I hate having to wait becuase shaman is out of mana and they still have a full hp bar.  I tell them I used to play a shaman and they think because I am a SK now that I don't know what I am talking about and that untill you get cann 3 that it isn't good to use the cann spells.  It's like talking to a brick wall. Sometimes I want to forget to hold aggro so they find out the importance of ac and hp.  I'm not saying all mid 40's shaman are this way but at least 80 percent of them that I play with are.  Please stop this influx.... :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Incoming Long story about druimans....<br />
<br />
Was grouped with a level 38 shaman in LDoN Dungeon, on my ranger twink (level 40), and first off...<br />
<br />
We zoned in. (Me, SK, Cleric (wife), shaman) Had a monk, but he went LD and never came back, so decided to try with us four.   First, we get into the dungeon, my wife goes LD.   Then, the shaman says hold pulls, need to get pet.  So me and the SK wait.   Watch him fizzle all his mana away, says he's OOM, sits down to med.   There is a simple single pull, so me and SK (in tells), decide to pull, kill it.   I use the ranja gimp 100 hp heal, to heal us up, pull another.   This time, the shaman is up melee'ing.  Seeing this, we assume he's ok on mana, so pull two.  We are getting a bit low, and ask for a heal, he says OOM, all the while, full health and still meleeing, and STILL no pet.  We barely win, wife comes back, heals us up, we proceed on.  After a bit (about 30 mins), cleric gets low on mana, asks the shaman to catch heals for a bit, so she can med.  He states, OOM still, sorry lost Crack.  <br />
<br />
So, I say why not cann?  He states, I read on the Crucible, that it's a waste to use canni.  I say what?  He says yea, it takes alot of hps, but gives back very little mana.  I ask what is his wisdom is.  At level 38, it was 232.  I said that's part of the problem, need to balance the hps versus the mana.  He said nah, Cann is just a waste till you get at least Cann 3, cause the ratio sucks.  At this point, I said the ratio might suck, but getting ANY mana back at this point, is better then getting none back by meleeing.  He sits down, meds, and for remainder of dungeon, didnt cann once, didnt slow (said was a waste of mana), and proceeded to Winters Roar (or whatever level ice nuke we got at 38), and melee our way through the dungeon.   The SK was also a twink, his main was a shaman, and both of us together couldnt get through to him about AC/ HP's, wisdom and cann...<br />
<br />
Moral of the story...  I miss good shaman in my twink groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, seriously, any new shaman needs to know that WIS definately isn't everything.  I made that mistake myself, but now after losing about 50 WIS but gaining 400 HP, it's already making a huge difference in how much mana I have or can get.  And IMO meleeing and DD is the last priority for a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Timing isn't hard IMO, but obviously a lot of the newer shaman out there just can't get it.<br />
<br />
Getting every last bit out of your class/spells that you can possibly get, that's what makes you a memorably good player.  Things like timing your canni-dance to get the max. possible efficiency are part of that.</div></div><hr />

So I read up on a shammy on castersrealm, and thought cool, ill give it a try. So i striped all the wis gear off my cleric, and made my shammy. Thought I was realy twinked out, being a lvl 1 with over 200 wis, but then when i 1st got canni 1 I thought it was sposed to help with manna, but i was only getting like 1 blue of manna for half of my live, had only like 700hp, if that. so then i came here, seen that i was a moron for the wis gear. so i droped all of it, shot up to 1100hp unbuffed, and had about 140 wis, still had down time cuz low on manna was hard, but now i have my regen bp, im never totaly out of manna, and when asked in a grp if im ready, and im out, i say hell ya, still got 70% health, lol. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=736373<br />

I skipped Canni II in favor of levelling.  Around level 49 Canni I was REALLY getting on my nerves, but hey, it didn't HURT to use it in combination with regen.  I just kept my health at an even 80% while medding, cannibalizing during the tick when I could.  Free mana in exchange for carpal tunnel.<br />
<br />
So while I definately wouldn't agree that Canni I is useless, it's a minor adjunct to other mana recovery mechanisms today (yes, like KEI).  The shaman in Islowem's story had more problems than refusing to use Canni I.  Meleeing while OOM?  Please.</div></div><hr />

 WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG <br />
<br />
The plural of shaman is shamans.  Shamans, not &quot;shamen,&quot; not &quot;shaman.&quot;  Shamans.  Period.<br />
<br />
Reference: Mirriam-Webster OnLine<br />
<br />
Main Entry: sha·man <br />
Pronunciation: 'shä-m&amp;n, 'shA- also sh&amp;-'män<br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural shamans<br />
<br />
Every other dictionary agrees.  There is one correct plural: shamans.  Period.  Stop giving false information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The ratio of HP to mana on all the canni spells is about the same now. I used to canni dance all the time, try to keep myself around 80% health, as someone else said.<br />
<br />
As for gear.... Well, I was going to post a shaman's profile I came across, but I won't in case someone knows her, I wouldn't want to embarass her. But at level 65, she has 1634hp unbuffed (and 80 of that is from an incorrectly marked charm), 235 wis (Platinum Jasper Ring, yeah!). Oh, and she has SCM3, SC2, but only MC1. *Shudder*<br />
<br />
I can even understand how a shaman can go along thinking that wis is the most important stat, but most 65 druids have more HP than that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fumorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Fumorm was actually created to be a duo with my ranger.  <br />
<br />
I started off as a druman on Fumorm, golden booties and all...  All my starting points in WIS too, plus all gear off of a druid alt.  That was before I ever came here.  I figured since Druids and Clerics wanted their WIS maxed, well, shaman should too, right?  HA!<br />
<br />
Well, I started to play my shaman by himself since I didn't want to be a complete gimp of a shaman, boy did I learn quick.  Level 45 trying to solo a slowed HG &quot;in teh face&quot;, and died.  Still had 60% mana, but 0 HPs.  Didn't work out very well.<br />
<br />
Sold almost all of my gear off, and farmed for quite a while, started looking in the bazaar for gear with high HPs, didn't even pay attention to WIS.  Ended up dropping from 255 WIS down to ~160 WIS, gained ~700 HPs.<br />
<br />
Got up to 59 with Fum, but couldn't shake the urge that I should have played an Ogre, so I rerolled, and Zukim was created.  Put all the points I could in to STA, then 5 in AGI so I didn't get penalized for having under 75 AGI, and the remaining 2 points in WIS since I couldn't put them in to STA.<br />
<br />
I never get KEI intentionally anymore, I find I have more fun playing without it.<br />
<br />
Just proof that a druman can learn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes I agree at those low levels when I was first learning the chain casting sucked and so did Can... until I came here and learned to Can dance... :)<br />
<br />
PS I think we need to reevaluate our Medicine cabinet and stickies to make sure that it contains no information that Can is not worth it until Can 3.  That is pure nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe it's cause I was always the shammy so I never noticed, but anyways I've been playing my mid-40s rogue and my girlfriend has been playing her enchanter and we have both run into SHM that don't use canni at all, and I'm like *** are you doing? Then I say I have a lvl 65 shm and they're like &quot;Who is it?&quot; and I say who and they're like &quot;I've never seen them before so you must be lieing and don't know how to play a shaman. C please&quot; /boggle. We constantly bag on SHM we see that don't meet our standards, it's quite funny.<br />
<br />
But really, I try to offer tips to some people who seem to be playing a shaman all wrong and some really appreciate it and have thanked me later for helping them be awesome, and others have decided to hate me till the death of EQ and beyond. There's a generation of twink shaman who just don't know what to do cause they learned to play from a guild DRUMAN. It's really sad to see a shaman who doesn't canni. I used canni 1 until I got canni 3 and and I used it CONSTANTLY. I have only been completely OOM a few times I can remember and any shaman that knows their **** should never be oom unless they have almost no health and are getting beat on.<br />

Is that ever the truth.  Every LDON group I've been ends up with myself and the one other experienced player talking in tells about how much the rest of the group stinks.  Ineptitude always seems to rear its ugly head in the most mundane of places too.  I'm talking about clerics that don't even bother to look at the hp bar of people other than the main &quot;tanks,&quot; let alone heal other group members.  There are the monks that don't know how to feign pull and warriors that pull before the ones that do know how can.  I even grouped with a paladin that had 87 stamina, but 170 wisdom, and, I kid you not, 173 charisma.   The guy believed adamantly that there was no cap to the returns on charisma when buying and selling from npc merchant and, moreover, that paladins had a special innate class bonus that gave them even greater prices in transactions with merchants.  I don't think anybody in this game has ever made me cry, but that guy came close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Canni has been my life since I first got it. Spent a week on that bloody canni2 quest cause I couldn't live without it. I don't see how drumans/shamans make it to level 54 with cannibalize 1 (unless they never canni).<br />
<br />
You also never know when you are grouped with someone with a level 65 shaman main! Its really rewarding to get a tell after a group/adventure from someone in my group giving you a pat on the back for your performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Junkilo, I am one of those who used canni 1 until I got canni 3. I think that I have ruined the index finger on my left hand and it did get extremely frustrating as I leveled, mainly due to the extra hp I gained, and the constant need for mana for my higher spells. But, I did it and I don't think it made me a poor shaman. From about 48-54 I don't think I said much to my guild and barely spoke while grouped but I think the constant wincing gave away to the group what I was doing. Just for the crack I pulled a canni V last night, then after I torpored I dropped the same amount of hp using canni 1. I was laughing at the effort it took. It made me realize how effective canni V really is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try to help them.  Make suggestions.  Refer them to these forums.  If they refuse to learn, KICK THEM OUT OF YOUR GROUPS.<br />
<br />
Several of the shaman I have spoken to who just dont canni (for example) use the excuse that they get groups, therefore they must be good.  Disabuse them of this belief by not grouping them... please.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to subject yourself to a crappy shaman.  There are so many shaman twink bots out there now to choose from, you can easily find a replacement for the truly inept ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, when Kunark first came out and they added CannII and III, they had a worse ratio than original Cannibalize - they just did more each cast. Original Cann had a 2:1 hp/mana ratio, the others were slightly less when first introduced. Dont know how they compare these days, because I never use any of them except CannIV anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">OK, was trying to resist, but have to share my horror story.<br />
<br />
Was actually playing my Shaman, level 49 at the time, and became the 6th member of a group in DL.  We had a nice mix, ranger, rogue, 49 Wiz (who had just acquired ice comet), necro, myself (with the newly acquired e-bolt) and a lvl 44 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Both the Wiz and myself were on lizzies, so we were DD and DoTing up a storm.  Since we both had the same heals, but I had the better debuff, DoTs and bigger mana pool, we agreed that I would debuff, slow and DoT while the lvl 44 Shaman healed.  Figured having him only heal, even with a ranger as MT, with slow and me as a backup healer, would work fine.  We single pulled for the most part and had good dps.<br />
<br />
Well, he was in bear form (more on that later), and after the second pull calls low on mana.  On the next pull we get 2, I slow both and do crowd control with doggy on the second mob.  After a min or so I noticed the ranger is at 30% health.  I don't have time to ask &quot;***?&quot; so I throw him a heal while I'm keeping the second mob busy.  After the ranger engages the second mob, he again drops below 30% health.  At this point the ranger is asking &quot;***, where are the Shamans?&quot;  I proceed to remind the jr. Shaman that he is main healer, at which point he says, &quot;hey, I told you I was low on mana.&quot;  So I figured, OK, miscommunication, and instruct him to call OOM when he can not cast vs. low mana which tells me he is in conservation mode but still functional (my interpretation, so I give him the benefit of the doubt).  <br />
<br />
This continues, group is rocking, but we are constantly letting the tanks go very low on health, or the Shaman is calling OOM after every other pull (single pulls mind you, maybe 1-2 greater heals each time).  I then notice that I have not seen the &quot;wincing message&quot; come from him, eventhough I'm on my mount and still using canni all the time.  So, I privately ask him in a tell why he is not using canni.  He tells me, &quot;canni pulls to much aggro, so I don't use it.&quot;  I was dumbfounded.  He is in a group with a ranger, rogue, wizard, and another Shaman that is debuffing/slowing/DoTing and he thinks he is going to pull aggro from the back row, 15 feet behind everyone else, by using canni?<br />
<br />
Truly amazing.  I then gently tell him that he is going OOM because he is not using canni and that he should learn to canni dance, which I explain to him in detail.  I also tell him of the benefits of a mount and how it is worth getting if he plays in outdoor areas alot.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later I see the old &quot;wincing&quot; message and figure he at least knows enough to take good advice.<br />
<br />
Then, as the group is breaking up, after a very good 90 min session, he leaves bear form and I notice he is an Iksar Shaman!!!!  I almost fell off my mount.  He is standing there in bear form (hp regen bonus) with the Iksar hp regen bonus and Chloroplast (spell hp regen), obviously always at full health (never took one hit) and would not canni.<br />
<br />
I had to just gate in amazement, after I put him on my ignore list.<br />
<br />
Well, that's my sad, but all too true, story.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I think, deep down, I'm playing a Shaman again because I was tired of grouping with crappy ones. <br />
<br />
There was the guy at level 56 who said he didn't bother acquiring Canni III because he had a horse, always bought KEI and never went into dungeons, the level 61 who had Torpor but never used it because &quot;it's useless&quot; and the level 59 ex-guildmate of mine that had 1750hp self buffed (I'm still trying to wrap my head around that one though he did have GEBs on so that might have been part of it :p). <br />
<br />
I gave up long ago trying to give unsolicited advice. In my experience, the stupid ones tend to be very aggressive in the defense of their stupidity and it simply isn't worth the headache to figure out which type of inept Shaman I happen to be dealing with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">It's hard to tell people about the importance of AC and HP. No one wants to be told how to play. Best thing to do for any Shaman would probably be to direct them here to these boards where they can see for themself how we all talk about it. Let them decide for themselves to stop being a Druman.<br />
<br />
Worked for me :)<br />
<br />
But I also learned when I was 40ish. I could have cried a couple weeks ago when a 58 Shaman in my guild was asking about the GEB camp in Sol B. I asked W.T.F. would he want those for? He asked why not and what could possibly be better. So I linked him a bunch of other boots all geared towards HP.<br />
<br />
He was confused as to why I thought those were better since they had no wisdom and the GEBs have a whopping 9 wisdom. <br />
<br />
I tried going into the whole discussion with him then all of a sudden a level 60 Shaman in my guild pipes up and says &quot;I love my GEBs&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The relative efficiency of the various canni spells is a big fat red herring. To an extent, the improved efficiency of the canni-dance is also a red herring - a worthwhile exercise, to be sure, but a red herring nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that for a low to mid level shaman, there is a simple lesson to be learned, and that lesson is the interchangeablilty of hp and mana. <br />
<br />
Mana = hp and hp = mana, they are the same, interchangeable. You convert mana into hp at a ratio of approximately 1:2 and you convert hp to mana at 2:1. It is so simple, but so many young shaman just dont get it.  Your total POOL is the sum of your hp pool and your mana pool. If you are low on one, convert some of the other. <br />
<br />
Being a good shaman is, in my opinion, all about keeping your hp and mana bar at as close to the same level as possible. if you are at 50% hp you should be at 50% mana, etc. Frankly it isn't that difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here. I always try to start off the night with a fresh KEI. If I can't get one, I shrug and head out, but if I can, great...<br />
Once it dies, it stays dead until it's time to head in for the night (unless some wandering enchanter can drop it on me), I'm not about to hold my group up just so I can get it refreshed...it makes life easier, but not that much easier.<br />
<br />
As it is, the main time I usually notice it's lack is if I am doing buff runs on an entire group...Using IoS, Tuna, Str, Dex, Agi and Bih'Li, I can get 6 or 7 people in before I am completely OOM if I can be sitting on Old GluePot while I do 'em with KEI...I have to start hitting the Canni button around #4 or 5 without it.<br />
<br />
The rest of the time, KEI just means I have to Canni less and self heal less to get back to full between pulls.<br />
<br />
I just wish my dual boxed Cleric could recover mana somehow (not to Yaulp 5 yet, and it's not that big a gain anyway). He hurts far more without KEI. With KEI he can melee, pull and keep the heals up just fine. Without it, he can only pull if he switches to baby nukes and usually has to sit and watch everyone else have all the fun during the actual combat.<br />
<br />
I need to get them both doing LDoN more, if only for FT augments.</div></div><hr />

My experance is there are those that want to learn how to play thier characters better.  And then there are those that know better then everyone else and will not listen.  Most people I've found fall into the second group.  Some attually do know more though most know far less.  I sure know my finger started feeling far less beat up once I got cann III.

By the time I could consider getting it, I was close enough to Canni3 that it was grind away and live with Canni1 a little longer and dream of Canni3 rather than go work the quest.<br />

As to the comment on Cannibilizing while tanking, it is not soo bad, unless you use you canni-dance social and not only cannibilize, but then sit afterwards  (though it is good way to keep aggro).<br />
<br />
Patinetly grinding my way to Cannibilization now.<br />

Question for those with Canni5.  Do you find that you no longer need Canni4 (can you free up a gem), or do you keep canni4 in the lot for between the three minutes canni5 refreshes?<br />
<br />
Seems to me  Even with Canni5,  Canni4 will still have old slot 6 reserved for it.<br />
<br />
And yeah  the 'modern' shaman that does not Canni with Stocism out is truly a waste, baby torpor is very very nice for the younger ones.<br />

<br />
Mine stays memmed, if your OOM, hit cann5, torpor or whatever, and start cann4. I can get back to full mana just before or at the same time that cann5 refreshes.  Youll still need to use it, sometimes you cant afford that 1950 hps, so you need something to fall back on to make up that last 1% mana you need for a heal to stay alive long enough to finish a mob.  Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well, I will admit to being a druman for quite awhile (before I found this website). I swore on my wisdom and GEBS were the shiznit imo. On the plus side, my main was a war and my constant partner was a damn good shaman, always canning, the spam drove me crazy. I just didn't understand it then. First time he popped cannV when we were grouped he scared the hell out of me for sure. <br />
<br />
Since I saw the light, I've lost about 40 points of wis, took leaps and bounds in the AC and HP department. I learned alot about shamans from my old partner just watching him. I ALWAYS canned, even with KEI. If I got a full health bar, something is wrong. I even cann in POK sitting around chatting. Yes, I do believe you aren't officially a shaman until you die from the wincemonster because you were paying attention and its just a habit /shame on.<br />
<br />
I'm not the know-it-all when it comes to being a shaman, but I think I do quite well, (thanks to all you guys), and I send every new shaman and new friend I meet to this website. Too much good info to learn here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Canni4 will always have a place alongside Canni5. Like Fum said, sometimes 1950hp is just a bit too much to lose if you're gonna get low health agro or want to just squeeze a little more mana out for that last cast. Plus, once you get a decent buff extender focus/AA, you'll be healing more than you caned. Nothing like popping a Canni5 and then skimming some more mana off with Canni4 while Q does it's thing and fills up the red bar...</div></div><hr />

As for canni II being a troll i never did the quest, The canni dance was my friend, after taking a break during velious and coming back after luclin and seeing that bear spell man I loved life.  Canni III was good.  <br />

No matter what level or what canni spell you got it is more effective than trying to melee and getting your uber 5hps of damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't offer advice normally. People are too hard headed and stubborn most of the time. My own performance in groups and solo is probably the best educator, especially groups. When they see me slowing, debuffing, backup healing/main healing, and dps (dog) with no kei and good macros they tend to put me on their friends list every time. Or with kei tearing crap up (slow/debuff and about 3-4K of damage per mob) in a group gets people pretty excited. They will remember your performance vs. that of a lazy shaman.<br />
<br />

I'll usually get KEI if I'm not grouped with her if there's some available in PoK. If it's there and everyone else is getting it, why not? But Canni 4 is still very useful when KEI/VoQ drops. I still don't come close to ever running out of mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Yes, the Canni II quest was quite hard. i.e. a &quot;normally&quot; equipped shaman could not solo it at level 39. However, it is not that hard - I completed it at about level 42, with the assistance of a couple of friends.<br />
<br />
But regardless of the ratio in comparison to canni I, and regardless of the supposed difficulty of the quest versus the reward, I did the quest because it was there! Shaman only quests are there to be done - the quest was good because it was hard. I did all the totemic quests too (although I never did get grizzleknot, so I should say that I attempted all the totemic quests). I did those quests even though there was some slightly better gear available to me, and I did them because I ama shaman.<br />
<br />
It is not about getting uberest fastest - canni II is a &quot;rite of passage&quot;, just like getting first peice of totemic, getting dogdog, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I wouldn't say the Cann II quest is HARD.  What I would say is that the Cann II quest is targetted to a level range significantly higher than that required to scribe the spell.<br />
<br />
Illusion: Iksar, which I believe came out at the same time is much the same way, but I:I is more or less a fluff spell, whereas Cannibalize is a pretty integral part of the shaman arsenal.<br />
<br />
The higher level quest spell enchanters got... Tashania, was it?  Is doable at its level (44?  I'm getting fuzzy on this stuff in my old age).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The returns for the canni 1-2 spells were changed quite recently, when they changed, someone posted the following, and I coppied to my tips file :)  So thanks to the nameless shaman who compiled it.<br />
<br />
Never go to Caster Realms for spell information. They have the lousiest database maintenance. Just go to Lucy to get the latest data translation from the spell.dat<br />
<br />
The real ratios are<br />
- Canni 1: 50 HP for 20 (@24) to 29 (@65) mana, so 0.40 to 0.58<br />
- Canni 2: 67 HP for 30 (@39) to 37 (@65) mana, so 0.45 to 0.55<br />
- Canni 3: 74 HP for 39 (@54) to 42 (@65) mana, so 0.53 to 0.57<br />
- Canni 4: 148 HP for 81 (@58) to 82 (@60) mana, so 0.55<br />
- Canni 5: 1924 HP for 1066 mana, so 0.55<br />
<br />
So, basically, yes the ratio stay relatively equivalent between the different spells as the level rise. But it's easier/cheaper to heal 148 HP at level 58 than it is to heal 50 at level 24... Volume is the kicker with upgrades, not the ratio.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I have personally done the Canni2 quest about 10 times, I always have a spare copy to give to young shaman in my guild. I try to help them see the light about AC/HP, and always steer them to this board.</div></div><hr />

Yes, 25 pp apiece for a 6/23 weapon...I must've made like 500 pp after I found out about the spawn time of the guy in Oggok.  And this was at level 30!  500 pp meant something back then!<br />

On high risk adventures, for example, we usually have a bot KEI us, for the cleric and other casters.  We almost always have a bard puller, so we often have bardsong too.  I still canni constantly and am usually at around 4 bubs of health.  When I'm in full burn mode, there's usually never any time when I'm not casting canni, velium strike, FA, quies, or debuffing.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't do this all the time (because I know people will say &quot;omg, i dont play eq to werk all the time!!!!111&quot;).  Probably 70-80% of the time.  Last night, for instance, we were doing a chump normal risk mission, and I was talking to a friend on AIM throughout the adventure.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dictionary.com disagrees. Shaman not shamans, sheep not sheeps.<br />
