<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either is good. I think the DN bows are better. You get a bigger hit from the underfoot bow, but over time the DN line is better for general use. They drop off of the rats in DN, or you can buy relatively cheaply ( 1-2kish on Fennin last I saw ).</div></div><hr />

As to the lucky halfling, but why should ANY ranger not have his epics?  Many of us don't have it because the drop is totally random and arbitrary.<br />
<br />
As I've said all along, the new drop process is UNFAIR.  If you kill Inny, the stone should drop.  Period.  Should we go back to that as the only way??  No.  The minis should still have a random chance of dropping it.<br />
<br />
You can throw all the justifications out there you want, but as long as I continue to see 4 - 5 monks and druids a night strolling around with epics, you will NOT be able to convince me that the Earthcaller drop process is fair.<br />
<br />
Ask any ranger that has helped kill at least 50 minis and Inny a few times.  Most of them agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see nothing wrong with this. I had my epics at 51. All epics are retrievable as soon as you get to 51. And bows pre-55 are almost pointless, except for minor stat increases or pulling tools.<br />
<br />
And the Emerald drop rate is FINE. Just because you have had bad luck doesnt mean that everyone else has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a bit of personal editorial and it stems from my experience trying to assist people in the Equipment forum. It also has nothing to do with halflings as rangers as I don't really care one way or the other.<br />
<br />
Anyway... I see questions like the above all the time. They are devoid of useful information aside from a rather ruidmentary &quot;tell me what to do next&quot; sort of thing.<br />
<br />
The posted here gave us no idea of what his current guild (or alliance of guilds) might be capable of doing so there is no reasonable way to recommend anything useful. A Velium Wrapped bow? Can he do DN? No idea because he didn't say. Bow of Doom? Can his guild do Doomshade? No idea because he didn't say.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to help with recommendations when I get a picture of where someone is at. But for me to recommend a new ranger in a major guild to get a velium bow from DN would be a waste of time. He'll own far better shortly anyway.<br />
<br />
So my response to SHerina is to tell us what your guild can do today and maybe we can make recommendations on what to look for next. Lacking that sort of information, I'll recommend a War Bow of Rallos Zek. ;)</div></div><hr />

i've got to go kill myself now, a halfling just surpassed me in about two months what it took my ranger a year to do.  <br />
although, with the 5% xp bonus, i suppose i'd be about 51 now.<br />
<br />
SHerina, may i inquire as to the days /played on your hfl?  you could, after all, be just moderately twinked but intensely devoted to your char.</div></div><hr />

yeah, ive already got a bow, one from DN, wraped...30/38, just looking for better. as far as my other chars go ive got a 60 epic wizard and 53 epic monk. and yeah, i bought my main hand epic MQ (50k) but oh well, dont regret a penny of it. anywho, thx for any help.<br />
<br />
oh, ranger dinged 52, 1yellow 2 blue in, goin for 53. thx</div></div><hr />

That drop rate is so freaking screwed up, just because you got lucky doesn't make it fine.  Talk about being blind to the larger issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the larger scheme of things, Earthcaller is useless.  In the *largest* scheme of things you will be using archery as primary damage, and if you really are going to be meleeing, it certainly won't be with epics.  Sure, argue about soloing, go kill vaniki and get a vastly superior soloing weapon that also procs slow (and at a lower delay yay).  If it's taken you 6 months to get an emerald of corruption, I'm sure you can kill Vaniki 3 times to get his weapon to drop.<br />
<br />
It took me 2 weeks to get my stone, 7'ish hate raids, lots of patches.  This was right after epics came out and Demi's still took more than 4 people to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montecrizto</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earthcaller worthless in the larger scheme of things? <br />
<br />
I doubt many rangers with earthcallers don't carry them around anymore.  For any rangers that ever solo anything, I don't care if they're level 60 with 16 19 sword off emperor, they're going to want the earthcall proc.  When I used to solo in FG... you'd see rangers from all the high end guilds soloing there.. what weapon are they using?  Yes earthcaller.  <br />
<br />
Calling earthcaller worthless (for soloing) because of willsapper is just laughable.  WS drops once or twice a week max per server, and less than 5% of anybody that kills Vaniki is going to give it to a ranger.  Why?  Oh this little weapon called earthcaller.  Any ranger that is at a vaniki kill already has one, so why give them a WS when its much more valuable to a warrior,  or even a rogue.<br />
<br />
And correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't earthcall approximately twice the % slow of WS proc?  I'd take the superior slow since I'm just going to be swapping in a different weapon when slow procs anyways.<br />
<br />
And all this is really besides the point, since &quot;the larger scheme of things&quot; doesn't equate to being in a large guild where you can get greater than epic weapons or have EQ+AM3.  Here its referring to the many rangers from 51-59 for whom earthcaller is the best damn weapon they can hope to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone is in a HoT guild or has time to play 24/7 or wants too or roleplays in which case earthcaller is priceless.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should have a forum aimed at us lesser mortal/immortals who arent 2 percent of rangers everywhere.</div></div><hr />

Six months to get SEoC means you are powerful enough to kill Vaniki?  Ooookay.  Well dee-ang, I'll be in Sleeper's tomorrow!  In a year I'll solo Kerafyrm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shion graywords</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, Guys, This isnt a thread about earthcaller, Nor is it a thread to make sarcastic comments about Uber/non-uber guilds/people.  While even i dont agree with Skanda about Earthcaller, some of you deffinatly need to chill.  <br />
<br />
As to the original Post, and question...<br />
my initial sarcastic response would be &quot;your 51.. with epics, and a wrapped bow..WHY would you need something better?&quot;<br />
<br />
BUT.... The Ranger's glade has allways been a place where we help eachother out, Twink and non-twink, Uber and non-uber, Halfling or non-halfling.  So.....<br />
<br />
Answer:  a wrapped Velium bow is almost as good as you can get, especially at 51.  Your upgrade options are as follows~<br />
<br />
Ssra longbow thing<br />
Bow of the Silver Fang<br />
Bow of Doom<br />
Priceless Bow<br />
Primal Bow<br />
War Bow of Rallos zek<br />
Bow of Shadows (heh, GL on getting to VT :P)<br />
<br />
or.. the completely miniscule upgrade of a Double Velium reinforced bow, 1 deley better and some extra range than your Wrapped Velium bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dauvan</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While this is not about the posters lvl/race and them having epic.  The poster did point that out, maybe out of pride or to stoke a little fire out of a few.  Otherwise he/she could have said, i'm 51 and in need of a good bow, whats my choices?<br />
 <br />
  To those that feel bad  do not do so.  One of my guildmates just twinked out a lvl 1 ranger, almost full tolans, rgb, cbol, and a bunch of other 50+ gear.  goal: make 51 in less than a few days played.   <br />
<br />
  Remember to not measure your accomplishments against someone elses.  Where Coryn might have done things I won't see for another 8 months, I am still proud of what I have done.  Poking at Coryn cause he's on Fennin too =).</div></div><hr />

when this new fletching stuff came out i was like kewl. but then saw it as cultural woodelf. guess what, im a half elf, so what did i do. i made a woodelf ranger(love the class). twink her out in ivy etch that i had sitting in the bank but mainly created her for the cultural stuff. and besides a female woodelf looks kinda cute in ivy etch.<br />
<br />
i do agree with Shion on the bows. those are great bows.<br />
 <br />
also i could care less if you worship karana or tunare, are a halfling or human. someone directed me to this site as one of the best ranger sites around but so far all i see is flaming this or flaming that.<br />
<br />
being lvl 50 i wear seb armor. im in no uber guild dont really care bout uber. i play to have fun and be with friends. <br />
<br />
but to flame someone that might have playd for a month or 2 and has there epics already. well thats not support. i have over 100 game days of play on my main. been playing over a 1 and half. and still do not have my epics but too me i will get whether at 51, 55 or 60, i could care less. i dont play 24/7 like some ppl are able to do. <br />
<br />
well i guess im done ranting now. <br />
but too the original poster, go with shions advice on the bows. they really are good bows.</div></div><hr />

Additionally, I think almost all of your upgrade options are no drops so at the moment you are using about as good as you can expect to get.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
