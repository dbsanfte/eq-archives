<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I've been lurking for a few weeks now.  I have a brand new (lvl 12) barb shaman on the newbie server.  I have previously played a paladin to 31 and a wizard to 54 on another server.  I'm having trouble keeping both piercing and 1hb skilled up to the max, and because I'm trying to keep both up, both are falling behind.  Is there one that I should focus exclusively on and let the other lag behind, or should I just tough it out and keep both as high as I can, even though both will be far below my max?  Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The truth is that melee skills (except defense) become pretty pointless anyway after level 40 or so.  But to answer your question, I would pick one and run with it.  Either is a good choice.  1hb works for the soulstripper, which today seems to be the pre-epic shaman's bazaar level weapon of choice.  Since most of your melee will be done pre-epic, 1 hb is a good choice in my opinion.  Piercing for the epic is good too, but by the time you get epic you will be mostly done with melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, though, offensive combat skills aren't hard to keep maxxed, you just have to go about it the right way.<br />
<br />
There are a number of NPCs spread out through the game who you can stand and tank against for long periods of time without either killing them or dying to them. The exterminators in the various towns are a good example: I used the exterminator in Neriak to level up the combat skills of an alt of mine--he never hits for more than about 3 points of damage, but he has probably 1 million HP, and regens fast besides. And he's in a spot where you can solo him without adds. So just take a selection of weapons, and tank away at him for a while. Buff up your agility and dex (one of them supposedly raises your combat leveling, but I can't recall which one).<br />
<br />
There was also a mob in GD you could use for this at higher levels, though I've heard he may be gone now. Mist Panther in Wakening Lands works well for this too, though he hits a bit harder. And I think there are others out there as well.<br />
<br />
Its just a matter of devoting the half-hour or so to getting the skill up instead of making exp. Same as with swimming--put on an EB item, park yourself swimming in a corner of Halas lake or somewhere like that, and come back in a half hour or so, to see how much you've leveled.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Exterimators have been nerfed.<br />
<br />
The only thing you could do is like, an epic NPC, who has high regen and you can pretty much wail on him all day, so long as you keep your HP in the positives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as items for sale I think there are a few more 1hb out there that are good but of course you have to look at our epic. I usually solo so I did use my weapons until lvl 53 or so when I got my JBB. I would keep the skill up that you have the best weapon for. Then while in a good group or when you have a solo spot down good use your other weapon to get that skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's no reason you can't max them all.  I made the mistake of concentrating on only 1 until i hit 50 or so.  Once I finally realized my mistake I made it a point to max all of them.  Just tank in the face of any mellee mobs that are DB.  I did it tanking goranga gatherers in Maidens, and maxed pierce, 1hb which was 3, and 2hb which was 103, in 2 days of tanking.  Buff yourself fully before doing this get dex as high as possible, pull with slow, dot to your hearts content, and swing away.  I went from 3 to 200 in 2 days of tanking.  It helps to have a low delay weapon and a haste item too.  To be totally honest though, at 65, I don't even have a weapon equiped  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also, on another note.  You are only level 12.  You could just stick to one and level but not worry about maxing it or other melee skills.  Then in your late 20's, when fights last a bit longer start switching to weapons you want to increase.  You should be able to keep one two maxed depending on your play style once you get into your late twenties or thirties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I decided early on that I was going to use a shield just about all the time, so I kept alternating one handed clubs and pokers, and they were both at 200 before I figured out that I could contribute more through med/cani/heal than I could through melee. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">edit: I maxed piercing out the gate...<br />
<br />
In hindsight I wish I would have kept up all 3 as I leveled. 2hb would be great fun for doing greenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I made a point of trying to max 1hb till lvl 30, then I shifted to 2hb, then piercing.  By the time I was lvl 50 my piercing skill was pathetic, my 2hb was was about 150, and my 1hb was also about 150.<br />
<br />
Two factors influencing me to max weapon skills were at lvl 28 I got my hands on a Mroon's Toy (sp - drops in SK off of a named clops, 2hb, looks like a doll, but back before Kunark it hit like a cement truck) and I liked the damage.  At about lvl 39 I ran through HHP and almost got owned by a group of orcs that went uncamped (I had no offensive spells memmed as I was in travel mode and I'll be damned if I was going to run from a green conn).  From 49-52 I maxxed piercing on seafurbies in OOT and I continued to max 2hb in WL on sent suits from 56-58.  I'm only like 5 points away from maxxing 1hb.  I even maxxed h2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One other note: if you are looking to max 2hb, and you don't have a decent proccing weapon, my advice would be to get that stupid shovel that drops in Lake of Rathe, get in a group that doesn't mind you tanking yet doing no damage, and start whacking away. Once upon a time it was the fastest 2hb in the game, so your skillups come quicker. You won't hurt anything, but you'll get skillups.<br />
<br />
Another fast 2hb, one that is MUCH nicer but also a lot more expensive, drops somewhere in the Gunthak area. Don't remember the name of it, but I've seen it around--nasty looking thing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd just pick one of either 1h blunt of Piercing and stick to that one. It's very good to have one up-to-date weapon skill to use for slaughtering greens if you need to. Past a certain point, that's all a weapon skill is for a shaman. It's not something you use much when you're seriously engaged in combat. <br />
<br />
I picked piercing because it was easy to twink with an uber piercer at the time (rune etched icewurm fang), and because I wanted to get my epic someday, and have the skill to melee with it if I felt like it. 1H blunt would be fine too, if you have a reason to prefer that. <br />
<br />
I think 1h choices are preferable, because that way you can use a shield, and get more AC and stat bonuses than you'll normally get with a 2h weapon. There are some advantages to 2h weapons in some cases, but overall I didn't feel it was worth working on a second weapon skill. I've never regretted doing only one, so far, at L 58. <br />
<br />
And if for some odd reason you find yourself desperately desiring some other weapon skill post-60, you can always sink a few trainings into it (or not) and work it up then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have four characters past level 51 and for a very long time one of them was a ranger.  So it was drilled into my head to max all my weapon skills.  As you’ve discovered, it’s not as easy as it sounds.  I agree with what others have said, pick either piercing or 1H blunt to focus upon, depend on what your best weapon is.  If you manage to max that skill then switch to your other weapon if circumstances permit until you level again.  But don’t worry too much about your other weapon skills too much until you stop leveling as quickly.  By then you should have a good number of training points saved up.  <br />
<br />
Unless you want to use some of your points starting trade skills, and its not really necessary for most of them, then you don’t really have much to spend your points on.  What I did to give myself a boots when I wanted to max all my weapon skills was spend training points on them.  You can spend up to about 60 points on a weapon skill before the cost starts to become prohibitive.  You can do this with your remaining two skills and have a much better chance of hitting then if you started at zero.  <br />
<br />
If you can find one for sale, the Bamboo Bo Stick (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=486) is a nice 2H blunt weapon to raise your skill.  Its faster than the abandoned orc shovel (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=467) someone else mentioned, though more expensive, and it actually does some damage: Damage: 8 Delay: 20. <br />
<br />
But as others have also said, chances are you won’t be using your weapon skills every much.  You need to max your defense skill as soon as possible, but if you group you usually be casting.  Still, its nice to have the skills for those times you find someplace you can solo.  It makes for a nice change of pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soulstripper is a Damn Nice weapon once you can procc it, 75 point taps + canni mean you can actually melee+canni and end up with more mana AND hp...well thats at 50+ when you have a 200+ dex and all that but still.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hot New (and soon to be nerfed for sure) Info<br />
<br />
in PoI there is a mob named researcher somethingorother in the room to the left when you enter factory. attack from the rear so you dont eat 800 point ripostes and go afk. grats 200 in all 3 melee skills. make sure you bring magic weapons though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tae Ew hammer of aggresion is a 20 delay 2hblunt. <br />
<br />
Corpsegrinder proccs 100 point heals and hits for 120ish<br />
<br />
Hammer of Spirit calling hits for 170ish and proccs a short term snare+dot.<br />
<br />
2 of my favorite weapons, the corpsegrinder for groups with druids/rangers because the snare on spiritcalling overwrites their snare.</div></div><hr />
