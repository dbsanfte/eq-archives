I feel the exact opposite.  The changes that have made the game so easy have allowed every twit and his little brother to get a toon to 65 and still know nothing about their class.  They're still herding us into the same zones to exp, but now solo exp is gimp.  We're in their world now, and if we don't play their way we're punished.  I.e. soloing, not joining uberguilds, etc. all punishable offenses.  EQ is going so downhill.. I wish I had the willpower to quit.  If you're getting bitten by the MMORPG bug, try WoW or Shadowbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While I agree about the increasing number of unskilled players leveling up without half a clue how to play in the high end game (particularly shamans sadly), I disagree on the other points.<br />
<br />
Solo exp was not nerfed. Exp in PoP was reduced - for everybody, solo or grouped. Go anyplace else and you get exactly the same solo exp you always got before. How hard is that for people to understand? In fact, you get more solo elsewhere because they scaled the experience for 60+...which also has expanded the places you are 'herded' for exp. If you're so sick of PoP, go check out Nadox, Hate's Fury, Nurga/Droga, or Veskar for AAs. Those places are quite nice exp, even post-60, and they are all virtually empty most of the time. The only thing keeping most people in PoP is loot. You can get exp other places if you try. Hell, go to new Plane of Hate for exp and you can even work on those Marsinger range item quests while you're camping there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What you're not taking into account is that PoP is by far better exp than any old-world zone at 65 (indeed, at 61+).  I don't have LoY but I've been to nurga, droga, and veksar and I have to say the exp in each place is awful, nothing compared to PoP.  <br />
Exp in PoP was reduced - for everybody, solo or grouped<br />
Why is a grouped aa twice as fast in PoP now? :p  Seriously man your argument might hold water if anyone AA'd at 65 in anyplace other than PoP.. but nobody does.  Stop blindly defending Sony and take a realistic look at the current state of EQ man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not blindly defending anybody. You can get just as good exp with a good group in the new Nurga as you can in most non-elemental planes. Crypt of Nadox is mostly dark blue at level 62, and Hate's Fury is all dark blue as well. <br />
<br />
And you just might be surprised at some of the things you can find in those zones - not to mention the amount of coin you can get (with mobs in Nadox/Hate's Fury dropping tons of gems or mobs in Nurga that drop 12-20 plats apiece). Maybe you should stop blindly following the herd and get out and see the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think single group/small guild content has gotten alot better.  Esp with some of the risk vs reward.  Looks like there is more otw with the next expansion for that matter.  Then you add all the trivialized content for one group in old expantions, and theres alot to do with a group.<br />
<br />
As for solo xp.  I was under the impression it stayed the same, and a group just gave the bonus.  I really dont know so good chance im wrong here.  I can't tell the difference anywho.<br />
<br />
Yes it is alot easier to level up than it was, but i gotta admit, i like it. Remember 59? Grind all night for like 2-3 blues lol.  If you like xp that way, more power to you. I'll take what they have given us.<br />
<br />
Overall?  I like what they have done with the game mostly.  I am going to give the oppposite advice.  Come back to eq if you are going to play a mmorpg, i cant see anyothers that are worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dude I have been to (some of: I don't have LoY) the zones you're talking about.  I could care less about the plat/item drops.  The exp is nowhere near PoTac or BoT.  Not even close dude.  Maybe 1/3 as fast.. maybe closer to 1/4.  You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who spends less time in PoP and more time in old-world than me.  I've been 65 for like 3 months and have 45 AAs to show for it, and I play a lot.  It goes to show you how bad old-world exp is at 65.  If it were up to me I'd forget PoP ever existed, as its done so much harm to EQ.  Old-world would need a 300-400% exp modifier though to make this feasible.<br />
Remember 59? Grind all night for like 2-3 blues lol. If you like xp that way, more power to you<br />
Its not that I like it, its that the choice is between making it difficult and having little Timmy train you and then blame you for his death because he got 65 in a month of casual play and hasn't a clue about the game, and is cranky beause mommy's letting him stay up past bedtime... and a hundred other similar situations caused by it being too easy.</div></div><hr />

Funny you should bring that up, I quit a 2 pack a day habit in January, had been a smoker for close to ten years... Different strokes, as they say.  At any rate, good luck with that, its the best thing you could possibly do for your health.  Patch worked for me, ymmv.</div></div><hr />

Don't. That's my only advise. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Exp ranged from 1/2 AA blue per kill to a full for the goblin cave masters. Max hit I took was 205. 1 ultor, 2 BoS's, 2 epics, and alpha dog seemed to kill just about anything. Like others have said, keep your resists buffed, and buff yourself correctly. You will get dispelled at some point. - Krakster<br />
<br />
I hunted in Droga with my cleric at 59. I started at 13% and by the end of the day had dinged to 60. We got a breastplate and several other drops (I dont recall the stats) but it was alot of fun and well worth the time. - Bailie<br />
<br />
Just a couple quotes from another thread here about Droga/Nurga, Antifrog. Now, considering you get about 1 blue AA per solo kill in HoH, I fail to see how this is not comparable exp when you factor in these mobs are much, much easier than PoP mobs. You'll note that Krakster is level 65, since he's using Blood of Saryn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMHO, stay away. AA points are now so monotonously easy to get in PoV/BoT that anyone who devotes a fairly large playing time to EQ can rake them in. <br />
<br />
I don't know, maybe it's because a long time ago you'd look at the new drops off the higher mobs of the latest expansion and go, &quot;Holy Sh*t, that's awesome&quot;. Like AoW and the Blade of Carnage, Ring, and Helmet. But now, when someone links a drop in a serverwide channel or such, and you know it's from the higher end of PoP (at least for me) it's always, &quot;Another 18/20 1hs with +100hp and insane stats&quot;, or &quot;Another earring that clobbers anything pre-Luclin and has 145hp/mana plus massive stats and svs&quot;. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't look at drops now and notice how much better they are than most...because now ALL the high end drops are just completely sick. For me, in part, this has ruined EQ. Most of the time it's no longer fun or a challenge to go in the Arena. If you can actually land Malosinia on the person, then it's a decent fight. If you can't land a thing you run around until they kill you, whether it be with their weapons or lure spells. I know some will disagree, and say that higher end drops and better stats were a must for end-game advancement as a whole, but I just don't see the fun in having every other item completely blow away anything from previous expansions.<br />
<br />
The ubers do their thing, and are probably completely loving the massive stats and such on these new drops...but it can only go so far. If SoE keeps pushing out expansions for the high end, then I say this time next year we'll see weapons going as far as 35/25 1hs for dual wielders, if they aren't even our now and I've missed them. Maybe it's just me, anyone else agree/disagree that the stats on higher end drops nowadays is just ridiculuous?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So you're relying on anecdotal information to tell me I'm wrong?  Real solid... you know, my cousin's friend's sister knows where Jimmy Hoffa is :p  The mobs aren't much easier.  They have about 15k hp vs 22k hp for mobs in Valor, for instance.  You'd have to kill them 2-3 times as fast to get PoP-equivalent exp, and with that many hp you can't.  Please, actually go to a zone you're talking about before commenting on it.</div></div><hr />

You're being completly hypocritical in trying to bring down rathe.  Why don't you try and come up with inteligent posts instead of trying so bad to make someone look dumb.<br />
<br />
And for my 2 cents, the exp in nadox/hate's fury/nurga/droga is extremely nice for what it's worth.  Yes it is a bit slower than BoT/Tactics, but who wants to go to BoT anymore anyway.  It's train city, people are complete loot whores now that ornate drops semi-regularly, and only about 20% of the people have a clue of how to play their class.  I'd say solo'ing/duo'ing in these out of the way places is a very warm welcome.<br />

Agreed, I was simply pointing out that you made a second account on the board for the sole purpose of flaminig me.  I suppose I should feel flattered, but instead I pointed out the stupidity of it.  None of my other posts/replies are flames, I'm most interested in the Tactics &amp; Equip forum.  Its also ironic for your only two posts under your new account to be flames directed at me for... flaming :p  What gave you away is your reputation points being so high after two posts.  I'm curious, why do feel you have to flame me anonymously?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The bards, wizards, and druids in my guild get around the so-called solo xp nerf by setting up a solo network in HoH.  3-6 of them group up at zone in then take basement camps that are far enough away from each other to where they are still getting all the xp per solo kill of each mob but they get group bonus because technically, they ARE grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is my normal account, i never even registered for this forum before, just used it for its information.  Guess your attitude just got on my nerves.  To each his own.</div></div><hr />

So who are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have been there, Gurck. The mobs are easier, and they hit about half as hard. And since you're so smart, you obviously have noticed how all those caster mobs spend half the time trying to cast on you instead of doing melee damage which makes them even easier (if your resists are respectable).<br />
<br />
I get 1 blue AA per solo kill on shrine guardians in HoH. Krakster said he got 1 blue AA per kill on goblin cave lords. I'll take his word for it, since I was grouped when I went to Nurga - I dont see why he would lie about it. Do you? So, if both mobs give the same exp - and the cave lord has 7K less hps by your estimate, hits half as hard (205 vs 500+) then which one are you going to be able to kill faster with less downtime? You must be using that new math when you came up with having to kill 2-3 times faster in Nurga for the same exp, cause I dont see it.<br />
<br />
I just spent a few hours with a guild group in the Halls of Betrayal today. I pulled 12% regular exp before I switched over to AA and got another 35% there. I was only on 100% AA for maybe an hour and a half (I'm 65, btw). The level 60 enchanter who was with us most of the trip got 8 yellows of AA before she left. Even picked up a improved healing IV cloak for the druid, and I nabbed a 50hp/mana 10 on all saves cloak, and a 50hp/mana +2% channelling ring (they had other stats also - I just didnt write them down). Warrior got the assassin belt with 20 dex and other stats. Monk got 3 of the 4 pages for the golem heart ring quest that nets an AC 10, 20 str, 15 sta, 10 wis, 70 hp, 50 mana ring. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, yeah, forgot to also mention we found tons of spells (think juggs loot table), lots of spell research components, including a dew clover and the eluvise Yaeth 108 for Malo which was previously rumored to only drop in Vex Thal. And, I did get Malo out of Halls of Betrayal a few days ago.<br />
<br />
But, by all means, you just stay in happyland of PoP and ignore whatever us n00bs who dont know anything try to tell you. You want to know the real reason exp is so good in PoP? It's not because it's better than other places - it's because that's where all the people are. All the people who think like you and dont accept that they can indeed go someplace else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I switched over to AA and got another 35% there. I was only on 100% AA for maybe an hour and a half (I'm 65, btw). <br />
Am I reading it right?  You're saying 35% AA at 65, with 100% exp going to AA, in Chardok-B, took you an hour and a half?  You could have gotten an AA point and change in an hour and a half in BoT or PoTac.  Honestly I think I can see where you're coming from.  You're sick of the monotony of having just a few zones to get reasonable exp from, so you get a break from that by hitting up droga / nurga and even though its atrociously slow exp, you're having fun and not paying attention to how slow it really is.  I'm all for having fun but an AA taking 4.5 hours by your own numbers is a far cry from the 1 hour or so it'll take in tier 3 PoP.<br />
<br />
Grats on the loots from dok-B but I'm interested in discussing AA speed.<br />

I think you're really taking me the wrong way here.  When I talk about pop exp being better by far than anyplace else, I'm just stating a basic fact.  I don't like it one bit, as a matter of fact I've played around with the idea of deleveling to 60 and pretending the expansion never came out.  I wish places like droga and dok-B did offer an exp alternative to PoP.  But they don't, not even close.<br />
<br />
The real reason exp is better in PoP isn't, as you claim, &quot;because that's where all the people are&quot;.  It is because of the still quite large (though somewhat reduced) ZEMs and the larger exp reward for fighting higher level mobs.  That change was made some time after Luclin had come out; you used to get similar exp whether a blue mob was level 45 or level 59.  I recall getting great exp in Maiden's after that change because the 4arms were high level, 52-58 IIRC.  However non-summoning, low 60s level mobs with 22k hp fall well below where they should if they scaled up in a linear fashion.  For example its only slightly harder to kill a valor golem than for instance, a Jugg in seb (high 50s, 12k hp est.), but between the reward for killing a higher level mob and the PoP ZEM you get a good three times as much exp for the golem.<br />
<br />
This is a fundamental game flaw, and I think we feel much the same about PoP.. we just have different ways of expressing that.  I have no compunction about calling Sony on their giant mistake, you prefer to minimize the experience gap in your view and claim your 4-hour old-world AAs are fine &amp; dandy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think you're exaggerating that a bit. I was in a HoH basement group for about 8 or 9 hours yesterday and the SK who was tanking for us dinged 2 AA points in that time (I was on 100% regular exp). <br />
<br />
You keep throwing Tactics into the conversation. I'm not talking about tier 3/elemental planes - in fact, I specifically excluded those because 1) I'm not flagged for elementals only for Tactics so I cant comment from experience, and 2) from what I have heard, those places are much better than anyplace else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">BoT exp is similar to Tactics, you can get in regardless of flags since you're 65 (need flag or level 62 to zone in).  2-3% aaxp per kill in a 6man group and the mobs are relatively easy.<br />
<br />
8-9 hours seems quite high for two AA points, maybe the SK in your group pinged a few other AAs that s/he didn't mention or had thier exp split?  An AA in HoH before the exp change was a good 2 hours.. now it could only be less, I'd guess a little over an hour?  Figure 80% group bonus for a 6man group with a 5way split, (20% was the old group bonus, and with a 6way split) vs. maybe a 10-15% ZEM reduction.<br />
<br />
Yeah from what I've heard elementals are much better exp, I've been in good bot groups and heard groupmates in elemental guilds complaining about the slow exp... lol.  Tier 2/3 planes are the fastest exp I've seen though, by far.</div></div><hr />

I know about BoT, have spent many hours there. Have key to the towers there also. I'm fairly sure Tactics was not among the planes which had flag requirements removed. I had the flag before they removed the others - I just dont hunt there because whenever I zone in and check it's either completely deserted or there is a RZ raid forming up.</div></div><hr />

Droga, nurga, and dok-B suck for exp at 65, which I've seen firsthand.  Steelbear has said himself an AA takes over 4 hours in a good group in chardok-B.  If LoY were any different, it would be packed and I could take my pick of solo spots in BoT or PoTac, as it would be empty.  I'd also read constantly about the various spots for exp and loot there, and hear about it in the various serverwide channels and my server's auction channel, the bazaar's ooc, etc...  But LoY isn't any different.  That whole expansion is, by design, for the sub-65 crowd.  If you don't like me arri, great!  I pride myself on not kissing anyone's ass, but letting it taint your argument is weak.  koko nobody cares what an ebayer thinks.</div></div><hr />

Thoughts? Rants? Advice? Musings?<br />
<br />
BTW, of the two other boards (see sig for hint on classes) the consensus is split.  Has the game de-evolved that badly?<br />
<br />
The game rocks. I split for about 18 months (just before Velious was released) and came back. It's still the best game I've ever played (4 years I've been playing it now). If you didn't like the game before, maybe you'll still feel the same, but if you left for other reasons and now have the time to play again, do it.<br />
<br />
Everquest is a fantastic game. The LoY expansion is a lot of fun, with a lot of new quests and some beautiful zones (I love Dulak and Nadox). Sony still make people's blood boil and at times the customer feels neglected, but the game itself is better than any other MMORPG out there, IMO.<br />

You can Wire electrodes to your lower extremities and get that charge of a ding every hour or a little less..<br />

You know what. The game is so much more than kill mob-A only for the next month and get 2% xp per kill. <br />
<br />
But by all means please go get the BEST xp possible.<br />
<br />
It will keep you away from me you dreadlands of valor monkies.<br />
<br />
I like tactics. Cause it is fun. I like droga cause it is fun. I like Chardok A and B cause it is fun. I like Veskar cause it is fun. Valor and BoT bore me to tears for some reason, probably because many of the people there have all the personality of a rabid crack feind looking for the next 2% purer fix.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the longest time I didnt have Valor or storms access I xped in justice in the bugs camps. And I just got my 251st AA today in Droga. <br />
<br />
But I am sure some genious will call me a noob.<br />

I don't think BoT is boring at all, group with a ranger and you can chase after mini bosses all day long, since they spawn every 6 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I avoid Valor when possible, because the xp/difficulty ratio isn't there, and is made worse by the large number of level 55s (esp. tanks) who think that just because they CAN go somewhere, that they SHOULD go somewhere.<br />
<br />
Soloing in droga is fun, but a tiny mistake will get you killed...good for what it is, but safe xp it is not.</div></div><hr />
