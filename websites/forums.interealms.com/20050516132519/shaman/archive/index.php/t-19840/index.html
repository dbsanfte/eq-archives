<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pestario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading alot of the DUO threads and I'm liking what i hear about a SK Shaman duo for Highend XPING and farming.<br />
<br />
I have a 9 Shaman on one account and a 55 Necro on the other, on this same account I have a 10 Bezerker I am leveling up with the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyways with Highend XP/loot hording in mind would a SK or Necro be the best partner.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of having a tank and not having to worry about kiting, but I suppose if the DPS is good enough killing with a Necro and shaman would be fine too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whaaa, Im soo confused now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm sure someone will crunch a bunch of numbers for you (well, maybe). However, it really comes down to how you want to play. <br />
<br />
If you want to make it easy and just slow/sk tank/throw in heals, that's great. If you want to kite around with 2 chars, that's great as well. They'll both work out great, it just comes down to how you want to play.<br />
<br />
The necro will come out on top for DPS, but the necro won't be able to tank [like the sk will]. Once the necro gets to 61, LoZ pet will be a viable tank though for certain situations...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will have better DPS root-rotting/kiting with a necro partner than you will duoing with an SK partner.  First of all, necros do awesome DPS.  Second of all, you don't have to spend time or mana healing the necro, since he isn't getting hit.<br />
<br />
I was duoing around Gates last night with an SK friend and we tried ferubi.  I can honestly say that I can solo there faster than I duo, because with him tanking I have to spend almost all my time healing or cannibalizing back the mana that I spent blasting him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, against certain mobs, one will easily outdo the other.<br />
<br />
in PoFire, I'm sure a necro would be much better. However, in other, smaller, areas, the SK would be close to or better than the necro. <br />
<br />
It really depends on how much HPs the mob has, how much the mob hits for, and your level. All three will play important factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, since no one decided to plug in some numbers for you, I will. However, not for SKs (because you don't want an SK for DPS).<br />
<br />
Embracing Darkness - 11.67 DPS<br />
Funeral Pye - 43.5 DPS<br />
Cessation of Cor - 16.67 DPS<br />
Dark Plauge - 22 DPS<br />
Blood of Thule - 55.83 DPS<br />
Horror - 71.67 DPS<br />
Saryn's Kiss - 33.33 DPS<br />
<br />
And all of those DoTs stack, for a total of an optimum of 254.67 DPS, just from DoTs alone.<br />
<br />
In a realistic situation, it would never really happen. Also try to remember that some of those DoTs are HoTs (heal over times) as well. One of them is even a melee debuffer! The necro will also bring a pet (one much superior to yours in tanking and DPS) to the table.<br />
<br />
I did not include Undead DoTs (they have one), Lifetaps, or any Nukes. So, under the perfect conditions, the necro could achieve over 400 DPS, or 2400 DPT (Damage per Tick).<br />
<br />
I also did not include any spells from the LoY or GoD expansions.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your choice, and if you need to know more information about how awesome of modifers their DoTs get, damage per mana of their spells or anything else, let me know.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to kite as a necro. Sure, it's more effecient (as some say), but they have many other options.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, a well-played Necro has many different ways that he can kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keeping in mind that you are 2-boxing...I doubt that kiting is a viable option.  You are also limited to what you can XP or farm kiting :D<br />
<br />

At the high end, 2 boxing while kiting would be a fairly viable option I would think actually. Necro has better sustained aggro than any other class in a kiting situation,imho. Shaman could just sit on a horse, click his list of dots while the necro clicks his and aggro snare kites. Only the necro will be doing the negotiation of the kite, shaman just adds dot dps, maybe an occaisional Qui and buff refresh. If things get hinky, gate the shaman while the necro occupies the mob/mobs and then FD the necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason I say it isn't viable, is because kiting in high level zones solo is tough enough.  Now you have to worry about passing by casting distance of the Shaman while timing snare and the rest of the Necro DoTs.  Between steering a mob away from other aggro and getting it through the Shaman casting range...just having a tank seems alot easier.<br />
<br />
And yes, Necros can do more than kiting.  But in a duo, kiting is their most legitimate option IMO.<br />

she never got hit.  dot,  flop, dot dot, flop.  pet tanks. (more likely i am casting Torpor as the thing is beating on me)  Necros amaze me with what they can do solo, and the DPS they add to groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd say go with sk since you can duo fine by yourself, plus you have half a group already for when you want to invite others and go to harder places or ldon.</div></div><hr />

What mobs would you be xping on that would do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">65 Shaman, 65 SK two-boxer here.  Love the SK.  Those that I group with LOVE the SK.  Personally, I think the Shaman/SK duo is tops, since you have a tank class that can tag a mob with a spell that will snap out aggro malos/slow.  That in and of itself is reason enough when mobs start hitting for over 500.<br />
<br />
Nothing like the Ogre Brothers duo-team that I've seen (I've got a 55 monk, 62 warrior, and 62 wiz, too).  You can handle a lot of encounters with those two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">65 necro, 65 shaman 2 boxer here.  I've not played a SK so I have nothing to compare against, but I would like to offer my experiences with a necro/shaman combo.  Obviously you have to fight mobs that don't summon.  The comment about getting summoned and beat down is moot because your not going to go up against mobs that summon.  I'll use PoV here as an example.  The back walls by DG are great places to kite.  Sow the necro, pull with snare, lay on the dots.  Send in both pets, reapply dots, reapply snare for good measure.  Very easy really.  Also, it's very easy to kite the mob past the shaman for added damage.  Very easy, don't let people tell you it's difficult to time it, it's not.  Also, Wake the dead aa adds to dps.  It's next to impossible to pull the mob off the necro, even if you send in the pets right away.  This works in HoH as well, the courtyard area is a great place to kite.  Works in PoN too if you know where to set up.<br />
<br />
I'd think both scenarios are actually viable, a lot depends on your play style.  I don't think your going to level any faster(that dramatically anyways), but I do think the necro will outdamage the SK.  I'd think the SK might offer you more places to go duo, so the choice is really up to you.  <br />
<br />
As your shaman gains AA points, you'll be able to train defensive abilities and it's fun to tank once in a while.  What i do is pull as I've done above, lay on the dots with the necro, slow with shaman, and then FD the necro and tank the mob.  send in pets, reapply dots as needed.  <br />
<br />
btw, I'm about 4700 hps fully buffed, no elemental/time gear with about 120 aa's, necro has 100 aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zizaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just another option would be a mage.  I don't two box him but my roomate plays a mage and we duo lots of stuff doesnt matter if it summons or not mage pet can take a good beating and can keep aggro from slow almost better than a warrior as long as your not in melee range.  Mage can summon pet items for your pet and his along w/ focus gear and mod rods.  I am currently leveling a necro on my second acct to box w/ the 4 of us(other roomate plays a bst) but just the mage and I can take mobs that hit for 1k and partially mitigate slow.  Just my 2c.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The choice between a necro and an sk is the choice between being omg powerful in some zones and not really effective in others, and being decently effective pretty much anywhere.<br />
<br />
On a related note, 2boxing multiple casters is a good way to drive yourself nuts in a hurry, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have done a lot of 2boxing including some time with ranger and monk.  But I decided to commit to my SK alt well over a year ago now and it has been a great 2box partner choice.  I liked Monk DPS and it was frankly easier to play... more fluid and forgiving with FD...  but lacked tanking ability which swayed me to the SK.  I have great flexibility with the SK... it is a VERY self sufficient class and survivable.  On hard mobs little things like lifetaps make a big difference if I need to buy time for slow and heal from Shaman.  It's also great for pulling and scouting...  snares are critical for some things.<br />
<br />
I can see how a necro would be great for kiting but anything where you need to stand and fight the SK wins.  I would also highly recommend considering a Paladin also actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">while its been a long time since I played a necro they are a damn solid solo class with a spell/skill set that compliments ours very nicely. you could rot stuff down in no time with the added safty of snare and with the malo line you both have less to worry about from root breaks.<br />
if you are up to agro kiting then the dps goes up even more, with dog dog and the skel pounding the mob while you and necro are dotting it all to hell the only issue becomes mana, the necro will have to stop to med here and there. but they have near shaman like mana regen (possibly better later on but the shaman will always be able to hit fm/fhp first) <br />
with the sk your choices on play style are limted, the sk will Always have to tank to add anything to the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just another option would be a mage.

<br />
Ditto this.  The magician is sort of a forgotten class, sadly, but they are quite powerful.  Mage pets make pretty excellent tanks when combined with shaman slows.  The air and earth pets can hold agro quite nicely because of their stuns (air) and roots (earth).  <br />
<br />
I'd say a mage/shaman combo would do very well in many situations - the mage basically provides tanking, pet toys, and excellent nuking.  All offense, basically.  The shaman provides the defense - slow, root, heals, etc.  A very durable and powerful combo, and mages are easy to 2-box.  Just hot-key the /assist-pet attack and a few nukes.  <br />
<br />
Two pets equipped with mage toys (add 600hp total, two procing weapons with 140 damage procs, summoned 10% item haste) and buffed with shaman buffs will put out a lot of damage.  Throw in some shaman dots and mage nukes and you can burn a mob down quick if you need to, or let the pets tear them up more slowly. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  Mages don't get enough credit for what they can do in a good group or 2-box situation.  They don't solo so well, but really shine with a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SK/Shaman 2 boxer, former monk/shaman 2 boxer (prior to the demolition of monks as viable exp tanks).  This combo is so potent it's scary.  You have everything but ports/rez covered, and you will rarely need rez because sk's are such awesome pullers.  Snare splitting, pet splitting (if you've seen this you know what I mean), insta-click invis splitting, it's so nice.  The mob summons? Who cares.  Got a room packed 5 deep w/ mobs? Who cares.<br />
<br />
Necro dps will smoke sk dps assuming mob doesn't summon and there's room to kite.  This isn't very viable if you want to go deep into dungeons, however.  I can't tell you how many times I've gone deep into a dungeon just by myself, no one else in zone, knowing I'm totally safe due to insta-invis + ivu + summon corpse (which necros also get).<br />
<br />
But, the best part of all- no matter what zone you go to, esp. LDoN or PoP, you are the core of the group.  You bring tank/puller/slower/healer/snarer to the table- you are the core of the group.  I typically add 4 dps and lay waste.  Granted, this is as a bazaar player w/ access only to BoT/Tactics so I can't speak to higher tiers, but this combo has done it for me.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, I got the new version of EQ Companion which now parses spell damage.  Been doing that the last couple of nights and my sk, while tanking, has beaten monks, rogues and wizards in dps, clocking in around 130 dps (I repeat: while pulling/tanking).  SK's at the bazaar level are incredible.  I can't comment on the raid level because I have zero knowledge.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>pestario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Very Confusing, I have the Shammy/Bezerker up to 24 now. I do enjoy the bezerker class and can Stun/snare, nice dps as well, tanks fairly well, there are on SK HP from what I understand.<br />
<br />
However the SK seems like they have so much more to offer, plus I could P/L (group the SK with my 24 shammy to catch him up pretty quick. Still trying to decide which route to go.<br />
<br />
I stll already have my 55 Necro and figure I will Duo him with my Shammy as well in the right situations but the Necro has already become secondary to the 2 box combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I played a 60 shaman/monk combo for a long time, and then a 65 shaman/60 monk, and now a 65 shaman/65 SK. <br />
<br />
The SK is really a lot of fun.  He doesn't have the mitigation or hitpoints of a warrior, or discs, but he is so much more fun to play.  He does have three things I really love -- FD(not as good as my monk's) and summon corpse(which necros also have) and the ability to survive being summoned by many mobs, and to just tank generally.  It gives you a lot of flexibility to be able to survive being summoned.  Sk snare also causes a lot of aggro, so I can make it so my shaman never even gets hit at all by mobs -- pretty important when you're in charge of both healing and slowing, and a nice luxury indeed.<br />
<br />
Necros do put out tremendous DPS though.<br />
<br />
But another way to look at the situation is, if you are tired or just feeling like a change of pace, what do you do?  With a shaman/SK, you can play one toon(shaman) at a time that has enormous flexibility and responsibility and must constantly canni.  It can be very rewarding and very irritating sometimes too.  But with a SK, you can experience a very different type of play, and one that I find far less involved in micro-management.  Like when I used to just single play my monk sometimes, playing the SK can feel like a refreshing vacation that helps keep me from getting bored with the game.<br />
<br />
I think a necro is one heck of a great toon, and thank goodness it doesn't have to canni, but it's not as radically different from a shaman as a SK is.  You won't get as much of the feeling of variety going from one dotting caster to another as you would going from one dotting caster to a tank -- one who can even FD pull!<br />
<br />
In raids, too, SK's can do a fair amount of kicking back compared to shamans, who always have to be slowing, healing inside and outside their groups, curing, and recasting buffs.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind having a necro at all myself, but I don't think it's as much of a change of pace if you decide to play it as a single every so often.  My SK has saved my sanity many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think it all depends on what you plan on using the duo on.  If you plan on doing any PoP mobs, I'd say the SK/Shaman combo is better because while the necro pet can tank slowed mobs, it's more of a mana drain due to the healing needed.  <br />
<br />
If you like to do some of the revamped and newer dungeons, the necro pet can tank just fine.  I often duo in Veksar and Droga and the 65 necro pet tanks the slowed mobs and keeps aggro very well.  It's also easy to keep aggro off the necro, just dot to hell and then FD.  <br />
<br />
I also have a lower level SK (41) that I use sometimes and I have to say, if I didnt love my necro so much I'd use that combo full time.  They compliment each other well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would say just the opposite.  In PoP, necro blows sk away, there's no way that duoing with a SK in Fire, Tactics, or even Valor/Honor etc. is as efficient as doing the same with a necromancer.<br />
<br />
Melee/Shaman rocks until you start getting to PoP past tier 1, where it slows down.  It slows almost to a stop if you can't get amazing gear for your melee.  Whereas a necro needs very little in terms of gear and, if they manage to get the gear, they can ToM tank pretty well when the need arises.  There are also some very interesting things that you can do with necro charm in a few places.<br />
<br />
Necros also bring rez to the table, which is invaluably convenient if you like hunting in odd areas that are hard to get to.  For example, you aren't going to solo the parts for the BA4 pottery item in Torment with anyone but a necro.<br />
<br />
I confess I am a bit of a necro fanboy, I loved reading Yaguex's amazing solo stories on the necro boards when he played, I love duoing with them now, and if I had the time to get one flagged, equipped, and levelled/AA'd, I'd have one on my second PC in a heartbeat =)</div></div><hr />

I agree with this if you're:<br />
1) only going to do single pulls in outdoor PoP zones -- and --<br />
2) you will never be grouping<br />
<br />
If you're going to do LDoNs and/or group with people (which is IMO funner, less stressful and more efficient), having a ready made core of a group is key.  I zone into BoT, LDoN camps, Tactics, wherever, and I just grab the first 4 dps I see.  This is great because dps is a dime a dozen, unlike tanks, healers and slowers, depending on your play schedule.  I recently started practicing pulling, tanking and healing in LDoN hards w/ this combo (I invited 3rd person just to let me get the adv, then they left) and my only issue was downtime due to shaman's near useless heals (thank goodness for lifetaps).  Again, invite dps and it's candy.  Pet pulling is also godly.<br />
<br />
Again, good luck and have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, I was only talking about duoing for xp and farming items/plat, not 2 people to LFG with, where you might be better off with sham/sk.  I disagree with the restrictions that you have to single pull more with a sham/nec vs a sham/sk and I'd disagree that you have to stay outside (some of the best indoor farming spots it is simply impossible to get a shaman to with a SK unless the shaman is willing to eat XP deaths). <br />
<br />
Of all the zones that I would thing to duo xp or farm in at 65 (off the top of my head, Fire, Valor, Honor, BoT, Tactics, Sol Ro, Decay, Torment, Veksar, Droga, Sebilis, HS, CT, Nadox I am sure there are others that I am not thinking of) I think I'd prefer a necro over a comparably geared SK in any of them with the possible exception of Sol Ro if we are talking elemental + characters.  <br />
<br />
I lack enough experience with GoD to have a strong opinion wither way about who (if anyone) to duo with there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If both had Fire access, Necro/Shaman is superior by far if it's xp you're after.  If you love to kite, the necro will always be better.</div></div><hr />

I keep regen on him an dhis pet and buff his pet with speed and such. Rarely do we have a death or any other problems. Usually we end up having to wait for repops when we are working a camp as we clear it too fast. Then again we are used to each others playing style as I have grouped with other necros with less favorable results. It simply means that as long as you know your partner and there play styles you will usually work well together</div></div><hr />

You just answered your own question.  If you don't want to have to worry about kiting, the SK will be far more versatile at the high end, in terms of what you can/cannot duo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, I have decided on a tank for the main setup but will still use my necro as well since itas already level 55 for some occasions as well.<br />
<br />
Just decideing between zerker or shadowknight now</div></div><hr />
