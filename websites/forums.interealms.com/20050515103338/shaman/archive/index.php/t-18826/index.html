<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have done the MB (Manic Behemoth) twice now. And although a little drunk both times I am positive I hailed the PP.<br />
<br />
But a thread I just read on the Safehouse confuses me, its says this about Seer dialouge.<br />
<br />
--Quote--<br />
Tier 1 - Innovation<br />
Seer:You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.<br />
- PoI dragon killed and have access to factory (Not Required)<br />
Seer:Giwin would like you to find him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek.<br />
- You have defeated the Behemoth and have access to Tactics (no Zeks killed yet)<br />

I have done TZ and RZ, but according to the Safehouse post I dont need to have done any of them to get the second message.<br />
<br />
When speaking to the Seer I only get the first message, somehtings wrong....and I dont know what. Any ideas? (I have only a couple of flags left to get)<br />
<br />
BTW I allways 'Unlock Memories&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume you did the first part where you hailed the dorf and said &quot;I will test the machine&quot;?<br />
<br />
I can't tell if you already had tactics access via the storms quest or not. If not, then your flags should be ok because you wouldn't be able to zone in on your own (without 85'ing it).<br />
<br />
If you post the whole seer text it might help unravel this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yep, you're missing the MB preflag, go into the factory in PoI and hail the gnome in the first room. Then fix flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did do the pre-flag, but I'll go do it again as I know these things can be un-ruly, thanks for the idea.<br />
<br />
Yes I was already flagged for Tactics via the quest.<br />
<br />
I'll also post the entire Seer dialouge regardless of results as I know these 'flagging problems' threads help a lot of people....they have helped me alot already.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, any more opinions before I get the entire Seer dialouge posted (in about 10 hours, currently at work) greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your fine.<br />
<br />
Seer:Giwin would like you to find him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek.<br />
- You have defeated the Behemoth and have access to Tactics (no Zeks killed yet)<br />
This compleately disappears once you have a tallon or vallon zek kill. Assuming you have any msg refering to tallon or vallon your fine as far as behemoth goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Taraddar, you are correct.<br />
<br />
Here is the text anyway as I said I would post.<br />
<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:12 2004] You say, 'what guided meditation'<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] The information obtained from Karana is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] You have beaten Rydda`Dar in the first of Honor's Trials.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] You have saved the villagers in the second of Honor's Trials.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] You have defeated the nomads in the third of Honor's Trials.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] Milyk has been saved from certain death, but is not recovering.  Only by destroying the ruler of all things pestilent will his curse be lifted.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] The portal into the Plane of Fire has been altered.  Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:13 2004] You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:18 2004] Sashe tells the guild, 'yes she does same for ebine list all 3.'<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:23 2004] You say, 'unlock memories'<br />
[Thu Jan 08 01:01:23 2004] Your heart beat speeds as you recall the Warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions.</div></div><hr />
