Info on stats and how they react in the game and resists and just a bunch of good things to drool over while we wait for the release in november ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cool :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I would *like* to see release as early as Nov. (and yes I saw the wink~) it is maybe possible, but unlikely.  Most of the closed beta folks at this point are in an uproar about the indicators pointing to release coming sooner vs. later.  But honestly from my experience in the week of Stress Test the game has great polish and is close, I think, to where they would want and need it to be for release.  <br />
<br />
They need to implement talents for 5 classes.  Two of those are probably done and in internal testing or close now with Shaman and Druid.  Then come Warlock, Paladin, and Hunter Talents.  Some balance and tweaking issues, some content, ie a lot of Horde quests aren't quite on par with Alliance.  It would seem the game is really only going to have 2-3 more main pushes in Beta.<br />
<br />
Ultimately it's all still speculation but they have given us enough indicators pointing to this year before the holidays.</div></div><hr />

Also, check out cosmos.exe at: <br />
<br />
http://www.cosmosui.org/<br />
<br />
It's a WoW plugin that adds stat collection and improves the UI without screwing up (as in allowing cheats) like UO, EQ, and AC plug-ins did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have to bear in mind, too, that a lot is going to be kept out of release, as Blizzard has stated, for good reasons they've already given.  So speculation about whether this year is too early or not has to be tempered with that.<br />
<br />
Now, SoE saying EQ2 will be released this year, with 3 months or LESS of beta, is really really funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even more funny when you also had the chance to play EQ2 beta Laughingwoman  ;)<br />
<br />
The sky in EQ2 is beautiful though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did not even bother to register for EQ2 Beta, I was *that* disinterested.   The PC character models are flat boring and too consistently humanoid, even for iksar and rat, etc.<br />
<br />
And yes there is content they specifically said is being held back from beta so it is fresh on the live release, but afaik they only said that regarding high end/raid content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Disinterest, as above.  I've beta'ed more than a few EQ expansions (some of which AFTER I'd paid for them, HAR!) and I don't care to do it again.  The funny part (because you missed my point entirely, Kykha) is that - in case you're not familiar with the beta process - 3 months is a LAUGHABLY short term for a beta test.  I don't care if you're Jesus Christ Programming Star, you aren't going to get a mmorpg up to speed in 3 months.  I'm kind of nervous, actually, about Blizzard saying theirs will be done by the end of the year, but I've never known them to release unfinished software, so I can't get myself too worked up.<br />
<br />
People are so used to swallowing buggy, crappy code from game developers, I guess it's understandible for them to be skeptical about Blizzard, not knowing their record.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was under the impression that EQ2 beta started earlier this year, sometime just before/during June.  So if EQ2 were to release in November, which is possible, or December, which is most likely, you're talk nearly 6-7 months of beta testing.  Which isn't a whole lot, but it is more informed than the 3 months you're claiming it is.</div></div><hr />

Howler if it is eq 2, then release will be the start of the beta testing.</div></div><hr />
