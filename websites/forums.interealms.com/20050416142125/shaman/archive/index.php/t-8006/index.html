<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, anyone know exactly how much data is uploaded and downloaded from yuor computer in, say an hours session of EQ?<br />
<br />
Reason I asked this is because it seems to be a trend where cable/dsl ISP's are capping the amount of donwload and uploads to help stop people from using highspeed access as a server on thier systems.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's 10 megs an hour or so.<br />
Check with sony's page though, they list the actual value there anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I remember correctly, the right most figure on the &quot;lag-o-meter&quot; is the amount of data being sent to you by the EQ server.<br />
<br />
This seems to fluctuate from around 500 (bytes per second I assume) in a quiet zone, to 2000 in a raid type situation, and possibly as high as 6000 when you loot your corpse.<br />
<br />
Assuming an average figure is 1000 bytes a second, that's 60k a minute, or 3.6 meg per hour, or 86.4 meg per day.<br />
<br />
Obviously these figures are a total guess, but I reckon they're in the right order of magnitude.</div></div><hr />
