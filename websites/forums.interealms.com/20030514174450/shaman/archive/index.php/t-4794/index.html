Heh but seriously. Now that you have Torpor go kill Coterie in Maidens Eye for fun, or Moktors in Umbral plains. It wont get you cash but it will give you some feel for soloing hard mobs that require torpor. They are good ones to start with:) Or you could just go try Yeldema;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL.. was funny last night in Howling stones when I torpored my Monk friend.  One sure way to keep 'em from pulling before you're ready.  His first encounter with Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe ya, most melees have a love/hate relationship with torpor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are the lesser named in ME soloable?  Those +15 stat bracelets could get you some serious money.  I've killed a few of these things with a group, and they were really pathetic.  I don't have torpor, so I didn't try the solo.  Seems doable, though.<br />
<br />
Any camp you can nab in seb would be good.  NG would be awesome.<br />
<br />
I think there's some stuff in ME that can drop some nice stuff that requires killing a bunch of toilers :o  not really familiar with ME, I hate the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chardok is good money, if he has dire charm it'll be alot better.  BTW Grats on torpor, took me bout 8 months of being 60 and my JB BP for torpor.  You got off lucky.</div></div><hr />

I think that's Umbral Plains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AYE the 15 sta bracer drops IN UP of a named mob...hes got quite a few hims,but friend told me its a good regan on him..not sure but...solo will be pretty tuff if it is a reg,but if not..he wouldnt be tough...getting him without a tracker would be but..dosnt hit for over 200..easy to solo and cast upon..we wack him most night..ranger will zone in see if hes up,if he is me(60 shammy) and cleric rl friend go wack him..got a bracer every night so far..they seem pretty random as well..got 2 cha..1 int..2 wis..1 dex &amp; aglity..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yah, Umbral.  dont think the spirits are solo'able.  They do hit hard and have a ton of hps.  however, they are slowable (easy to do).  The only problem I see is they seem to be perma-camped (well, I'm guilty of this as well).  Quite easy to do with a few friends as long as one of them is a cleric.</div></div><hr />
