<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who can play, or those who might just know.<br />
<br />
What is the maximum level difference between players to join an adventure, if any.  Example - My Ranger friend is level 65.  I am level 54.  Can we both be in the same adventure together?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, a co-worker ordered the boxed version, and the manual in there says 6 to 10 levels in difference. I'd assume the 10 applies at 65, so you're pretty close anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />

Adventure Tips <br />
<br />
The Wayfarers Brotherhood have many interesting adventures for you. You can find them in North Ro, South Ro, Everfrost Peaks, the Butcherblock Mountains and East Commons. To get an adventure, form a group and seek out the Wayfarers. The group leader must Right-click on the Adventure Recruiter or the Raid Recruiter to be given an adventure. <br />
<br />
These adventures take place in dungeon &quot;instances&quot;. This means that a copy of the dungeon is created just for your group, and no others can enter it. You will have a limited time to complete your task, so keep moving. Here are some other tips about the adventure window. <br />
<br />
- Only the group or raid leader can start an adventure for your group or raid. <br />
- Your group or raid must be complete before the group or raid leader accepts the adventure. Only characters in your group or raid when the adventure is requested will be able to enter the dungeon. <br />
- If you decline an adventure, you will have to wait a short while before another will become available. <br />
- The group or raid leader can choose a Normal or Hard risk for the adventure. If the group or raid leader chooses Hard the adventure will be more difficult but will also yield greater reward. <br />
- Once you accept an adventure, a waypoint represented by a blue line will appear on your compass to help guide you to the entrance of the dungeon when you are in the appropriate zone. <br />
- The Time to Enter shows you how long you have to locate and enter the dungeon portal. If you do not enter the portal before the timer expires, your adventure will end. <br />
- Once you enter, the Time to Complete shows you how long you have to reach your objective. If you do not complete your adventure by then, the adventure will close down. <br />
- If at any point you leave, complete, or fail your adventure you can still enter the dungeon and retrieve your corpse, as long as the dungeon is still open. <br />
- Any time that a dungeon instance shuts down, all PC corpses and any living PCs will be placed outside the dungeon at the portal used to enter the dungeon. <br />
- The View Stats button will show you your adventure statistics, and from the Stats window you can access the adventure Leaderboard. <br />
<br />
Here are some tips about group adventures: <br />
<br />
- You must be in a group of at least 4 members to get an adventure. <br />
- Your group members must all be of a similar level (within about 6 or 7 levels of each other). <br />
<br />
Here are some tips about raid adventures: <br />
<br />
- You must be in a raid group of at least 18 members to get a raid adventure, up to a maximum of 36. <br />
- Your raid members must all be at least level 60, with a required level average of 63. <br />
- Each member of your raid must complete at least two adventures in the theme you wish to raid in. <br />
- Once you have successfully completed or failed a raid adventure, you will need to wait five real-life days to do the same raid adventure again. For example, if you take on the raid in Deepest Guk, when you fail or succeed on that raid, you will have to wait five days to try again. <br />
<br />

so the answer to your question appears to be no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These raids were designed to be really hard for hardcore, high level raiding guilds. They put in zero raid content for anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 expansions in a row catering to high-end guilds, with some bones thrown in to the majority of the playerbase.  *sigh*  I'd say &quot;when will they learn?&quot; but even this kind of garbage is better than anything else out there, so they have no reason to change.  *laugh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They added 1-group adventures for all levels.  How is this 'catering to high-end guilds'?<br />
<br />
Seems to me they added something for all levels, from low level all the way to high end players for whom a 1-group hard adventure would be trivial.<br />
<br />
Waiting to form my own opinions from experience, but I'm looking forward to the exploration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have it backwards.  This expansion is for the non-raid crowd, with a bone thrown to the raiders.  Raids in LDON are very restrictive.  Win or lose, one raid per 5 days per area, high levels only, 18-36 character limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the 6 or 7 levels is bunk.  Had a group earlier today with 63 shm, 62 shm, 65 bst 64 sk 65 mage and 58 brd.  Would not let us accept the mission.  When we dropped the bard we could.<br />
<br />
I /bugged it, but dont expect anyting to come of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bard was 7 levels below the hightest levels, and only 4 behind the lowest. And we still couldnt add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lets see 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, looks like a 8 level range to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">???<br />
<br />
65-58=7 last time i checked... unless you want to count full bars of xp as 1 level, then you should start counting at 58/0% and go up.  but then you have to assume that the 65 is fully maxed at 100% xp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The document says &quot;within about 6 or 7 levels of each other&quot;.  I took that to mean 6 (because I see the cup as half empty).<br />
<br />
What can I say, I'm a pessimist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you recall a few weeks ago there were polls on login that asked what raiding and grouping preferences people had. I assume LDoN was tuned according to the majority responses.<br />
<br />
My guild is pure euro so we didn't have time to bash a raid together and we have PoTime tomorrow, but some of us hammered single group encounters in all the various sectors apart from Miraguls and we all found them relatively simple on Normal and semi challenging on Hard. After we finish Time tomorrow we will probably test some of the Raid adventures and see how we get on. So far my impressions are that the dungeons are tuned and aimed at sub Elemental guild pickup groups, with drops of very roughly Ssra/VT quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The actual limit is : Highest - Lowest &lt;= 6. Or at least that is what it was in Beta, and I see no evidence that it has changed.</div></div><hr />
