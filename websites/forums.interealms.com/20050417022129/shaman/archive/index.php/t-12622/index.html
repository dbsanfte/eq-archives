<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kermitt Defrogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have killed in MS, got about 2 ticks of a blue bub from the mobs there. not too great.  I killed the frozen apes in TD, decent exp ( bout 3-4 ticks of a blue bub per kill ) but horrible getting there.  your KEI is 1/3 gone by the time u finally get there.  I did DSP grouped and was ok.. about 3 yellow bubs in 3-4 hours of non stop pulln.  was wondering if there is a place in LoY that a twinked 31 Shammy can solo at?  I was thinking about Jagged pine forrest, but dont know that zone at all either.<br />
<br />
any advice would be helpfull.  best solo exp so far for me at this lvl is the frozen apes in TD... I just hate having to waist 1/2 hour getting there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>terent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played until 35 in OT got about 1% per kill with a 35 warrior and 35 shaman. But i moved to Gulf of Gunthak. at the beach area most mobs are Dark Blue or Even con.<br />
<br />
I am getting 1% per kill there with warrior partner. i can do 2 mobs at the same time when necesary. i am still at beach have not moved in yet. gonna do that at 36. Will do tunnel there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 33 to 36 I have been fighting in GD at either the Tizmak caves in or the cave bear caves.<br />
<br />
Bears are good exp but no loot.  The tizmaks are slightly less exp per kill but frequently drop 5 plat vellium weapons.  With Kei and pet I can constantly kill Tizmaks and get around 60 plat an hour in weapon drops.<br />
<br />
I found awesome exp at the orcs in CC, but solo is a little sketchy as even with a pet you still get a lot of potential for multiple adds.  That said I have not found better exp or loot yet for my level.<br />
<br />
I also found I was having a fun time kiting and rooting giants in GD for decent exp and gaining toes and heads for the first 2 shawls.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think these areas are soloable easily, but here is what I've found so far.<br />
<br />
Beach - low 30's.<br />
Tunnel - mid 30's.<br />
Before the castle steps - mid-high 30's.<br />
Castle steps &amp; drogmars pre-steps - mid-high 30's.<br />
<br />
The area pre-castle and on the steps has very few ppl hunting there, so it's nice and quiet.<br />
<br />
Not areas you probably can go LFG in, but byog and you'll be fine.  Or if you're plevelling yourself too.<br />
<br />
The area of Gunthak, near the Dulak zone, is probably around 40 or so, but you'll get frustrated by all the uncalled trains being dumped on you.</div></div><hr />
