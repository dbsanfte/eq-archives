<br />
Played EQ2 beta a bit. Had a lot of fun. I like the game and will be trying it out when it goes live.<br />
<br />
Shaman Class<br />
Shamans are great fun to play. Seemed well balanced up to 20 which is as far as i managed to get in the two weeks i've been playing.<br />
<br />
Real heals shared with all priests, although all direct healing seems slightly weak atm.<br />
Real damage mitigation with wards (rune buff).<br />
A non-overpowering slow (so far anyway).<br />
Rez (loved casting that the first time at level 12 or 13)<br />
SoW although scouts get better.<br />
Dots.<br />
Bear form.<br />
Miscellaneous other stuff.<br />
<br />
Class System<br />
Basically there are 4 archetypes which branch to class and then sub-class. You start as a priest, then can choose shaman at 10 then mystic (good) or defiler (evil) at 20.<br />
<br />
All archetypes share the same core abilities, which i like, because it makes every class pretty well equipped to do their job. Seems like class balancing will also be easier, but time will tell. Some people don't like the system, because it makes all classes of the same archetype pretty similar. I didn't mind it.<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
You get core spells which you can upgrade through crafted spells or drops, from apprentice 1-3, adept 1-3, master 1-3. So you start with an app 2 generally and should upgrade to app3 soon as you can which is about the baseline. Drops of adept spells are not so rare, and these can be crafted also. <br />
<br />
Then every 13 or so levels you get a new more powerful spell of the same type, which you have to upgrade all over again. But, if you had a master 1 or better, you probably wouldn't start using the the new version when you got it, as the master would be more powerful for some levels yet.<br />
<br />
Very ocassionally you get a new spell like bearform for shamans that is quite unique, however most spells are upgrades of previous ones. Not a bad system, but lacks a bit of diversity currently. The spell lists for mages particularly seem like they could use some work. I'm assuming they are leaving room to add new spells.<br />
<br />
Also some players complain they don't feel particularly different from the other classes in their archetype. For priests i didn't see this as much of a problem. <br />
<br />
As well as the core heals, runes, regens, and nukes: <br />
Shamans get wards (runes), slows, dots, etc, wear medium armor<br />
Druids get regens, damage shields and nukes, wear light armor<br />
Clerics get another debuff, a heal shield (mark of karn type), translocate, etc, wear heavy armor.<br />
<br />
Clerics are currently complaining they are the worst healer (tee hee). I suspect it's because a lot of them are ex-EQ1 clerics used to spmming their direct heals, which seems to be about the worst way to play a healer in EQ2. Having played a shaman where we had to use more spells to acheieve the same effect, i was pretty used to it. That said, shaman wards are pretty powerful and combined with the base regen and slow make shamans excellent choices as main healer.<br />
<br />
Content<br />
There is a lot of content, particularly quests, even at the low levels i played. Unfortunately, seems like most people will blaze straight past it though because leveling as it stands now is pretty easy. It will no doubt slow down a lot later, but personally, i think they could halve the levelling rate and it would still be pretty quick and would force players to see more of the game world.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy the focus on the Qeynos/Freeport base cities. Brought back a lot of memories of the original EQ when it was a fun game. Fippy's decendents are alive and well and Blackburrow is once again a dangerous, spokky, train-filled dungeon. <br />
<br />
Overall, there is a lot to explore and the devs appear keen to keep soloers happy. I didn't do a lot of soloing, but it's pretty easy to do as a priest if you wanted to. Instances seem to be used well to control overcrowding and lock your group into a private dungeon where appropriate.<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Not bad overall. A lot of go-there-kill-5-rats-come-back type stuff. I did a couple that were quite involved, like the quests you have to do to achieve your class and subclass, and there may be more story based stuff i haven't seen. Much better system than EQ1. Rewards are pretty good and you can get pretty well kitted out just on quests alone.<br />
<br />
One reservation: it's pretty easy to abuse the system at low levels, once you know where all the decent quests are. My last char got to level 11 in about 4 hours and had 30 silver which is not a small amount of cash without grouping or exping at all. I still have a bunch of quests to do that will take maybe another 2 hours, see me through to close to 15 and make me another 20 or so silver.<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
Encounters are generally geared to the 6-person group similar to EQ1, although there is soloable stuff around. Combat in a full group is fast and furious. Health and power regen is so fast, you basically have no downtime. Particularly with the addition of heroic opportunities, there seems to be a fair degree of skill involved if you want to increase your performance. These are special sequences of spells/combat abilities that when fighting will trigger a benefit for the group. People are only just starting to learn the system, so looks like it could be cool for groups who play well together. <br />
<br />
Soloers also get heroic opportunites and they help quite a lot, at lower levels anyway. I heard at higher levels soloing is painfully slow, but no first hand experience.<br />
<br />
Locked encounters will be debated forever -- once you engage a mob, nobody can interfere, including heals and so on. I didn't hate it.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
Quite a complex tradeskill system. There's plenty of explanations around of the mechanism, so i won't bother trying. Suffice to say i found it pretty confusing at first, but now that i've got the hang of it i quite look forward to battling the chemistry table. Interdepence of crafting classes is forced, so like the class system, you start off and can do all crafts till 10, then you pick one of 3 craft branches you can do until 20, then one specialized craft at 20. And you are locked into mastering that one craft alone with that char.<br />
<br />
The crafting exp system is independent of the combat exp system. If you want to get to lvl 50 in crafting, the devs say it will take take as long as leveling to 50 through combat.<br />
<br />
I like the system, particularly after they speeded up the progression in the last patch. Some players complained that it gets very boring quickly because you have to do a lot of sub-combines. However, the bazaar system wasn't available then, so maybe being able to buy the subcomponents from other players will make it a lot less painful. Having mastered alchemy, brewing other crafts in EQ1, safe to say i found the EQ2 system far more involving.<br />
<br />
Stuff Some People Will Hate<br />
Death sytem. You get an exp debt that you can halve by finding your corpse. If you don't recover your corpse you are crippled with a curse for 3 days and get the full exp debt. You respawn with all your items, but have to repair them. Also, if someone dies in your group, everyone gets a share of the exp debt. This could cause some problems later, no doubt.<br />
<br />
Trivial loot code. You can't farm items from mobs that don't give exp. Not an issue for me.<br />
<br />
Level restricted loot. You can't wear items too powerful for your current skills and you have to continually upgrade your gear. Not an issue for me.<br />
<br />
Probably a lot more besides, but can't think of it atm.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
After playing EQ2 it was impossible to go back to EQ1. No doubt, this is mostly because the game is new and i've been playing EQ1 for 5 years. That said i like the ideas at least behind most of what they have put into EQ2.<br />
<br />
My biggest reservation is that SoE is in charge of the game. I am familiar with their ability to ruin good ideas through bad implementation and to plow ahead with ideas because of expediency.<br />
<br />
That said, i did get some of the original sense of wonder i felt when i first started playing EQ1 years ago. Time will tell if the game can hold that feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">another very cool thing i'd like to point out.  if you target your main tank their target becomes your secondary target.  this means that you can toss heals when you need and any detrimental spells will go directly to the mob the tank is fighting.  it just makes things a little easier for the shaman.  conversely, if you target a mob, any beneficial spells will automatically go to the player that mob has targeted.  <br />
<br />
regarding slow, i don't even know if slow actually slows anything or if it just makes me feel better.  being an old school shaman, slowing is in my blood so i do it because i can :P<br />
<br />
locked combat isn't as much of a pain as i thought it would be.  <br />
<br />
i thought trivial loot would be a problem because of old quests but that's not the case.  you don't have to actually loot things off of the quest mobs.  it will automatically give whatever you need if you kill the right mobs.  plus if you do have a collect X quest it's not near as much of a pain as EQ1 is.  better than 50% of the kills drop your quest piece (my estimate, not hard numbers).  <br />
<br />
i'm not sure if i'm going to play on release or not.  it is quite different from EQ1, but quite a bit the same, in a way.  it's very hard to explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">another very cool thing i'd like to point out.  if you target your main tank their target becomes your secondary target.  this means that you can toss heals when you need and any detrimental spells will go directly to the mob the tank is fighting.  it just makes things a little easier for the shaman.  conversely, if you target a mob, any beneficial spells will automatically go to the player that mob has targeted.  <br />

<br />
<br />
I found that Howling Haze, at 24, was pretty superior to Keening Haze.  Much more useful slow, if you're comparing apples to apples (Adept 3 vs Adept 3).  AE Slow at 35 is nice.  <br />
<br />
Regarding Mystics in general, and coming from a 65 Shaman in EQ1 (I left after PoP) I can say that I'm honestly very pleased.   I've been playing since Friends and Family, and after several months and a pwipe, I've gotten to tinker with 'em quite a bit.  A few months down the road, and I'm still having a good time, so that's all that matters. =p  I know there is a lot of contention on the beta boards recently regarding the &quot;lack of diversity&quot; regarding some of the sub-classes, and I don't really agree at all.  Personally, I think the majority of the people posting haven't even really gotten to the 25+ mid-level game where the sub-classes really start to flesh out.  Some spell lines don't even begin until; others as late as 29, and the Mystic pet is 45 - so I think most will find they are pretty well fleshed out in the long run.<br />
<br />
With that said, I don't know a mage or a melee from a hole in the ground, so maybe they are suffering from a lack of diversity. =p  I like mah shammy just fine.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Btw, if anyone has questions, now's the time to ask!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, playing a shaman in beta has been mostly fun for me, even though I am currently only level 18. The role of a shaman is almost exclusivly healing, at that level. Some buffing, slowing and nuking to go around. Our melee output is negligible, at least that is my impression from soloing. We kill stuff with spells and if we run oom during the fight we are dead (solo).<br />
<br />
My biggest issues:<br />
The overall gameplay feels too restricted too me. Since I have never been bothered by those things the locked encounters, TLC or linked mobs are supposed to fix, they are just annoying to me. But, of course, there is the possibility to balance encounters better. There is a lot of discussion on the beta-boards about these issues and the full spectrum from deep love to utter hate for these mechanics.<br />
<br />
Soloing is currently being improved some. Counter to some believes, at least for the Freeport side it is neither easy nor very rewarding to solo. For many quests you must have a group or wait until the encounter (and reward) is trivial.<br />
<br />
Also the stability under load is still very bad, but I guess that is a priority right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall it is a well designed game with stunning gfx. Everyone will have to find out for themselves if they like it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In combat we have just to chain cast our 2 ward . Other spell don't worth it (and we don't have enough mana for them ,except if we fight easy mob).Can nuke a bit (very low dmg nuke) and dot ,but most of time ,we just cast ward and assist the MT (because it's impossible to med in fight).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my impressions of eq2 weren't very good. To be honest its not fair of a sequel in any way. It has great graphics, cool voiceovers and stuff but it just lacks immersiveness, its more grind based, the class system I didn't find very fun, and it has some horrible gameplay ideas like group exp debt. <br />
The game will appeal to a certain niche but its not going to appeal to the masses, like WoW will by anymeans. Plus, you're going to need a pretty good system to run it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For another view of the beta, this post (http://vnboards.ign.com/EQ2_General_Board/b22210/77125268/?69) seemed to set out the major concerns, at least some of which i share:<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
My bottom line on EQ2 though, now that I've had a chance to test up to 25 with one class and all the other archetypes into their mid-teens is: <br />
<br />
- Graphics: yummy scrummy!!! The screenshots look sublime in motion. The E3 video's of combat were a hoax though. Combat looks nothing like that smooth and polished. It's messy and the cracks have been smothered by excessive eye-candy. The mobs don't animate beautifully like the Nightbloods in the video, they perma-twitch every few milliseconds as someone else hits them, until the moment they fall over and die. <br />
<br />
- Audio: Also yummy scrummy!!! Voiceovers add so much you can't even begin to imagine how good they are. EAX4 and 7.1 surround is supported. The surround effects are excellent. Ambient noise and idle mob noises are excellent too. Skeletons and Pumpkin heads make the same noises as they do in EQ1. I adore them for keeping those .wavs! <br />
<br />
- Zone design: Very, very good. Just as good as EQ1, which was always one of its strong points. <br />
<br />
- Quests: Just as blah, blah, blah as every other MMORPG. 95% are delivery based or &quot;kill 10 of these and come back&quot; based. Absolutely nothing inspiring at all and I've done hundreds of them. They get even more dull the higher you go. Obviously the imagination was running out by the lvl 20 content mark. I'm sure there are some continent discovery quests higher up that may be more interesting but I have no desire to even get that high unfortunately. <br />
<br />
- Introduction Curve: Excellent. Every MMORPG should aspire to EQ2's Isle of Refuge. It's absolute brilliance. Even if you've never played a MMORPG before EQ2 will draw you in and take you from 1-6, showing you in bite-sized chunks just what the hell is going on. I can't stress it more. Isle of Refuge is THE noob zone to copy. <br />
<br />
- Combat: It's awful. It's everything you hated about SWG. It's MMORPG-lite. It's DiabloII. Heroic Opportunities were a marketing ploy and nothing else. Encounters are so dumbed down it's not funny. Fights follow one of two routes. There are NO abilities at any stage of the game that can add anything more interesting than what I've seen already up to 25. Mobs move faster than players (The entire encounter is on you in milliseconds). Mobs all attack the person that aggroed first (which therefore has to be the tank). There are AE taunts which are too effective and simplify everything and AE nukes which are much too effective combined with AE taunts. It's just a button mashing fest. On two linked tough mobs you may want to CC but only enchanters get mez, which is on an EIGHT second recast timer and other mages get root on a TWELVE second recast timer. Combat is generally pull the lot and AE the living daylights out of it. AE nukes are limited to encounter only. Lots of abilities are limited to encounter only. Combat is incredibly fast. There is no room for strategy in EQ2. <br />
<br />
-Mechanics: Just generally the auto-attack and auto-face and button mash your timered abilities is just boring. Any special attacks you do are &quot;free&quot; and on top of your regular swings. There is nowhere near the complexity of having a special attack become one of your swings and managing endurance use and which attacks to use when like in DaoC. There are no reactive styles or style chains. Heroic Opportunities are too lengthy to go into but suffice to say that I understand exactly how they work and they are a flawed system entirely. Endurance IS Power for the melee. Your endurance bar is nowhere near as precious or as vital to manage as in DaoC. Movement has little sense of inertia. People fly around on ice skates. There is no acceleration. Power regen is the same whether you are sitting (purely cosmetic. It may as well be an emote) or standing/running about. Power and HP regen stops in combat so there is no tactical sitting out. Once your power is gone that's it unless you have a mage transfer power to you or the encounter ends. You rarely run out of power anyway, unless you end up with multiple adds that you didn't account for. Mobs move faster than players so you have to sprint to stay away. Sometimes mobs randlomly won't stop chasing you. If you accidentally aggro something then it's often better to dot them and run and let the anti-kite code kick in and break the encounter than it is to just sprint away. All abilities have recast timers. Even fairly common abilities such as root, mez, nukes, heals have recast timers which seem to serve no purpose. It's certainly not due to balancing because of the other concern which is... Variance. Damage variance is wild and unpredictable to the extreme. Stats play no function in changing it. I can hit something with my 12 second recast timer Ball of Fire for zero (resisted) or between 170-300 damage and have no control over the damage variance. Even grey mobs have massive damage variance. Orange mobs have the same. I can strip myself naked and have no stats and there is no change. Over the course of 30 second fight my main damage spell can do zero damage, or 600 damage, randomly, through no fault of my own. SoE are kidding themselves if they think they are balancing anything. Their system is so flawed it's silly. A yellow double arrow overcon mob can aggro me and I'll parry and riposte (again totally randomly and automatically) it's massive damage specials. Later on a green double arrow mob can hit me with the same specials and take 50% of my hp away. EQ2 is TOO random to the extreme. There is no room for min/maxing. <br />
<br />
Classes: Here comes the WORST part of EQ2. The game is balanced on an Archetypal level so that any group with one of each of the 4 archetypes will perform optimally. As a result there is little to no difference in any class or subclass. Casters are the worst examples. The spell lists are almost identical with most of the spells shared ones anyway. There is no flavour to each sub-class. Between 20 and 45 you may get two or even three spells that make you different from the other sub-class and maybe 6 spells that make you different from any other mage. The ones you do get are usually matched in function by other sub-classes spells and just have different animations and resist types/stat buff types. The worst case in point has to be the necromancer. There are lvl 30+ necros who's best tank pet is the generic summoner beetle they start getting at lvl 10 and share with the conjurors. For nukes they are using the lightning bolt line all mages get at level 3. There is SO little difference between the classes and sub-classes in each archetype that I honestly couldn't tell you what I'm grouped with sometimes. I just know there is a healer type, tank, rogue and caster there. The priests are all the same too with very minor differences. The current spell lists are final and published and won't change apart from some unecessary fluff spells. As a lvl 25 wizard I've got two unique wizard spells and all the spells I'll ever have bar about 4 extra utility ones that don't look terribly insipring. Most of my spells I'll share with all the other mages anyway. A lot of abilities have very short durations and little effect so that over the course of the fast EQ2 fights they do so little that they are not even worth the casting time, let alone the power cost. The small effects get consumed by and lost within the massive variance I mentioned earlier anyway. <br />
<br />
Content: There is seemingly lots of content in EQ2 and I've only touched on some of it getting to 25. it just isn't very interesting and always ends the same way, with dull generic combat. The zones are excellent but the encounters inside them are not. I've tried to do all that is possible (quests, dungeons, instanced zones etc.) on the Qeynos side and a little on the Freeport side with multiple archetypes up to mid teens and mage up to 25. Every named encounter has been fairly boring. Never once did I have to sit and think about a special encounter the way one might approach the encounters in DaoC:Trials of Atlantis. Even if I had done, the limitation on combat and class abilities and the way encounters are done means very little room for any kind of tactics or surprises whatsoever. The closest I even saw was the Maelstrom Room in Stormhold. You click a sword, the door locks and successive waves of mobs spawn. Hardly inspiring. Everything can be tackled with the good old.. Tank AE taunts, mages AE nuke, priest spam heals, rogues..erm.. do melee dps. Or if you have a chanter, let them mez as they are good against 1-3 overcon mobs. <br />
<br />
There are lots of bugs and server instability but I won't go into that because they will be fixed (hopefully, although SoE didn't manage to do it with SWG) by release. To me EQ2 seems to have been designed around a marketing model, rather than a good core combat foundation. At the end of the day you kill things. You do quests to get stuff that lets you kill things. Players make things to help players kill things. Players kill things to get higher level so they can kill more things. EQ2 doesn't have a solid &quot;killing things&quot; foundation to put all those zillions of dollars development on top of and that's where it falls flat on it's face once the eye candy wears off. <br />
<br />
EQ2 is targetted at a different audience, granted... but who? stupid people? I can't see how anyone can want to sink their time into something that does not challenge them in any way. Please DO try it because it's such a beautiful world and the experience is truly amazing. The work that the artists and designers have put in is fantastic. It's just a crying shame that SoE's phenomenal budget wasn't available to other companies that may have put it to better use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Darjeeling gives a couple of good sumarizations, that I would find hard pressed to add to.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think I will be moving to EQII.  There's something missing, and for the life of me I can't put my finger on it.  I just couldn't find myself being as emersed in the game as I am in EQI.  The eye and ear candy just wasn't enough to hold my interest.  I'll continue to move through Beta and see if it improves with level, but as it stands' I'm faithful to the original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and the Mystic pet is 45 - so I think most will find they are pretty well fleshed out in the long run.<br />

<br />
That pet sounds more like a Ward in EQLive... it can't move and just sits there and heals people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now the pet doesn't attack, you're right.  It casts beneficial spells on your group.  I'm pushing for a pet that attacks; or perhaps introducing a scaled down version of the pet in the ~30s, with the higher level pet having combat ability.  It may stay as is though, we'll see!</div></div><hr />
