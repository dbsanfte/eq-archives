<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, what is up?  I finally get some time to myself and decide to do an LDoN adventure.  I am trying to get enough points for several items, but don't always have the 90-120 min, without a break, to group and go.  At my level, 52, I only get 16-20 AP, so getting anything significant is going to take a while.<br />
<br />
Anyway,  we do a mission and I LD once and die twice.  We run out of time and fail the mission, just not enough DPS in the group, but we did have 3 healers (cleric, shammy, druid). I was not the group lead and was ignored when I argued for more DPS.  Instead, the druid informs me that &quot;she is the group lead&quot; and invites a cleric (doh).<br />
<br />
But the weird thing is that I had 3 corpses at the zone in point after the session was over, not 2 like I expected.  Does the LD generate a corpse?  This is the only explanation I can come up with, since I know for a fact, and was confirmed by my equally surprised group mates, that I only died twice.  Anyone know what the explanation for this is.  I know that in the past, if you went LD with a corpse in the dungeon and the dungeon expired you would not get your corpse.  Have they gone too far the other way?<br />
<br />
Anyway, in addition, I had gained about 11% of a level in exp during the mission (I have a % number on my UI).  However, after getting 3 96% rezzes from the cleric in the group, I ended up with only 1% net gain for the night.  ***?  Can someone please explain to me what the exp hit is when you die, and how much you should lose with a 96% rez.  Although I got 3, I did not expect to lose over 90% of the exp I had gained, and basically 10% of a level.<br />
<br />
Any insight into these two issues would be greatly appreciated.  Right now I am baffled and depressed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no clue how you could lose 10% xp after 3 96% rez's, but i'll keep an eye on LDoN/corpse/rez type dealies.<br />
<br />
I am interested if you won the adventure with such a support heavy group tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Riaz Whitepaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do know when you die you loose 10% exp not all to bad when you get a 96% rez you get like 9% of what you lost back after dieing many times my self in LDON this i have noticed as for you loosing that much exp I think that  your situation was massivly buged and you should petition something thing like that because that is not normal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's more likely that you failed to take a rez, or thought you did and fully looted a corpse therebye taking the full death penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My GL currently has a petition in from not getting a corpse back after LDing in a LDoN zone, so it isn't completely fixed.<br />
<br />
As for how much you should get back: I twobox, so I've actually had plenty of chances to watch that in action.<br />
<br />
On either of my level 54's, a clicky rez will restore all but (around) 1% of the XP lost.<br />
<br />
In other words, if my Shaman has 32% in, dies, then my Cleric clickies him, the Shaman will be back at 31%. I've had one instance when a rez brought him back to (for example) 32%, and one where I am pretty sure it took just over 1% (sending him back to 30%, for instance).<br />
<br />
In the first case, there had been a few XP gains just prior to him dying, so he may have been up a percent to begin with and I didn't see it.<br />
<br />
54 is my highest, so I don't know if that carries through in higher levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had similar happen ... I had 2 corpses in PoV, one clothed, one naked, both WERE rezzed, but only got the experience back for one of them.  However, if I've had multiple corpses and zoned or relogged between each rez, no problem at all.  Sadly, by the time I got a GM to return the experience, I got it all back and then some (even dinged), but was a nice extra 5% for 65...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, I did not miss a rez, and no, I did not loot the body of all items.  It is similar to this last case, where I had two naked bodies and one partially looted.  I simply did not get all of the exp back, acted as if I took the entire &quot;death&quot; exp hit even though I had gotten the rezzes.<br />
<br />
I have submitted a petition, will let you know what happens.</div></div><hr />
