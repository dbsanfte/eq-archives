<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>novel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did this with my necro back in the day and now doing it with the shamy. The camp can be done before 44 but it's a lot esier at 44. at 50 everything goes light blue.<br />
<br />
Location: BB Docks (bucherblock)<br />
Spell lineup: <br />
1) Slow<br />
2) gate<br />
3) root<br />
4) Nuke<br />
5) dot<br />
6) heal<br />
7) regen<br />
8) haste<br />
<br />
Mobs highst hit is 92 as far as I can tell.<br />
1% xp per kill.<br />
When killing at the docks wach out for the 2 gate gaurds. soemtimes they chace goblins and they are yellow to 44 and resist everything i trew at them.<br />
<br />
Number 8 on map refers to a lady standing by a campfire. the hut nearest to the docks has 2 mobs in there. I usualy open door. target one. root it. The second one that agros dies ebfore root brakes.<br />
<br />
If you find That you can manage to kill more. The 2 huts by number 5 have 2 more you can do. the rest of the huts are caster mobs.<br />
<br />
Loot is a few pp and a bronze/fine steel wep. You can sell to the merchent near the druid port in. <br />
<br />
This is a nice out of the way solo location that is hardly hadrly ever camped. Ejoy and be safe.<br />
<br />
Edit: couldn't figure out how to post the pic of the map in the thread so here is a link to it. http://www.bladesoftime.net/BB.JPG</div></div><hr />
