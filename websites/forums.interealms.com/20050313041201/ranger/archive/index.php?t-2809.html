<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming you mean chance to swing with your offhand, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I thought, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...you sure about that Elwin? What then does control the frequency of dual wield checks? The main hand delay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual Wield works like this<br />
<br />
Every time the delay comes around on the offhander, you make a dual wield skill check (Skill + Level) / 400.<br />
<br />
If you pass, you swing, if you fail the swing is supressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellick</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you put say a 1hs in 1 hand and a 1hb in the other I think it's pretty easy to see....slash, slash, crush, crush.....Is it even an issue post 40s? I seem to dw and dbl atk every swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, thats what I thought too, Voder. So the offhand delay DOES control frequency of dual wield attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hajime Saito</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that when it comes to DW the desparity of DEL vs both weapons will determine how often you QUAD. I could be wrong here but from what i have seen -- when using 2 lammys i tend to quad quite often and when i use a Lammy / LSoEE combo i tend to see a gap between the 2 double attacks. Granted that is a QUAD, however that to me suggests that each hand performs seperately as far as delay is concerned. Vodyr is correct in how it works tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadrien</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm i got a Bonechiller yesterday and i really see the difference...14/17 secondary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you are right, hajime...<br />
primary and offhand are checked by two entirely different delay timers.  if your two weapons have equal delays, you will see a quad as four immediately consecutive swings, but there will be a discrepancy if your weapons have different delays.<br />
can't remember the exact ratio of weapon delay to real time, but if 10dly = 1.0sec, and i'm wielding a lammy and centi LS with no haste, my swings will look like this:<br />
0 sec - i hit autoattack<br />
1.9 - swing with lammy, check for dbl atk<br />
2.7 - check for LS, if successful check for dbl atk<br />
2.8 - swing with lammy, check for dbl atk<br />
4.7 - lammy<br />
5.4 - LS<br />
<br />
you get the idea.  swings will seem close most of the time, but the checks will only actually land together every 51.3 sec.<br />
<br />
we put the faster dmg weapon in the primary because of the primary hand dmg bonus, and we put the better ratio in our offhand due to the lack thereof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK 2 further questions, assuming procing is not an issue and assuming agroing is not an issue:<br />
<br />
1)  Which weapon would you prefer in your offhand, a 9/18 or a 14/29, and why.<br />
<br />
2)  Which weapon would you prefer in your offhand, a 14/14 weapon or a 28/28 (yes I know this is an extreme example), and why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raber</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming DPS to be the only determining factor, you would want:<br />
<br />
1) the 9/18<br />
2) the 14/14<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2 in example 1) are very close tho, so if there were other stats on them that should be taken into account too.( ie +str +sta +saves, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) 9/18, because a 1 : 2 ratio is a better ratio than 1 : 2.07143<br />
2) 14/14, because either 1 : 1 ratio will do roughly the same damage on xp mobs, but the faster weapon will hit for min more often on raid-level mobs.  <br />
<br />
but you do want to consider the stats and/or effects on each =D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Kishin, but the point of my questions was to show how delay IS an important consideration for an offhand weapon.  Many people just assume that damage is, disregarding ratio and low delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, but the lack of a damage bonus per swing in the offhand is what is the deciding factor. This makes the delay 'not matter', at least as far as raw damage over time is concerned. It does matter as far proccing and aggro are concerned. A lower delay offhand will increase both over a slower one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.. not true...<br />
once you get ambi you will see that your offhand damage skyrockets. Your offhand damage can now  be nearly 30-40% of your net melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Valphoo, this is an interesting comment.  I really can't comment on the impact AA has on weapon usage simply because I haven't attained enough of them yet.  But if the offhand damage increases 30-40 percent it would seem faster weapons would benefit more by this.<br />
<br />
And Fade the lack of a bonus in offhand (excluding the AA implact) works both ways.  Faster weapons means more swings, since the dual wield and obviously double attack kick in off the offhand weapon delay, and against high AC mobs this can be very important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.. not true...  <br />
<br />
Whats not true? If you are responding to my post, I think you are incorrect. Ambidextery or not, there is no damage bonus for offhand.<br />
<br />
offhand damage increases 30-40 percent it would seem faster weapons would benefit more by this <br />
<br />
This may be true, but it is because of an increased chance of dual wielding, not because you get a damage bonus applied for offhand. So a low delay weapon with the same ratio as a high delay weapon would over time produce the exact same damage. The rate of offhand swings does affect proc chances and taunt, so in this regard a lower delay offhand is 'better'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, just read reply.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hmm are you saying that double attack chances increase due to more swings in offhand....yeah I guess that would make sense. I did not consider double attack.<br />
<br />
*after thinking*<br />
<br />
But still, you may get more chances at double attack, but the weapon you get that with ( the faster weapon ) would hit proportionally less per double attack ( the two have the same ratio, so the faster MUST be lower damage ). The slower weapon, while getting fewer chances to double attack, would do proportionally more damage when you do get a double attack with it. I bet it works out such that there is no appreciable increase done over time due to double attack effects, but I can't say for sure. Just a suspicion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fade on high AC mobs, higher damage weapons do not necessarily hit for proportionately higher damage than lower damage yet faster weapons.  But, again, I cannot say what impact AA has on all this since I don't have the experience yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm yeah if the damage done is being clipped somehow by some kind of high AC effect, then I can see what your'e saying and I think your'e right, a faster weapon would be better in that case. But actually that proves the general case that I am making. If a high damage weapon's output is being clipped by a high AC mob, then that in effect is reducing its ratio to the point where the effective ratio of the faster weapon is better. I was never questioning the case of two weapons with different ratios, the one with the better (effective) ratio is always better in terms of raw damage. My point was that there is no real difference in the amount of damage done over time by two offhand weapons that have the same (effective) ratio, with one being faster than the other, other than as I have noted in regards to taunt and procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxxius</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe guess we both in the forum at the same time.  Yes, under normal circumstances where 2 weapons have the same ratio, the delay might not factor that much to be concerned with, again disregarding procing, taunting, AA and added stat issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, yah surfin instead of working. K. I am going to reserve judgment about the AA issue, since like you I don't have any actual experience with ambi. I suspect that ambi does not make a significant difference for the delay issue, but I hope I get to find out for myself at some point :)</div></div><hr />
