<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are a TON of morons in this game.  I don't know if this is the first mmorpg most people are playing, but I am amazed at the level of noobness in this game.  A few examples for ya:<br />
<br />
Hunter loots a blue bind on pickup ring with a ton of int on it, and says 'he didnt know what that meant'.  I had told this guy not to just click yes on everything he loots a few times before this .. but what does he do? Yeah .. moron.<br />
<br />
Plooters .. they are everywhere!  Avoid pickup groups at all costs cause these guys will just loot everything as soon as it hits the ground.  Being a tailor I get the worst of it as I have to rely on group and solo drops for my skillups.  I tried explaining that looting all the wool/silk/linen whatever when you're in a group with a tailor is like stealing every tin vein you come across.  They still dont get it.<br />
<br />
While we're on the subject of mines .. you ever killed your way solo to a vein and a chest only to be jacked by a group that just runs in and trains you to boot?  I have .. morons!<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I love this game, but there is alot of learning to do for everyone.  Here are some ground rules you should follow if you are grouping with new people:<br />
<br />
1. ASK what tradeskill people are working on, then SHARE the resources.   This can go a long way to making you a bunch of friends.<br />
<br />
2. Don't just loot everything you see, some of this stuff you will NOT be able to trade once you loot it.  Pay careful attention to everything that you roll on, if the group loot option is on, even bind on pickup items will automatically go to your bags if you win the roll.<br />
<br />
3. Don't be a moron, look before you leap, and for god's sake don't be a plooter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LMAO, yep, i know what you mean about having chests/mines jacked by someone watching you clear the way.  Happened to me and since I'm on an RP server, he just RP'd a response to me yelling at him.  Everyone RP's and orc like a caveman it seems, so he says &quot;A-hole got mine.&quot; and ran away (insert name of char for a-hole, i can't remember it lol).<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I turned off general chat within 30 seconds of being in the game and haven't looked back.  :)</div></div><hr />

First day online someone was seriously asking what the cheat codes for the game where and then going off about how stupid it was that there weren't any. <br />

<br />
One reason (and this is a big one) WoW has such a large number of seemingly inexperienced MMORPG players is the Warcraft community is already huge - in the RTS side of gaming.  Naturally they were drawn to WoW if for no other reason than to actually live in the world they've played in third person for nearly a decade.<br />
<br />
To those that have played the Warcraft series, you recognize WoW as the only MMORPG with a long-lived, rich, deep story line behind it right out of the box.  I suspect some of those &quot;clueless&quot; players could run circles around some of you &quot;MMORPG experts&quot; with their knowledge of the Warcraft Universe.</div></div><hr />

It is in your best interests to share in this game, after all this is not EQ and you really dont need to rush things at all.  That named you just ganked from a group is going to respawn in 2 minutes,  the ore vein you killed someone over is spawning in a 100 other places.   A lot of these people dont even look past their own noses long enough to notice that they just killed you.<br />

I fail to see why this should give you first dibs on those drops.<br />
First aid is a very important skill for all non healing classes, it reduces downtime (by a lot) and is for some classes a life saver.<br />

Amen. No special loot for anyone I don't expect it of them and they should not expect it of me. People need cash in this game and everythign i loot i can sell at AH or vendor for cash for spell s and armor and repairs. This is not EQ..yet. There are no FILTHY rich ppl in the game yet so most of us care about our cash and drops a lot more than some care in eq now.<br />

It's physicly impossible to train people in WoW.<br />
<br />
As for the silk drops etc for tailors.  Too bad.  I'm a shaman and I still use bandages a lot.  I melee/tank stuff, and saving some mana and just using a bandage to heal myself up in a fraction of the time it takes me to regen my mana is clearly the way to go.  After turning every single piece of cloth and wool into bandages that I've been able to ever, I'm finally at 150 skill at level 26.  There's no way I'm freely giving up my share of the tradeskill drops because you think your tradeskill is more important than my tradeskill.  If you have problems with other people looting this stuff, change the looting method, or dont' group with them.  Simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">bandages is an overlooked skill by many Juujuu, very helpful.<br />

Casters in general burn their mana bar waaaay early. I flat out told one: &quot;Dude - next time you get aggro 3 seconds into the fight - I am letting you die.&quot; He learned.<br />
<br />
Paladins who never heal others in group but act like warriors.  Yo -a$$much - you have mana - use it.  The excuse: &quot;How am I supposed to tank the MOB if I am healing you?&quot; doesn't fly when I am the only one healing. (Lot of shaky Paladins on SH).<br />

Same with loot whores - oh BTW - the faster internet connection wins in that category.<br />

You forgot all the lessons learned in EQ. Don't refight the last war. Avoid the a$$hats, make friends with quality players, the n00b you help today is the person who comes out of the blue in three months to your aid.<br />

Oh and I use bandages too. (First Aid 221).  <br />

Alot of dumb people though, I have seen rogues dump their wad on a mob and then wonder why they can't lose aggro, yet they don't even use their feint skill, same as you faern, the casters that go all out and then get ass kicked.

-Allows everyone to roll on powerful items (which you set with the threshold setting)<br />

Still isn't the perfect solution since those greedy ninja speed looters will grab all the trash loot, un-named items, and items where everyone passes on.  Those items still goes to the person with the quickest right click.  Trash loot accounts for a majority of my income.<br />

There's also an expectation of common sense and courtesy.  I think the complaints are about the lack of those elements.  You don't just run up and take stuff you didn't clear to.  If you don't need items from mobs, you should offer them to the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
I do skinning and leatherworking and in crowded areas I'll sometimes have people come up to me and try to skin my kills even before I leave.  That's rude.  I skin random corpses, but only if the person who killed it has left or if the corpse is just lying there.  I'm on a pvp server, but I'm not going to duel someone everytime I want to clear to a chest or a named mob.  It's just a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Most of these people, who I expect to be younger teens, will be gone in a month after their trial runs out and the more normal MMORPG players will remain.</div></div><hr />

Actually you are wrong.<br />

During group loot everyone can loot coins and everyone can roll on items in the treshhold.<br />

<br />
I do understand thats the way its supposed to work, but I have seen plenty of cases where the mob doesn't wander back and remains agro on anything in the area. I have also seen mobs that continue to evade no matter what even after pathing back (although this I haven't seen since end of open beta thankfully). <br />
<br />
Its one of those things that isn't quite working just right at this time from my experiences.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I've seen every time.<br />
<br />
Someone will run past me with an angry mob on their tail, they're at low health, then just as I pop off an arrow (Distracting Shot, agro effect) the mob disengages and evades. My auto-shot continues to fire until I manually stop it and the mob evades all of those attacks as well. No agro what-so-ever. I've even been passed by a large horde of mobs (6 to 8) who were running back to their point of agro and I wasn't attacked. I'd have to agree that THIS type of training is pretty much a non issue in this game. <br />
<br />
However, I can agro a group that's within a short running distance from someone, drag the group over to them, begin to fight, and let some agro on the other person. THAT does work, and does happen. Though that's usually unintentional.</div></div><hr />

Nope firstaid is what keeps my shammy downtime manageable (I tend to nuke things down fast and use FA to heal) :) And anything you tag is yours so just go park in the obvious linen/wool/silk drop spots and farm away (I can tell you horde spots if u dont know). These also benefit from being perhaps the best cash drop spots in the game so far (I am 26).<br />

However other drops (including junk items, tradeskill drops, etc) are handled in a round robin way.<br />
<br />
Then I'm confused.  I have been in a few groups and we always use the same loot system.  Anyone appears to be able to loot any corpse, coins were split among the groupies, but NAMED items (stuff with stats) were rolled on.  If everyone passes on rolling, the item went to the looter.  All other trash loot went to the looter.  What loot system is that?  I thought that was group loot and the threshhold set to uncommon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Negative. Turns still happen. Can't loot every mob. It's different from round robin though because u can roll. Here try it. Go to a dungeon and start killing some mobs don't have the sparkles on them (indicates loot) yet you see groupmembers loot it. Also they loot some you can loot too. So say i kill a mob it drops dead my friend loots some linen then i loot same mob and get another few coppers and some linen also. <br />
You can't loot EVERYTHING because you will get the &quot;That would be stealing&quot; line from your character. And cash is split equally always anyway.<br />

I see that sometimes only one party member can see a piece of loot on the mob, but it is in no way an equitable spread.  <br />
<br />
Then you have round robin, which would seem to be perfect for most situations, but then a &quot;bind on pick-up&quot; item will drop and the person who needs it can't loot it.  Thresholds don't seem to affect round robin.  <br />

<br />
Then you have round robin, which would seem to be perfect for most situations, but then a &quot;bind on pick-up&quot; item will drop and the person who needs it can't loot it.  Thresholds don't seem to affect round robin.  <br />
<br />
I am starting to wish for good old EQ style pissing contests, where at least the power to award loot is in our hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set it free for all then, and explain to the group beforehand about bind-on-looting items.</div></div><hr />

There should be a NBG setting where only the people who can use it will roll on it. haven't tried it myself yet, but that's what the manual says at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/parties.html:<br />
<br />
Group Loot - When an item equal to or above the threshold (details on threshold below) is on a monster that is killed, everyone gets a pop-up box on their screen with the item and pass or roll options and a timer. Anyone who rolls, displays a number between 1 and 100, the highest roller of all those who choose to roll automatically gets the item. Anyone who waits until the timer expires automatically passes. Items below the threshold are taken care of by normal round robin rules. <br />
<br />
Need Before Greed - Same as group loot, except players who cannot use the item automatically pass.<br />
<br />
Or you can use:<br />
<br />
Master Looter - This setting allows the group leader to loot everything and allows the leader to decide if other members in the party are to get items, and what items they should get. This becomes useful when very powerful items are dropping and people can't be trusted to pass them out fairly.</div></div><hr />
