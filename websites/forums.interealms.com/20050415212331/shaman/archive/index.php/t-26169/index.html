should do PoP baking. Solo some regruas and make/Sell the buckets of crab legs. That'll get you to 288. Nice exp and great food to boot! then you could probably get the rest doing hobgoblin surprise.<br />
<br />

I soloed the Golems in thundercrest for my scrolls of wisdom and they hit pretty hard to. Honestly the thing I'd be more worried about soloing them is getting interupted while underwater. Gonna make it harder to cast and might cause problems. Yeah when you first get into the elementals they are pretty mean and scary but I went back there a few months ago and did them with a group of 5 and it was pretty easy really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as cool as soloing water is, i ALWAYS get myself killed... i have issues with underwater soloing for some what ever reason.<br />

<br />
well, things that hit for 1k+ can take down ALOT of players fast. best thing to do is just keep your distance and root-rot them for the most part.<br />
<br />
on average the mobs I melee hit for 500ish. I was able to tank trash in Sol Ro's tower when I was bazaar geared (easily). Murks in NC hit for 500..Murks in WoS give much better EXP, but run like a crack addicted bards.<br />
<br />
last night I tried soloing &quot;The Nest&quot; non-instanced version. not quite the EXP of WoS, but the drakes, in contrast to other DoN zones (and even OoW) have MUCH less HP. I can tell, because with my normal DoTs loaded on the mobs in OoW is about 3% per tick in DMG. in the Nest, its 4-5% per tick. EXP is about 5-6% AA/kill not fantastic...but safe.<br />
<br />
I'm probably gonna try to do the &quot;fallen nestlings&quot; and see if they summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I soloed the Golems in thundercrest for my scrolls of wisdom...<br />
Ut-oh. Are those needed for something?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ah, not at that point yet, so they probably wouldn't have counted anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used to love tradeskills :(<br />
<br />
I'm 220 or higher in everything, and despite all the frustration I was fairly well pleased with the accomplishment.  <br />
<br />
And I just need a Hope Stone to finish the Aid Grimel earring quest.<br />
<br />
But --<br />
<br />
I got to 255 alchemy earlier today, and started in on Benefit Awareness V potions -- which looks like it would be one of the very few genuinely useful higher end potions.<br />
<br />
But the potions do not combine into 10-packs.  They have zero charges.  They are not potion-belt equippable.  And they cannot be clicked.<br />
<br />
That is:  all this &quot;higher level&quot; tradeskill stuff has been rushed out the door all broken ...<br />
<br />
So I stopped.  I can't just trash these potions, since they might get fixed, in which case they would be good to have.  But since I can't combine them into 10-packs, I can't continue.  I don't have room to store 100 single potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But for baking ...<br />
<br />
should do PoP baking. Solo some regruas and make/Sell the buckets of crab legs. Griz is right about doing PoP, but he's got the wrong advice on which recipe.  Planar fruit pies.  Any level 45+ foragebot can get you multiple stacks of planar fruit.  That's the recipe that will get you to 288.<br />
<br />
then you could probably get the rest doing hobgoblin surprise.And hobgoblins are very easy to solo at level 70.  Easy to single pull with malos, easy to outrun the mob to the plateau where you parked dogdog, easy to slow before the mob reaches you, easy to tank once slowed.  True, you can't root them.  But they'll be even easier with leopard on dogdog.  They will die very very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I read somewhere that you have to get some kinda bottle/jar to combine with those potions to give them charges. Takes high pottery skill to make them.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing they're trying to make alchemy more like poison making, but the way they are doing it makes it extremely difficult to skill up right now. I'm hoping things will get easier once they've got all their ducks in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Regruas don't summon. only things in the zone that do are the trilouns at the zonein, the champions, and the various named.<br />
<br />
I made a ton of dough in PoWater pre omens selling ecian ice and soapstones, and keeping the crab legs for myself. You can single pull OTE's room without too much trouble, you just need to be careful. Don't try to gimp them using mana free root, your 1.8 sec greater immobilize owns here. Don't forget putrid decay, it's an extra -55 poison resist.<br />
<br />
Honestly, they do hit for 1k, but so does everything else most people exp on. Last time I was down there (couple months ago, late night 15 man PoWater to twink alts with EP molds) they missed a lot and hit mostly in the 300-500 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I hate all these suggestions for baking which include &quot;level blah blah forage bot.&quot; That is just not an option!</div></div><hr />

I am doing Slarg poppers to 288 or 292 what ever it trivs at. Get diamonds, blue diamonds, 2% aa a kill at 68, they cast a stupid ass druid dot, winged death, with a neg 300 MR, but it works out okay. Lots of them, maybe 10-15. Quick respanws, and I sell the poppers at 3k a stack.  Eazy lazt experience and I cover two, actually three tradeskills, baking, jc, and fetid slime for smithing temper. <br />

<br />
I did one MTP run and ain't doing another till I triv out on the Slargs.</div></div><hr />

Now the poppers sound interesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Consider him an extension of yourself.  You have two legs, two arms, one pet dog, and some other wierd looking appendage that somehow produces fruit while you sleep at a rate that might be alarming if you looked closely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Seriously the poppers to 282 are not bad. The parts, tail, eyestalk, and legs, do not stack so carry a collapsable spit with you, only works in collapsable and PoK oven. In a couple hous I'll get almost 2 aa, usually 2-3k worth of gems, which I use also, a couple EPs for lower lvl friends, a slarg spear worth I think 800 tribute, pages for the cloak of wisdom quest, and will have been dotted 80 or 90 times. <br />
<br />
The poppers do not sell fast, but they are needed in Bristlebanes platter, and are just nice food.<br />
<br />
 You of course need Habenero peppers foraged from PoK, but those go for about 1 plat each in bazaar, are always pn PoK vendors, and if you /ooc in PoK will usually get you a stack or two. <br />
<br />
Or you could make a ranger, luckily my first character ever was a ranger.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I hate EQ tradeskills.<br />
<br />
It just seems like such an endless timesink... so much clicking (even with the improved interface - which was a big improvement)... and very little reward.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the WoW system a lot.    However, I think it's TOO easy to progress in WoW.   <br />
<br />
So ideally for me... I'd like to see something between the two.   More like WoW, but just a slightly higher learning curve near the end.<br />
<br />
I did the 8th shawl on one of my characters... it wasn't fun for me.   I didn't feel I had somehow earned it more because I had the money to pour into tradeskills.     I refused to do the Earring quest even though I have money, time, and the flags to do it.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's the great thing about these games... choice.  For those who feel it's worth it... more power to you... I have never found tradeskills in EQ fun.    I find them very enjoyable in WoW... but everyone and their grandmother maxes the skills and there's a lack of worthy sellable items... which is why I say... harder than WoW... Easier than EQ would be my ideal system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thing with tradeskills, like most stuff in EQ is not to make it work, or if you do make it productive work. Like the Slarg camp for me, I still get exp, I get drops for three TS so I get a lot out of it. Same with Hobgoblins, gems, essence for poisonmaking, and parts, When I did brownies for parts, I did the ones in Lfay with the spiderlings. Got a stack of parts and 3 stacks of silk. <br />
<br />
It took me three years to finish the shawl. I wear that fooker with pride too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Do planar fruit pies (you need access to a 46+ forager for this unless you buy the fruit in the bazaar) to 282, then swamp rat cruchies or tormentor stir fry (both mobs you should be able much more easily than regrua - at least one hopes so ;) ) to 295. If the fruit pies are not feasible because of the foraging requirement, you can try the slargilug recipes. They triv at 282 as well, the slargs are soloable so that should be fine. You need habenero peppers, another foraged item, but its a simple matter to make a low level alt specifically for that purpose these days.</div></div><hr />
