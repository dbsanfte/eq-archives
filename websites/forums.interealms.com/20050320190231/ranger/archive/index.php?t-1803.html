<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got through watching HBO Mayweather vs Castillo fight.<br />
<br />
Castillo, the reigning lightweight champ, against Mayweather who had just stepped up a wt. class and was undefeated.<br />
<br />
Set in Las Vegas, where Mayweather is from.<br />
<br />
The fight started off a close one, with Mayweather winning 4 of the first 5 rounds imo, and the oppinion of the telecasters alike. Then Castillo came on strong, dominating the fight thru the 12th round imo. It was at least a 5 pt difference, or should have been. <br />
<br />
My judgement was, Castillo by 6 pts in the end, winning the last three rounds convincingly. He dominated Mayweather completely. The ringside had him up by 5 at the end, these including George Foreman.<br />
<br />
Conclusion- Mayweather won the fight unanimously. ***???<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Now to the reason behind this post.<br />
<br />
Why don't the boxing federations just come out and admit it. They are NO MORE than entertainment JUST like the WWF. The sport is a joke. With so many bogus wins, with stupid DQs, stupid rulings, it is no wonder that people in general have stopped supporting this great sport now. <br />
<br />
I know it started years ago, people in fits over some of ALI's tactics that he got away with. Holding, rope-a-dope, etc. Then Tyson's crap, biting ears and such instead of fighting like a pro. And with so many bad calls, bad referring, and the money exchanged, not to mention Don King's antics, I am utterly amazed that they can make any money at all off of serious sports fans.<br />
<br />
Pay per view?? lol. Right, to watch a bogus sport? <br />
<br />
Maybe once people start realizing what they are paying for, like 500 dollar tickets to watch a pre-ordained outcome fight, then maybe they will decide that the entertainment they are receiving just isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
I mean to me, if a TRUELY gifted athlete makes lots of money, doin what he can do, in a legitimate sport, okay. But when an undereducated guy who's only gift is his body, becomes part of a prewritten script like a talk show, then why is he worth all that money?? I mean, heck, alot of guys can read a script and get out there and box around some, and do it for alot less cash.<br />
<br />
I wish people would quit making people like Don King richer.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a big difference.  The WWF has become a fantasyland filled with cartoons of athletes, the characters and the interaction have become at least as if not  more important than the wrestling itself.  It is sports entertainment and no longer denies things are being at least patially scripted.  The corruption is part of the script.  There is no moral message scripted into the fights anymore, and morality in general has fled the squared circle of professional wrestling.<br />
<br />
Boxing is quite often truly corrupt, as it purports to be a real match-up between two fighters and occasionally the fighters takea dve or a referee or three gets paid, or sometimes just told, how to score the fight.<br />
<br />
I'd rather watch the wrestling, which I do occasionally.  I always liked cartoons.</div></div><hr />

Acrobatics is tough especially when your 6+ feet tall and weigh a chunk.<br />
<br />
its ALWAYS damn impressive watching a big guy do a flip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boxing on the other hand is corrupt.  I don't think its barbaric really though I question why any would want to pruposely spend their lives taking hits to the head.<br />
<br />
REAL boxing does take endurance, skill, quickness, strength, and tactics.  The stuff going on now though just isn't worth it.  when someone clearly outplays another in scoring points and avoids the KO himself then that guy should be rewarded.  But its seems a little to often that non-KO wins are easily corrputed to be whatever the judges want.<br />
<br />
And I agree... I like watching cartoons too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok hold up, I'm a HUGE boxing fan and I consider it my second favorite sport behind football.  <br />
<br />
1.  Boxing is politically influenced and the back benchers or the fight game will sell there mothers for a good purse bid.  However the fighters are not corrupt and are true athletes.  Do I think fights are fixed in this day and age maybe 1 out of 1000 bouts but thats about it.<br />
<br />
2. Didn't see the mayweather/Castellio fight but I know Mayweather granted an immediate re-match, as for the scoring all I know is Judging in about the hardest job going.  I've watched fights where I was looking for a particular fighter to win and for reasons I can't explain I would sit there and say he's winning the rounds why does everyone disagree.  Its worse when your considered the favorite as the challenger you know you gotta truly impress or KO if you want to take down a champion especiall a pound for pound champion.<br />
<br />
I was present at the worst decision in boxings recent times I spent a fortune and took the train from frosty canada to go see Lennox lewis fight Evander holyfield at the Gardens, I will tell you that the decison rocked my world but watching that sporting event live was easily the greatest single sporting event I've ever been to nothing and i mean nothing matches the excitement of an Undisputed heavey title bout.  I've seen many big events live and nothing even comes close.<br />
<br />
3. Barbaric my ass, Boxing is filled with skill and atheltisicm I would argue that boxers are some of the greatest athletes in all of sport, there Conditioning, strength, stamina, quickness and intelligence and more importantly endurance are all tested to the max.   It is not Ultimate fighting its a sport with skill vs skill with rules to protect the boxers.  Its pure magic watching a boxing lesson going on in the ring.<br />
<br />
All I can say is boxing has a bad rap and unless you understand the sport I would just hope people don't judge it cause of the nature of the competition.   The business of boxing sucks but the sport itself is magical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect here. Mayweather's people told Castillo that they MIGHT give a rematch. Mayweather was asked this on camera, and did not give any direct answer at all, he only said he would look to the next challenge.<br />
<br />
Judging is a hard thing to do, but I don't care if you know little to nothing about boxing, some fights are just easy to call, and this was one that should have been easy enough to call in the favor of Castillo. It was a pretty decent fight, but Castillo was always the agressive one, and he only took a few pop shots the whole fight by Mayweather. Castillo led every statisitic, exept for jabs which was almost a tie, and this fight was not a jabbing fight, it was an inside brawl. <br />
<br />
Second, Castillo had one point deducted and I believe Mayweather had two.<br />
<br />
Sometimes judges have a hard time because of no activity, or a fighter comes on strong at the end of rounds, etc. But this fight was not the case. Mayweather did nothing but hold, forearm, and take very few pop shots the whole way. Where normal lightweight fights have alot of punches, this one was about half the normal. This was a heavier hitting fight, few jabs.<br />
<br />
I agree with most here, prof. boxing is very corrupt. The boxers may be honestly fighting sometimes, but somewhere, the fights, at least the title ones, are rigged somewhere, somehow.<br />
<br />
Barbaric? nah. I personally would like to see them use smaller gloves, and go back to 15 round bouts. Oh, I would also like to see less activity by the refs. Breaking fighters up every 15 seconds is not right. Let them work it out.</div></div><hr />

As for the sport being corrupt I will say that the part of boxing that is political and corrupt is how fighters attain there rankings the bouts themselves are not.</div></div><hr />
