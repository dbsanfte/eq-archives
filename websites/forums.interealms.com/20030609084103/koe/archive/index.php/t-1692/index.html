<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For me to forge small fine steel plate 2 things must happen.<br />
<br />
1: Small plate molds must be imported - Kaladim is the place to get them.<br />
<br />
MOLDS:<br />
<br />
Small plate molds must be retrieved at no small expense from Kaladim and delivered to Ssauron, or an iksar of his choosing.<br />
<br />
--&gt; NOTE: The failure rate at 190 skill (Ssauron) is still rather high, so at least 3 molds of each type desired will be needed, more of each type increases the likelyhood of you receiving a piece of that type.<br />
<br />
That's the relatively easy part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2: MQ ore must be imported from HHK Preferably, although I understand you can get it at the windmills in Ak'anon too, (Not sure but I think you can only get small bricks there, which would necessitate (sp?) several trips).   Here's the easiest way I've found to do this:<br />
<br />
MQ Folded sheets of metal:<br />
<br />
A: Caster type binds themselves at pre-chosen meeting place.  I prefer The River in Lake of Illomen, near FV Zoneline.  Said caster then makes the ardous journey to HHK and loads up to the limit on BLOCKs of Medium Quality ore (Must be BLOCK).  Said caster will be encumbered beyond movement.<br />
<br />
B: A tell is then sent to Ssaurina, Weezee's Iksar Shaman and my smithing assistant, who binds at a forge in cabilis and runs to The River to pick up the ore.  It is important to send the tell before gating back from HHK to Illomen, as you will be helplessly standing there when a_newbie_00 trains the bloodgills to the FV zone.  Best to wait until Ssaurina says she's there or almost there before gating.<br />
<br />
C: Encumbered beyond belief, Ssaurina gates to the forge.<br />
<br />
D: Ssauron gets to work at the forge, aided by Ssaurina's shammy buffs.</div></div><hr />
