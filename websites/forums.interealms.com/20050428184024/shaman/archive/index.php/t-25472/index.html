<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karedil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Blizzards Euro forums are down at the moment so I thought I'd chance my arm here. I've been downloading the beta client since the 9th and was expecting it to finish last night but it has got stuck at 83%.<br />
<br />
The bar has stopped at 2052MB but the amount downloaded says 2600MB. There were some posts on the Euro forums along this line but as the forums are now down I thought I'd see if anyone here could help. Anyone know anything about how to resolve this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Stop it and restart it, I had this several time with my Euro beta download. It will resume from where it got to, so you don't have to re-download the 83% you already have :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im sorry bud, but we rock so no cookie for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karedil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think we are used to that by now in most other spheres of life so why shouldn't it be this one too ;) <br />
<br />
I gave up and paid for a copy of the client on DVD via Ebay..the guy offering this service has since had his account banned for 3 days by Blizzard<br />
