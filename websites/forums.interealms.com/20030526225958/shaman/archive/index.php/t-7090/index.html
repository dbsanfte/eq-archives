<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This one person on Brell.. is seen selling malo for 85k at least once a week.. she keeps buying them up just so she can do this!! Grr.. it pisses me off so freakin much.. =( I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate this ****.. sorry couldn't locate a /rant forum.. and its concerning a spell so decided to put it here ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So spread the word that it's available for cheaper.  My biggest pleasure is to watch folks like that take a massive loss when the bottom drops out from whatever they bought to resell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">unfortunatly I dont think it'd matter much.. people will pay the outrageous prices..  while poor people like me will be scrimpin and saving forever.. ugh..<br />
<br />
TBO I'd be happy to get the damn spell for 65.. 70k cause I have just that.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, drop rates on it changed not too long back.  It's coming down.  If you've made it this long without it - you can last a tad longer... keep looking and you'll find it for a bargain -- you even said this other guy buys it for cheaper ... it'll come around.<br />
<br />
Heck, if you have PoP, check around PoK, there's rumors floating around about randomly rare spells showing up on Vendors from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hhehe still only 59 so have been made to wait.. but I have heard some of the nice spells for a varity of classes have been seen on merchants (of course when i check them they have the same old crappy spells.. heeh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First copy of focus of spirit I ever saw was 2 days after Velious released on a merchant in Kael.  12pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">saw a copy of true spirit (new pet) on veeshan this weekend for 20K.  the price gouging continues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh well, I picked up malo in the bazaar on Xev for 1 k. :).<br />
The bad thing is, even if I'd put it up for sale for 50 k it would be snaped up and resold for 80k. So I guess I go kill another 2000 gnolls and write it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I know that the outrageous prices people are asking is going on I guess on most of the servers.<br />
<br />
I got lucky and got Torpor two days ago for 40K on the Rathe in the Bazaar. The last time I saw Torpor for sale in Bazaar it sold for 110K. So, I guess I got a good deal on the spell.<br />
<br />
I think what people really need to do to help curb the greed practice is to boycott the people selling the spells at high prices which will force them to lower the prices. I know this would be impossible especially with the rare spells but just thing it's on way of controlling prices. Patience sometimes has it's rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While I go and pay the higher price and have my spells w/o having to wait for the somehow mythical cartel set price.  I'll go enjoy playing a game(a little lighter in the wallet) while you sit waiting in the bazaar for your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There has been no &quot;Fix&quot;  to the drop rate of level 60 spells.  In the last month, not one copy of Malo or torpor has entered the market for sale on Xegony.  Not one.  Don't complain about the price gougers, they are only following supply/demand.   Blame VI for either the ignorance or malice they display in not correcting the drop rate problem that makes 85k a reasonable sale price for a $*&amp;^*ing spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Geez...why would they (SOE) want to fix the drop rate of a 2.5 year old spell from 3 expansions ago??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Torpor has been going for 40k to 50k for the past week on karana... seen 3 copies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have seen the same thing in CT server.  Torpor would be seen once in a blue moon in Bazaar for 80k, but has recently come down in price to 50k.  As far as Malo goes, I bought it for 4k before they even got the Bazaar working.  Today I saw 3 of the new PoP spells for sale in the Bazaar, 2 of which are quest spells, both selling for 7k, and of all things, Replenishment was being sold for 999pp.  What an idiot that person is.  You have to have PoP to even gain the lvl to scribe the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Last few weeks on Bristlebane have seen several copies of both Torpor and Malo come up for sale in bazaar.  about 30-35k for Malo, 55k-ish for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demanocus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For heavens sake DO NOT BUY PoP spells folks!!!<br />
<br />
Parchments drop. I got three this weekend and now have the Gimp AGI buff, Focus of the Soul, and True Spirit.<br />
<br />
Kill Puslings, Spiders, and Crawlers in PoD and Spiders in PoN not to mention the Maze in PoN as well. I saw a total of 19 drop this weekend of which I received 3.<br />
<br />
They are out there. Be patient and save your cash.<br />
<br />
As far as Malo, I agree with Gorm. I refuse to spend that kind of cash. Highest I ahve seen Malo on Brell now is 135k from some ass in teh Bazaar and I saw True Spirit on Saturday for 50k /boggle.<br />
<br />
I can have just as much fun without the spell thank you and no Lovista I don't waste my time in the Bazaar nor will I support the price gougers.<br />
<br />
I'll keep my 135k thank you and wait for the drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WTB 30 shaman on A ' ro to randomly kill kunark dragons.<br />
<br />
well ok .. it could happen. 30 banes and 30 pox's assuming all have the spell and land it before they die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i dont get it... torpor is way worth it... that spell is godlike... ive allways had it, since i dinged to 60 ages ago... ppl without dont know what they are missing...<br />
<br />
imo, spells &gt; items!<br />
<br />
pay it! its worth it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finally got Torpor last week in Bazaar for 40K on The Rathe. This is the first I have seen it for sale since the second week the new UI was started, It went for 110K that time. Still have not seen Malo =(  Still have only seen one parchment drop on PoD off one of  theose blue skeeters, I lost the roll.<br />

Malo , never seen ....<br />

Mala ( 60 mago spell , same effect , SAME EFFECT !!!!)  45 pp ....<br />
<br />
<br />
Malo and Mala are similar but not the same. Both unresistable, yes... but Malo lowers resists by 45 while Mala lowers resists by 35. Mala is a lot more common too, last time I checked, there were about 8 copies for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you're on Bristlebane, and you need a spell I have, I give it away. I don't believe in selling spells.. trading.. maybe.. but selling is abusing other players (strictly my opinion).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gamral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Camp protector in OS, or Guardian Wurms in SF.....or If your in the position to do it, go get RoK dragons, and get the spells you need from drops....and let the people selling them for 85K+ keep them.  I got malo from a friend, and torpor off severilous,  I honestly don't think I'd ever have either if I had to pay the prices listed here.  Good luck guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've been fortunate in getting some drops, some gifts.<br />
<br />
When I have a piece of gear I outgrow (or a duplicate spell) I look for somebody I know to give it to.  Failing that, I try to find a shaman fighting the good fight and give 'em a hand.  Only time I charge for a spell is when it's something like Jasinth, etc.  I end up with so many of those I put 'em up at 10p a pop... simply because just about everybody I ask has it, too.</div></div><hr />
