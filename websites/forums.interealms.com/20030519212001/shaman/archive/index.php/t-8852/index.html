<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow shamen brudher:)<br />
Sorry to bug you with a question, but it really makes me wonder..*g*<br />
<br />
When I reinstalled Win2k all worked fine, but now when I start it up.. it gets to the desktop, startup sound comes and all ok, but the screen just stays on my background, no task bar no nothing.<br />
<br />
Now as smart as I am i found a way if I press Ctr+alt+del then open Taskmanager and do in File / Execute and open the explorer exe from the Win2k folder it starts up and all is no problem. What went wrong, how to fix that problem?<br />
<br />
It is a fresh installed system with EQ, zone alarm and some programm's on. what could it be?<br />
<br />
Also I noticed while I start the machine up on desktop there appears a little grey square in the top left corner for like 3 seconds, then disappears and the desk won't startup as I described above...just a lil note.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and have a nice day, weeee!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh, thats a good one. Have you tried kicking it?<br />
<br />
Did it do this from the very first full boot of the new install or after you installed a program?<br />
<br />
*points at zone alarm*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">.. I think it was not immediately after I installed the zone alarm proggy, but was definitely shortly after.. as well I think to remember this problem occured befor I reinstalled the machine too:)<br />
And hey , how did you mean KICK IT IN TEH FACE, or whudd?!<br />
hehe /raWr<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">recent patches to zone alarm? try uninstalling the program and see if it responds any different<br />
<br />
I usually just kick the machine square in teh powersupply...lets him know whos boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recently had similar to this at work. Computer would boot to a blank desktop, apper to be locked etc but in fact turned out to be running fine...<br />
<br />
What is was is this: the resolution was set to higher than my monitor could display.  So the task bar and icons to the left were there but simply not displayed. moving the mouse to the edge of screen would scroll it to show the hidden objects.</div></div><hr />
