<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who's in it and what class do you play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whoah when did it open up?  OH did it open just for the FV server people(FV is the pay extra server right?) ?<br />
<br />
I posted about this before, but the only reason why I bought that damn Lords of Everquest (worst game ever) is because I figured I liked RTS games and I wanted to at least try EQII out.  I've never gotten to Beta anything yet either and I certainly dont mind letting them know if I dissagree with how the game is running :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thumbalina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It seems that a lot of people who bought Lords of EverQuest are in Beta since last week.  I got my invite last Thursday....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After you get your invite, is it a full download or do they ask for more information to send you the disc and such?<br />
<br />
Just checked my email yesterday and didnt get an invite yet... I did get the message when I tried signing up for the Open Beta &quot;What are you doing moron you are already in the Beta program because you bought our crappy game Lords of EQ&quot; (I'm paraphrasing ;) )  So it said I was in and just had to wait to be contacted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it true as I've heard that it takes up to take 100 hours of exp'ing before you get to level 15?  Sounds a little extreme, I was wondering if any other beta folk had impressions to share.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">beta has just started recently.. and im sure spell balance/class balance is higher up on their list than exp rates for the moment</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beta started in July, actually.<br />
<br />
They just added a couple waves of new people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess eq2 has a NDA doesn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh yeah mcroc I was thinking the same thing... I'm sure anyone in Beta is held to the NDA.<br />
<br />
It's still a ways off so I'm not too excited yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, the game comes with a download, not a CD sent to you. Once installed, it takes about 24 hours of patching (Im on 2.7 meg upstream, 2 meg downstream and it still took that time). <br />
<br />
Nope I did not buy LoEverquest. Just playing normal EQ on Sullon Zek. They sent out a bunch of new beta accounts this week, I belive most went to Legends accounts to be honest, at least thats what I read.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, they say on the websites that you will reach lvl 6 within 30 mins of playing the game, at least so I read, so I doubt it's horribly slow EQ, probably just like normal EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thumbalina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It took me under 8 hours to download EQ2, not sure exactly how long as I started at around 10pm and when I got up at 6am it was done and ready to go.  <br />
As for exp... well the first 5 lvls took me about 45 min to an hour to get... took another cpl hours to get to 8.. after that it gets slow due to lack of groups (at least in my opinion). I did get my mage to lvl 12 after a cpl days of playing around and checking out different things.<br />
Cant say much about the game due to NDA agreement, but I found it to be quite linear in the way the character is developed and especially in crafting aspect of it.   I guess I am going to skip this game when it comes out and hope that WoW is better suited for  me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That bad?  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thumbalina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not so much that its bad.... I really like a lot of aspects of it such as graphics for example :P    But it is not what I expected when it comes to development of the character and I tend to get bored when I get 1 spell per lvl (and its exactly the same spell as every other wizard or shaman or whatever class you play gets). I prefer to have options as to what I want to do with my character - I briefly played AC2 and SWG (dreadful game!) and I like to be able to have some input in what skills I can learn and which direction I want to take....  Hard to explain my gripes without violating the dang NDA so I hope I am making at least some sense  :)<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: my opinion of the game might be somewhat of a minority because most ppl I ran into while playing it seem to really enjoy it. I, however, got bored after 4 days of playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think I see what you are saying.  Maybe they just haven't implemented enough of the components that allow you to customize your character to be special as opposed to cookie cutter.  I know that when I was in the Horizon's beta I felt like even though you could mix and match schools, every cleric felt exactly the same, every druid felt exactly the same...  same stats, same spells, same skills.  At least in AC2 and SWG you had paths to choose to distinguish yourself from others, but you really didn't start out as a specific class if I remember correctly.  I may have that wrong though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EQ2 is cookie cutter at the beginning and as you progress you choose different paths to take. Excellent EQ2 site....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would not be saying I was in beta folks.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that the NDA includes a clause that requires the testers to keep from stating that they are EVEN in the beta.  Becareful.</div></div><hr />
