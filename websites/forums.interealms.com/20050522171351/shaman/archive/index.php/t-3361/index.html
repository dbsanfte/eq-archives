<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I REALLY, REALLY want to do some of the KATTA quests, but as a Trollie, they don't like me much.  How can I raise my faction with them?  All your imput is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Kill a LOT of vampyres<br />
<br />
2) Kill a LOT of Seru<br />
<br />
It will take several levels of killing these mobs non-stop to get non-kos. You will also be kos to the above factions (obviously) although maybe not all of Seru, depending on which mobs you whack.<br />
<br />
Don't think any of the tricks work these days (wolfform, invis-hand in, harmony, etc). But i might be wrong.<br />
<br />
Save all the fangs and ash from the vampyres, so when you get enough faction, you can hand them in for more faction. Can also farm shrieking substances for another faction quest.<br />
Moon factions are REALLY slow to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mseru   is a good place.   As an Iksar i was verry kos to the Katta people.   But after a few day    im amiable to guards and dubious to guy for EB quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CT troll here and not to discourage you or anything... but I gave up in the end.<br />
<br />
Kill vampires in Tenebros and ME will give you faction with Katta, but very small faction hits so will take forever that way. Before the caster NPC changes we farmed vampires in TM for 80h+, but I didn't even raise from scowling.<br />
<br />
Kill the Seru guards in Marus Seru - 6 very green ones for level 60 at least... if you're lucky you'll get exp on the run :) That way it wasn't too hard to get the faction up with the Katta guards (but I'm still scowling to the EB quest guy)<br />
<br />
There are several different Katta factions though, and I've yet to get my faction high enough to be able to do any turn in quests for faction. Invis turn-ins and stuff doesn't work anymore. To raise the faction with the citizens felt like it wasn't worth the time put in.<br />
<br />
Got a friend that is a Rallos Ogre shaman, and he started out non-kos to guards, so your deity will matter what faction you start with.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take a right after zone-in in Katta and run to the shorties area.  Berk Thurstone will be in his own room on the left, very easy to run past him.  He's the guy you give pyrrohitite stones too.  That quest is the one you can do with the lowest Katta faction.<br />
<br />
You can angle through the door if you're real careful and do some ducking, but bear form will also get you through.  Shrink spell doesn't work.  Just to con him, of course, you don't have to go through the door.  <br />
<br />
Stones weight 10 each, do not stack(yeesh), and are uncommon drops off of sonic wolves in tenebrous mountains.<br />
<br />
Killing them is a good thing to do while working on the skulls for the shield of bane warding quest there.<br />
<br />
Do enough of the stones and you can move on to doing the vampyre blood and ashes, and I think shrieking substances after that(which also drops from sonic wolves).<br />
<br />
Killing vampyres and seru is unbelievably time-consuming -- the guy who said do it for several levels isn't kidding. <br />
<br />
My ogre did all of the above and is well loved by validus custodus guards, but can't buy or sell, and there are still quests he can't do.  Katta faction is extremely hard to do; it makes Cabilis faction look like a joke.</div></div><hr />
