<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have bumped into several Shamans with like:<br />
<br />
Putting &quot;Joe Shmoe&quot; on Main Heal &gt;SPELL CAST&lt;<br />
Buffing &quot;Imatarget&quot; &gt;SPELL CAST&lt;<br />
<br />
And this is somehow related to their target because no one can type that fast and always spell things the same way during a mad rush. So I am guessing this is a Macro of some sort.. can someone tell me how this is done? n00bin' here</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you know how to create a hotbutton.<br />
A couple of mine are like this:<br />
<br />
/cast 1<br />
/g [ %T ] will be healed in 10 seconds (group)<br />
/1 [ %T ] will be healed in 10 seconds (raid channel)<br />
<br />
After casting slow<br />
/g &gt;&gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;&lt; has been slowed by 75%<br />
/1 &gt;&gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;&lt; has been slowed by 75%<br />
<br />
Aslo have ones for Malo/Malosini, when slow is resisted and fast heals (Chloroblast).</div></div><hr />
