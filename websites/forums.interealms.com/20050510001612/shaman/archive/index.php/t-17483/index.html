<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>burtold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at work and i searched but didnt find any answer.  Can  our pet(currently lvl55 pet) can he use a 2hs wep?  I would think it could but just wondering.  I will test it tonight but i am impatient.  Since the Greatstaff of Thunder are easy drops and so cheap, could be good pet wep if he can wield it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no. the only pets that can use a 2hs are the low level mage/necro pets(I think below lvl 20). But on the bright side, if you give one of them a crude covered great staff from AR, they hit like 60 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can give your pet a 2 hand weapon but it wont do diddly squat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I gave my level 34 pet a velium 2 hander a few weeks ago, just out of curiosity.  I got the &quot;Konaner slashes a ulthork hunter for...&quot; message, but it didn't do any more damage than a one hander, and he couldn't dual weild while he had the two hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pets who don't duel wield will equip MOST 2handed weapons. These weapons will only increase max hit damage of a pet IF the base damage of the weapon is 2x greater than the max hit of the pet.<br />
<br />
For Mage pets, this is only convienient up until level 16 or 20. For shaman pets, I'm not sure this would ever be realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's pretty nice for low level necro pets, as well.<br />
<br />
You have to admit, it'd almost be worth the loss of a Windblade to see your pet doubling for 100...except for the fact that two rusty daggers will have him quadding for 60. :P</div></div><hr />
