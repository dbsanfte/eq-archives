<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think they snuck that into the last patch, started noticing it a few nights ago. Doh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought that was put in awhile ago.  Like months ago actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, it was done a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you mean how you can right click an item, and all gems refresh when its finished casting, it still worked for me about 2 weeks ago. I cast rage, then clicked on JB vambraces, when it was done, gems refreshed, and I know rage recast is more than the 10 sec the strength click takes...havent done it since then, got new arms, and use HoS instead of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was nerfed in the last patch. It's the biggest direct nerf ever to my play style. It practically reduced my mana regen and ability to buff and do everything as fast as i have been. <br />
People, who have not been using this, can't feel how much of a nerf this was. <br />
<br />
It's getting worse and worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know, I never realized how passively I use this (Habitually if you prefer).   Canni-dancing during a raid, pull comes in.. I now have to WAIT to cast slow/Sini till my gems refresh from canni... DANG I never realized how long it can be.   Normally I will have things slowed about the same time they get in the first hits on MA, now it is on the MA before Sini even lands :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What are you talking about with this?  Seems like all the really good stuff folks always leave out of this discussion boards.  First of course would be the affliction haste items.  I thought those only affected Dots.  Who was I to know I should have quested for that asap?<br />
Now this.  Seems like using some sort of click item you can slow faster.  Too bad shamans can wear the insta click CoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes they fixed the instaclick exploit months and months ago.<br />
<br />
It's not a nerf when they fix an exploit (just a REALLY late bug fix).<br />
<br />
I used it alot but it's no big deal it's gone... just get a summoned spell-haste ring and Blessing of Reverence! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, here is what happened:<br />
<br />
Used to, you could cast a spell, click an insta-cast item (i used sow boots) and then all the spell gems would refresh instantly and you could cast a spell.  For example, you could cast tnarg's, click your sow boots, and then cast tnarg's again without having to wait the 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
A couple months ago, they fixed it so that even if you clicked your insta-cast, the real spell that you just cast would remain greyed out for 3 seconds, as it is supposed to.  However, the other 7 spells that you cast were ungreyed and you could cast them immediately.  For example, you could cast quiescence on someone, click your boots, and then cast tnargs without having to wait the 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
In the last patch, they fixed it so that clicking an insta-cast item does not refresh the spell gems at all.  You have to wait 3 seconds to cast a spell, which is how it was intended.  It was really annoying the first day or two, but I have gotten over it already.  It really isn't that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
What kozul said about rage refreshing before it was supposed to, thanks to a clicky item, is something different.  There was a bug where if the spell you had in your #1 gem slot had a long duration, then using a clicky would make it come ungreyed before it was supposed to.  However, even though it was ungreyed, you still couldn't cast it until it refreshed.  I noticed this a lot because I always put avatar in my first gem slot.  They have fixed this, though, and the spell will remain greyed for the proper duration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, Affliction haste items were &quot;fixed&quot; to only affect dots.  With PoP, there is a new Solusek series of focus items which affect all detrimental spells (slow, malo, root, dots).  <br />

<br />
If you use Lucy to look up Affliction effects in the database, you will see a line for each one which limit them to &quot;hitpoints allowed.&quot;  This means they only affect dots.  If you look up a Solusek effect, you will see they are missing the &quot;hitpoints allowed&quot; limitation.  They affect all detrimental spells.</div></div><hr />
