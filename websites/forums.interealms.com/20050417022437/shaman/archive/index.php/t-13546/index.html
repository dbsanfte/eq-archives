Zone into Dulak and follow the wall to the right until you come to the huts with drunken / broken skulls in em.<br />
on the opposite side of the huts is a huge hall and when you follow the hall you come to a spot with some crates.<br />
That is your camp for 2 reasons.<br />
You can pull most of the huts when at camp. Invis up, open door to a hut and target a mob. Head bak to that crates and cast slow.<br />
Somehow the roaming guards will NOT aggro while you kill AND the mobs will not run.<br />
Just slow em and JBB em to death. very fast exp, at 45 i got 2 % per kill.<br />
Not to mention the really nice loot *Cash gems, mithril amus etc*<br />

PS: You also get the empty flask there which is needed for the Stoicism spell quest.</div></div><hr />
