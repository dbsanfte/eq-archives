Happy Birthday guys, sometimes I love you, sometimes you drive me nuts....you still are the best group of freaks out there to play this game with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow,<br />
<br />
That is truly awesome HermanaCruzadas...its what really makes this game special and worth playing in my opinion. I think not having a DKP system really shows your dedication to one another and I applaud you for it my friend.<br />
<br />
May there be many more years to come for you all :)<br />
<br />
Edit:note to self...proof reading is good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's DKP?<br />
<br />
Dragon Kill Points....<br />
<br />
its a system by which you gain a certain amount of credit/point at each encounter you attend......each item has a value in points and you make a bid along with anyone else in your guild for that item.<br />
<br />
Most work on the fact that who ever has more DKP's at the given time of the bid...wins the item. Although some may use seniority/attendance in the decision as well.<br />
<br />
Its a pretty fair system in most cases actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does not using a point system make the guild more &quot;family oriented&quot;?  I'm in a family oriented guild on Rodcet, we have lots of husbands/wives/family members, we don't require raid attendance and try to keep raiding at a sustainable level, but we do use a point system.<br />
<br />
We don't use DKP directly because as I understand it it's a fixed-rate system where each item is assigned a DKP value.  We use what we call ERP, Earned Raid Points, and bid them basically at auction when items drop.<br />
<br />
IMO there is no fair way to handle loot with a large guild except via some kind of point system.  We have over 100 members, no way the officers could take all the comings and goings into account and be fair to people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me it just seems kind of cold and businesslike, and reminiscent of the people who view Everquest as a job.  That's just my opinion though, and why there are lots of guilds with lots of different systems:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats!  I think guilds like that rule:)  Hope mine is still around after 5 years:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Madalton, sorry you feel you have to be mean, it was just a post for fun.  BTW everyone who plays this game should have the brains to realize one or two folks might not be super nice but that does not mean the other 150 in their guild are just as bad!</div></div><hr />

Happy Birthday GH....  Seen ya peeps running around Karana occaisionally.  Commendable accomplishment keepin a Guild that strong for so long.  Look forward to runnin into ya one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah yeah, people on karana are stupid and don't have brain. We understand your point Hermana  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
However ,no more on that ,it's futile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not quite sure how you came to that assumption, my only point is you not liking a few people in a guild of 150 should equal you hating them all is rather silly. /shrug In the end you're entitled to your opinion and I hope you feel better trying to post something not remotely near what my comment ment.  It is a nice passive/aggressive attempt to cause more slander!  :)</div></div><hr />

OK, but the decisions have to be made SOMEHOW.  And an objective points-based system is going to take some pressure off of somebody to try to have to make those decisions.<br />
<br />
I agree there are lots of guilds with lots of different systems, but you seemed to be proud of the fact that you weren't points-based, and I just see that as an indicator of how family-oriented a guild is.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't the original poster, though I tend to agree the OP should be proud of not being point based.  I have no idea what the OP's guild does, but we still roll for drops among the people who attended that particular raid - therefore no one has to make any decisions.   Cash drops go into the spell fund to buy spells we don't have, and extra copies of spells go to the spell mule to hold til someone needs them.</div></div><hr />
