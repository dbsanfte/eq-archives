<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of starting up alchemy and after doing some research I estimate that it would cost about 9K to skill up from 21 to 180 assuming that you only needed 6 non-trivial combines on average per skill up using Ugzugs skill progression recommendations (Titans for skill ups above 103).<br />
<br />
For those who have mastered alchemy.. is this a realistic figure or is the 6 combines per skill up on average wishful thinking?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmmm.. Sounds like the 6 combines on average per skill up is indeed wishful thinking then.  According to my estimates 73-191 would cost about 8K based on the 6 combine per skill up theory.  In your case it looked like it took (on average) about 11 combines per skill up.  Thanks for feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's all dumb luck, you could get from 1-200 on 200 combines if you got really lucky.  Just decide how much PP you can afford to spend, and spend that much, then stop.  It's just like gambling, except the odds of it paying off are much worse :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarlen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spent 4k making Titan potions to go from 170 to 183 today. Maybe its just my bad luck or terrible stats../shrug<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention, I had over 40 combines before a single skill up at one point and easily went 12 to 15 combines between most skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gukaistar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Naala i almost fell off my chair when i read your prediction.  Not flaming ... more me crying.  If you do go ahead with Alchemy please post back your skill lvl when your 9k is used up.<br />
<br />
I figure from 20 - 180 cost me about 60k on Dro.  Skill ups on Alchemy are well off the mark from other trades.  /sarcasm on I think its because its such a money maker once we master it. /sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wo Wo... hold on a second... 40 attempts without a skill-up.... Good grief if that's the case then yes I can see where it would cost 10's of thousands of plat.  My estimates were based on statements made in Ugzugs guide where he mentioned it took about 12 or so combines per skill point increase.  Then he mentioned that changes were made which cut that rate in half.  That's where I came up with the 6 attempts per skill up number.  <br />
<br />
Sounds like in reality it's much higher.  I just wanted to know what I'm getting myself into.<br />

same thing happened to me yesterday sarlen.<br />
<br />
i dumped 9.6k and went from 71 to 180.. from 71 to 110 or so i did costly dex potions for my ranger friend though, if i stuck to growth potions only it would have been cheaper.. from 110 and up i went growth potions all the way.. when i hit 170 it took me over 40 combines for 1 skill up sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nytmare ..... just to be certain..... are you saying it took you 9500 pp to get to 165? If thats the case , according to my estimates , that's about 7 attempts per skill up.... not too shabby. What it looks like is once you hit a certain skill level, say 165, the number of attempts per skill up dramatically increases.  Kind of like the leveling scale, where once you hit 51 you transition from a fairly linear rate of increase to an exponential (much slower) increase rate. <br />
<br />
Or maybe you were just lucky up til 165 :)<br />

Now I remember why I was so happy to hit 180 and thought the pain would finally stop, Now I get to spend 650pp on something I cant sell to players and a vendor will only pay 9 and a half plat for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Having worked on every tradeskill, it seems like with all of them, you'll experience relatively fast skill-ups until around 130. From then on, points come a bit slower. Around 170's, a lot of the skills begin to slow down even more, but generally that's because of ingredient availability and/or price.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I went from 142 to 180 yesterday making Titans potions, and spent a little less then 4K. No clue what it cost me previously, but I did a lot of skilling making potions I might actually use  on my warrior so probably wasnt the most economical route.<br />
<br />
But I have enough DS potions, cold and fire resist, and stat potions to last me quite a while, specially since I usually forgot to use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spent 4k last week going from 165-175...roughly 1-2 skill ups per 20 combines. Had a run of 60 combines without a skill up as well. That sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Using the titan potions, for 2.5k I was able to raise my alchemy skill from 115 to 148.  This was a 33 point skill increase.  I am only a 54 lvl shaman.  Unbuffed wis maxed at 255.  I'm kinda ugly, so it cost me roughly 500p for 2 stacks each of the maliak and trifern leafs.  My skill increased about 8 each time i did the comibnes.  This was 8 skill increase for 40 combines.  8 was the average, sometimes it was higher, I think 10 was the most I got, and sometimes lower 3.  But after 200 combines I did come out close to the max for my lvl of 150.  I plan on continueing this method once I level.    Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Update:  When I say i'm ugly, I mean that i didn't use any cha buffs or gear, cha at 94.  Buffed with gear I can get it up to 225.  Just too lazy to bust it out to save a couple plat.  Also after doing this I went out and bought one of the geerlock alchemy devices.  Normally without, my success rate was about 50%.  With my success rate was about 80%, and I got my last 2 skill ups with 5 combines.  Geerlock was 200p on Rodcet Nife server.  Now maxed at 150 until I ding. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This may be apples and oranges, as I’ve yet to start on my alchemy skill, but I’ve found similarities in many of the trade skills I’ve worked on.  And the main similarity is the complete randomness of it all.  There are some general truisms, such as skill increases are faster at low skill levels and slower at high skill levels and that for skills that go to 250 the range from about 180 to about 210 are often hell levels.  But the randomness factor is HUGE.  For example: I’m working on brewing right now, which is thankfully inexpensive, and it took me just over 180 combines to go from 192 to 193.  But I hit 194 and 195 within two combines of each other.  I know you can average all the numbers together, but sometimes you can hit several dry spells in a row and on high plat combines it can be a killer.  So honestly I think everyone will end up with different price totals in the end and some of them are going to differ by vast amounts.</div></div><hr />

156 to 179 cost about 3k of titan potions. Was about another 1.5k to get 179 to 181 and then 181 to 191 cost about 5k (had some bad luck). Pretty much happy on 191 as I will skill up doing 200&gt; combines in normal business now.<br />

I am level 56 and I have done about 190 combines without a skillup at 155 so far... I'm thinking that is just bad luck. I have given up for a while, that sorta ticked me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Left my alchemy at 75 awhile ago, being happy with sow and IvU potions.<br />
<br />
Picked up the ol bag again today, spent 300p to get it to 102 (8 bumps in the first stack of combines had me pretty excited for a while), then it leaped up to about 100p per skillup, which seems like it'll be the case for a while, from the sounds of it.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, Kargen, did you have a geerlock or alchemy AA or anything?  I'm only lagging behind you about 20 wis - I wouldn't think it'd be 7-10kpp difference... but maybe I'm underestimating the stat impact on skill bumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Alchemy is one skill where you do NOT want to use a geerlock when attempting to skill up.  Would you rather have 100 useless titan potions or 150 useless titan potions?<br />

When I was skilling up to 180 (from 103) it cost me about 9k (give or take a few hundred pp) and I cursed every time I suceeded at making a potion.<br />

More clicking = bad.  Eventually you run out of poeple to give free titan potions to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest unless you can spare the plat and have areason to do it (my Rogue main got stuck in Sol Ro room by a bugged TL and I couldn't buy any damn gate potions bar the vendor sold one so I decided to raise the skill and be damned ) I wouldn't waste the time doing alchemy. <br />
Unless of course you are a tradeskills nut or someone that feels alchemy is essential to their shammy or guild.</div></div><hr />

As far as 100 vs 150 useless potions...why not sell them back to the vendor to recoup some of the loss? It's a 33% increase in what you recover. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">After having gotten to 130 skill several months back, I decided to improve my skill for the new illusion and gate potions.  Last week, I spent just over 4k and went from 130 to 171 in about an hour of sitting and making Titan's potions.  Last night, I made 10 gate potions with no fails, even tho they are not trivial to me, with no skill ups.  At 58, I may have reached my cap limit, not sure tho.  I don't know how much further I will take my alchemy skills at this point.  Seems to be that there is not much else left out there to do at this point.</div></div><hr />

But im lev 61 shami.  260 wis.<br />
<br />
I have never done tradeskills and fig it was about time.<br />
<br />
I literally trained on tues.  It took me about 3-4hours and id say roughly 6.5k (was less than 7k) with 135 char selling all the potions back to vendors.<br />
<br />
But i hit 180 today.<br />
<br />
I just would attempt to make the cheapest potions possible that were above my level.  taking into consideration that some potions would use the ingrediants i may have already bought.  When i got to 103 or so, i did nothing but Titans potions as they were the cheapest.  I didnt care so much about getting a potion as i did about a lev increase.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, thats what i did.  I am pretty happy i waited till i was 61 with 260 wis as that seemed to make it much easier.<br />
