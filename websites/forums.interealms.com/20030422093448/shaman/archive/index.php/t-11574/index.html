<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havegrillen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i know this probally been asked a tons of time before but ill ask again since i couldnt really find the info i was looking for, well some of it but couldnt find the situation i am in atm.<br />
<br />
atm i have a shaman lvl 57 with hole part done and the tear from PoF, but havent killed Neh since i find it extremly hard to find her up :(<br />
<br />
now my question is then is it possible to just skip neh and then max out faction to ally and then hand in tear myself with my shaman and then spawn the rak who drop the epic piece?<br />
<br />
im kinda tired of waiting on neh so im probally desperate now :P<br />
<br />
i dont know if its MQing since im the one with the tear, but im trying to skip a part of the quest since its annoying me because i cant find the npc up :/<br />
<br />
hope someone can help :)<br />
<br />
/cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes that will work.  Kinda strange that Neh isn't up, it seems I can't go into CoM without bumping into her (him, it, .. whatever)</div></div><hr />

Neh is a spawned mob.  Neh isn't ever up because the only way for Neh to be up is for someone to specificaly go to the deepest part of the zone and kill the reaver that spawns neh, and since this normally only happens when a shaman is going for their epic, chances are you wont find neh just sitting there.<br />
<br />
The reaver that neh spawns from is on a 2 hour spawn cycle i think, and unless city of mist is a highly contested zone on your server, you have a 99% chance that the neh reaver is up.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, yes you can max your faction, and skip neh, but since it takes all of 15 mins for 1 group to go and kill neh, then I highly recomend that you just go kill her.<br />
<br />
You can probably do a neh run from start to finish before you can find the wondering spirit one time, and you would have to do that 3 or 4 times to max your faction from where you are now.</div></div><hr />
