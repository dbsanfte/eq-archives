<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First time posting,, <br />
<br />
I have searched and seen several post on Exp in Katta...<br />
<br />
I am a 54 Barb Shaman, and was wondering do I really need the Katta and Asscocaited Faction?  I have the Shield of Bane Warding, and am in the process of getting the EB item now and t was thinking of killing the guards soon after.  If I kill the guards, how will that effect other areas?  I have tried to decipher the faction info but,, just dont get it..)<br />
<br />
I am ready for the great exp.. but I dont want to screw up other zones.. Dont mind losing Katta... as I dont see going there after I get the EB item.. <br />
<br />
SO.. basically asking, Should I, or Should I not kill the guards being a Barb Shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All you need to do is kill Nathyn's guards. They are the guards in the enclosed area with the sonic wolve guards in front. After killing a couple of thousand of the guards I am now max ally with Katta, the coterie and 2 seru factions. You can single pull them at 57. The normal Katta guards will never help out unless you are KoS to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soloed guards for most all of 58. I am now KoS to most of Katta. Could care less as I never do anything in that city. Already have EB item and don't want the Shield of Bane Warding.<br />
<br />
Occasionally I will need to run through that zone, but with invis and the secret teleporter in the moat, it is not an issue. <br />
<br />
You can always kill guards in Seru to get your Kata faction back if you so wished... they a bit tougher and drop more pp ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a secret teleporter in the moat?  Where at???<br />
<br />
Also, do the tougher Seru guards give better xp?  Any advice on where to hunt in Seru?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">are there any specific mobs in katta that should, or shouldn't be killed. I have heard it is great exp so I was thinking of duoing there with my war and shammy but I am not very familiar with the zone and I would rather not run into a guild leader or something that will beat me down. If anyone can give some advise on hunting in katta, or point me to where that advise is I would appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So,, I am hearing that it is ok to kill the guards here in Katta and that really no other important faction is going to be hit?<br />
<br />
I am actually only concerned with unexpected faction, like a hit in some other zone that I am unaware of.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your responses<br />
<br />
OH&gt;&gt;YEAH&gt;..  HAPPY HOLIDAYS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Teleporter- When you zone in from Twilight, hang a left and after the first (or second?) archway, jump off the path into the water. Swim towards the wall (the side you jumped from) and click on the little marking on the wall. Teleports you to the bank area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">then kill all the guards in the bank area? My war/shammy combo are 52/51 atm and heavily twinked so we kill pretty quick and the war rarely needs healing. Is Katta considered an outdoor zone?<br />
<br />
Thanks, I will try it out later when I have a bit of time, hopefully it isn't camped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually killed the guards right when you zoned into Katta from Twilight. If that was camped, the bank guards it was. I was telling you about the teleporter/invis incase you ever need to run through the zone.<br />
<br />
Aye, outdoor zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">see the posts in the hunting section, 50 to 60.<br />
<br />
Katta faction is useful for the quests (Rallic pack, Shield of Bane Warding, and the EB item).  Some tradeskillers hang out there, as well.  Other than that - no value even to the goodie goodies.<br />
<br />
killing regular Katta guards is fun.  Outdoor zone, so sow and horse work.  bank in zone (have to invis to get in there).  you can sell to vendors until you go kos, and there are vendors near by, in TS.<br />
<br />
negative faction hits for killing katta guards are for katta.  positive are for coterie and seru factions (not all seru factions)<br />
<br />
<br />
some barbs, faction worriers, stick to killing nathyn's guards.  this is fine - not as many spawns, so at 58 or 59 you will have some down time, or can kill nearby katta guards.  this gives negative faction to coterie and to nathyn and to some seru factions.  I am told it no longer gives positive to katta, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you all for your info...<br />
<br />
I will be KILLING them VERY sooooon!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are 13 guards in the &quot;Nathyns Guards Camp&quot; you will be hard pressed to make it through all of them in the 13mins it takes for them to respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nathyn' Guards<br />
<br />
+ Katta<br />
+ Coterie(Vampire's in Katta)<br />
+ 2 Seru Factions<br />
<br />
- Nathyn Illuminous<br />
<br />
I am ally to the vampires, katta and the 2 Seru factions. I get the &quot;can't possibly get better&quot; message. If you are a faction worrier, do Nathyn's Guards. The most I have ever been able to kill there solo is 8. At 60 I skipped the 2 Sonic's as they were always light blue. The regular guards were usually blue 50% of the time. The 2 sentinels are always blue at 60. I can get 1 yellow of AA here in an hour. Not the fastest there is but a great place to pick of exp at off times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to say thank you for all of your help with this, as well as the people on the chat channel. I am loving Katta right now. There are usually only a couple of people in the zone, and I have yet to see anyone killing the guards that I am after. <br />
<br />
I have been killing the guards right around where the teleporter lets you out. I can easily kill 8 of them before respawn, sometimes I grab another 2 but that puts me a bit behind, until I get a couple more levels.<br />
<br />
I really like this place, and I would have never come here if not for all the information that you guys have shared with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heya... I'm an iksar, and these bastages iz already KoS.<br />
<br />
I'm 55, no epic, no horse, mad skillz and an affinity for c3 ;).<br />
<br />
How would I go about killing in Katta?  No Shield of Band Warding yet which I might try soon, and no EB item, so should I try to up my faction by killing Seru? Or just go straight for the jugular on katta guards?  <br />
<br />
And can I kill Nathyn's Guards while being KoS to normal guards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">from what I hear, seru guards are a bit tougher so you might want to do katta for a few levels, then switch. As a side note, horse is better than c3, go get a horse.</div></div><hr />
