<br />
I thought of the timers for CanniV and MGB, but don't know where to find those types. <br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to find those types please post here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have gotten quite a few private messages about this UI...<br />
<br />
Once I am done running it thru every possible way it could cause a bug and confirm it is all working as intended, I will be more than happy to post the files.<br />
<br />
Be patient... it will be worth it.<br />
<br />
BTW, if any of you know the method to display AA timers give me a private message or public.<br />
<br />
If it's there I can find it, I just want to save the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the compliment... I have been working at making this UI shaman friendly. I still think there is more I can do, and there is one issue I am trying to work out. It's quite annoying.<br />
<br />
As far as the resolution... I am running it at 1024x768 also. Wouldn't have to change anything at all.<br />
<br />
As far as the other persons comment... yeah, I know that... just didn't worry about the small stuff. The more important parts of the UI are at the bottom fo the screen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, wheres my liddle download link at!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's my own personally UI so far.<br />
<br />
As far as the time goes I did try playing with it some and got no go. If you try and reuse the element on the AA screen it errors out that there are duplicates of it and if you delete it, it error's out that it isn't on that screen. Unless there's a label tag out there for it I don't think we're gonna be able to pull that timer out unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">http://members.optushome.com.au/qaelan/ui.jpg <br />
<br />
This is the UI that i have put together....<br />
<br />
I borrowed the spell book and group window from www.eqinterface.com (http://www.eqinterface.com) .<br />
I tried to make the inventory screen look as much like the velious one that i could, as i kept getting lost in it, and couldn't find anything. The class art picture is also the auto equip area.<br />
<br />
I have another version of the player window with AA exp showing as well. The pet health bar appears in the gap when a pet is summoned.<br />
<br />
Let me know if anyone wants the source and i will post it somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;clickables&quot; ? Wow is that window available with the standard UI or is that something you added? That alone rocks, i'd love to be able to take that stuff out of my hotkey windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm pretty sure that the 'clickable' box is a modified pet window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Otoole</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aruman,<br />
<br />
I LOVE your UI. I don't have a pet up very often but on the rare soloing occasion, I do. I have seen UIs that have the pet health in a green bar that is overlapped underneath the character's own health bar. From what I can see on your skin, that might be the only thing missing. Would you consider making a duplicate mod with the pet health option? Would be great for lower level shaman or to load in if it feels like a &quot;solo&quot; day. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and although I like the whole thing...my favorite part of your skin is the inventory screen. That thing rocks!<br />
<br />
I play in 800 x 600 mode so obviously I would have to make some alterations. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The bar that overlaps the player health bar, is another, narrower pet health bar that is placed very close to the player health bar.<br />
<br />
In the group window in my UI, the green pet health of the other group members appears in a 'combo' bar with the groupies name.<br />
<br />
Have a look at www.eqinterface.com, they should have a few player windows that you can download.<br />
<br />
edit: misread post :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the encouragement... I am trying to make this UI as Shaman friendly as I can. :) <br />
<br />
I do have the pet health bar in the player Window. It just doesn't show because I had no pet at the time of the screenshot.<br />
<br />
It is the third one down, where the gap is and the o% is showing at the percentage to the right.<br />
<br />
I'll post the Inventory mod later tonight... I know thats working ok.</div></div><hr />

Looks great !<br />
<br />
I would like to make a suggestion though about the inventory Mod.<br />
<br />
It would be usefull (IMO) to put a &quot;done&quot; key on the window. With the reduced size and having to use larger screen resolutions these days trying to manuver your mose to those little &quot;x's&quot; to close windows can be hard, esp if you are lagging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the keyboard shortcut 'I' to open and close the Inventory window. Thanks for pointing out that X though, I am going to remove it, just forgot about it.<br />
<br />
If you want a mod of it after I am done with it then I could do that easily enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously nice work. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the comments :)<br />
<br />
It will be available...<br />
<br />
I just have to figure out a few quirks that are annoying. Something in one of my windows causes a rare crash to desktop. I am tracking it down right now.<br />
<br />
When I get everything fixed I will post it all at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It looks awesome.  The clickables area is very usefull for all the freaking clicky items we gotta carry around.  The inventory window is very efficient, I'm very impressed.  The only unmentioned item so far that I feel could use a little more attention is the hotkey window.  The buttons are too big (the default sizes are to big to start with) and there is a little wasted space to the right of the hotkey set selection arrows.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, have you used the viewport settigns on this?  I haven't played with that yet and I'd be interested in seeing how it works.  I generally keep all my party, spell and hotkey banks on the left side of the screen so in laggy conditions I don't need to move the mouse far to make a timely cast or click.  Keeping all the stuff on the bottom has proven difficult when I need to loot or click on short mobs/PCs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nice... =)  Was someone correct in assuming you made the clickable box from the pet box.. or will there be a pet box as well?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Most excellent man.  I havent really had the time to mucky-muck around with the new UI, but what I have tried leaves me frustrated at how little screen real-estate I have left.  This looks great at 1024x768 and you've just saved me bucks since I dont have to get another monitor ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Wildaar's UI link..<br />
installed it today its a puzzle man eheh the curvey look is really boxes that overlap the cut outs to give it that wavey look.. All windows appear at the top of the screen in random formation and you have to put them together.  Hope you have a 2nd comp near for it makes it easier to see what goes where.  Works best in higher rez.  Gl with the UIs guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It's an obvious thread. I didn't bother posting another screenshot since its so close to the one in theis thread.<br />

Aruman has come up with a great interface that in my opinion is about as close to perfect as I have seen. It has everything you need but set in a way that doesnt interfere with your play or deluge you with a ton of usless or near usless buttons and info.</div></div><hr />

Keep up the great work .. Ill keep checking back for a newer version/ fix for the bazaar crash until then  I can use a mule to check ... heh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I think I might start from scratch and redo the UI. I will keep the look but there are two things puzzling me my current one:<br />
<br />
1. Trying to left click and hold one of the clickables objects causes CTD. Why this happens has eluded me so far. they are inventory slots.<br />
<br />
2. Loss of /bazaar use when in Trader Mode. When in default UI it works fine. When in my UI, causes a problem.<br />
<br />
I will get these problems fixed, just give me a bit of time :)</div></div><hr />
