<br />
We're all eagerly awaiting Group True South with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Also, we expect a nice indoor-usable snare, a 90% rez, and the ability to charm.  DC should be added as an AA, too.<br />
<br />
If SOE wants to go all out they can give us FD and ports, but that might be a bit over the top.</div></div><hr />

Wow, you sure hit the head of the nail on that one...  Is it just me, or have pick up groups for PoV just became horrible....  Due to sony unlocking the teir one and two zones, I have trouble finding a hard core exp group like I use too.  I took me 3 hours to find a &quot;nice&quot; exp group.  First group we had this paladin tank for us, she was a lvl 61, with NO hp's it seemed like..  I ended up tanking most of them, then I gave the whole &quot;guild needs me i gota roll&quot; speel....   Just seems like pople trying to fight in places there not rdy for....  Anyways, no big deal, just doing a little venting.</div></div><hr />
