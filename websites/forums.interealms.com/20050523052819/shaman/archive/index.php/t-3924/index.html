<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel sorta bad for the other countries... We are doing shamefully well, prolly cause our high standard of living allows our sport stars to be &quot;sponsored&quot; by the government/industries and thus live entirely to train for their sport. I am not sure of the rest of the world, but that's gotta help them be the best. <br />
<br />
Oh, I'm not trying to say that they haven't earned what they have I might add =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being lucky enough to live in the city that's hosting the games I've been to a number of events and been thoroughly entertained.<br />
<br />
I saw your boys get a one-two-three in the 4K cycling sprint at the velodrome last night. <br />
<br />
We ruled the the athletics though with 6 golds. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well i live in melbourne and i din't make it to sydney in 2000, and im not old enough to remember the 56 olympics, so i am really looking forward to 2004 for the next commonwealth games.</div></div><hr />
