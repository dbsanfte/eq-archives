Been fun being a shaman, and who knows, maybe if I play EQ2 I may see some of you on there. Also if you play FFXI look out for me as Euphem on the Valefor server.<br />
<br />
Have fun, and always remember:<br />
Turn Left</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to retirement =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">retirement is fun, then you read the crucible board and think how it might be fun to play again...and then you start playing again :/<br />
<br />
I have a few friends playing FFXI, and have been thinking of trying it out myself.  ANyone want to talk me into/out of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope you enjoy your new adventures on a brand new world.  Just don’t do something crazy like give all your items away and devolve your character.  You may well be bitten by the EQ bug again and it would be nice to be able to come back and play your old characters.<br />
<br />
I plan to quit EQ, at least for a time, when Horizons comes out next month.  The only things keeping me in Norrath are the few friends who have not quit to play Horizons.  I’m going to miss them terribly, but I’m also looking forward to playing new characters in a new world.  And as an avid crafter I’m very excited to test out what sounds to be an amazing craft system.  But I know there’s a good chance I’ll be returning some day, so unless Sony deletes my account all my characters will be awaiting my return.</div></div><hr />
