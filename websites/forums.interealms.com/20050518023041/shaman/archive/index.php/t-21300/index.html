<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That sony didnt want to trivialise old content?<br />
that was the (one of) ecxuses for not boosting shamans various powers to acceptable levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lvl 70? jesus h christ on a pogo stick.<br />
<br />
if you are going to lie at least have the foresight to lie in a way that you wont expose your own lie a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
in short, <br />
<br />
Dear sony<br />
<br />
piss off.<br />
<br />
<br />
canceling my accounts as soon as I can unload the various piles of gear and stuff I have from friends.<br />
<br />
anyone have a functional map of Skyshrine? mine seems to have broken around the time of the dx9 patch and there is somone who would love it if I turned my WDB into a WDH before I go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Arch Lich in Ssra already cons dark blue.  Of course Statue of Rallos Zek in Kael conning light blue would be funny.  Of course a single group of lvl70's wouldnt have a problem with him either.</div></div><hr />

Sorry dont really see this as an over-reaction.<br />
Sony lied (Suprise) to shaman.<br />

No need to apologize, your opinion is as valid as mine Wuflbane.<br />
<br />
I don't take the game quite as seriously as some folks here. It's 12 bucks a month to me, and 30ish a quarter for upgrades. If I stop enjoying it for what it is I will stop paying and stop playing.<br />
<br />
All the real life stuff about shaman being lied to and being useless doesn't pay the mortgage. I enjoy debating and will argue points and criticize posts I disagree with because I like to. I get enough criticizm of my own posts on here which I always enjoy reading. But I don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
That probably makes me an outcast here. haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where did Sony say any of this? Level 60 sure trivialized level 50 content didn't it? Level 65 has trivialized quite a bit of content as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whats wrong with trivializing old content?  Casual gamers wanna see part of the end game too.  Their end game will be in VT or EP while current end game will be finishing Time / GoD / Omen.  Whats the problem there?  I dont see it.  If your guild is in the EP/Time now, finish farming that crap and move on.<br />
<br />
Btw, Trak and the rest of Kunark &amp; Velious is now trivial and has been for a long time.  Is anyone complaing now?  Would you like to still be farming NToV and Trak and the end game?  In the long run, it doesnt matter if they up the max lvl.  Everyone will have their place in the game, and yours is not to keep others from progressing and seeing new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I happen to enjoy being able to go back and solo in Lower Guk and Old Sebilis. Isn't that what growing in power is all about? It is for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't see any way EQ can progress w/o raising level caps every couple of expansions. As much as grinding sucks, there is only so much you can do with AA and gear.  I think GoD should have incorprated instead of OoW. <br />
<br />
This is especially true for casters and hybrids.  Just how many 65 spells can you make available?  I thought it was totally stupid to have an upgrade to Quiessence at the same level as the spell it is upgrading.  <br />
<br />
Now I won't be surprised when I get my level 70 cold nuke for 1175/375 mana and a 15 sec cast time either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I AM NOT looking forward to the PITA to get new spells. No thanks. At least AA's are steady progress without zone flags blocking access to spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">its not just the new lvl cap, its the constant stream of bs pouring out of sony about this that and the other thing. they are releasing yet another expansion when the last 3 are still broken in one way or another, when the dx9 patch is still causing massive in game issues (who knew those stupid shadow step potions would one day have value? been stuck in a tree with a non caster alt latly?)<br />
I guess its more of the final straw type of thing for me. that and the only thing I see in the future is posted right above this one <br />
&quot;Now I won't be surprised when I get my level 70 cold nuke for 1175/375 mana and a 15 sec cast time either.&quot;<br />
<br />
cause its true. :(</div></div><hr />
