<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think that verant did a pretty good job on these casinos. While the turnout of items isn't good at all, they can keep ya busy for quite some time. I went there just to see how it was, with the thought of only spendnig 2k. Went there, bought 20 tokens, and got to work. Didn't care what I got in return, was just turning into random dealers. I ended up spending about an hour, and maybe more, at the casinos with just those 20 tokens, because I was winning a bunch of tokens back. That would have given me the impression that I was actually winning, if I didn't know what I could have won.<br />
<br />
In the end, I wound up with about 2 stacks of random food, and I only spent 2k on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent my 2k before they &quot;fixed&quot; it. I declared it dumb, and i was right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Judging by the reports that I've heard it did exactly what SOE wanted it to do; some people dumped obsene amounts of plat into them with nothing but junk food, a spec or two, and time wasted.  I've yet to hear anyone say that they recieved a Guise of the Deciever yet, which appears to be the &quot;jackpot&quot;.<br />
<br />
They need to set one up in the Bazaar and in home cities though.  I hate Shadowhaven, and wouldnt go there even if I was going to waste money on a casino</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There were 2 guises won on my server by people who I trust as &quot;honest&quot;. There was also a couple other big-ticket items like a Bard speed Lizard, a Rubi BP.<br />
<br />
I also heard the Bat-Wing thing wasnt actually true, it was a joke some Guide made on a server-board that just spread. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think its a great idea. I think it will ultimately drive prices BELOW their former level. What I hate is how people spend 2, 4 or even 10K and then WHINE cause they didnt win. Hey, I will pay 10K for a Guise, show me the merchant. <br />
<br />
I spent 4K, got the food everyone gets, and a potion with 1 cast of Harvest. Had a little fun doing it too. Hope they bring it back. <br />
<br />
BTW Thorizon, the location isnt too bad. Its RIGHT inside SH from the Bazaar Zoneline. Probably seperated to keep bazaar spam-lag seperate from casino spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I am abit disapointed by the whole event of things I cant say I think this was a bad idea at all.<br />
I went and spend 50k on it befor it was fixed, and I still had some fun doing it. <br />
I'll probably go back for my guise once some of my trader stuff get sold =)<br />
<br />
Great way of getting 'some' of the duped plat out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I think it will help the economy, at least for awhile.. but I am guessing the people who duped plat in order to sell will not be spending any there.<br />
<br />
In other words, the value of the duped plat gained by the biggest culprits such as yantis will increase, and in the end this will mean more money for the sploiters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i know of 1 guise of the deciver dropped on my server to a paladin. i think over all he spent 150k+ at the casinos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its all matter of opinion but I think the batwing story is a fake too, possibly dis-information to justify them pulling the casino's out.<br />
<br />
As other posters point out I think the casinos achieved thier purpose, to vacuum up millions of pp in duped plat in an effort to re-balance the economy.<br />
<br />
To leave them in, as they were, would end up driving the economy into the ground within a week. It only takes small ripples in cashflow to impact markets greatly, look at the NYSE for example.<br />
<br />
Although it would have been a damn interesting social experiment, I would love to see it happen (but not on my server :P)<br />
<br />
Of course SOE suggest they are going to put the casino's back in after New Year, maybe to give them time to 're-assess' the state of the nation before doing more cash-vacuuming or maybe to refine the idea so its more in tune with the entire virtual economy.<br />
<br />
Time will tell, but I'll not be going near them if they come back unless they have been in play for a few weeks, and are proven to offer reasonable odds (which they do not atm, a casino in RL with those odds would go bankrupt in a week)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem with the Casino is that everytime you turned in a token, it performed a character save. So if you're turning in 20 tokens per minute, that's 20 character saves per minute. If 20 people are doing so that's 400 saves a minute. Hitting 10,000 saves per minute per server isn't out of the question, and that just hammers the hell out of the servers, causing lag and instability.</div></div><hr />
