<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at the Spirit Call IV AA when I noticed that it summons SpiritWolf242 x 5 for 60 sec. Note the x5, thats the same as Spirit Call III is. Spirit Call V only summons 6 pets. So for 2 more AA abilities (that prolly cost too much) we get 1 more pet. <br />

After seeing that I checked out Call of the Ancients AAs. I noticed that CotA I summons a WARDShamanPet2 x 1 for 300 secs, CotA II summons a WARDShamanPet3 x 1 for 300 secs, CotA III however summons the same Ward pet as CotA II.<br />

Kind of sad that they can't get even these uninteresting AAs right, its only a cut and paste job changing 1 thing. Also kind of funny considering the changes made to them today (1/31) was for spell icons NO ONE WILL EVER SEE. They aren't buffs and they aren't spells to be mem'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it might be possible(though i have my doubts) that the wolf call summons better pets.. but it does say the same pet summon at moment, but that might just be the template they used. but either way they havent got it right yet.<br />
<br />
and for the ward pet i rather have it decrease damage taken by players, bit like a guard spells.</div></div><hr />

The ward pet increases the rate of endurance regeneration. As things stand the endurance pool is sort of ok but its slow rate of regeneration limits the things you can do using it. When the melee markII changes make their way into live EQ (the openings were dropped but the spells are still on lucy, suggesting that they are thinking of other ways of using them) the current rate of endurance regen will be totally inadequate for most of the new abilities to be used in sustained combat. The ward pet in it's current incarnation was probably intended to address this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it wont be a &quot;pet type&quot; but it will act like a pet  its a ward that plays a bard song ENDUR regen spell for a duration  the range is ****tty on it  ... i probly wont be buying it till way later on<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  lucy just lists the changes (if its a buff no matter what it is) it will have a spell gem icon i think everything has a gem icon if not mistaken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your right it has a effect gem, but like a bard one so not in main buff slots, but the bard window<br />
<br />
and i just hope that it does become more useful:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will say this about the ward vs spirit call. If any groupmember asks me to use the ward over my pet..they can /rude themselves. I'm all for using it during raids tho and it's the best time for it, I think since almost NO one uses their pets in raids, except for the rare SC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm. They fixed Ward &quot;pet&quot; progression and took Bara Cudar's idea about summoning a more powerful pet for SC4&amp;5. You think they actually read this thread? <br />
<br />
.....Naw. The code monkeys got lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure if it's coded now that you can see, but the Call of the Ancients AA has 5 ranks, and each successive one increases the time (and I think power) of the now HP regen.  yeah, it used to be an endurance regen, but while I was talking to the AA developer last night, he stated that an Endurance regen is kinda pointless and the shaman one was changed to match that of the Cleric/Druid one.  So, I think at the fifth rank, we get to summon a ward is like a 78 hps regen for X amount of min (i don't know how long right now).<br />
<br />
And, the 5th rank of Spirit Call (well, 2nd rank of GoD SC) summons three shaman pets that are a darker version of our other ones that hit upwards of 95 and MIGHT proc a lure fire type spell (can't confirm this at this time).</div></div><hr />

Ouch that is totally bogus.  They are giving us nothing new this expansion.  None of our AA are shaman only and none of our new spells at this time are absolute improvements except the Ancient Cannibilize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not complaining.  We get what amounts to a better pet (only for a min, but it's at least a start), a new ability to avoid getting smeared (SCS), a new hp regen (think of how extra it will help for soloing power), little bit stronger nuke crit potential, and crit dots.  I would have liked to have a unique AA to our own, but hey, at least we are getting some good ones.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully, that won't be an issue.<br />
<br />
Going to the Lucy history page for Call of the Ancients I shows the following changes:<br />
<br />
02-04 04:18 Changed Extra from WARDShamanPet2 to WARDShamanPet1 <br />
02-04 04:18 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet2 x 1 for 300 sec&quot; to &quot;Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet1 x 1 for 300 sec&quot; <br />
01-31 00:03 Changed SpellIcon from    to   <br />
01-13 04:19 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet2 x 1 for 10000 sec&quot; to &quot;Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet2 x 1 for 300 sec&quot; <br />
01-09 18:37 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Summon Pet: WARDShamanPet2&quot; to &quot;Summon Pets: WARDShamanPet2 x 1 for 10000 sec&quot; <br />
01-06 18:59 Initial Entry <br />
<br />
Initially, it would have been a &quot;Ward or Pet&quot; type thing, due to it saying &quot;Summon Pet&quot;; it's been changed since then to &quot;Summon Pets&quot;, which, like Spirit Call, those weapons that proc epic &quot;pets&quot; and the Wizard Xuzl AAs, should mean it will coexist with the normal pet.<br />
<br />
Still no sign of Rabid Companion and it's affects in the (updated today) strings file on Test, though - and they've changed advanced innate run speed to &quot;Swift Journey&quot; and the regen AA to &quot;Convalescence&quot;.  Spirit Speed, Spirit Shield, Consupmtion and Enhanced Rabidity are still absent.<br />
<br />
(Quick edit - sort of offtopic, but Wizards are also getting a new swarm AA, with upgrades to their pet swords. As it stands, the wizard sword AA currently tops out as 4, light blue to 65 swords for 45 seconds, compared to 9 light blue mini earth elementals for 30 seconds for Magicians. In comparison, our 5 dark blue pets for 60 seconds outranks both - it'll be interesting to see what their upgrade is like).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">stated that an Endurance regen is kinda pointless and the shaman one was changed to match that of the Cleric/Druid one<br />
<br />
Wow. So he's saying Endurance is worthless?! I find this hard to believe; or rather, it may be worthless now but once they sort out melees properly I'd think endurance will become quite important. <br />
<br />
I saw this as one thing in GoD that'd make shaman really wanted, whether in xp groups or on raids, having more endurance -&gt; more discs -&gt; more dps and better tanking. Quite sad to hear this is no longer going to be the case.<br />
<br />
Dunno how much you can say under NDA, but why would endurance regen be &quot;useless&quot;? I see this as quite a heavy blow to shaman (and melees!)<br />
<br />
the Call of the Ancients AA has 5 ranks, and each successive one increases the time (and I think power) of the now HP regen<br />
I realise lucy isn't 100% reliable and data on test will change - but currently all 5 levels are listed as 300 second duration, the only difference is in the WARDShamanPetX having different value of X (suggesting a more powerful effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes new spirit call sounds good, though does it summon dire wolve model or just dark spirit wolfs? do they hit high elvel mobs? oh someone saw the same message as this if that was so, it be great:)<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5125&amp;source=Test<br />
cept was lure of flame when he posted<br />
<br />
hope we get a new pet too.<br />
<br />
the ward you say is now a clone to the cleric and druid..hmm better than satm, but why not make it a damage decreasing thing, ward seem to me think or protective things:)<br />
<br />
 it has improved but i think they could do better still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">no, i'm saying that us having an endurance regen was kinda pointless, cause almost everything that drops in GoD now will have endurance on it, and I have personally never met a melee character that had problems with endur regen (don't get me wrong, it's prob happened, i just haven't seen it).  As such, also since they scrapped the Openings and other melee parts, this endur regen wasn't needed as much, so they changed it to match the hp regen of the clerics/druids.<br />
<br />
And Retron, pay attention to what I've said earlier.  The ward isn't a pet.  It's a bunch of words that are levitated above ground that says &quot;%t ward&quot;.  It doesn't move and will give you a hp regen now.  The regen goes in the bard slot, so there will be no complaining about now having the room for it. <br />
<br />
The wizards spirit call type spell was upgraded in the same sense that ours was.<br />
<br />
 Still no sign of Rabid Companion and it's affects in the (updated today) strings file on Test, though - and they've changed advanced innate run speed to &quot;Swift Journey&quot; and the regen AA to &quot;Convalescence&quot;. Spirit Speed, Spirit Shield, Consupmtion and Enhanced Rabidity are still absent.<br />
<br />
That's because these AAs were what was initially in the planes for shamans.  They have sense been changed.  I wouldn't expect to be seeing them anytime soon, although who knows for the next expansion (yes, the one after GoD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">though does it summon dire wolve model or just dark spirit wolfs<br />
That Dire Wolf model linked to in an earlier post was almost certainly just a really old screenshot. Certainly the last time I went to Kael, a few weeks back, the wolves I saw were the same model as the all the other wolves in Norrath. It would be a nice idea to make those new swarm wolves look different, though....<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;will we get a Dire Wolf as a pet&quot; speculation, I'd bet the answer will be no. Even Beastlord and Mage pets only hit in the 70s or low 80s tops (as far as I know), so the chances of us getting a normal pet hitting for 95 would be vanishingly small. I'd just settle for being able to use the Diamond Prism of Companionship for my spirit companion....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well um wasnt meaning getting a pet the same for a spell, just improved pet so hiting for maybe 70 3khp but hits hoigh mobs ?<br />
but made me think,  what if you made it an aa (similar amount as dc in aa and recast)  would that be better? (might need tweeking but a pet we can summon every maybe 4hrs thats like the spirit call wolf ver.2?) call it greater spirit summoning:) also as it harder for us to do dps via ou spells maybe a much better pet would be a good way to sort that? (beast get close to our dd, can we get close to thier pet? {count there mellee as our dot kinda})<br />
<br />
i know it not to everyones taste but if i got a pet that could do some really nice damage (not up to beast,mage necro, but not to far off ) i think i could live with our crapy dd:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep heh, the only spell that I think is really universally appealing in the set, and they make it the one that only a very small number can obtain.</div></div><hr />
