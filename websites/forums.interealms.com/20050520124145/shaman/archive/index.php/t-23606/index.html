<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, tonight was my guilds second Quarm attempt.  But a first for me, as I was afk during the first attempt.<br />
<br />
Well, I thought to myself, tonight I shouldn't be lazy so I went about  making sure everyone is FA'd, cured, happy.  Basically steeling myself to be all that I can be:)<br />
<br />
So, I dilligently setup hotkey set 5, with 7 /tar meleeX keys, and a 8th key with /cast FA /3 FA on meleeX so I can keep track of who's next.  As I start going through the cycles, I get 4 tells saying don't bother, and 2 tells saying &quot;I don't have the room for FA with the dots and HoTs&quot;<br />
<br />
My point:<br />
<br />
I guess its been said before, but it really sinks into a player hard, when you're doing something big with your guild, something you've worked on for a long time, to have what used to be one of your bigger assets tossed aside by the raid.<br />
<br />
I guess with whatever comes out with Oow, in whatever final form it takes, I hope that at least one of our buffs is considered &quot;invaluable&quot;.  That, when space is an issue, at least one shaman buff is the one players do not ever want to click off.<br />
<br />
That being said, I certainly didn't feel useless.  Continual cures and  keeping the real healers healed kept me quite busy and feeling useful.   Quarm being at least partially slowable feels good, and having to re-debuff him every 25% gives shaman a fairly big role.  <br />
<br />
However, I couldn't help but contrast Time to GoD. We raid often in GoD now, and the differences are glaring.  Nothing slowable, fast battles, insane dps.  I've said it before, most of you have also, but I still just can't imagine how SOE can't see how badly GoD hurt the shaman as a class.  Its in every way fundementally opposed to our strength as a class.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps in Oow they'll release the &quot;Land of No Nukes&quot; or the &quot;Zone of 'FD don't fool me boy!'&quot;  or &quot;HollowShade of No CHeal&quot;.  It would be interesting to see an entire expansion seeminly designed to take away each's classes biggest strengths.  <br />
<br />
Oh well.  Still having fun, with Time being rotated between GoD runs, and most things still being an upgrade for me, I have some to look forward to.  And I'm really looking forward to our Oow group heal/edur regen (although its an expansion too late).  <br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm in a &quot;wait and see&quot; mode concerning our buffs and dmg spells.  But from what I see so far, there isn't much thats going to redefine us so far.  I really hope that SOE does something big with our class soon, because I've been reading tons on EQ2 and it looks amazing:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quarm sucks like that. I run bare bones on him, without even any room for niceities like Spiritual Dominion and my FT5 clicky shield.<br />

I have had 4 AEs on me on quarm. Venomed Mist, Epoch Conviction, Glacier Breath, and Time warp. it sucks keeping all those slots open, but I wouldn't want to risk something like Virtue getting Overwritten simply cause it needs to force its way into a slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quarm is one of the few events where the power of a Shaman TRULY shines, IMHO. I keep 3 cures memmed, Malos, Malosinia, Mal Decay, and 2 slows. Every head I bust my ass trying to get SOME slow on him. Every AE I cure my group, cure a few chanters and clerics, cure a few tanks. <br />
<br />
I wish there were more events like Quarm in this game. I have yet to see him die (we are 0-3 right now, number 4 probably tonight). It lets me play a Shaman like a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quarm fights love shaman.<br />
Heal over time is very efficient.<br />
We can cure everything.<br />
We are needed for debuffs 4x in the same fight.<br />
<br />
For quarm, my list of buffs I keep up is:<br />
9<br />
symbol<br />
fos<br />
bss<br />
<br />
c5<br />
sd<br />
horse<br />
<br />
trib<br />
seasons<br />
gmr<br />
<br />
clicky ft8<br />
clicky 180hp<br />
clicky 45ac 15resists<br />
<br />
this leaves room for 1 heal over time, and 1 debuff<br />
I'm not meleeing, so get rid of haste.<br />
I'm not meleeing, so get rid of pred.<br />
I'm not tanking, so get rid of AC.<br />
I'm not tanking, so get rid of dshields etc.<br />
Depending how I'm feeling, I might get regen.<br />
But more or less, if it's not HPs, resists, or mana regen, you don't want it for Quarm as a shaman.<br />
<br />
cure your debuffs asap on yourself, and you don't need lots of free spots<br />
hide from AEs too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use 3 spells for Q and thats it wont give the detailes but mainly I am chaining one, major ones a cure, sometimes I use a different cure, and a heal, I ONLY use FA in trial 1 and 2. thats just me tho.</div></div><hr />

I think the best thing you can do in time, is bag trusher, if you have it, its really not needed, Quies, seemes to be good enough, from what I have seen.<br />
<br />
One day raid leader was in my group and said my only job was to Cure, well I actually have succeded with a full group both ways I tried healing and curing, I guess it just depends on what your mana pool is and how quick your reflex/ducking skills are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly there is no reason to be taking any of Quarm AEs other than one.  If you have more than two on you at any one time (epoch and time warp only) than you need to check agian at your strategies for the fight.<br />
<br />
But yes, I do agree that this is a great fight for shaman.  I use to be so valuable in that fight.  Last night was the first night that I've ever not been in the main healing group, and that was only cause I had to log off for 10 min in between phase 6 and Quarm and dind't come back till quarm was at 70%.<br />
<br />
BTW.. gratz me on Bracer of the Inferno last night.. woot.  I can finally get rid of my crappy ldon spell haste ear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know the shaman in our guild we don't bother with cure's.  We just spam heal cleric's and druids and malos/slow quarm each head.  Quarm is a race task.  You need to burn him to 50% as fast as possible.  If the majority of your tanks are still up and clerics are alive you can win it.  Because of the short term fight and how often he spams a aoe we just don't bother with cures.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't cure anything? that's crazy. Clerics/Druids and casters don't need to get hit by the AE. I'm grouped with the melees and out in the fray so I do get a lot of junk on me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We've killed Quarm a few times now. On about our third try the word was leave at least 4 buff spots open so that you can get the AoE heal even if you are Dotted. I tried that a couple of times and didn't enjoy the results, so the next time we did Quarm I thought, hmm, I wonder if any of this crap can be cured. So I loaded a bunch of cure spells since I wasn't using most of my spell slots anyways as a back up healer/slower. Actually I found that many of our cure spells cure Quarms dots. It was kinda neat since no one had ever mentioned trying it. <br />
<br />
In my humble opinion Quarm is a pretty boring mob. I wish they had done better for the final boss of Time, but hell not much I can do about it.<br />
<br />
My recommendation (if it's worth anything) is mem all yer best cures. Cure yerself first so that you stay alive to cure others.<br />
<br />
I've only done it a couple of times now so I'm still experimenting. When I find out exactly which spell cures whatever dot I will let ya know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I sent in /feedback kinda like that a while ago. I joked that they should mitigate every class's main attribute because they are too powerful. I went through a list of what they could do to each ability so the game would be more challenging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with me.  I usually park under Quarm if I am curing a melee group.  I am either curing clerics or melee; depending on the group I am in.  Also, I usually get tells from my friends for cures.  Since we have a lot of shaman that show up for quarm ( 5/6 usually ), I do not mem malos and slow to concentrate on healing and curing.<br />
<br />
My spell lineup is:<br />
<br />
1. Canni iV<br />
2. AD<br />
3. Nadox<br />
4. DA ( mainly to cure people outside my group )<br />
5. RGC<br />
6. FA ( If I am with Melee )<br />
7. DM<br />
8. BoT<br />
<br />
Quarm usually falls pretty darn fast for us now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The only thing that isn't curable is that Glacier frost.. or whatever it is.  Everything else can be cured by a shaman.<br />
<br />
Also, you can prob kill Quarm in the first 5 min if you really want to attempt to burn him down.  However, it you want to take 7 min to kill him and dodge the AEs.. seems a bit more sensible.  Quarm isn't a burndown fight, it's a controlled kill.  Hell, you really only need five clerics in the rotation and prob not even that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I always cure that damn hourglass icon with RGC on me first, then every caster in my group as fast as I can. Isn't that thing a mana drain? Mana drain = v. v. bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is a mana drain among other things.<br />
<br />
Epoc Conviction<br />
1: Decrease Spell Damage by 20%<br />
2: Decrease ATK by 280<br />
3: Increase Curse Counter by 36<br />
4: Decrease Hitpoints by 100 per tick<br />
5: Decrease Mana by 50 per tick<br />
6: Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed<br />
<br />
Also, there is a slow from the adds that Quarm spawns at various intervals if I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh yes.. that spell slow from the adds.  <br />
<br />
Pretty sure that isn't curable (correct me if I'm wrong)<br />
<br />
Was very curious about a strategy to keep those off the healers.  Kinda messes up a CH chain to have half the healers slowed hehe.</div></div><hr />

I dug this up because I was going crazy trying to remember.<br />
<br />
Quarm's adds proc the following spell (which is bad for casters too, especially healers)<br />
Time Warp<br />
1: Decrease Spell Haste by 50%.<br />
2: Decrease Attack Speed by 50%.<br />
3: Increase Disease Counter by 36.<br />
Unresistable<br />
Duration: 10 ticks<br />
Curable with Pureblood/Nadox (2 casts ) or Abolish Disease ( 1 cast )</div></div><hr />

I don't know if thats accurate.  I seem to remember casting nadox twice on my group trying to cure it off myself, and it wouldn't work.  Our main shaman also told me its uncurable.  Hmm.  I'll try it again next time:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking on lucy and allakhazam, they list it as having 36 disease counters ( not that lucy / allak is right or anything )<br />
<br />
Try using AD first.  There might be a case in which the mob is pounding on the particular melee and you get a situation like this:<br />
<br />
Melee gets hit with slow ( 36 Counters )<br />
Cure 18 PR/DR - first cast Nadox ( 18 Counters )<br />
Melee gets hit with slow ( 36 Counters again )<br />
Cure 18 PR/DR - second cast of Nadox ( 18 Counters )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Abolish disease will cure it easily in one cast.  Normally i sit there during the fight and everyone that I see get hit with it I'll cure (especailly if they are a cleric/druid)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">RGC cures epoch in 1 cast.<br />
Abolish Disease cures plagued earth in 1 cast.<br />
Our other cure hits the poison dot in 2 casts.<br />
Abolish Disease cures the time slow in 1 cast.<br />
<br />
If you don't have RGC, Abolish, and our quick 18 counter disease/poison cure memmed, you have the wrong spells memmed for the fight.<br />
All 3 of the damaging AEs have mana drain components to them.<br />
You want to cure all 3 of the AEs when you can off the casters.<br />
Only 2 of the 3 AEs have big damage per tick.  One of them is pretty crappy.<br />
The slow needs to be cured from everyone that gets hit with it.<br />
<br />
Quarm is a big 4 headed version of Cursed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/nod  I think your best bet is to use AD.  It is not the fastest method to cure the slow, but at least you will not get a race condition like I pointed out above.<br />
<br />
You will get to a point in which you kill Quarm so fast you fall down laughing, saying, &quot;that was not hard at all.&quot;  Quarm rhymes with what?  Farm.  :P<br />
<br />
As for the adds:<br />
<br />
If I recall, they are mezzable.</div></div><hr />

Gorg<br />
You've killed Quarm? lol<br />
<br />
You're gonna wanna cure people.<br />
<br />
My spells for Quarm are usually something like<br />
<br />
1)Daluda's<br />
2)Balance<br />
3)Malos<br />
4)Disinfecting Aura<br />
5)Abolish Disease<br />
6)Blood of Nadox<br />
7)Trushar<br />
8)Ancient: CP<br />
<br />
A nice thing to have is the clicky RGC range from Pyronis in PoFire. You can click it from inventory (you'd be supriased how many people don't know that). Just because your melees dont have room for FA doesn't mean we as shaman aren't needed for this stuff. We (as stated) have to Malos and Slow Quarm 4 times (every 25%). People will send you tells like &quot;Epoch&quot; &quot;cure disease pls&quot; &quot;cure slow pls&quot; &quot;poison cure please&quot; and that should keep you pretty darn busy. Also everytime I see that I resist the poison dot I pop Nadox twice for my group. Heal the MT when you aren't curing. Be casting malos when he's at 75% etc. itll land when the head drops. Just because no one has room for FA doesn't mean you're useless =). Just think of it as you're no longer keeping 1 buff on all the melee, you're keeping 3-4 debuffs off of everybody!<br />

We had 7 shaman last nite, and killed Quarm without a single death for the first time.<br />
