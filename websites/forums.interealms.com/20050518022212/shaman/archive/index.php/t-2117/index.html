<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, soon I will be able to play on 2 comps with 2 accounts<br />
I have a Shadowknight I enjoy playing, and decided it would be fun to make a shaman bot to go along with him, so that the exp goes by faster with less downtime ect ect ect...<br />
<br />
anyway I was wondering, should I be focusing my shaman bots equipment in the same route as Rokkebs (a balance of ac and wis) or for a bot is it just better to focus on wis for the mana pool?<br />
<br />
My SK an Ogre, and I think I will be making my bot shaman a Troll, just cause I've never played a troll yet :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, opinions are appreciated, as always :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well for a shaman you always wanna go AC, HP then Wis.<br />
<br />
Point being the more HP you have the more you can cannibalize and the more mana you will get.  The more AC you have the less you get hit and the more HP you have to cannibalize. Wisdom only gets ya so far.<br />
<br />
Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More AC = better, especially for a bot.  Botting is harder if the bot crumples like paper under an attack (take a resisted slow for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sgc316:  I think since he was going to have the Shaman 'botting' he didn't want to Cannidance or spend a lot of time clicking.<br />
<br />
With a SK you should be able to keep aggro no probs.  I would go mana and then Wis.  Wouldn't worry about ac/hps.  But then I wouldn't play that shaman as a main :)<br />
<br />
I haven't heard of many people making a shaman for a second account, I'm guessing druids have a better range of skills for 'botting'.  But then you have faction problems. :(<br />
<br />
I'd be interested to hear how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since my shaman is a bot, I go HP&gt;AC&gt;Wis.  Theory is that since i am not playing her full time, she is not taking the hits she would be if she was a true shaman, so i'd rather have the extra HP to canni with. <br />
<br />
In fact, her defense just maxed a couple days ago....with her at 11 AA points and level 60 :)<br />
<br />
If you consider that fact, I think i'm doing the right thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used odd formula<br />
<br />
1 wis &lt; 9HP &lt; 1ac &lt; 10HP<br />
<br />
When choosing stuffs<br />
<br />
AC is a little too abstract a number, while HP is a bit more concrete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been taking a break from the xp grinding of my main and doing some 2 boxing...<br />
<br />
I have to say what everyone already knows...and that is Shaman+melee is an awesome duo.<br />
<br />
I was going to take a monk and will at some future point but went warrior instead.  Now i don't want to start some &quot;you missed out on the finer nuances of playing a warrior by pln him!&quot; because other than push 'a' and rap on taunt/kick I don't really care about the rest...he is for my own enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Anyways with Fungi/Regrowth/Focus/Haste on slowed mobs he is a literal human blender...never needs heals and has almost hit lvl 50 in just under 3 1/2 days played.<br />
<br />
Druids might be better at pln during the early levels but once you get into the 40s I think the shaman/melee combo is lethal.</div></div><hr />
