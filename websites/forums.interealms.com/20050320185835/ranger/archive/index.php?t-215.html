He then discovered that he could not post a topic.<br />
<br />
Eventually, as he was chewing thoughtfully on a tender dorf steak, he tried logging out, logging back in, and even tried creating a new account. None of it worked.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon tried to help the poor ogre with his quandry, but unfortuneately, his efforts have yet to be successful.<br />
<br />
Numbuk wanted me (the temporarily Aetheric voice of Numbuk&amp;#153) to let you know that he has made complete copies of all his stone tablets containing 'Da Tale of Tales', and that no matter what happens, his works to this point will not be lost to posterity. Let's all send Numbuk 'Get Well' cards with little messages bugging him to get back to work on Da Tale, when he gets better.  :p</div></div><hr />

Ack, time to switch to gnome.  Too much dwarf will do that to you.  Gnome is much more tender and we have an over population of them already.</div></div><hr />
