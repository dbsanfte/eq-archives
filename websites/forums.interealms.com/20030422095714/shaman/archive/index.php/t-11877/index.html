Get one of the beefier talismans from WW for your neckslot, a Yeldema tali may harbor fond memories (I know I loved mine too), but its junk, failing that, the likes of the tracking wolf collar/10th ring collar are both great too, ribbon choakers or even just a black saph necklace are another 2 cheap yet still quite nice options.<br />
Hardened grey flesh sleeves would be an option for arms.<br />
Bracer of rotting bile or another barbed rubicite bracer would be an easy enough upgrade over the wolf callers.<br />
Personally I wouldn't bother with a valorium ring, do a shiss ring instead, or if you can stomach it, do chardok faction for the second ring, that also gives you the option of getting the swc.<br />
Heirocloak for the backslot, several expansions old and its still one of the best tradable cloaks in the game =)<br />
No idea why your wearing that belt, do it justice and stick it on a melee twink or sell it, its plat worth would do far better elsewhere.  A girdle of mithanial, oak leaf girdle or BD smithed racial belt would be better choices imho.<br />
For the shield, get an ooiv or skull marked shield, they are simply unbeatable value these days.<br />
<br />
What sort of stuff is your guild hunting now as far as raid targets go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">belt i am sellen. i got it oin SG and at the time it was better then my spider fur.  soon as i can find a girdle of mith for sale i gonna try buy it.<br />
<br />
atm guild just took down vindi for first time,  were working out of HoT should be factionless in bout a month and i get to go slaughter dragons like i so wana :)<br />
<br />
i plan get another ooiv (had 2 in the past)  only reason i stuck with this shield so long is hard beat a shield with 100hp ooiv is worth it skull marked is not imo.<br />
<br />
once the bastid in crypt drops my cloak that'll be replaced.<br />
<br />
the rest i look in to see soem prices thanks for the advice</div></div><hr />
