<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged Vnerable last night, got an entire day off tomrow for AA grinding for can5, but I have a question.<br />
<br />
After Can5, I want to go against conventional wisdom that says SCM/MGB/Whatever and just get some AA's that are FUN.<br />
<br />
I was thinking spirit call, at least one level, then try out that Virtulent Paralysis. <br />
<br />
But I wanted your opinion, which are some AA's that are just fun to have lying around?<br />
<br />
(Im 62, I raid semi-regularly, guild raids are usually two groups, so I don't relly see any pressing need for MGB, mainly I want something that will help me out in my farming ventures, to help me kill those exspensive named mobs I just can't seem to take out solo (BKD in Droga is a good for instance) just trying to farm cash for Torpor and maybe an Ornate Pattern or two)<br />
<br />
Yes I already know I should just level, but I don't want to *Pout*<br />
<br />
(No Torpor also, but Malo)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very helpfull reply Juujuu !<br />
<br />
Here's how i didnt mine obviously did the MC3/Cani5 , then i worked on MGB QB2 SCM3 ND3 PP5 RC3, im currently working on SCR/SCRM ,CA and CS but another alternate would be working on the healing aa's if your more interested in being the cleric.<br />
<br />
Heres some aa's I chose not to get, Rabid bear, pet aa's, SCF , and stat aa's (well untill I get all the ones i want) these just seem pointless to the shaman class as we arent really nukers, or a pet class /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are a heavy raiding guild so I went for:<br />
<br />
MC3/Canni 5<br />
MGB<br />
RC1<br />
SC1 (just for fun and also can help with push when needed)<br />
SCM2 (working on 3 now)<br />
<br />
I will probably go for RC2 next then start working on the extended buff duration aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After Cann5, I went scr1, 2, 3 and scrm . . then Spirit Call1 and RC1.  I enjoy both of the 2 new toys.<br />
<br />
I would strongly recommend going the scrm route next.  The path was long, and it sucked sometimes, but let me tell you . . 1800 guaranteed and sometimes 2100 hps torpors for 200 mana just plain owns . . . not to mention 2 and a half hour (forgive me if my math is off; I'm just getting up) ish focus and getting an extra 50% on some of the annoying single target buffs like Haste.  <br />
<br />
Whichever path you take, enjoy! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey, Juujuu, I have an idea - just put &quot;click search&quot; in your signature and make empty posts.<br />
<br />
I have found RC1 to be extremely valuable and it's only 2 AA.  I'm interested in upgrading to RC2 but the cost is a bit steeper, and I don't have Cann yet, so it'll have to wait.<br />
<br />
VP sounds very interesting to me for crowd control.  Trivia tidbit: apparently the knockback is really a knock in the direction you are facing, so if you put your back to the mob and use VP, you PULL the mob to you.  Handy for dewalling.  Don't know how well it works in practice.<br />
<br />
Spirit call also looks like fun, but beware the PUSH of the pets.  That many pets have a significant amount of push, and they are not controllable once summoned.  One technique is to circle-strafe while using SC so the pets come from several different directions (they get &quot;emitted&quot; one at a time).<br />
<br />
In my case, though, I have 1.5 AA's left for MC3, 5 for Cann V, and 9 for MGB before I can think of anything else :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VP indeed has that effect. I picked it pretty early for its fun factor. It has turned out to be very usefull in some situations. It can help when a mob is beeing pushed in the wrong direction, take it out of walls, take it out of melee range and much more. It is situational, but I do not regret those AA for a second. In fact, I'm pretty sure I will go to at least VP2 when I got more of the 'neccesary' AAs. I probably got it around 30ish AA or so. Needed a break from the long path to scrm (which is my second best AA after canni).<br />

PS Btw, Juujuu I agree that search is a good tool. But could you please let me know how anyone is supposed to search for AA ???? If you tell people to use search on something that search does not suport, please instruct them on how to get around the 4 letter minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree that after can5, scrm is my best aa spent for the 1800 Q if nothing else. Just for conversation sake, I did mc3/can5 then scr3 for a bit better Q, then nd3 for more can5 safety margin, and then scrm. Now working on qb2, and then scm next. Its all about the can5 and Q for me at the moment, when I finish that I will get some fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've just begun my AA journey, and only have 5 AAs atm (just started 2 days ago though), but my point of attack is going to be Regen3, Run 3, MC3, Canni, SCR 3, SCRM, then Spirit Call and Radiant Cure, 'cause I want to have some fun. :)  I think that's 44 AAs, and that gives me a large chunk of what I want for 44 AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">after canni V i did 1 level of spirit call, then i did MGB, then SCR3, SCRM, SCM3, QB2, Radiant Cure, ND 1, SCF 1, Virulent Paralysis, Healing Gift 2 and working on 3 right now., then off to max healing AA's, then maxing ND, then going to start on some other aa's . maybe CA, LR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want fun stuff; spirit call, radiant cure, and virulent paralysis should fit the bill. I got spirit call right away when PoP came out and it's pretty handy sometimes, and used to get a lot of oohs and aahs and 'am I seeing things?' People are used to it now. I dont have cannV yet, but am finishing up mental clarity now and then getting it. Then I think I'll get the next two levels of spirit call, virulent paralysis, and just about everything in archetype. Oh, yeah, gonna throw three points into metabolism sometime in there - 50% less food is good.<br />
<br />
My path was regen 3, run speed 3, spirit call 1, radiant cure 1, spell casting reinforcement 1, mental clarity 2. Have almost 4 points done for mental clarity 3, then getting CannV. Yeah, I dont grind much - too much raiding/tradeskilling/playing alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have CanV (fastest route) and 1 SCR... I'm gonna bang out 65 between raids... then finish SCR/SCRM, RC1, and QB2, and MGB... then ND3, CA, LR... then Spirit Call, Vir Paral... by then they'll have upped the level cap and I'll have to grind to 75 (or I'll have moved to WoW :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">spirit call is nice and to avoid push, right as the spell is ending strafe around the mob and place pets around the mob so the push is equaled out, ie not 3(or more) pets pushing same direction.  <br />
vp is nice to have to get an unslowed mob away from u and then have it rooted.<br />
mgb is nice on raids and really helpful on terris thule fight.<br />
<br />
nd is awesome because we all need hp and nd 1-2-3 gave me total about 250ish more hp i believe.<br />
<br />
other aa's depend on the way you play and what u want. <br />
defensive aa's like ca and lightning reflexes are NICE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">mainly raid oriented, and didn't start AA till 65.<br />
went Can5, mgb, nd3, scr3, now working on qb2 atm<br />
sprinkled RC2, VP1 and SC1 in there for the fun factor.<br />
haven't made up my mind yet for after finishing scrm and qb3, either the healing gift/adept series or ca/lr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After Cann5 I went for QB2 (to get quicker Torpor). Then did RC1 and VP1, then went for SCR and SCRM. <br />
<br />
Going to work on ND and probably SCM next here.</div></div><hr />
