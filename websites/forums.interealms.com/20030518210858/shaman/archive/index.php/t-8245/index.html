<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is this necklace I hear of for trolls?  A snare necklace, or is it the one with clinging darkness?<br />
-Bubub</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reagent symbol of Innoruuk, quest starts in Grobb from a DE woman. She sends you to her brother in the cleric guild of Neriak.<br />
<br />
Awesome little quest, I did it solo in about 3 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to clarify, it's the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk.  It's 7AC, +3 Wis, +2 Int, +15 Mana with an effect of Clinging Darkness.  I can't tell you how nice that thing is to have.  Especially when duoing with someone.  Even without the effect, it's a pretty nice neck piece.  I did it with my troll at 24...but, I was seriously buffed when I killed the halfling in Neriak, and I had help from a wizard friend with the Crusader in Steamfont.  Obviously, you will have to be an Innoruuk worshipping Shaman to use this thing.  Worth every moment of the 2 hours it took away from my experiencing to get this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DOH!  I got halfway through the quest and I look up to see....Cazic Thule...I am retarded :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't worry, I follow Cazic too and I've never missed something I can't have :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go do the CT necklace quests and get both Bubub.  MUCH evil can be accomplished with these, especially if you pair with a druid, SK, ranjah, and even filthy necros.</div></div><hr />
