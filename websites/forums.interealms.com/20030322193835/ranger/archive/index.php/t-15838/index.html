I really applaud Hoss (the local uber guild) for doing this... I'm also curious if any other servers have similar arrangements :)</div></div><hr />

That's really a cool thing... wish our server would get in on that sort of action</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We've been doing this on Cazic-Thule since the second week of PoP between a few (competing) guilds.  Basic rule is this, if a guild has completed the flag giving encounter on its own it's free to send along its members to the same encounter being done by another guild at a later point.  It's totally reciprocal and works very well.</div></div><hr />
