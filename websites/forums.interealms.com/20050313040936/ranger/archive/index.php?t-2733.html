<br />
Just to rehash, here are the components:<br />
<br />
<br />
in the Fier'Dal forge<br />
---------------------------<br />
arrow head: small brick of mithril, file, flask of water<br />
arrow shaft: large brick of mithril, arrow shaft mold, file, water<br />
<br />
In the Fier'Dal fletching kit<br />
------------------------------------<br />
fletchings: small brick of mithril, mithril working knife<br />
<br />
Combining the three mithril components with a large or medium nock was trivial at 202 fletching. Combining with a small nock was *not* trivial at 202, and resulted in one of the mithril knives used to make the fletchings. I was 0 for 22 attempts on it, burned a few hundred plat. It looks to be bugged. On success it apparently makes an equippable by none/none throwing item. Anyway, Maena at eqtraders said &lt;a href=&quot;http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfletching.showMessageRange?topicID=351.topic&amp;start=41&amp;stop=55&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;in a thread there&lt;/a&gt; that she was getting 33% success at a skill of 228. Considering every component used is bought off a vendor, once/if they get the kinks worked out, I'll be ecstatic.</div></div><hr />
