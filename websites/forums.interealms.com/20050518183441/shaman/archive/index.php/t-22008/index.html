<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was browsing the changes on Lucy and nearly every root and snare type spell in the game has had 'unknown 183' changed from whatever it was to 6.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what was changed and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suspect it has something to do with the PvP changes, but don't quote me on that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm I think I came to the conclusion unknown 183 was duration a few weeks ago but forgotten and not sure if its actually pvp only or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe you should go cast it on some mobs and find out.<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The PVP sugestion sounds like a good one since they mentioned root's would land easier but last less time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its for pvp, soon root/snare spells will have 2 durations, one for pve and one for pve</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its for pvp, soon root/snare spells will have 2 durations, one for pve and one for pve<br />
<br />
Isnt pve the same as pve though so would really only have 1 duration ?:)<br />
<br />
Sorry dont normally pick on other peoples typeos as im lousy typist myself but im bored :)<br />
<br />
