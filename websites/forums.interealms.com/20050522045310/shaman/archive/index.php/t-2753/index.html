<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Every time I ran passed, I always stop to see if he is up.  I've only caught him up 3 times, and one time I didnt have time to stop and kill him.<br />
<br />
The first time was a few months ago, I had a druid friend with me, and we barely won.  The ae seemed huge, he tore into dogdog, and it took alot of work to find a spot where I could get a neal and nuke off.  We did win however, and I got a lovely + charisma earring for my trouble :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Just killed him again last night right before I logged.  Had a 55th level chanter with me this time.  We both called up pets, I hp buffed em, she hasted, and we cleared out the camp and attacked it.<br />
<br />
The difference in the 2 fights was night and day.  I never got hit with any ae at all.  She had to run right up and melee the shrrom so that her pet could aggro from her getting hit.  Nothing ever got summoned, and the pet might could have lived from start to finsih without a heal.  I actually nuked when he got to 50 health, and it came close fo finishing him.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this has been covered, but what happened to this guy?<br />
<br />
Btw, no spell this time either.  Yay, gloves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I kill him all the time to get remove curse for guildmates.  Even sometimes do it while waiting on a rez during a raid or something, can kill him naked with the primal axe in bank hehe.  Spell has always been a raredrop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seen him up, kill his guards really quick and just want to off him, quick like, no pet or special buffs.<br />
<br />
First, he dispell all my buffs.  Oops left instaclick items with friend.  Then he dispell my torpor a bunch of times and totally own me.... oops.  <br />
<br />
The best part was walking back to my body and watching a cleric solo him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rar!<br />
<br />
(As for the shemale comment.) I only play a female in game. Why? cause three years ago I wanted to look at something cute with red hair and to me cute aint a guy. The personality has grown over time but I don't hide that I am a guy.<br />
<br />
Also just to let the narrow minded know as well. I am not a bear in real life either. And other than Wildaar None of you are trolls As for ogres ... Nope no ogres here either...(Well except maybe Mill, and Numbuk, they could be ogres IRL)<br />
<br />
Smile folks it is friday, and thier is a weekend of our hobby to enjoy!  (grins)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I didn't know you were a guy in RL Snoww.<br />
<br />
I am 100% female in RL and game...but I don't really think I would look as good in Wolfcallers in RL.  /shrug<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm Glori you should make a magelo background and use your pretty full character picture on it.  It's a great place to get to use the whole thing.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Are you fluffing your post count, Henora?  Shame!<br />
<br />
Hmmm, how I do that thing with the picture? I'm a bit magelo challenged, I just figured out BAGS for the love of god.<br />

<br />
I keeled sappy boy a couple nights ago and realized that whoa . . he's way easy now.  Even so I still had Jabober do most of the work.  He was easy.  Prolly got hit with the caster NPC nerf that happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i am not a fluffer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">click the &quot;user cp&quot; button at the top of the page<br />
<br />
then click edit profile<br />
<br />
scroll down and you can give yourself a custom title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fluffer!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Do you know how to use photoshop Glori?<br />
I can send you a template.<br />
<br />
Relv - did I see you are a ranger right?<br />
I made one for my ranger friend too.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69821<br />
<br />
I think the pose he sent me is cool.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly no artistic genius (obviously) but I really love tinkering around in photoshop, it entertains me when there are no posts to fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ohmygod, that is looks so boss.  No, I don't know to use photoshop :(  I had no idea you could do such cool things with magelo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Mmm ok, I like that theme, with the name bar and all :)  Yeah, I am a ranger.  My current one is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3690) but I'm not much of an artist at all, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">cool that looks nifty too.  :)<br />
<br />
my friend actually told me he is gonna want a nature scene background in the future hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah I just think it looks kinda odd having an EQ char against a RL background though, dunno, heh.<br />
<br />
How do you get the antialiasing around the character to go away?  When I try to do it, it either leaves a bunch I have to manually trim or cuts into the image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Gloriana!  check your PM box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I use the lasso and do it by hand in photoshop.<br />
The magic wand always leaves artifacts.<br />
<br />
I've been tinkering a while, so it doesn't take too long  :)<br />
<br />
I find one thing that makes it faster is using both a light and dark layer behind the image you are cropping out.  Then you can switch between them in one click and find the stray pixels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">uh, you guys know what a fluffer is? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I didn't know until I played Fallout 2 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">&lt;-- Not a fluffer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">From experience, no.<br />
<br />
It might be too much to swallow to say I've admired their work, but it doesn't suck as much as working at McDonalds or the like.</div></div><hr />
