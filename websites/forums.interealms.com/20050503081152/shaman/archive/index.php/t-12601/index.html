<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedHat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
I'm new to the whole Shaman scene and I just wanted to get the opinions of some of the board elders if I may.<br />
<br />
Firstly, I have about 15k to spend on twinking out a new sham. I've played a necro, and as far as equipping goes I beleive the idea is about the same (get to about 200 wis, then focus on straight HP gear and some straight mana [correct me if im wrong about this])<br />
<br />
Aside from the gear, what would be the best class to duo with from 1-50+. I was thinking the good ole' Sham+Monk team, but if there are other good options please let me know. <br />
<br />
The last question I have is about race. Is the regen bonus on a Iksar/Troll beneficial enough to offset the 20% xp penatly I'll incur?<br />
<br />
If there are other threads I should look at regarding similar questions, please point me in the right direction. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

/cheer Red Hat.<br />
<br />
Shaman + monk seems a viable option again, thankfully.  Ranger is good, and brings a much-wanted snare to the mix.<br />
<br />
If you're a Troll shaman, you don't need snare if you quest for the necklaces (one of which has clinging darkness or the like) so you can go for added offensive ability (SK) or added defensive and healing ability (Paladin).  Either takes and keeps agro well, so you can lay on more damage.<br />
<br />
Until about lev 20 I'd suggest you think of yourself as a tank with an extra arsenal of spells, and twink like that.  It's not until 20s that our melee begins to lag a bit, but it's still a viable damage option for us through the early 40s.<br />
<br />
I've heard the racial xp penalties have been lessened quite a bit -- any troll / iksar coming up through the ranks now able to confirm that?  Sounds too good to be true.<br />
<br />
Finally, gear.  As somebody who will need to withstand a few blows (and if slow doesn't stick, a few more) you'll find most of the shaman here say go for AC til you get to 1,000, HP second, Wis third.<br />
<br />
I had a wisdom somewhere around 160s til I was lev 58 -- but then PoP came out and +wis items began having decent secondary stats, too.<br />
<br />
Since our wisdom determines the beginning size of our mana pool, it's good to have stuff that can bump it up for doing things like raid buffs, running around town randomly focusing folks you know, and the like.  It just means we can go longer before having to cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Once we're in battle, however, AC arguably means we'll be hit less, but HP means we'll both survive longer and have a larger capacity to refill our mana pool and get off that much-needed heal.  Get into the habit of keeping yourself as fom as possible and let regen work for you (as a necro, this should be 2nd nature by now!).  Even with a lower mana pool, if you're routinely fom or near it you can do things that surprise the heck out of the folks who are stuck medding for mana.<br />
<br />
I ended up balancing the stats, and seem to be doing OK.  Not uber, but</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedHat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forgive me for this probably very newb question, but why is snare so important? Just for when root wears off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For when root wears off, aye. And remember, in combination with SoW, your DoTs are are a deadly thing, as kiting insures a low death rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't really ever done the shammy monk thing.<br />
<br />
I did the shammy Ranja duo from lvl 13 to lvl 40 And we were an awesome team! We leveled waaay to fast :lol<br />
<br />
Next I did the shammy Necro team ( the ranja buddy  made a necro eheheh)<br />
Also a great combo I simply prefer the ranja team because i'm more active in the battles.<br />
<br />
The most recent duo i'm in love with is actually Shammy and Beastlord.  WE both can cause the hurt with spells, he has a flippin' pitbull of a pet cobine my buffs with his buffs and its like wowza  SUPER SHAMAN! :lol <br />
Never go OOm never have to stop pulling. . .  the bsty juice with the kei is real slick. . hmmm his pet keeps aggro like no tomarrow. . . Basically great.  Can't get much more technicall cause i'm more of i play and do and don't know the technicalities of how and why its better just that I find it to be so.<br />
<br />
Also currently i'm upping my DEF and find Dr00d and shammy a good team just let him make you into his pet kinda lol and your able to up all your melee stats real nice like :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have great hatred of things that are dead (but just don't know it yet) trudging off and notifying their next of kin.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's their kinfolk I hate, come to think of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kanala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman + monk seems a viable option again, thankfully.  <br />
<br />
Really?  So maybe Lighteagle (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=393912)  will be able to find a group again! :)<br />
<br />
Even though,  as long as I stayed away from PoP,  I could still keep him alive, as long as Slow landed pretty quick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Darn straight, kitty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Snare is also better than root because the mob still fights back when rooted.  Dogdog gets free hits and you get free DOT damage when it's &quot;fleeing&quot; while snared.<br />
<br />
Some good items that are pretty cheap these days - a mishmash of WIS and AC:<br />
<br />
Iksar Regen BP<br />
Leaf Scale Gloves<br />
Metal Linked Crown<br />
Bone Mask of the Jarsath<br />
Spider Fur Belt<br />
Jaundiced Bone arms, hands, helm<br />
dragonhide legs</div></div><hr />
