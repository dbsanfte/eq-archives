<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping for some assistance from the folks on the boards about good hunting grounds for my 58 Shaman, where I could farm decent equip for my NEC alt.  I never seem to have spare plat to dump into gear for alts, and I figured my Shaman could help out by solo farming in some of the long forgotten camps.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could solo in permafrost...there's a mob that drops an int cap there. It's been too long though and I'm not sure I have name right (runed circlet??)<br />
<br />
You could solo in nadox, working on pure blood and getting sandals and gloves for your necro.  Gloves of Fallen Spirit and Twice Stitched Sandals are the correct names I think.<br />
<br />
You could solo the soulstripper in Dulak and sell it for cash to buy twink gear.  I think the drop other than soulstripper might be an int caster cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could try KC all that flat skin stuff drops there for NEC/SHD there are also a few other things that drop there that might be good for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Loam encrusted gear from the Hole is nice for int casters - robe has some godly mana on it. When I was twinking out my wizard just recently, went through slaughtering elementals for 2 or 3 hours with a 65 chanter friend, got about 6 pieces. In theory they could drop from the entrance mobs, but the drops we got were further in. stay away from golems, gargoyles, &amp; constructs. bad loot, mitigate slow, &amp; very MR. <br />
<br />
There are some nice int caster drops in COM that I soloed at 57/8 Mysterios glowing sleeves  &amp; glowing something necklace (sold both for 2 or 3k each). The named mobs that drop stuff can spawn more or less anywhere, got a couple of named while camping spectral courier for epic. only mob that gave me real probs was Mighty golem - resisted slow 3x &amp; I had to run for it.<br />
<br />
Luggald Assassin in Dulak drops a nice int caster piercer, captain of the stormwave drops a nice int caster 1HB, but he's a rare spawn, &amp; his common is mellee legs.<br />
<br />
Do the Fine Antique Ring &amp; Fine Cut Diamond Inlaid Mask quests in PoK with him too, the focus effects are nice, &amp; will serve you till lvl 50.<br />
<br />
Do the havester Quest in the Temple of Soulseek Ro - Droppable, stats aren't that good but it looks way cool.<br />
<br />
Park him at the entrance of Velks, kill the Fierce blizzard hunter, &amp; let him loot the ear (after you get one for yourself) that room is the best solo XP I've had around that level anyway. I posted about this somewhere in this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Preecher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoM drops some real nice stuff, I was in there camping the key to get into the castle for my Epic and got about 7 items that went to my alt Nec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Loam encrusted stuff is from Siren's Grotto, isn't it?  Or I might be thinking of some other loam...<br />
<br />
Nurga has some great little alt-gear drops - be sure to get maps and tips from the nurgalopedia site  --  http://pub116.ezboard.com/fcouncilofzarchonfrm4.showMessage?topicID=4.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sirens grotto is nettled kelp - loam is from the hole</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd definitely say go to nurga. RIght as ya zone in and go up waterfall is the placeholder for stabber remmy, got a caster face and shoulders I think off of him that were upgrades to my 61 necro. Farm both of his drops, then head to another camp and repeat. Most stuff in there doesn't see invis so ya can move around from camp to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for some really good suggestions.  I visited Nurga and picked up the gloves, shoulder and arms pieces.  Amizingly decent xp since revamp of this zone (ssshh, my new solo spot =)).  Mostly DB at 59 (deep in zone), zone xp mods and half way decent coin drops make for a fairly tolerable dungeon crawl.  Just have to be mindful of those gaters that bring back fiends =)<br />
<br />
Spent a lot of time in CoM, but didn't get any decent drops.  Off to the Grotto and Permafrost for cap.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the suggestions....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">screw the runed circlet and go to lower guk for the 9 INT helm. The Froglok Sribe drops it as far as i know</div></div><hr />
