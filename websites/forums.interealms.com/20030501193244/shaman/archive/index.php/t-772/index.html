I’m not going to start Alchemy till I hit 34. I know your Max skill per level starting at Level 25 is 5.  So by level 34 if you had been doing Alchemy your skill would be 45, if Maxed out once you hit 34.<br />
<br />
If I save my points for 34 does this mean I need to put 45 points into Alchemy to get my Max level 34? I don’t think you can put more than 20 points into any skill, does this apply for Alchemy as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can put more than 20 points into skills.... so long as it's not a trade skill (which Alchemy, despite our experience is considered).  what I did when I hit level 25 was put all 5 of my training ponits into it every level until I couldn't do so anymore (level 30), then just made SoW potions till they trivilized after I hit level 32.  From there it's just finding the potions that you *might* be able to sell, or that you dn't mind selling back to vendors for less than the cost of a single ingredient.<br />

Good luck.<br />
