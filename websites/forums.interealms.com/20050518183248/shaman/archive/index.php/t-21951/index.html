A ranger soloed trak.  (with raid buffs, but still)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So much for the &quot;upgrade to the shaman class would trivialize older content&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
This game is already as easy as it can get, all you need is a good amount of time and a average IQ to work your way up to the top. It's sad, once you figure it out that is.<br />
<br />
Props to the guy who pulled it off though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This phenomenon is actually nothing new. Trvialization is a continuous process wich began with Ruins of Kunark. They level-nerfed Vox and Naggy to hinder trivialization a bit, but after that... <br />
<br />
Actually i think they should revamp ALL the old zones when they release a new expansion. I think it sucks not being able to make good exp in old zones just because they keep pressing up the level cap. Right now im bound to either PoP or GoD (haha) for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He clicked innate cammo everytime he got banished, then waited for a summon back.  Clever.<br />
<br />
I'm impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree Vigdis,<br />
<br />
Mind you I am not talking about a wholesale &quot;buffing&quot; of all newbie zones but taking a portion and bumping them up a bit.  Droga is an example.<br />
<br />
I know they have beefed up zones in the past but not often and not with any serious result.  They moved Runnyeye up a few levels if I remember but that did not last long.<br />
<br />
I say they should take the deeper areas of all of these old world and make it 65 solo- 50+ group but leave the &quot;front&quot; areas for newbies.<br />
<br />
I think that is accomplishes two goals.  One it gives us unguilded, non-Time equiped, hard-to-find full group folks a place to play.  And puts us inclose proximity to newbies so they can benefit from having us near.  I think more lower leveled folks would adventure in these old world, non-graveyard dungeons if they thought that there were a good number of high level characters to help them out if they got in a jam.<br />
<br />
It would also be a lot cheaper and easier for SoE to improve zone that already exist as opposed to pumping out new zones.  Content is content.  For me it does not necessarilty have to come with brand new zones and art.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interestingly enough, while he did elect to get Taisman of the Tribunal, he didn't bother with any stat buffs... since all his stats except AGI are maxed.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Rytlan will be jumping in with an explanation of how stat buffs could've made soloing trak even easier. Virtue and VoQ obviously were considered useful.<br />
<br />
check the buff bar on <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone else notice that he did it with mainly self buffs?  <br />
<br />
Only shaman buff I saw was ToT.<br />
<br />
[edit:  GRR..slow fingers...Kiz is faster]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">OMG a paper tank killed Trak. LOL I find this hillarious. I always thought of rangers as bait and rez fodder. I might have to revamp my opinions of them....maybe  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">3 chanter buffs and the only shaman buff was a resist...go go focus!<br />
<br />
very nice work on his part though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Man, who honestly thinks rangers are the weakest link anymore?  It's been like 2 years since they truly sucked.    With their ability to do 2 mins worth of incredible bow damage, it just becomes a game of &quot;can the mob kill me before I kill him.&quot;  And any class with elemental gear and the proper AAs can take a few hits (all &quot;paper-tank&quot; jokes aside).<br />
<br />
It's a well-known tactic to invis or sit down to get summoned immediately back to Trak after banishment, so he just used his head there.  Smart game and good effort, glad to see he pulled it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He clicked innate cammo everytime he got banished, then waited for a summon back.  Clever.<br />
<br />
I'm impressed.I plan on trying this once I get some more resists (possibly a quarm ring? haha). With the new Trushar it should be doable. Instant clicky invis potions should do the same thing innate camo does. I can probably melee him down with my sharkspine. Dunno if VP will root him though :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nothing new really, SK's have been doing it for about 6 months.  A druid did it probably 2-3 months ago.  I'd bet paladins or maybe necros will do it next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it helps if your paper is 8.6k thick - nice effort and congrats to him.</div></div><hr />

I group with several rangers that MT hard LDONs, they are not &quot;paper tanks&quot; any more, they may not be beefy in the Hp and Ac dept like a knight or warrior, but they certainly dont suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree, Barm. Good use of what he has!<br />

It's a little too cool for me to turn into Shaman agenda :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I certainly didn't mean it in that manner :)   This blew my mind in a I-didn't-realize-rangers-could-solo-anything-inside-let-alone-Trak kind of way rather than a This-goes-to-show-we-suck way.</div></div><hr />
