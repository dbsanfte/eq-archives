<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deyhawke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been diving all over the net trying to get some information on them, but aside from the drops there isn't much.  Can anyone shed some light on these for me?  I know they spawn inside the factory, but on what kind of timetable?  Max hit 450 (quad?)?  I also read they have a similar AE to Nexmirthifen...  heheheh any help would be greatly appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if i recall shorlty have getting factory access a group of us 'daredevils' went in to try to kill the prototypes.  i am pretty sure that they banished the tank somewhere else.  so yeah think about that.  i dont remeber many details or anything but remeber the tank not being there when he shouda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">been to long since i tried them, i remember thinking this wasn't a good idea with just one group...some AE that hurt and flurries that killed me.  my group didn't even touch the mob damage wise, but we were had a low 60s toon or 2 with us and we didn't know they AEed...i got a slow resist and that ended the fight pritty much.  wish i could be more help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never done them but seen guilds go in past us when I was XPing on golems with a group. They always took two or three groups, and the AE was hitting us back where we were standing - a long way away. No way you can hide from the AE. Its not as nasty as Nex - can't remember exactly what it hit us for, but it was significant damage without being insane.<br />
<br />
One mini-raid I saw wiped, I think they said the mob warped back to its bind and then summoned. Something to beware of anyway.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't help more -  I'd advice going in force the first time though, and don't take any low levels or the AE will just drain all your healers of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the AE is a snare.. they &quot;proc&quot; banishment I think.. The banishment makes your tank to end up in 1 of the other prototypes room.. I think if you take the one straight ahead your tank will go to the rightside prototype or something like that.. Was a while since I was there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3 groups of 60+ is all you need they are about 50k hps quad 450 and are slowable (mitigated) so only partially. They drop great loots for thier difficulty. 1h4 hat, and Spaulders that have haste of mithaniel.<br />

kill the right room first, the the left, then the back.</div></div><hr />
