<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In pondering our DPS in another thread, I hit upon something I'd like to know how everyone feels about.<br />
<br />
Murtak's stickied thread of Shaman improvements puts our nuke DPS around 122 I believe.  I've not really seen anyone say yea or nay whether that is where they feel we should be.  However . . .<br />
<br />
If we feel that 122 DPS is an acceptable level of DPS for the Shaman, then perhaps we are a lot closer than we think to where we wish to be.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn + Velium Strike:<br />
<br />
Assume one wave of Tears is resisted. (Yea, that does suck, but its reality). Anyway . . . 2 waves of Tears + Velium Strike = 123.6 DPS. Add in dogdog's 25 DPS and we're just below and unhasted Ranger, generally thought to be around 157 DPS.<br />
<br />
Comments ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on the mobs, and tears + velium is a bit lower, just around 90 dps with doggy on raids.<br />
groups, its higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess its more of a general question than a number.<br />
<br />
If we are buffing, debuffing, and healing.. how much A) time is left for canni B) time is left for dps C) how much dps is acceptable for someone already doing all the above mentioned things.<br />
<br />
I debate this myself, and don't have a real good answer atm.  If our buffs really meant something and added group dps, if our debuffs worked in shorter fights and weren't mitigated or immune, and if our heals kept up with increased mob dps... well, I'm not entirely sure I'd care about dps as much.  <br />
<br />
Its because our buffs, debuffs, and heals aren't really that strong right now, that shaman are beginning to search for other ways to contribute.  Like last night dorking around in BoT, a character had an enc out of group, and the cleric had a dark mace of thought from VT, so I let the enc slow, and the cleric was perpetually FM cause I FA'd him along with the melee. <br />
<br />
In that situation, I was wishing my rains and nukes did more damage.  But prior in the day, I was doing a hard ldon.  The cleric wasn't that uber, and we had an enc and bst in the group.  I basically was just malos'ing the mobs, letting the bst do the initial slow, Q'ing the bst and MT, and doing backup heals.  I didn't cast one nuke or dot the entire time.  In that situation, several times, I wish'd I had a group Q, and a stronger fast heal.  <br />
<br />
We just fill so many roles, but not well, that I'd rather see the shaman start to become more defined.  If we incrementally, slowly, and simultaneously increase buff, debuff, heal, and dps with each patch/expansion, I fear we will always be the worst in all those categories.  We really need a clearer role in the future imo. Especially if content is going to continue to evolve to fast, low hp fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What are we talking about here exactly? Averaged dps over a mobs life, sustained dps, or peak dps?<br />
Peak dps I can do alot more, sustained about that for a short period, average over a mobs life about half what you mention - this is all given a reasonable mob in current content that I group in.<br />
<br />
Another issue is where do we address our problem of our weak dps? Short fights/long dots? slow casting and low damage nukes? Do we try and increase our dot damage over a period of time, reduce our casting time on our nukes, or do we look for bigger nukes? Give us better nukes and better healing and how are we different from druids then asides a few key utility roles?<br />
<br />
Also, increase in dot dps will garner us more aggro, and until that is changed I am hesitant to want that problem as well.<br />
<br />
In this current world of fast fights, I hold no illusions that we will never do respectable dps. Our main tools aren't geared for that at all. I don't want to change our tools to match the current mechanics but rather an adjustment.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
Bane/Anathema recast time removed (why is it there anyhow? mana cost + resist rates are balancing enough) and possibly a resist modifer attached.<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment upped to ~800 damage <br />
<br />
Velium Strike upped to ~1100 damage and it's cast time adjusted to the 6.5 mark<br />
<br />
Also, if dot damage to aggro can be fixed and made constant:<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction aa's changed to 5%/10%/15% crit rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
More than that I don't want. I do good dps when I am able to stack dots, and don't when I can't. I want to be able to do non-pitiful damage when I can't stack dots.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I'm driving at is short fights.  We are all aware that Shaman can DoT the ever living crap out of something that has a life expectancy of over 40 seconds.  However, these days few mobs do.<br />
<br />
One of our complaints is that we have no way to contribute in situations where mob life span is short.  You can do 123 DPS over 18 seconds using Tears / Velium Strike.  It's probably even sustainable.<br />
<br />
So, I suppose what I'm asking is what do we consider &quot;acceptable&quot; DPS for a Shaman over a short fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem is that I never use Tears of Saryn, it's situational at best.  First, it breaks mez, which means you need to make sure there are no mezed creatures near by.  It gets resisted alot more than 1 out of 3 for me, especially in GoD.  I often have them all resisted, or do less than maximum damage.  Tears is not affected by modifiers like ID4.<br />
<br />
So when it comes to nukes most Shaman only have Velium Strike loaded.  Which itself is a weak DD that takes too long.<br />
<br />
I agree Shammy dps over the long haul isn't bad.  In fact when I solo PoFire I can stack on all these dots:<br />
Pox,Bane,Anathema,BoS,BoU,Curse of Spirits..  And with my Time range piece I often get numbers like this:<br />
140,510,320,390,160,167 = 1687 per tick (not to mention crit ticks)<br />
That's a heck of alot of dps.  But even then it's situational.  It takes about a minute to malos, slow and stack on that many DoTs.  Not to mention the amount of aggro it generates, not even the best tank on the server could maintain aggro off me.<br />
<br />
For Exp groups, what we really need is a fast nuke, something over the 1k range, that we can cast on mobs after we malos and slow.  Something we can cast to add dps in a regular exp group.<br />
<br />
For raids, Shaman would be dps machines if we were allowed to stack on DoTs and not get summoned after the first tick.  What we need is some type of way to lower aggro, something like Necro's FD or Wizard's Concussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wizards get clicky canni via mana robe (and obviously feel that it's a part of their &quot;standard gear&quot; since they've asked for an upgrade to it on the SoE web site as one of their top 10 issues).  So perhaps it would not be outrageous for shamans to ask for an item with some sort of clicky concussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have more problems with aggro than DPS.<br />
<br />
For raids, in my case it's fairly easy to push well over 200dps on bosses with fomm3, critaff3, 25% poison/30%cold focus etc. For 'farm' bosses I usually just toss on bane then blood, then chain nuke to see if/when I can get summoned ;)<br />
<br />
For sustainable DPS groupwise I only really allocate 2 slots to damage spells, so its usually bane/nuke/dog.<br />
ie: in KT, I malos at max range, slow lands/resist as tank is taking first swing (I'm right by him), then bane on refresh, then 1-2 nukes per mob and cover any patch emergency healing etc.<br />
<br />
I think we need to look at our role raid/groupwise before looking at dps 'figure'.<br />
<br />
ie: if I am raiding new/critical/non-trivial content, DPS is pretty low on my list of priorities 'to do'. Quite often I patch heal, keep my group alive, deal with crap, make sure xyz is covered before DPS comes into the equation. I do more raid dps when we are low on healers by keeping the rogues/monks etc up rather than dotting. I only really go pure DPS when all the bases are covered ie: raid has multiple shaman and more than enough healers.<br />
<br />
Overall, I suppose my point is our DPS is so situational group/raidwise its hard to put a flat figure on it, as our role varies a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think the answer is to look at potential DPS, per say, but rather, &quot;What can I do in that last 10-15 seconds of a fight to contribute&quot;. <br />
<br />
A 1K nuke as fast as Spear or a 1600 nuke as fast as VS or a 3 tic 700 per DOT. Given the content today, and the amount other classes can pump out, I dont see this as unbalancing at all. Its still kinda low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Has anyone ever factored in Ferine Avatar in our dps?  I know it's secondary and probably difficult to estimate.  But keeping FA up on 3 other players (which is what I normally do) has got to add up to something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The &quot;standard formula&quot; I've heard is +10 ATK = 1 dps.  So you can probably count yourself for about 14 dps per melee on which you keep FA up.  I've heard that it starts running into soft caps once your melees start getting up around 2200+ ATK though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, I think some sort of aggro reduction spell for our DoTs would be awesome.  For raids, I'm not talking about trash, because I put that stuff in the same category as exp mobs, it just dies too quick.  But, for raid bosses, that can take 5+ minutes to kill, it would be nice to be able to stack on DoTs in between patch heals.  I wouldn't feel so useless.  As it is currently, on raids, one shaman slows the boss, and the rest of the shaman patch heal with a crappy patch.  It's funny, because we've all tricked ourselves into believing we're semi important on raids, when we've really been reduced to buffing focus, slowing trash mobs, and one honorary shaman on the raid to handle the boss slowing privalege.  Here's to you Mr. Boss Slowing Shaman (said in the Bud Light commercial tone of voice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kazim/jvrebi - standard thinking is grossly wrong on the value of ATK to DPS.  Do a search for threads here, thread starter was Purdypog.  Toward the end of myself and someone else (Frekkels?) had a discussion about this very thing and it turns out that 10 ATK = 1 DPS is grossly wrong.<br />
<br />
Blazz, I think you are starting to understand what I'm driving at.  What I am trying hard to point out is that a Shaman can currently knock out 2225 damage in 18 seconds.  I believe you and I are generally looking at the same amount of damage and time.<br />
<br />
My point might be that we are already there.  I am simply looking for some counterpoint to it.<br />
<br />
I accept that mezzed mobs would affect this, that is certainly true and it would, situationally, affect our DPS using the method I outlined.  I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  All classes have situations in which they are unable to perform at their peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Yeah, that was me.  I was under the same mis-impression Kazim had with respect to attack values contribution to DPS.<br />
<br />
I'd like a single nuke that combined the qualities clerics/druids have.<br />
High damage (but not wizard strength), fast cast time, add a recast delay of so many seconds.<br />
<br />
One of our big problems isn't burst dps per se, but it is contributing ANY meaningful dps when we're also debuffing and slowing.  I agree we shouldn't be pumping out druid DPS #s', but we should be able to do something besides watch Velium Strike hit a corpse or take more damage ourselves than the mob does when casting Tears of Saryrn.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking a nuke that would help us would be like this:<br />
E'cian Strike<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 2400. <br />
<br />
Mana: 605 Skill: Evocation <br />
Casting Time: 6.35 Recast Time: 12.<br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Resist: Cold <br />
Range: 200 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any Deletable: No <br />
Interruptable: Yes Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental Category: Dir. Dmg <br />
<br />
Make it a level 70 OOW spell.  Scale it down slightly for the upper 60 versions.  This is just a smidge less damage than the druid's OoW nuke for the same mana cost except it also has a long recast delay (which the druid's version does not have).  Fast enough casting with spell haste that we can get it off when a mob is at 20-30% health, and it will be available in time for the next mob.  I don't think this would unbalance us, but it would let us do some appreciable (but not outrageous) DPS AFTER we've Malos'd on incoming and slowed the mob and hopefully without drawing crazy aggro.  On single big mobs we could use it in concert with Tears &amp; VS for some decent burst dps on mobs that cold lands.  We'd still be gimped for Cold/Poison resistant mobs, which I can live with.  Our Cold nukes used to be very good, would nice to see them go back to that.  A poison based version would also be awesome to have with lesser damage/mana values but no recast delay in the upper 60's.<br />
<br />
A clicky or AA Concussion would be awesome.  I could live without nukes if I could click a 2 second cast time concussion every 6 seconds to counteract DoT aggro.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Short-duration, non-raid-target fights, I don't do direct dps. I slow, sic the pet (if it's still around), Q the MA, and go to pull another...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trevalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anyway . . . 2 waves of Tears + Velium Strike = 123.6 DPS. Add in dogdog's 25 DPS and we're just below and unhasted Ranger, generally thought to be around 157 DPS.<br />
<br />
I think there are a few factors that make this comparison misleading.<br />
<br />
1) This hypothetical ranger can easily grow his or her DPS a lot by being hasted, as haste is generally available in most groups and all raids.<br />
<br />
2) This ranger is using weapon damage, which is going to be useful whether or not the mob has poison resistance, or cold resistance, or magic resistance. On many mobs some shaman DPS spells are rendered useless.<br />
<br />
3) The shaman is forced to use mana to do this DPS. The ranger can autoattack and go forever, but we are forced to use up limited resources. I thought the idea was that using mana made for more powerful 'burst' attacks to make up for the limiting cost.<br />
<br />
4) I am not sure adding dogdog is completely fair. Particularly in a raid instance his lifespan is very limited.<br />
<br />
5) Shaman are going to have to deal a lot more with aggro than a meleeing ranger.<br />
<br />
6) Melee DPS is more even. With shaman the long cast times mean that often in group instances by the time you get the mob malosed and slowed, there is barely time to get good use of Velium Strike, much less a rain or a dot. Melee can keep going right up to the time the mob dies without being wasteful.<br />
<br />
7) Melee is not going to break mez or trip traps or pull adds onto the ranger the way rains will for the shaman.<br />
<br />
8) To sustain our DPS over the long haul, shaman will have to use our 'active' mana regeneration by spending time using cannibalize. It's very popular for shaman to 'pay' for their good mana regeneration with penalties in other areas, but as long as that is true, it has to be taken into account that time spent regenerating our mana is time we can't spend doing DPS.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily think 155 DPS is bad for a shaman in theory (although it is definitely not great either), but there are so many extra costs to our current methods of doing DPS, that I don't think we are really as well off as your post seems to suggest. Just my perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Samana - I don't think we can ever expect to be able to do both Slow and contribute DPS, not in today's EQ.

What I am trying to find is a way for us to regain some of that &quot;jack of all trades&quot; ability, and strongly enough that we are seen as a viable alternative for whatever role we apply to.<br />
<br />
Pitching in 2200 damage in the last 18 seconds of a fight is no small thing.  No, it isn't even close to Wizard DPS, and perhaps it's still not enough.  Blazz is starting to get the idea, consider his post if you will.<br />

<br />
i dont' worry much about dps in general though. what i am more concerned about all in all is this: <br />
<br />
our impact on dps in vs dps out.<br />
<br />
would be interested to see something that demonstrated our impact on the dps swing. ie..how much dps in we negate with debuffs and heals, in relation to how much dps we generate via buffs, nukes, dots, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, now this is an attitude I just don't understand. A beastlord can slow and contribute DPS. A chanter brings the best (situational) DPS in the game via charmed pets, and they can still slow... and then there are other things they contribute like VoQ, mez, best haste, etc. Bards are their own story - with the best pulling ability, overhaste, DD/DoT songs, mez, etc.<br />
<br />
If we can't provide good DPS, and we can't provide main healing, and we can't do any CC other than root parking, and we can't tank... why the heck would you invite a shaman to a group over a bard, beastlord, or enchanter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">...and yet, we still get groups. weird...</div></div><hr />

Especially if there is two Shammy's, now what, one becomes DPS or back up healer.  <br />
<br />
I think we need something, especially with the uugly reality that our Buffs aren't as required as they used to be.   The original thread of is 155 DPS enough, no.. it is not if we are needed for DPS.  If we are going utility then sure its fine.  How do we increase DPS?  Dots? or Nukes?  I would take one of each please, however, not before we get some sort of aggro reducer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We already have a 3 tick DoT that goes 650 / tick . . . people simply don't use it because of an inherent flaw in the way it is coded.  In fact, it actually all happens in less than 2 ticks, but once again that's beside the point because of the flaw.<br />
<br />
Whyte - yes, that's what I'm driving at . . . the times when Malo/Slow is simply not the right way to spend our time.  30 second fights.  What I am looking for is some way, within the context of the spells we have, to get us up to acceptable DPS in those situations.<br />
<br />
You see, I believe we have a much better chance of getting small changes that add up to something worthwhile than a huge change.  For instance, I can see getting resist modifiers added to the Curse line a lot easier than I see us getting a completely new 3 tick DoT.<br />
<br />
So, creatively, with the context of what we already have, how can we do 150 DPS over 30 seconds?<br />
<br />
For instance, I can get to 107 DPS by casting Bane then Anathema and it takes me about 11 seconds to cast.  I've still got 19 seconds of fight in which to Can back my mana.  I can probably add a Velium Strike to it and increase my DPS to 138.  I think I could maintain that given the down time during the fight plus pull time after the fight before the next mob arrives.  But that may still be a little low.<br />
<br />
Perhaps not.<br />
<br />
Consider a &quot;new EQ&quot; mob has perhaps 32k HP . . . we've done damage equivalent to 13% of the mob life . . . 1/8 approximately.  How much would a Wizard do?  I can certainly speculate what they could do based on the spells that have, but, what do they actually do?  20%?<br />
<br />
If a Wizard does 20% of the damage to a mob compared to our potential 13% that makes us 2/3 as good as the Wizard.<br />
<br />
Is 2/3 the damage of a Wizard acceptable if a Shaman were asked to perform a DPS role ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the actual increase in dps depends on the relationship of atk to mitigation AC. Buff ATK doesnt increase your max hit, just the likelyhood of hitting closer to max, depending on mob AC. If your ATK is so large relative to the mob AC that most of your hits are near max, increasing ATK wont help you (obviously). Likewise, if it is so small that all of your hits are near or at min, it probably wont help much either (allthough it might). The effect is greatest when you are hitting for values somewhere inbetween, so consequently finding meaningful parses for this sort of thing is hard. The usefullness of the buff also depends on the class its being casted on, since base ATK values differ.

Or for Burst what about Mutt. And mutt swarm? Sure it is only every ten minutes. But it is avalable as a burst. <br />
<br />
In a fight of 1 minute Shaman are okay as a steady damage producer. But We have the ability to front load damage and do something else if we didnt have other duties. <br />
<br />
In other words. No matter what the spells. If a wizard has to kite for 30 seconds out of every fight before he can cast a spell then he is not doing his DPS. <br />
<br />
Fix our aggro on dots. Especially with Dot crits. Make the fights last a little longer without the Extreme stupid DPS of mobs and bring the game back into RPGland. rather than Twitchfest 2004 and shaman will be a grand contributer once again. <br />
<br />
Keep fights at the stupid 30 seconds max grindhouse crap. And the game will just burn out rather than fade away.<br />

I repeat. Don;t change every class to suit one aspect of the game. Fix the god damned game.<br />

This arguement is ridiculous. Why do clerics get nukes? (better ones than us, BTW) They arent a DPS class. Why do Enchanters get bigger nukes than us? They should charm for thier DPS. <br />
<br />
I am gonna agree that in the overall scheme of a 30 second fight, that 1100 nuke you dropped on during the last 5 seconds REALLY didnt contribute THAT much, but its something, and its a helluva lot better than . . <br />
<br />
a. Standing there itchig my ass (old troll here)<br />
b. Singing Nine Inch Nails lyrics in guildchat while we wait for the mob to die<br />
c. Asking for the umpteenth time &quot;Anyone need any buffs?&quot;<br />
<br />
etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
A lot of EQ is perception. That 1K may not be much when the wizard is blowing 3K holes, or the rogue is BSing for 900 a poke, but it will make ME FEEL WORTHWHILE. As it is now, I have a Sharkspine, I have FoM3, and I melee baby, cause I get a ton of 450s and a bunch of 900s. I would rather swing the mace than duck to interupt VS yet again cause the mob is dead before it goes off, or cast SoT hoping to god for a 1300 crit to make it HALF worthwhile. <br />
<br />
I duo with an SK friend a lot in Sol Ro. He can barely keep aggro off me, and I out DPS him by a million. 2 DOTs, a nuke or 2, and the mace procs. HIs pet, my pet, both with weapons we bought in POK. For a couple &quot;non-DPS&quot; classes, stuff dies DAMN FAST. <br />
<br />
We arent asking for a 2K heal to be clerics. We arent asking for a 1200 point fast dd to be wizards. We are asking for those 2 minor tiny things so we have an option. In the days of 3 minute fights, we had options. Actually, we had time. DOts runnin, Torpor runing, doing DPS and healing at the same time ready to cast whatever the situation may call for next. <br />
<br />
I know you were being tounge-in-cheek with your statement, but I am on the &quot;More DPS&quot; side of the shaman fix fence. My buddy VeeshenMurtak could care less about DPS. He wants to be able to heal like he could in the old days. Thats the beauty of the Shaman class, really.</div></div><hr />

Dont even need that much. 1600 seems reasonable at lvl 70, 1200 for the 66 nuke, maybe. That would make me happy happy. Same casting times as SoT by the way, AND have it be affected by that STUPID focus on Ornate and EP gaunts!<br />
Did somebody already suggest a 3 tic DOT?<br />
. . .or a 3 tic 700 per DOT. <br />
::sniff, sniff:: you didnt even read my post Faern!! WHAAAAAA!!!! <br />
<br />
Heh. Actually, I dunno who came up with it originally, it wasnt me, I just loved it the instant I saw it. Solves a TON of problems. Less tics = less aggro. Less tics = better in shorter fights. Less tics = usable in most situations where a nuke or rain would be used. <br />
<br />
If they are concerned about the solo unbalancing of it, have the first tic be a DD, then you cant use it for root-rotting, or something. Really seems &quot;Shamanesque&quot; to me, honestly. I cannot think of a better DPS spell to &quot;fit&quot; my class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Blazz - I know you want a little more DPS, I know that many Shaman do.  Is it what I want personally?  No, not really.  However, as a Community Correspondent it is my job to see all sides of the community and help make the Designers aware of the reasonable and logical requests.<br />
<br />
The feeling I get from my experiences is that it is highly unlikely we are going to get any radical changes.  I don't expect to see us get any (truly) new spells.  I don't believe a 3 tick DoT is likely.  What I think is far more likely is a &quot;fix&quot; of our Rain spells.<br />
<br />
No, Rains aren't workable in every situation.  Mezzed mobs put a serious damper on Rains.  I don't think that is a deal breaker though.  Not every spell is right for every situation.<br />
<br />
Honestly, answer this question:  If Tears of Saryn did not have the built in 20% resist, would you keep it loaded?<br />
<br />
I would.  That's 1950 damage that happens pretty quick . . . not only that, instead of the whole 1950 getting resisted, it is checked 33% at a time.  I realize I would have to be careful around Mezzed mobs.  Nevertheless, 1950 damage is a significant amount of damage used at the proper time.  If the mob is a runner, you use it to knock the mob into run range.  If it enrages, you burn it down thru it's enrage portion.  If it gates or CH's . . . same deal, burn it.<br />
<br />
We aren't Wizards.  I don't want us to be.  You guys don't either.  What I want to do is identify some of the smaller problems with our existing spells that could make a big difference and work towards getting those fixed.<br />
<br />
Another one that really bugs me is the Bane line.  Those spells are simply perfect in timing for these fights, but the resist rates are so out of sight that you simply can't afford to cast them.  Thats another thing I'd like looked at.<br />
<br />
This thread is my way of collecting all these little things that would help us.  It is by no means the only thing I think we need work on, it is just one of them.</div></div><hr />

Yup 1600 seems reasonable at 70 but if we suggest 1600 you know SoE will only give us 1400.<br />
Ask for 2400 we may get 1600 or maybe 1800 or maybe &quot;Rytans looking into it&quot;.<br />

When clerics overnuke (and just with their generic nuke) us and overheal us by a damn large margin...<br />
<br />
When druids overnuke us and overheal us by a large margin too...<br />
<br />
Asking to be on par with both classes on their lesser ability (aka clerics' nuke and druids' healing) is not what I call unreasonable or unlogical.<br />
<br />
Druids and shamans would heal the same, but druids nuke harder.<br />
Clerics and shamans would nuke the same, but clerics still own everyone in healing.<br />
<br />
We won't be better than clerics and druids, but at least, we won't be the eternal ones behind all the other priests.<br />
<br />
And at least, when you have more than 2 shamans in the raid, in the worst case we can heal like a druid or nuke like a cleric, but not less than both classe in both ability.<br />
<br />
Is it really unlogical and unreasonable ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the point is that &quot;many&quot; shaman want better burst dps so that we have something to contribute to short fights other than malos/slow and wait to see if someone needs a spot heal.  When there is another healer in group, things can get pretty boring in most groups/zones, as you know.  Also, based on your previous comments, I agree that a bigger dd is not the only answer, a short, intense dot would be nice, or a &quot;fix&quot; to the rain spells.  I also realize that some of these issues are already listed on some of the class top 10 lists, so I'm hopeful that change is coming.<br />
<br />
My only concern is that you remember that you are in a negotiation with at least 13 people (SOE and 12 other class reps).  Lets make sure that we are reasonable and logical, but lets also make sure we are heard and action is taken.  I don't expect you to rant and rave, but I do expect you to express the same sense of urgency that the shaman community expresses here at the crucible.  Do it nicely, fairly, but strongly.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, and thanks for doing what you can to help the shaman community.<br />

c. fighting with the 4 other shaman to ninja buff the dead puller<br />

- Trash mob :<br />
Fights last 12 sec max in qvic and a bit more in Txevu, but I still can't land 2 velium strike there  even if I m not on debuff /sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
- Named<br />
In Qvic I m totally useles once slow landed on named fight.<br />
They resist cold like hell, are almost immune to poison and are immune to disease.<br />
So, I land bane (when not resisted) and pull out my old staff of eternal flame and use rabid bear.<br />
It's a bit better in txevu, but not a lot. At least I was able to land more than 1 dot last time I fought named in txevu<br />
<br />
Sure, I could consider myself like a healer and heal my group, but without a group heal or a bigger fast DD heal, it wasting mana and time. Druid will heal a lot more than me faster and cleric will just heal the group if needed.<br />
I can keep a group alive in Qvic again't named AoE, I did it. But it's like winning challenged olympics game.<br />
<br />
So, I just look at chanter criting nukes and /drooling for their uber dps.<br />
<br />
We have 2 lines of nuke (I m not counting burst of flame)<br />
a fast and a slow casting one.<br />
Poison = fast =&gt; 2.45 dmg /mana (with spear of torment)<br />
Cold = slow =&gt; 3.08 dmg / mana (with velium strike)<br />
<br />
I m all for a fast cold and fast poison using the worst dmg/mana ratio (2.45)<br />
=&gt; poison : 4.2 sec, 1004 dmg 410 mana <br />
=&gt; cold    : 4.2 sec, 1200 dmg 490 mana<br />
sure it would hurt our mana bar, but I m regening lot of wasted mana during raid anyway  :D<br />
if a chanter can nuke for 1320 in 6 sec for 360 mana, then those spell would not unbalance things.</div></div><hr />

Rain sure. And you do know you can target Mutt and cast it. Or a meele To space the rain so it doesnt hit Mezzed mobs. If you pay attention.<br />
<br />
A dot would be best for the flavor of the shaman class accourding to what we have been playing for the last few years.  And if they dropped the Bane line to a neg 50 resist or even neg 100  resist then it would fix alot of the problems. And ditch the 20Percent resists on rains and we would be set damage wise. (My opinon of course)<br />
<br />
Our nukes have always been the slow of a winter storm. Cold, plodding but chilling when it hit. Seems more of the flavor of the class. Calling down the winds to strike rather than the power coming directly form the shaman.<br />

<br />
OK, since you asked. <br />
<br />
1.  Reduce cast time on VS (and all Omen dd's) to 4.2 secs, same as SoT.  7.8 secs is painful.<br />
<br />
2.  Reduce resists on rains to be on par with similar dd's, should not be a hard 20%.<br />
<br />
3.  In general, reduce duration of dots and increase damage per tick, for the same amount of mana.  Basically, make them effective in short fights, but don't cripple us with poor damage/mana. I'd propose a 33% reduction in duration.  7 ticks goes to 5 ticks, like Bane, with a proportional increase in damage (so BoS becomes 448 damage for 5 ticks and BoU becomes 200 damage for 17 ticks). <br />
<br />
4.  Reduce aggro on dots and dot crits, make on par with dd's, so we can actually use dots without a guaranteed death.<br />
<br />
That's all I want, as far as dps goes.<br />
<br />

Fight duration will get longer. It has to. Otherwise the game will just break itself. Going all out all the time is as painful as fighting one monster for an hour. <br />

Fix aggro on dots. Fix the silly resists on our spells becasue we have the capability of malos. And give us Short dots. Medium dots and long lasting dots. <br />

Pigeonholing us into DPs would break shaman as much as we are broken now. We don't need to fit into the round hole with the square peg.

We are shaman. We make fights of all shapes and sizes and makeups better. And right now what is mostly broken is all fights are the same Sprint fights in new content that we have no tools to address.<br />

I disagree on changing all our DoTs.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it make more sense to simply add a significant resist modifier onto the existing Bane spell?<br />
<br />
I mean, fights are short.  Brutally so.  We have three flavors of DoT insofar as run time is concerned.  Short (Curse), Medium (Poison) and Long (Disease).  That right there is vintage Shaman . . . a flavor for every occasion.  Unfortunately at present one of those flavors is &quot;broken&quot; by a stupidly high resist rate.  How cool would Bane be if it landed 90% of the time?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I dont think there is much that can be done with DoTs in the short fight paradigm without some radical re-design of the way DoTs work. If you have a 3 tick DoT you might as well have a nuke or rain. Ways to adapt DoTs to short fights could be:<br />
<br />
1) Make them allmost insta-cast (0.5-1 seconds). Granted, this would unbalance soloing at lower levels because of rapid stacking, but at this point I dont think that lower level issues are too important. The faster cast time would be balanced against the fact that a DoT takes time to run. Stacking issues could be addressed by making DoTs of the same line not stack with each other.<br />
<br />
2) Make DoTs act as a mana drain on the caster, with an initial mana cost on casting, so that when the Mob dies they stop using mana. This would tie the mana cost to actual damage being done and make DoTs an efficient option for the classes that use them.<br />
<br />
3) Get rid of or significantly reduce the initial agro associated with casting the spell, so that people dont have to wait before using them.<br />
<br />
4) Make DoTs unresistable, but allow resist checks per tick (dont know how practical this would be)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My DPS is fine in solo / xp group situation<br />
VS is enough in xp group situation<br />
Rains are enough in xp group situation (even with the resist)<br />
Dots are maybe a bit slow, but they are ok in XP situation<br />
<br />
However, in raid situation (GoD) that's an other problem.<br />
<br />
With mob dieing in 12 sec, using dots is stupid<br />
It's not a problem tho, resists there make almost impossible to dot mobs anyway.<br />
So what left me to do ?<br />
Using our poison rain ?? if dot is resisted, the rain will be resisted too, and with mezed mob in range, it's a bad idea except if you want to wipe the raid (and yes, a single add can wipe a raid)<br />
*** am I supposed to do in raid when we are already 4 shaman ?<br />
Only thing that left that is not uber resisted is my sh!tty slow cold nuke.<br />
Yeah !! I m happy !! I can nuke the mob once at best !!<br />
<br />
So please, don't give me some &quot;nukes are not shaman things but dots are&quot;. Last time I checked, we got our first cold nuke at lvl 5 (doing 12 dmg) and our first disease dot at lvl 5 (for 10 dmg max) not counting burst of flame here.<br />
I agree that we tend to use dots more often because of plenty of good reasons( mana efficient vs nuke, soloing, stacking while caniing etc. etc.). That doesn't mean I don't need a fast nuke, even if it costs 500 mana to cast !<br />
<br />
Dots or rain will not improve anything but the BoT_Shaman or soloing shaman.<br />
Nothing wrong here tho, but I'll pass thanks as it will not help me to fight boredom during raids.<br />
So I guess I'll wait for a &quot;raiding shaman dps&quot; thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The question of shaman DPS revolves around 1 thing: will they EVER fix DoTs?<br />
<br />
By this, I mean:<br />
<br />
1) Will aggro on DoTs/DoT crits ever be tuned to be reasonable? By reasonable, I mean LESS than an equivalent nuke, since instant damage will always be better than damage over time.<br />
<br />
2) Will we ever see decent resist mods on our DoTs?<br />
<br />
3) Will the duration of DoTs ever be tuned to make them usable in LDoN/GoD style fights?<br />
<br />
4) Will the cast times of DoTs ever be adjusted to reflect the fact they take time to work? We end up with a double penalty here - long cast times, and we also have to wait for the server to &quot;tick&quot; for the damage to start.<br />
<br />
If the answer to all 4 of these questions is not a resounding yes, just give all of our damn DoTs to clerics. Druids too, for that matter. Then we can see how often they trot out the &quot;j00 guys do madz DoT DPS!&quot;. In exchange, we can get druid level healing and cleric level nuking.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I love the idea of using DoT spells, and I think they are much more shaman-ish than nukes. The problem is, they are so incredibly broken right now, I find it rather unlikely that they will ever be fixed enough to be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I can answer some of that Sith.<br />
<br />
1.  Necros (and their rep) are currently pushing very hard for this.  They have good data, and I've made sure they have some of the data we collected as well.  I'm not sure what the outcome will be, but it is most certainly &quot;being evaluated&quot;.<br />
<br />
2.  I don't think we will see it on all our DoT's, particularly the Poison and Disease.  I think it's possible we could get it added to our Curse line as a balance against encounter design.<br />
<br />
3.  We have great Curse DoT's already, which run extremely quickly.  You're right, they don't land consistently enough to use, but, &quot;see above&quot;.<br />
<br />
4.  I don't believe we will see, nor should we push for, any change in cast times on our DoT's.  The cast times, in general, reflect the run time of the DoT.  We might be able to get a slight adjustment of the cast times on the Curse line, again in the interest of balance against content.  However, I simply don't think that it's worth whatever coin we would pay for it with respect to the other things we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Keep in mind that while Condemnation does 1100 vs Velium Strike at 925, most Clerics don't have the mana regen to cast that more than once every 30 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that we need help.  For some reason Fenril you seem to think that I am against us getting upgrades, and I am quite the opposite.<br />
<br />
Tar - I think you need to read the whole thread.<br />
I read it.  You're proposing that a fix to rain spells might close the DPS gap so that one shot of that and VS will get us to an acceptable 122 DPS mark.  What I'm saying is that's great and all, but I've lost a good chunk of the fight slowing and Malosing and now I have to fight a heavy handed recast in my rain spell with an insane cast time on VS.  A mob is in camp before the previous one is dead and I want to be able to sustain that DPS for one shot of each at the end of each fight.  After a while my active mana regen is going to do me in because I cannot cast two spells at once and I can't cann enough.<br />
<br />
In short, if you're going to discuss sustainable DPS, factor in mana regen, by either dumping some recast and cast times or make the mob live longer, OR giving the shaman class a strong passive self only mana regen.  Oh, one more thing you've already touched on as well, relying on rains for DPS is dangerous in tight quarter fighting.<br />
<br />
Burst DPS is another story, but I'd hope we can do better than 122 DPS in burst situations.  When I was lvl 60 raiding in HoT I was doing over 122 DPS burst as a casual player (easy to when the fight is long enough to actually stack DoTs and DD/rains).  As a 65 shaman with foci and AAs, I would expect better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I disagree.<br />
<br />
Few other classes have progressed massively, if any have.  They were simply better suited to that style from the beginning, but since it never existed before, no one knew, or even knew to speculate.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps you misunderstood what I meant about doing it all.  My intention was to show that we will never be able to do it all within the confines of the new &quot;vision&quot;.  No one can.  Fast fights mean specialization, or the ability to specialize.<br />
<br />
What I think we should seek for Shaman is not a single specialization, but the ability to choose one of our aspects, focus on it and contribute within the context of the content.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">all i'd like:<br />
<br />
1. -100 resist check on our curse dot line.<br />
<br />
2. reduce cast time of curse dots by 1.0 sec and kill recast. presumably we're still debuffing before we cast dots and such, reduced cast time shouldn't throw off balance.<br />
<br />
3. stop the insanity. the wave spell resist thing is crazy. <br />
<br />
4. we have no double attack or dual wield--allow us a higher multiplier on melee hits. doesn't sound like much, but it seems thematically feasible given that we wear chain and are all of races that tend to breed a lot of warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
all of these together would give us just enough small improvement to add up to a worthwhile change, and it seems to me that none of these would even come close to shifting the balance too much given the fact that we are still going to be casting other things before dots most fights, will still have to manage rains to avoid aggro problems, and will have to take time off of melee to canni up between fights--and more usable dots mean more use of canni.<br />
<br />
personally, i am squarely in the &quot;we are not a dps class&quot; camp. people who say the argument is ridiculous need to get over themselves. clerics don't have canni to allow them to nuke more than a couple times. in fast and furious fights they have to devote most of their attention to healing--which is usually the case wherever they are, anyways. additionally, their nukes aren't spectacular as it is. Bane + VS &gt; 2 cleric nukes, and is more than reallistic in a quick fight. druids are stuck between us and clerics, and IMO, they SHOULD have better nukes. their biggest heal costs 600 mana, so they don't have the option of spamming nukes if they are main heal in a group. if they are a support healer, they will be nuking somewhat more, but will still have to manage mana to be able to have some in the hole for those situations where they have to heal. <br />
<br />
on top of all that, part of what we have to take into consideration is the pre-GoD/OoW content. if we go out and get a 2400 point nuke, and have dots improved in any real way, we're going to be ridiculous in luclin, PoP, etc. the dev team has to look at balance in terms of more than JUST balancing us in context of the new expansions. <br />
<br />
<br />
little things that add up will help more than big things, IMO. <br />
<br />
and at the end of the day, i still want to FEEL like a shammy. i don't want to suddenly become a nuker. if i wanted to nuke and have big heals i'd have made a druid. let druids keep their identities. just make dots a bit more usable, give us that bigger melee multiplier, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
hrm...could even make cripple line have resist check of -100.</div></div><hr />

Actually, no where did you mention before that this was exclusive to the DPS role where we'd do nothing else but nuke.  It's sad that I'm expected to cast 2 spells per fight (of course you might mean chain casting the two spells, but again, I refer you to our requirement for active mana regen) and then mana regen when the druid is mitgating damage through heals and contributing DPS though a DD and DS to a factor where they are doing more damage plus can still sustain a single heal per fight.  I expect to be as viable a member of a party as a BL or druid is and I hope I am a more viable option in a strictly DPS role than a cleric (if we are tossing multi roles out the window).  I've done it all, granted, some of it rather poorly, but the strongest thing a shaman should bring to the table (if we're going to get slows and mana regen shoved down our throat) is the ability to fill in 2 or more roles.  Since I should only be smoking clerics on DPS on short fights, what other reason would someone want a shaman?  If we are talking about exceptional cases here (ie: the odd boss mob) then let's balance our class on the day to day basis before worrying about exceptional cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>whytewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Quick and easy are three things:<br />
<br />
1. Fix Dots:  Reduce aggro, improve cast times, improve resists.  We need to feel secure in casting them, be able to cast them in a fight and they need to stick or our DPS goes to 0.  (None of which happens 100%, but we must feel we have a chance).  Rain/Wave is horrible to use in many situations, especially with mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
2. We need one additional Nuke or fix the nukes we have.  Thinking of a Ranger as an example, they have a high mana nuke wich quick cast time, but high re-cast time, and a high cast time, but quick-recast time.  Work them together.  From a balance perspective, make it quick to cast, long to re-cast and maybe chew up a big chunk of our mana.  It is that last 20% that can kill a group.<br />
<br />
3.  Fix our heals.. Wait you say, this doesn't have anything to do with DPS?  Wrong.. If our heals were more efficient, we wouldn't worry abotu DPS as much, because we would find an additional role.<br />
<br />
I think the key is role here, and if you had a group and want to bring something ot the table that no one else can.  You look at Pali's fighting for better healing and it looks like they will get it, were we now fall to maybe 4th on the healing list?  BL, Bard, Chanter all heal, we may be first but the margin is slim.  Nuke, we are 4th, Wiz, Druid, mage.. I am ok with that.  (We may be 4th-7th with Cleric, Mage and Chanter)  Dots, Should we be number 1?  We are with Nec and Druid in 1-3.  Where am I going with this... Our speciality of slow and buff aren't as required, so for shamans to feel useful, either slow and buff need to become a factor or we add to another quality, such as DPS.  YOUR POINT and I finally got there, We can't be everything to everyone, but we need to be useful.  Sud you stated Shaman will never be able to it all, your right and wrong.  We already do it all but snare.  Really if you think about it, we are jack of all trades, which can be useful in a small group, but when there are more, you would rather of a specialist that excels in that trade..</div></div><hr />

I agree, I would expect a Shaman to be a far more viable option than a Cleric in a strictly DPS role.<br />

Well, a mage can (situationally as this is a bolt spell) cast Firebolt of Tallon  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3318&amp;source=Live) and in one spell do more DPS for 2/3 of the mana with a 7 second cast time and then sit around on thier backsides.  Even if they don't have a pet summoned they are still ahead on DPS and can easily sustain that.  Not only that but they have major DDs that hit in a couple resists while our mobs have to be susceptible to BOTH poisen and cold for us to hit the 122.  Now realistically, I should hope the mage could out burn me, no contest, but not only am I being outclassed while using 2 spells versus 1, cast time, mana cost, and resists, but there is NO advantage to my superior mana regen as I cannot use it to drop more nukes.<br />
<br />
Wizards are even more one sided and most melees don't need mana to sustain superior DPS.<br />
<br />
BoT players don't need much to tune them and a better nuke, rain fix (with a complete overhaul), or a solid DoT fix would do it, but I would think PoT shaman deep in GoD would require more than that to fix them.  Likely something more along the lines of what Blazz is proposing.  I agree with Murtak though, I'd like to see more data before settling in on a number.<br />
<br />
I will disagree on the exception though as you see it.  I would argue that as you progress the situation you describe is less the exception, and more the rule.  If slowing isn't effective in more content, I need to be able to contribute some decent DPS to compinsate, maybe even take advantage of my mana regen to be able to contribute more in the forms of additional buffs and/or heals.  While I agree that overcompinsating with an over the top nuke isn't the way to go, then I should be able to contribute in an additional role to make me a viable choice for the spot I am taking.  This means I need faster cast times/MUCH lower recast times or superior self passive mana regen.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the obvious straight comparisson (getting our butts served performance wise and not being able to get reasonably close with superior (although active) mana regen), there is the fact that hopefully, we're never JUST nuking, because if we are, there are 13 out of 14 (other classes) better classes out there for DPS.  That was my point and that we had to work twice as hard to even be in the same area code as the ballpark.

I think part of the problem with some of the responses so far is you are looking for solid answers to some totally theorethical situation.<br />
<br />
You initially posted about how we relate to unbuffed ranger DPS, like I know the poor fellas are always being rezzed, but its hardly realistic.<br />
<br />
Then you propose short fights, indeterminable of role/content/tier and expect solid suggestions?<br />
<br />
OK so lets narrow it down, DPS in a 30sec window, how many nukes etc, are rains viable etc etc? We still need context in which to discuss this. Are we talking Mr BoT shaman with 2.5 unbuffed hp and 50aa, or Mr Qvic shaman with 7k+ unbuffed hp and 500aa? Or somewhere between?<br />
<br />
I suggest breaking down the game to rough levels, and looking at our DPS role group/raid and what improvements are needed.<br />
<br />
ie: <br />
<br />
1. Normal Ldon/Tier2 pop<br />
2.Tier3 pop/VT/hard ldon<br />
3. EP/ GoD to Kodtaz<br />
4.Time/Ikkkinz+<br />
5.Qvic +<br />
<br />
ie: what level is this 122dps figure aimed at. What level are these no slow 30sec fights happening. Group or raid?<br />
<br />
I feel unless you are more specific about the context, perhaps including in-game examples from different levels of play, rather than theoretical thott-bot style analysis.<br />
<br />
What I'd personally like to see as DPS upgrade:<br />
<br />
1/ Reverse splurt curse dot, neg40 check, 1200, 800, 600, 400. Fast cast but curse style refresh. design for KT+ play level.<br />
<br />
2/ Fast, bad and expensive poison nuke. Make 'saryrn.' pres work with it. If we get nuke focus on ornate/EP etc, we are already considered a nuke class by sony, or they fear giving us a dot focus ;)<br />
<br />
3/change rain resist check to same as our nukes. lower recast on tears/torrent.<br />
<br />
4/ look at dot aggro/dps ratio.<br />
<br />
Anyway not flaming you, keep up the good work ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Grog, in your &quot;breakdown&quot; I don't see too many Shaman who fall into cat 1 complaining.  They wouldn't mind upgrades, but they are functional within the scope of their content.<br />
<br />
Some few in cat 2 grumble a bit, but still feel mostly effective and needed within their content.<br />
<br />
Cat 3 is the beginning of trouble, they are &quot;feeling the burn&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
Cat 4 are those who are really struggling hardcore to find a role and bring value to their groups.<br />
<br />
Cat 5 are on life support, what few there are.<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize that a Cat 1 Shaman is probably doing a lot less damage with Tears than a Cat 5 Shaman.  I accept that.  But at this time, the spells are the same.  They both cast Tears of Saryn.<br />
<br />
The gear and AA variances, in theory, should make a significant difference in the damage these two Shaman make casting the exact same spell.  I would say that the difference should equate to the necessary difference in DPS from 1 to 5.  <br />
<br />
If it does not, we are fighting the wrong battle trying to get our spells changed.  We should instead be looking to get gear or AA's added or changed.<br />
<br />
If it does, then we can simply look at the base values of the spells since they are identical and decide what amount of raw (unfocused, unAA'ed) DPS is required to make Shaman 5 have what he lacks.<br />

If you have a 3 tick DoT you might as well have a nuke or rain. Ways to adapt DoTs to short fights could be:<br />
<br />
1) Make them allmost insta-cast (0.5-1 seconds). Granted, this would unbalance soloing at lower levels because of rapid stacking, but at this point I dont think that lower level issues are too important. The faster cast time would be balanced against the fact that a DoT takes time to run. Stacking issues could be addressed by making DoTs of the same line not stack with each other.<br />
<br />
2) Make DoTs act as a mana drain on the caster, with an initial mana cost on casting, so that when the Mob dies they stop using mana. This would tie the mana cost to actual damage being done and make DoTs an efficient option for the classes that use them.<br />
<br />
3) Get rid of or significantly reduce the initial agro associated with casting the spell, so that people dont have to wait before using them.<br />
<br />
4) Make DoTs unresistable, but allow resist checks per tick (dont know how practical this would be)<br />
<br />
<br />
after reading this post, i would like all to know, that tugela is no longer a warrior main, hes half a shaman, amazingly well thought out post with ACTUAL good ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">One of the problems Shaman face is the new paradigm and that is speed, speed, speed. DPS, DPS, DPS.  <br />
<br />
The problem is players and their AA's and equipment are now built for the quick fight. However, most classes could easily transition to the long fight.  The problem is that the long fight becomes the not so long with Crit Nuke AA's, incredible DPS, Mana Regen 15 and then some, yadda, yadda.<br />
<br />
Remember when in Velious resists were huge? Especially in NTOV? Well back then you had to make some decisions on equipment. Not so anymore.  We're all HP whores.<br />
<br />
And ONCE you go the route of forcing players to go HP and speed - there is no turning back. Because we as players can just muscle our way through encounters where perhaps a higher FR is required.<br />
<br />
The Pandora's box of DPS + Speed &gt; * has been opened. You cannot close it without tectonic sized shifts to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Keep in mind that while Condemnation does 1100 vs Velium Strike at 925, most Clerics don't have the mana regen to cast that more than once every 30 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that we need help.  For some reason Fenril you seem to think that I am against us getting upgrades, and I am quite the opposite.<br />
<br />
I never said you were against us getting upgrades, just that the &quot;reasonable and logical&quot; thingy ticked me :p.<br />
<br />
The best cleric DD is Order, the ancient GoD spell if I'm right, 1210 base damage (to a class who is NOT a DPS, wtg SoE). You'll say that it's the ancient spell, so only 0,01% of the cleric population have it. So what ? Our major problems are related to PoP Time (a bit), LDoN hard and GoD (where is dropped the rune for order).<br />
<br />
If cleric X want to chain nuke, he has to mem 2 DD (stupid recast time on their DD), but still... Condemnation 1100 + Order 1210.<br />
Even if we chain nuke our best nuke, we are far from this. 2 Nukes of VS = 1850 dam and with longer casting time.<br />
And look at their OoW DD !!! it's worse, Reproach 1575 dam + Ancient Pious Conscience 1720dam while our is barely equal to Order (Ice Age, 1202dam) ????<br />
<br />
Now that's what I call something illogical  :mad: , especially for a class who own BAD (no other words) all other kind of priests in another vital slot, healing.<br />
<br />
I don't say that they should be nerfed (the day who I'll ask for a nerf, please, shoot me :D), but just that we should be equal to druids in healings and clerics in DD. Actually we are just barely buff bots and looking at the OoW spells, the situation will go worse as usual at each expension.<br />
<br />
I think that i'm one of the rare who don't ask to be a bit more close to druids and clerics in healing and dd, but who ask to be on par, not 1 or 2% behind. After the 2 majors screwings that SoE made us (first one was mitigation, second one was GoD fights), we desserve this and not less.<br />
Any kind of DoT won't help us in GoD, DoT = Damage over Time and even a huge damage 3 ticks DoT won't fit in GoD content (and anyway, with the bugged aggro, I can't imagine what would happens on such DoT :p).<br />
<br />
Up to Time Tier 2 or 3, we are good, needless to say. Our healing is suffisant, our slow is far less resisted/mitigated, fights last longer so we can do our job and even contribute to healing or DPS, even VS in its current status (925dam/7.8 sec cast time) seems to be ok... Phase 4 and 5, bah... bosses fights, nothing new :p, Quarm could be a bit painfull if you are only with a Pally in the group for the heals and unlucky (11 AE DD in a row is really harsh  :D ).<br />
<br />
LDoN Hard... the curse start. Short fight, mostly everything mitigate, healing start to be innefficiant, no time to cani for mana, DoT ... hmmm... forget DoT, bad idea :D, DD... well if you have time, usually after debuff, mob is near death.<br />
<br />
GoD... the curse goes on. More shorter fight, harder mitigation, healing totally innefficiant (1,5k heal vs 3k dam/round... the winner is ?). It was the first time (and badly not the last) I was spamming heal non-stop on a 10k war fighting a mitigated slowed mob and still watching his hps goin down to death..., and about DPS... well, what DPS ?<br />
<br />
OoW ??? Well, actually, I don't have enough faith in SoE to be a bit more optimist :p<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Tamariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Tam - are you mobs really lasting that long?  I don't doubt you it just seems a bit different than the experience most folks are having.<br />
<br />
How are you keeping up with Mana Regen?  You are spending an awful lot of time casting and burning a tremendous amount of mana on each mob.<br />
<br />
Time dont usually be a problem , with spell Haste IV and BoR (Slow 2,3 sec) and casting malos on incoming .<br />
Malos 3.8 + 2.25 recast 400 mana<br />
Slow 2.3 + 2.25 recast 250 mana<br />
Bane 4.2 + 2.25 recast 490 mana<br />
Tears 4.6 + 2.25 recast 450 mana<br />
Torrent 4.6 380 mana<br />
<br />
Less than 30 sec to cast all and the last tick of torrent if mobs is alive land about 40 secs from engage.<br />
<br />
About the mana , you cant do that in all mobs ( I have some mana reduction focus and espezialization in evocation ) but you can do it in a lot of them . I usually play with the same group of friends , War , Cle , Bard , Nec , SK and me (not a very high DPS group I know), with VoQ, Bard song , group mana tap from Nec (mobs with mana only) , Sk mana/heal tap , Canni V and my own mana regen , mana dont usually be a high problem , but no you cant do that in all mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I'm a category 2 shaman, so to speak, VT/Tier3, so can't comment intelligently above that level.  The problem I have seen that I can comment on is DoT agro, and this has only become a problem recently when I'm trying to do respectable DPS on VT bosses.  I say they make SCS an active AA, not a passive one.  I'm not going to get further ranks in SCS because there are times when I want to get snap agro, to pull mobs out of a group to root it, or to grab it off the cleric so he can do his job on a big pull.<br />
<br />
It's reasonable that SCS should be active if you consider what it is;  the caster makes it less obvious who's casting the spell on a mob by using smaller gestures, learning to make a quiet incantation effective, whatever.  This won't fix the problem entirely, since DoT agro is so fubar, but it will reduce the amount of agro you generate over the course of the fight, reduce your hate counters when you slow, nuke and debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Tam, it's nice that this works for you.  However, the mobs and content where Shaman are having trouble is obviously not the same as what you are working in.  A Tipt mob that lasts 45+ seconds has probably killed half the party already.  And Tipt is really only the &quot;tip&quot; of the iceberg.  (Sorry, I couldn't resist)<br />
<br />
Kil - ShadowKnights have asked that SCS be switchable and it doesn't look good.  I'd say that if grabbing aggro is important to you, don't train SCS.  I think it's all a matter of deciding whether that particular AA suits your style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Tam, aside from Sudedor's comment (which is likely bang on), as you said you have a low DPS group (a good, balanced group, but low DPS).  Part of your success is based on the specific, and somewhat uncommon group composition.  There is nothing really wrong with the shaman class once you slow down kills, but in faster paced groups we don't bring as much to the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">In pondering our DPS in another thread, I hit upon something I'd like to know how everyone feels about.<br />
<br />
Murtak's stickied thread of Shaman improvements puts our nuke DPS around 122 I believe.  I've not really seen anyone say yea or nay whether that is where they feel we should be.  However . . .<br />
<br />
If we feel that 122 DPS is an acceptable level of DPS for the Shaman, then perhaps we are a lot closer than we think to where we wish to be.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn + Velium Strike:<br />
<br />
Assume one wave of Tears is resisted. (Yea, that does suck, but its reality). Anyway . . . 2 waves of Tears + Velium Strike = 123.6 DPS. Add in dogdog's 25 DPS and we're just below and unhasted Ranger, generally thought to be around 157 DPS.<br />
<br />
Comments ?<br />

I'm very far from that kind of dps while raiding GoD on named mobs.<br />

<br />
From this guy name, you can imagine he is not alone and that there are a few other like him.<br />
They all resist like him poison and cold like this guy is resisting magic.<br />
Also, other shaman were trying nihil with the same luck.<br />
<br />
number of Turgur's casted : 14<br />
number of Turgur's resisted : 14<br />
That's 0.172 Turgur / sec :p<br />
<br />
Oh.. and I did 50 dmg with my spear !!<br />
<br />
ph34r my leet dps !!<br />
<br />
And sorry for the log thingy.. I m not good at parsing log with my little hands without parser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Wud - I haven't had a chance to delve into those numbers yet, but I wanted to express my great appreciation to you for even getting these together for me.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Just right off the bat, I find this interesting:<br />
<br />
There should have been 27 waves of Tears, Wud said the mob was moving a lot, so that's where he lost the one wave and came up with his total of 26.  So far so good.<br />
<br />
Of those 26 waves that actually hit the mob, there was a resist rate of 69%!  Good god y'all!<br />
<br />
Now, Spear of Torment was cast 9 times and boiled down to a resist rate of 12%.  I'd call that &quot;acceptable&quot; for a resist rate and I think most casters would as well.<br />
<br />
But *** with Tears?  Even if you took off the built in 20% . . . 49% resist vs 12% ?<br />
<br />
If we can get some more data on this, I think we may have a case here.  There is no way I buy a 69% resist rate on any spell.  That's just wrong.  Perhaps some code that has gotten stacked on or inadvertantly altered . . . I dunno.<br />
<br />
It's possible that this is just a statistical aberration, thus the need for some additional data.  But this is something I really think we should look at.<br />
<br />
More analysis soon, work permitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">It's possible that this is just a statistical aberration, thus the need for some additional data.  But this is something I really think we should look at.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish it's just a statistical aberration, but it's not, at least for raid mobs in that zone.<br />
In other zone, it's different, you can't really use rains because of adds and if you dot, at some point you might get aggro (because of the design of the encounter, your dot is the only thing building aggro on  the mob at some point).<br />
I know I've died a few times because of pox (easy casting from pants) getting direct aggro from nameds  :confused: (unlike necro that can dot and FD) in inktu'ta and txevu and it wasn't a problem of tick crit .. <br />
Also, some fun encounter have the boss sorta depop and repop every 20 or 30 sec, so all your dot are gone with the boss every 20 sec or 30 sec or so (so does all debuff too, but it's not the point here).<br />
 <br />
Trash mob have different resist and VS or SoT are landing ok(if you have time to cast em before mob dies).<br />
I didn't try Tears of Saryrn on trash, too many adds mezzed around that can one round chanters. <br />
<br />
I guess I could try using more rains to see how they are resisted.<br />
Basically, on boss, we can't really do dmg outside our DD because of design or resist and on trash mob, they die a bit too fast for allowing us to land more than 1 nuke when you are lucky.<br />
<br />
I'll try to find time to get you more numbers.</div></div><hr />
