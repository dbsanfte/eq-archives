<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, about last month, after having the spell since the day it was released, I finally got the sense to make a macro for my Canni IV that was /cast 6 one line, then /pause # the next line, and staggered so forth, to cast it three times.  <br />
<br />
Now if I'm grouping I never use it, but if I ever happen to be grinding out a few AA's solo or duo, it helps ease the soreness in my finger... BUT...<br />
<br />
The pause seems to vary a LOT.  At first I set it to 52, which caused the macro to hit the spell about half a second after it ungreyed.  Later that day, all of the sudden the macro was not hitting the spell until a good 2 seconds after it ungreyed.  So, I adjust it down to 48.5, and it works as it had before.<br />
<br />
Then, about two hours later, it's casting it too quick, and I have to put it up to 54 to make it cast regularly.<br />
<br />
Since then I've given up trying to keep it so it casts it as fast as possible... I just leave a second and a half buffer there for variance.<br />
<br />
Any idea on why the heck it is so variable?  Is it a lag thing?  Because it doesn't seem to vary but once every few hours and sometimes it won't change at all.  Anybody else havin' this problem?  What number do you use for your delay, and does it screw up much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/pause is still the same.  Each unit of pause is 0.1 seconds.  <br />
<br />
It's client/server synchronization that's changing things.  Not just physical here-to-there lag (I can ping the servers with comfortably low numbers), it's the server having to think a few bits before replying and confirming an action is underway.<br />
<br />
Edit:  52, BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shandy, is that the same reason I continually get the:<br />
<br />
&quot; Spell recovery time not yet met &quot; message?<br />
<br />
Man, talk about pissing me off to no end. I haven't been that mad since jerry jones (the anti-christ) fired Jimmy Johnson as head coach of the Cowboys.<br />
<br />
No wait, I was equally p.o.'ed when they cancelled  Dragnet  with Al Bundy just after Roselyn Sanchez was added to the cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's pretty much how I understand it, Faern.  The server itself is running behind.  I wish it were limited to high-population zones.  When there are only 7 people soloing in a zone and you all have the same half-second-to-a-second added on to everything you do, it pretty much rules out standard internet lag and people's client setups.<br />
<br />
I do something<br />
Server gets the info<br />
Server processes all the other info for the zone/zones it deals with.<br />
0.5-0.75 seconds after it gets my info, server processes my info.<br />
I get info back.<br />
<br />
There's either something wonky with SoE's internal traffic or their interserver synchronization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed that on a raid (lots of ppl around with lags) the pause tend to get longer. Basically on raids / intense graphics areas I cannot use the pause on macros.</div></div><hr />

casts canni IV 5 times. the pause has to go before the action for some reason. Nice macro for 25 seconds of AFK! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its the same reason some people 20K when they zone into some places. The server thinks they fell a mile, because of the serversync, heh, even though it was just a little hop-drop. Fire is notorious for this, I ALWAYS levi before I zone in there now.</div></div><hr />

PWNAGE!  Thanks Grizlor =P<br />
<br />
Now I can go get a beer and pretend I hit the button for ancient canni before I left.  Whoady!</div></div><hr />
