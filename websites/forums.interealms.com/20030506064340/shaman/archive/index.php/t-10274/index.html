<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3areas of interest on your map.  <br />
1. area 3 is where Nathyn Illuminous' house is. 2 sonic wolves and 2 guards out front, more guards inside.<br />
<br />
Nice spot because killing these guards RAISES your faction with other guards, merchants etc.  bad spot because once you have bad faction here, the guard's aggro range is HUGE.<br />
<br />
2. The twilight sea zone in.   you have 6 static guards and 2 roamers there.  Lower level than nathyns, but easy.  also, when you zone into Katta from twilight, if you take the bridge out of this room to your right, jump off and swim to the wall, there is an icon there (a big white picture) that you can click to zap right to the bank (area 11)<br />
<br />
Drops faction with Katta<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Area 11.  The bank.  Lots of people kill bank guards, lots of guards to kill.  I understand that there are some quest drops from the guards inside the bank.<br />
<br />
Drops Katta fation<br />
<br />
All are fine 2 boxing, but once you hit 57ish, forget the second box, you don't need it.<br />
<br />
I did all of these at 56 solo w/ epic- bane- jbb- horse- alpha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Out of the three spots posted above, I like the bank guards my self. Pull with slow, you will most likely get two (unless you are high enough to single them), Just root one and deal with it after you're done with your first victim &gt;=). At 54 this is a very easy camp (regen BP, no epic, no JBB), just slow, VoS, and Ebolt then send dogdog in, once VoS wears off recast Ebolt. It will be dead a few seconds before it wears off again. Loot is meh, nothing to go crazy about, up to 5 plat a kill and they drop weapons that sell for about the price of FS. Gook luck, its a nice camp =)</div></div><hr />

Does this &quot;zap&quot; you to a safe spot or can you expect to be jumped when you arrive?  Thanks for the info  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nathyn's Guards are easy and fun.<br />
<br />
Single Pull at longest range.<br />
Sick pet.<br />
Dot him.<br />
Can while you wait for da JBB to refresh.  (If you have such).<br />
<br />
For best effects use the guards weapons against them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure how safe the spot is where you get ported from clicking on the wall since I always have invis up anyway ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at 55 i have trouble pulling from inside the house, i get 2 mostly but have got all 4 once and that was nono fun.  anyway, any suggestions?  thought about moving inside b/c i'm not kos yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Added info, from my experience dere:<br />
<br />
The port from the icon at TS zone in drops you out in the middle of the bank area.  You will not aggro any of the static guards there, and can run to the wall or invis up safely.  If some one has got the guards moving around, is a good idea to have invis up.<br />
<br />
The guards INSIDE the bank are a higher level thatn the guards outside - Centurions, iirc.  The one time I got adds (level 58 at the time) two of em came out and wiped me fast.  root didn't stick long enough to gate.  That is why you should always invis up to go in and bank - go behind the bankers to deal with them.<br />
<br />
And another place to hunt is where the walkway around to left from the TS zone in reaches the tunnels.  About neg 500 and neg 1800 on the map you link.  This has one big advantage to someone learning tohunt these guards, as you can always single pull them if you are careful.   you do need to learn to time the roamers.   The trick is that these guards in the tunnels aggro on line of sight, so you can edge up so that you can see only one of the two at the first turn in the tunnel.  pull and kill, then do the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a word of warning - if you're low enough to not get single pulls, the pathing in this place is absolutely horrid (would you expect anything else from Sony?).  I've pulled mobs only to have them run AWAY from me, picking up like 10 friends in the process, before finally pathing over to me.  This was at 55.  You might want to wait till at the very least 57 or 58 to exp here, as Sony is too incompetent to make the pathing any better than horrible, and gave us a summon pet spell instead of fixing it.. Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried the guards at the Twilight Sea zone line at 55 and could not single pull.  Dinged 56 and can now single pull everytime except the 2 guards nearest the zone in.  You have to get too close to both of them to engage and get proximity aggro with them both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spent a lot of 56-58 killing Nathyn's Guards.<br />
<br />
I could not single pull from inside the house until level 57.  Single pulling the outside 4 guards was easy....stand at max range and cast slow.  <br />
<br />
I set up camp at back of the mansion (and after I went KOS learned I could just hop the wall around the mansion to get back there--sonic wolfie guards see thru invis, so avoided them until pet up are gtg).<br />
<br />
Nathyn's camp was nice, easy, quiet exp.  The pp from selling the swords the guards drop was enough to cover KEI costs per session, but not much left over.  <br />
