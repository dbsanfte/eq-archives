<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">sitting here at work being bored so i figured i'd run the numbers on the dots and see what kind of dps a shaman could produce. this is what i figured with pox/bon/jbb/dogdog assuming no resists you will be doing about 103dps. i really didn't know what the pet could do dps wise, so i just put 15 (underestimating prooly) plus thats kind of hard to figure with out actual parsing, mobs ac really can differ a lot. plus almost everything is red/yellow to the lil guy so its not real fair like to him. anyhow with plauge/eblot/dogdog/jbb i figured roughly 89dps. that is pretty good! can anyone really confirm a dps on the epic? we all know its like 1200ish on mobs, and we also know its a splurt style dot. can anyone confirm a dps on the epic dot?<br />
<br />
anyhow if a shaman is actually trying to put out some damage on a high hp mob they can. i never really thought one could put out that much damage with dots, we acutally get some pretty nice ones. i'll go run some numbers on necro dots some time..that would be insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so no idea eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do understand what you are doing but...<br />
<br />
Why do people always add in the JBB, Epic and rare spells? Contrary to popular belief and the idea you get from reading these boards not everyone has these items.<br />
<br />
I've been on Xev since December of 2000 and have never seen either item in action and don't know anyone who has the spells either except for people I met here and then talked to in the game. Your average Joe Shaman is Ghetto compared to what is considered a Trash Shaman here.<br />
<br />
This board has the BEST played and BEST equiped Shaman in the game as participants and by no means can average be parsed from their posts. If VI bases upgrade decisions on what they read here then there will never be hope for the casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i was basicly trying to see what maximum damage out put with the dots were. ebolt and plauge (vendor bought, you know that) and pox and bon. also the jbb isn't that hard to get, i got one for 15k on xev a few months back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, don't forget that 1/5th of shaman can't even use a JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe we could take the DPS for the pet, epic, JBB, and our four main DoTs separately, for those interested in their personal potential max DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am anything but uber. My guild only recently started getting into NToV. I've had my JBB for almost a year. I made 60 in July of last year. I do have all the highest DoTs a shaman can have, not counting the Ancient spells. My armor is full Kael, except the one bracer is the JBB. I did recently get a facesmasher from NToV, but its overall effect on my soloing ability is pretty minor considering how much a shaman missed when swinging.<br />
<br />
When I cant find a group, I go to Fungus Grove, summon a puppy, buff it with Focus, AGI and Celerity, and then proceed to slow, Poxx, and drop epic dot on a shroom, and then JBB and melee it until dead. I find that I can kill mobs almost as fast as melee do, but that I have less downtime than they do since I keep regen on myself and do my best to keep KEI/C3 up as well. With a little playing around, you can go almost non-stop, and get some good exp in the process.<br />
<br />
Another point is that Verant will *ALWAYS* base their decisions on extreamly well equipped players, since in their minds, everyone will reach that point someday. Look at the continual upgrades they do. Vulak was relatively easy for a year. Then someone decided that it was too easy, and they turn it into a ring that makes getting to him almost impossible for the vast majority of the guilds. Fear and Hate were both upgraded as well not long ago, again because it was too easy for the best guilds. My guild is quickly reaching the point where we can kill any mob in the game. In fact, we think we were the only guild to kill Tunare 2.0 multiple times before even clearing NToV once. Getting to all the main mobs in Ssra and to Seru is about all we havent tried yet. And those will happen soon.<br />
<br />
In any case, shaman can do nice damage WHEN our spells land. Unfortunately, it seems that most uber mobs resist nearly everything we have. And that leaves us with some pretty crappy melee skills to fall back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ya i agree shaman damage isn't ussaly a factor on raids, just because generaly they are bussy debuffing and dots are just way to much unwanted agro. course that dps is purely on asumption that there are no resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;b&gt;Another point is that Verant will *ALWAYS* base their decisions on extreamly well equipped players, since in their minds, everyone will reach that point someday&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
You're right and hopefully they won't be bit by this when the next *BIG* thing comes along. If a game was ever made with EQ's relative quality that also catered to both the &quot;gamer&quot; and the casual player they would see how really big this market can be.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to wonder about VI's enrollment figures, if they're just counting accounts and not billing addresses thay might almost have to halve their numbers as to actual DIFFERENT people playing. Most people I talk to these days have multiple accounts.<br />
<br />
Again though, we still never got what we wanted and that's a virtual fantasy world that works similiar to a real world, for all it's trappings EQ is still just a FPS with a magic twist, the  people that succeed are the same that do well in any types of games that require real-time reflexes and action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;the people that succeed are the same that do well in any types of games that require real-time reflexes and action&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, social interaction plays a much bigger part than this.<br />
<br />
Back on topic though.  Using puppy/BoN/Ebolt/Epic/JBB, I've estimated my dps at somewhere around 100 dps.  I haven't crunched to many numbers.  My method is easy.  It takes me around a minute to kill a mob with about 5 - 7k hp.   Take 6000 divided by 60 seconds and you get 100.  Nice and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;b&gt;Actually, social interaction plays a much bigger part than this.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
If that's the case I should be level 60 by now because all I do anymore is interact socially. <br />
<br />
What can you do but fight and then fight some more? I should have said though that EQ is a FPS bred with a fighting MUD and people who have good hand-eye coordination and reflexes along with some brains will excel and arthritic old men like me get left on the sidelines, a modicum of brains alone won't cut it.<br />
<br />
Yeah to get back on topic, don't underestimate the power of a hasted pup on stuff you may fight around my level (53) solo, they still do a decent amount of damage, for example a pup would steal the experience from me if I fought an experience  green Seafury and didn't Ebolt twice. In otherwords the pup did more damage than one Ebolt and my melee together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On mobs high HP mobs with low resists i can outdamage anyone in my guild except rogues.<br />
<br />
I worked out that when bane, pox, epic and odd jbb blast are pumping, i was getting well over 80 dps.<br />
<br />
Thing that holds me back is either the aggro or the fact we have other shaman in the team. Worst thing is landing all the dots and thinking i'm safe, then epic starts hitting hard and boof, you will not evade me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">in the world of pretend<br />
i was looking at it this way, saying there were no resists etc<br />
in a 2 minish fight you could<br />
epic, pox, 2 banes, 10 jbbs for around 9200 /76dps (1280 mana)<br />
epic, pox, 2 banes, 10 ice strikes for around 13300 /113dps (3780 mana)<br />
<br />
i forgot if the recast timer on torrent of poison begins <br />
if it starts after the last wave<br />
5 top for 8100 / 71dps (1900 mana)<br />
if it starts when you get done casting<br />
7 top for 11300 / 98dps (2600 mana)<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the puppy<br />
someone did a big post about it long ago, with alot of tests, but i forgot that.<br />
i do remember my puppy doing like 3dps vs red to 60 mobs<br />
and around 20+ to exp mobs.</div></div><hr />
