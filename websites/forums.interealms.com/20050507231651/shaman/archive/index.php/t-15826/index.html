<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did search around the forums to see if this had been posted before.  Tho not extensively.  If this is common information you can smack me.  :)  I found it extremely useful so who am I not to pass it along.<br />
<br />
EQ has a function in it's code that disables alt+tab functionality within the game.  For whatever odd reason, this code was not removed when SOE implemented the window mode.<br />
<br />
So for the most of us, we are still stuck using alt+clr+r (eqw) to manually release the mouse so we can access windows which at least I find to be fairly annoying.<br />
<br />
That being the case ..<br />
<br />

<br />
Is a free microsoft program that will allow you to modify the way EQ in it's windowed mode operates.<br />
<br />
As I have no method presenlty to host some images (hint: someone with some server space lemme know and i'll edit them in) the directions are as follows.<br />
<br />
Once installed, start the program and you will see a basic explorer tree format.  If you scroll down the tree you will find everquest and it will have one entry.  That entry is labeled &quot;Disable Alt Tab&quot; or something close to that effect.  Right click -&gt; Disable entry and then restart everquest and you should be able to alt tab out of EQ into other programs without releasing the mouse cursor over to the system.  I've found it particularly useful when I'm running 2 eqws on one machine and it lets me quickly change views with a function I am used to using.<br />
<br />
Hope some of you will find it useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korshatiz123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">eqw from eqwindows.com does the same thing (alt-tab windowing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not if your running windows xp. But his fix does work, thats what I did. It tells you how to do it in the eqwindows.com forums also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They removed the alt-tab limitation a long time ago in EQ.  It's Microsoft's application compatibility database that is screwing things up hence why you have to install that tool and modify the database to make it work right.<br />
<br />
Anyone running Windows XP should do this, by the way.  This makes EQ run MUCH more stable under the OS plus allows you to use other programs that use DirectInput for hotkeys to their full extent.  Some program examples would be FRAPS and TeamSound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">UNfortunately, on my computer it's stuck on ignore alttab and I can't right click or use the menus to change, it's greyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's the exact instructions:<br />
<br />
1) Download and install Windows Application Compatiblity Toolkit.<br />
<br />
2) Run Compatbility Administration Tool<br />
<br />
3) Expand the 'Applications' listing in the window.  There will be a lot of apps there by name.  Scroll down to Everquest and make sure it's hilighted.  This will show eqgame.exe with some sub categories on the right.<br />
<br />
4) Right click on eqgame.exe in that window and select 'Disable entry' from the menu.<br />
<br />
5) Close the tool.  Voila you're fixed!</div></div><hr />
