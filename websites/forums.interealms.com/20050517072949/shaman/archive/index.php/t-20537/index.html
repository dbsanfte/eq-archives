<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya, it's me again!  The scalely pain in the rear for SoE.  I dunno about you guys, but I continually get frustrated when people are 'working' on a problem and go radio silent.<br />
<br />
Lots of folks have asked if SoE now considers us balanced or if further changes are under consideration.  Folks at SoE haven't bothered to reply yet, of course.  So, I sent Brenlo an email (copied below for those curious).<br />
<br />
I don't want to start another huge bunch of threads on this topic here in the Crucible, but did want to keep people in the loop.  I'll let you know if Brenlo sends a response.  Hopefully he'll post.<br />

<br />
Brenlo,<br />
<br />
Heh, after all the massive shaman threads, I feel kinda bad about writing you but . . .<br />
<br />
The shaman could really use a little more communication.  Sorry for the length of this email, but I felt some evidence/explanation of the issues was needed for clarification.<br />
<br />
Right now, there is a lot of confusion over several issues.  First, are we done?  Was the healing changes the sum total of our ‘balancing’?  I don’t mean for good, but for the short term at least.  Are we likely to see any other changes? <br />
<br />
Have there been any move to address the underlying healing percentages?  Specifically, there is a fair bit of disgruntlement that our healing has been restored to only our PoP percentages.  In terms of raw upgrade, it’s about half what most shaman agreed we needed in GoD—specifically, we healed 1300 with tnargs, we thought 1750 would be the lowest effective amount, and we got 1550.  <br />
<br />
The healing percentages in PoP were aligned PRIOR to the implementation of slow mitigation.  Thus, Shaman were nerfed in PoP, and never got our heals adjusted after the mitigation went live.  Putting us back into the same percentages doesn’t address that issue.  Further, the encounters in GoD are not simply hp/dps increases—they are a more fundamental shift in game mechanics.  Apparently we were pegged at 47% of cleric heals at least as far back as the inception of PoP. That was before (a) mitigation, and (b) the change to mob hp vs dps. <br />
<br />
The shaman have been arguing, so far unsuccessfully in terms of getting even a reply, that due to the widespread prevalence of mitigation the dev's need to examine the base percentage of heals for high level heals. More specifically, since stuff now mitigates about 50% of our slows to have a net slow of around 37.5%, many feel that shaman heals need to be bumped up in base percentage terms.  I would argue that druids need to be bumped up too. (Maybe 54% and 70% of cleric heals respectively?)<br />
<br />
When mobs mitigate, their dps does not go down as much, but our healing ability does not compensate. No other healing class is balanced against slow (I discount the minor heals that BLs get), so it only really affects shaman. Thus, while mitigation effects all slowing classes, it really double whacks the shaman since our heals remain unchanged. That problem goes back to PoP.<br />
<br />
Now enter GoD, where mobs hit much harder and mitigate, but have less hitpoints. Fights are over faster, so over the course of a fight, mitigated slows, or even bounced slows are of substantially less importance to clerics or druids. The difference of mitigated slows over the course of a 30 second fight is relatively trivial to clerics or druids (their heals aren’t balanced against slow), especially since most cleric and druid heals contain an 'overheal' component--heals above and beyond the hp the tank has. GoD reduces that overheal component a lot, so much so that many cleric/druid heals hit for full efficiency. To some extent, that makes druids and clerics MORE efficient, though at the cost of some anxiety since you have larger spikes in hp! Pity the hapless tanks!<br />
<br />
Shaman heals, on the other hand, are effectively gimped further. We were already healing for full efficiency due to lower hp heals. Now we have a situation where we are penalized for slow by having a heal that, because it almost always hits for full, can't get any more efficient, and it’s over the course of fights that further trivialize the impact of slow by being of such short duration. Slow saves us mana on healing over the course of a longer fight. Short duration fights, especially since we have to slow at the beginning just don't prevent as much damage.<br />
<br />
Shaman were designed as an endurance class, and that concept is no longer relevant in GoD. Slow makes healing more efficient over the course of long fights. Thus, by slow, shaman add endurance to the healers' mana. Over the short term, we don't really save them ANY mana--they still have to heal once or twice. Over the long term, we can save them a TON of heals.<br />
<br />
DoTs take a long time to work. Cannabalize/mana regen depends on our ability to take the time to do it. Burst healing and dps is now king, but shaman are at best pawns at both of those areas.<br />
<br />
While I’m on the subject, is anyone examining shaman dps over short term fights?  I’m talking about in terms of reasonable mana-efficiency and time.  Sure, shaman could stack 3 dots and nuke a mob once so that for one or two tics we do a lot of damage—but we’d be out of mana in like 4-5 mobs.  Not to mention that we’d probably be summoned and dead after the first mob.<br />
<br />
Are shaman just basically hosed for GoD?  There seem to be some fundamental game balance issues on shaman at the moment, and while the healing upgrade helped, it hasn’t addressed any of the real underlying issues.  It stuffed us back into a position where we were already hurting.<br />
<br />
We can’t flop like necros to dump agro.  We can’t jolt like a ranger.  Channelling through a mitigating mob is luck.  We can pull agro off a non-uber tank with a single DoT at 80% of mob life.  We can’t nuke worth a poop.  Our buffs (expecting 1 hp buff) are no longer of use.<br />
<br />
If you don’t want to post on the shaman boards, fine.  How about just replying to this email with something I can post on the shaman boards?  Are shaman ‘done’?  Are we ‘balanced’ now that our dps and heals are back on a PoP level?  (Hint: pretty much all the other classes got a raw dps upgrade with GoD)<br />
<br />
I know you guys have been trying to look into shaman, but can you talk to us a bit while you do it?<br />
<br />
One last thing--thanks for being the point man!  You have a rough job basically fielding tons of angry emails, and I doubt you get anywhere near the credit you deserve for a rough job!<br />

<br />
I like it, but I'm not sure if I'd have used some words like &quot;gimped&quot; when talking to an SoE rep.  Aside from the word usage, it outlines our issues well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">definatly a good e-mail, I still need to see the quicker malos cast before im totally happy, and maybe a better &quot;Cheal&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good email, as always Chutoi, I just hope its not deaf ears that it falls on...the one glaring thing that really stands out about our current place in the game is that we simply havent been answered about their position, what we will or wont see.<br />
It would be nice to simply have an email or message posted here that said, once and for all, &quot; the 1550 point heal is as good as it gets, and stat buffs on Focus will remain, neener neener neener&quot; or that said &quot;oops we really meant it to be XXXX heal, and while were at it heres a few changes to Focus&quot;.<br />
Eh, I just chug along and play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just hope its not deaf ears that it falls on....<br />
<br />
I don't think the problem is deaf ears.  I think the problem is that this expansion is finished and developers have been told by their supervisors that their priority should be new expansions.  Developers may be sympathetic, but they are simply too busy producing new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemdall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At least you tried.  I don't hold any hope of getting a response or action, but saying something is better than saying nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you for emailing SOE. I suspect &quot;gimped&quot; was the politest term you could think of  :) I admire your restraint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Chutoi<br />
<br />
In this era of fixing long standing problems across classes, it would be great if Dev's can follow with corrections on Shaman class.   <br />
<br />
It was easy for Dev's to work in a change on our heals when they noticed that healing percentages for Shaman's were still based on pre-PoP numbers thus not keeping up with other healers.  By the same logic, Damage numbers seem to be tagged to Pre-PoP numbers instead of keeping up.  <br />
<br />
When Ranger archery wall issues can be resolved and pet classes tweaked in raw numbers ... surely the weakest Priest burst DPS  class can see some adjustments (if only in discussion on direction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good email, aside from a few word choices (gimped  :D ), I think it clearly stated the core issues confronting the shaman class in the newer content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/cheer Chutoi<br />
Good job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">personally past 60 i think the whole classes needs a revamp to make it fun again, and some of the aa looked at too.<br />
<br />
however nice email, i just expect the poeple involved will pretend their dumb and wont say anything. this is because the amount of business they`ll lose if  most of the shaman ,who feel the problems at higher level, leave will likely lose them less $  or not enough than trying to fix the problem. And this is the main reason why i am dubivous of how good eq2 will be.. that and the fact out of thier 48 classes there is actually only 12 and 4 artisan classes ..whoopie.<br />
<br />
but then i was hoping for a more you could specialise in pet/dots/dd , you get all but one you master, one your good at and the other average.<br />
depending what you do depends final class. spiritshaper (pets) , spiritsaper(dots) , spiritchanneler (dd)  but all shaman, dps very similar just different delivery. could all ahve same buffs, but the why they heal maybe affect the first part, so have 3 names for that. etc anyway sory seem to have wondered off track: sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good e-mail Chutoi and thanks for doing this, however I personally have lost all the faith in SOE. We're a forgotten class. Besides the healing and slow issues you mentioned, we offer no utilization of any kind. Stat buffs are wortless nowadays, for FoT7th shaman doesn't need to be in the group, and that's that - BST and chanter can slow, difference lately between the slows is too small to mean anything, and with the mitigation, doesn't even matter much, and both of these classes offer much more utilization in a single run then we ever will do. Right now we still are goot for HoH, BoT and normal LDoN runs and are asked for it, but in higher end areas, the issue is becoming more and more apparent - groups rather take BST or chanter to GoD, hard LDoN and such runs, because they do what we do, plus much more.<br />
<br />
Add some other expansion similar to GoD, and without doing anything to the shamans, and we will become like the warriors used to be - useful only on raiding, in everyday gaming, useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really get tired of the belief that the Druid must have the secondary healing role to be useful in groups.  <br />
<br />
First: The high end charmed pets do insane damage.  Did the Tipt trial with druid and mobs dropped so fast cleric hardly had to heal!<br />
<br />
Second:  Druid buffs are probablly more useful than ours except maybe for FA.  I would take Bot9 any day over Fo7.<br />
<br />
Third:  Their Succor is often a group saving action.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So come on, demand at least parity with druids on healing if you expect changes in healing to really affect game balance.  Or better yet some other USEFUL and DEFINING ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Great email. I just hope it doesn't go unread :(</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more. Anyone who thinks druids only purpose ina  group is to heal has no clue what that class brings to the table. Thier group desirability has risen alot since PoP came out, while ours has only remained stagnant or decreased.</div></div><hr />

Great e-mail + thread.  SOE will probably read and pay attention if we're not complaining lo=ike spoiled brats all the time.<br />
