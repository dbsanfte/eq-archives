<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dulthun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a couple of years playing melees (55 Warrior, 48 Ranger, 35 Rogue, 51 Paladin), I have changed servers to help a friend out at work and have changed classes to Shaman.  I know that I will be frequenting these boards often to obtain a wealth of information that you guys give. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for all the help I know I will get.  And so you guys know, I do know how to use the Search button.  No equipment thread from me. <br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome Aboard.<br />
<br />
This place is the best resource of shaman information you could hope to find.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the community as a whole is pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
If you don't find an answer you're lookin for, don't hesitate to ask.<br />
<br />
Also /join serverwide.crucible:crucible is a nice place for in game information if you don't happen to have a 2nd computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dulthun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the chat info.  I'll be sure to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As long as you search for many common threads and don't find the info you're looking for, ask away and we're more than happy to help.   Just be sure to read past opinions before jumping into the &quot;Why should I put on AC when I'm a Wis caster!&quot; argument, ok?  :)<br />
<br />
Welcome aboard, looking forward to hearing how your melee background influences your opinions.<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dulthun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Taladaen.<br />
<br />
In fact, I have read many of the opinions on the AC/HP vs WIS debate prior to casting my bones.  Look at my Magelo to see the route I have taken.</div></div><hr />
