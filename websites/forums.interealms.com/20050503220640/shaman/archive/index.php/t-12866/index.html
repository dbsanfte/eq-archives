<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what are the pros and cons of frogloks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are you intending to do with your froglok?  This might help answer the question if we had a bit more info.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
decent stats-comparable to human<br />
some sort of enhanced vision<br />
ability to hold breath a long time underwater<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
No regen like iksar or trolls<br />
Less starting stamina than large races so less hp<br />
No ability to slam, if that matters<br />
<br />
I am not sure of xp penalties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurrpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No experience penalty on a Froglok.<br />
<br />
Hammar's right. Think of a Froglok Shaman the way you'd think of a Human shaman and you've got the right idea. We get infravision, a 125 swimming skill, and roughly double the time underwater of anyone else.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you get dizzy doing blackflips all night while slowing mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cons:<br />
<br />
Having frogs as a player race just sucks the life out of EQ as a &quot;fantasy&quot; game and places it firmly in the realm of cartoon.<br />
<br />
I hate frogs :).<br />
<br />
lizards, cats, and now frogs.... barf.<br />
<br />
Personaly I think the curent plague of frogs is a sign from Moses that EQ is getting close to the end and because of that I hate them, refuse to buff / group with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pros:<br />

Also *** Yedra, 60 already!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slurrpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Between Paludal, DSP, and PoP, it's relatively easy to get a toon to 60, without powerlevelling. Heck, it's been two months since LoY was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">one thing i was wondering about was the Agi and Dex being so high, wouldnt that make maxxing out Melee stats faster/make you melee better during solo?  I tank with my dog, and i am always trying to max weapon skills.  Also, Agi raises AC in a way i heard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pro:<br />
- Great to pick on.<br />
- Many retarded names like: Kermitt, Frogg, Froooakk<br />

- They suck.</div></div><hr />

It makes you LOOK like a gay bonetard. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, I really enjoy playing Frogloks, they're different, and even though hey are hard to take serious, sometimes so am I. So, the Froglok race is cool, even though you sometimes get a lot of crap but hey, you guys cant do backflips can ya? Frog p0wa!<br />
<br />
Edit: Spelling on They're</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like the froglok models. I think they did a nice job on them. I think I'm going to have my guild all make newbies frogloks on another server to play one night a week. <br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pro: you arent a troll, and avoid the least respectable and most-often-twinked-by-power-gamer-dicks race. Small size opens up some armor options. Being an good(as opposed to barb neutral) has its own benefits. You look cool and dont need to turn asstastic luclin models on to use horse/lizard. Ultravision(mm).<br />
<br />
Cons: no slam.<br />
<br />
Anyone who still plays EQ and posts on EQ class boards has no room to bitch about people supporting SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Con:  Troll players (like me) probably harbor a grudge against you because of what happened with Grobb.<br />
<br />
Its illogical I know, but I hate all frogs because of this.  If a frog wanted to group with me I'd have problems with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jubakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I find that your beginning stats and racial abilities matter very little in the long run. Ultimately, it's the person at the keyboard that makes the difference.<br />
<br />
And why is it people have such a hard time accepting frogloks but will readily accept a little green muppet named Yoda as THE Jedi master.  :p<br />

<br />
Hmmm, it says Ultravision in the FAQ, but my Froggy doesn't have the purple tint on anything the way my Rogue did in DE form. Did they change the way ultravision looks in game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes they changed the Ultravision to a blueish tint.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I started a froglok shaman recently, and I really see nothing wrong with it.  I haven't gotten anything from other players about not being taken seriously, and all that other crap.  I personally like it, I love the emote animations =).  I admit, it would be nice to regen like iksar or troll, or slam, but I don't really mind too much.  Besides, if I am having fun, why should I care =).</div></div><hr />

Sweet. One less spell to buy. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Heh, I wouldn't get too upset about the anti-Froglok comments. This place is positively tame compared to what I used to see on the Ranger's Glade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Con:  Frog<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hmmm, it says Ultravision in the FAQ, but my Froggy doesn't have the purple tint on anything the way my Rogue did in DE form.<br />
<br />
Try taking him to Greater Faydark and see how well he can see. If everything is black, you got no nightvision. If's it's real dark with red spots, you got infravision. If you can actually see things, you got ultravision. <br />
<br />
Course, your monitor/graphics card make a difference. When I first started playing EQ even with infravision it was too hard to see in Greater Faydark. I have a new monitor/video card and have tweaked settings since then, and it's much easier to see in dark places now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Frogloks are the best looking models in the game.  And their /cheer emote rules along with their /rude.   <br />
<br />
Not having slam though is probably the one thing that kept me from rerolling.   Slam is very important on a red server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Pro's : Double shrink one to an unbelievably small size.<br />
<br />
Cons : Same cons people had bout the kitties =P  <br />
<br />
Still wish I had remade my character when Kunark came out and made my barbie into an iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i miss slam on my frog, but its mucho made up for by the suprerior int.   ~90  ~120 with kei<br />
<br />
Int is a very much needed stat !!  I now get why totemic had so much int on it.<br />
<br />
My skill ups are x2 as fast as my ogres.   I miss the run speeed of a kitty or gnome, but overall i am very much enjoying the frog.<br />
<br />
I went for a rpg name and not a kermit variation....not that i have much source material on female froglok names )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bearfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Why did they move the Trolls out of Grobb - to me it doesnt make sense, why didnt they put the Frogloks on Kunark in the swamp of no hope or FV - nobody ever hunts these zones, except for a few iksars quests they are redundant, could have give a relationship with the iksars - similar to Ogguk and Grob - an odd mixture of kinship and KOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slurrpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why did they move the Trolls out of Grobb - to me it doesnt make sense, why didnt they put the Frogloks on Kunark in the swamp of no hope or FV - nobody ever hunts these zones, except for a few iksars quests they are redundant, could have give a relationship with the iksars - similar to Ogguk and Grob - an odd mixture of kinship and KOS.<br />
<br />
The problems with training guards from one newbie city to another on a PvP server makes this idea unfeasible. Remember, Frogloks are good. They worship Mithaniel Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Between Paludal, DSP, and PoP, it's relatively easy to get a toon to 60, without powerlevelling. Heck, it's been two months since LoY was released.<br />
<br />
If it's so easy how come you don't have a lvl 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slurrpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If it's so easy how come you don't have a lvl 60?<br />
<br />
<br />
I find exping for the number of hours necessary to get my Ranger to 60 to be mind-numbingly boring. He'd be 60 easy if I hadn't been so bored, I created a Froglok Shaman instead.<br />
<br />
Slurrpy is level 24 with two days played on him. I slack a lot doing the newbie quests and such. It took me less than ten days to get Lukko to 50, solo the whole time, without KEI and crap weapons (Centi Short Sword and Dragon Horn Yak). Click his name and take a look at the Magelo. See that Earthcaller? Know what that means? A ton of hours logged in Hate. Thousands of dead minis and no exp.<br />
<br />
Oh, and because of work, I play 15 hours a week, max. It's not hard. You just have to know what zones and what mobs you need to level the most efficiently.</div></div><hr />
