Ok, after 4 hours of camping the AC in SRo for my wizzy to get the ****ing JBoots we get him to spawn and slaughter him. A firend druid loots the ****ing ring to mquest to my wizard and we go to Rathe. Well he goes and ****ing kills stuff and finally after 3 hours the ****-ass gnome spawns.

It's cool bud, that's the way this goes sometimes. Twice I had to camp the AC two times each for my 2 RL friends cos they messed up the turn-in. First friend gave 3200 gold, 2nd guy gave 3260 gold. I almost broke down and cried. And I did the AC again for both of them cos I promised when we all started EQ that I would.<br />
<br />
Of course now the 2 of them play like maybe once a month grrrrr. I should have charged them something for the time I spent in Sro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My poor, kindly light soul... could not possibly think up a long chain of swearing and profanity as you have in that case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, I understand Azareal's post...I was trying to get my cousin involved in EQ since a bunch of friends and I devoted a lot of time to it. <br />
<br />
I started to PL his new character a bit, but then decided against it, so he could get to know the game better. I then decided to just give him some starting money and I started a toon from the same town, so we could hunt as newbies together. He started a warrior, I started a cleric so I could heal him etc.<br />
<br />
Some friendly guy (a RANGER no less) came by and gave both of us an item. I got a shield (that really wasn't great, but I was happy) he got a sword. I forget what sword it was, but at the time my jaw dropped because it was better then what my MAIN (ranger) had!!!!! MUCH BETTER!<br />
<br />
I told my cousin &quot;Whatever you do, don't die and NOT get your body, that sword will rot.&quot;<br />
<br />
He played with me for about a week and then played one day solo and died, let his body rot.....lost the sword.<br />
<br />
He then told me he quit, and said &quot;Yeah, I lost that good sword and all the armor and stuff and then decided I didn't want to play anymore, it was too hard after that.....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I just am happy I only gave him some banded armor and a handful of plat....<br />
