I can't speak for cripple, since I'm a bard, but I can tell you this:<br />
<br />
Bards get a song at level 51:<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />

Largo`s Absonant Binding<br />
Decrease Armor Class (AC) from 16 (L51) to 18 (L60)<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Decrease Attack Speed for between 30% (L51) to 35% (L60)&lt;/font&gt;<br />
Decrease Movement between 52% (L51) to 61% (L60)<br />
Decrease Agility from 45 (L51) to 50 (L60)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It's a singing based song, which can be &lt;font color=red&quot;&gt;amplified&lt;/font&gt; with the effects of: instrument mastery, singing mastery, puretone, amplification, singing shortsword, cloak from shei vinitras, a crystal which drops in the basement of ssra temple, and one other unknown item. It's also possible to slightly increase the amount of ac and agi that gets debuffed with jam fest, which increases the effective level of the song.<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;If your using a singing shortsword and the song 'amplification', your current modifier is 2.7&lt;/font&gt;, making the song debuff 18 * 2.7 = 48ac &amp; 50 * 2.7 = 135agi. Puretone = modifier of 2.8, and means -50ac -140agi. Oh, with just singing shortsword (1.8), I was debuffing -32ac -98agi.<br />
<br />
The best (current) modification from the base sung value of 1.0 (which would be 18ac 50agi at level 60) is 3.6, which would be a combination of various things, but the total debuffed possible until verant raises the cap for instrument modifiers is: -64ac -180agi &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;** EDIT: and 129% slow?!?**&lt;/font&gt;.<br />
<br />
I did some tests against rubble rousers in akheva ruins using this song. My first test had no debuffs, second test had this song with just singing shortsword, and third test had this song, singing shortsword &amp; amplification.<br />
<br />
There's a certain point at which ac debuffs help. If a creature has 1199ac, and you take away 99ac, your not going to see much if any increase in damage output. With just singing shortsword and no amplification, my average damage per hit was EXACTLY the same for both offhand and primary hand hits. It wasn't until I used amplification and increased the ac debuff from -32ac to -48ac that I saw a noticeable increase in damage. I went from (-32ac) absolutely no difference in average damage per hit, to (-48ac) a 7% increase in average damage per hit.<br />
<br />
My highest hit did not get affected AT ALL. It stayed exactly the same. Only my average damage per hit went up.<br />
<br />
As for the agi debuff, I saw an increase in both tests. The first one with just the singing shorsword saw about a 6% increase in hit percentage, however the second test only saw a 7.5% (roughly) increase in hit percentage from when I had no debuffs. So while removing another -45agi did help, it wasn't much.<br />
<br />
So, when you hear a shaman say that cripple is worthless, tell him to start working together with his local bards, druids, and necro's (and maybe sk's?)<br />

Haste and slow values for any song are never effected by instrument mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TravlinMann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Amplification, Epic, Singing Mastery, etc don't change the haste/slow effects on songs. They only change the stat buffs/debuffs if I recall correctly. This is all assuming that nothing was changed in a recent patch though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay, whew!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was about to make a bard... glad it isnt true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Remember though that bards can stack this on a mob *after* our slow is in. Granted, 35% slow on a mob that already slowed 75% (a total of 83% slow) isn't that big a deal most times, but there are several fights that I'll take any advantage I can get.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Again, I wish.<br />
<br />
The spell will stack, but the slow component will not make the mob any slower.  This is just like two haste spells (not counting our 4 stacking songs) Only the greater of the two haste/slows will take effect.<br />
<br />
The debuff components will stack though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm.. considering they will have to land their song onthe MOB every few ticks or so, I wonder what aggro those slowing song do generate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a rule our songs do not generate much aggro.  Because we have to refresh them every 12 seconds they build up a lot of aggro over time.<br />
<br />
I think I know where you are headed with this.  Our resist rate on this song is a lot higher than your slows.  It would not be a viable option to land an early slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually QUITE often one of our bards get's a slow on before any turgur's is landed. They are playing occlusion anyhow and mix the bard slow in with it. <br />
Kinda nice lil damage reduction right off the bat while the big slow is being worked in.</div></div><hr />
