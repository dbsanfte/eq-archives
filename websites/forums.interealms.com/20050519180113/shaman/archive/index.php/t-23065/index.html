<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rumour over on the Enchanter boards was the unveiling of new LDON armors.<br />
<br />
Whether said armours were PvP server only or not, the same ol, same ol seem to be the only armours available at this time.<br />
<br />
Did anybody see or purchase these things?</div></div><hr />

Both items were LDoN 1900 points, no specific camp. They were intended for the new PvP point system it seems.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Let's not view this as those getting there late being hurt, but as those getting there early being fortunate.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">haha.. Colal what class do you play.  I was at that fight with Yikitu (killed around 6:30pm EST) and I didn't recall another shaman being there from what I saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am so sick of them putting in uber items by accident then ripping them out.  Oops, no more manastone or guise.  Oops, no more insta-cast Circlet.  Oops, no more universal camp armor.  Oops, no more FT7 robe, our bad!  Oops, no more HEAPS of useful &quot;fabled&quot; items... oh wait, that one was intentional!  But don't worry, the hardcore gamers that rush to farm spots and purchase items when they first come out will get to keep them.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story?  If you plan to play EQ2, and hear of a particularly overcamped or efficient item, GET IT NOW.  It may not be there tomorrow.  Same deal with LDoN/Omens crap.<br />
<br />
Too bad I work 40 hours a week and can't bum rush and pillage fresh zones before they are nerfed.... I know it doesn't happen often, but every time it does, it makes me angrier; I just find myself going, &quot;WHEN will they learn???&quot;</div></div><hr />

Fantastic post, Slim. And a DAMN solid point. It especially pisses me off when they remove &quot;cool, fun&quot; items like the Guise that only have one minimal benefit (to shrink large races) other than faction crap, which is easily adjustable. <br />
<br />
Manastone was a bit different, I think they should have just nerfed EVERY ONE, to a 3 second re-set. Problem solved. Same with CoS. Nerf EVERY ONE to a .5 second cast, now you cant pop it while running. Then replace both with &quot;less desirable, but still decent&quot; versions, like the current CoS, and stick a 10 second re-set on Manastone. People would use them, but they would hardly be as game-changing as they are now. <br />
<br />
I really think SOE dropped the ball by removing Fabled items. If they wanted to limit them, then just do what they are doing with Hot-Zones, and shift them around. One month, its Guk, MM, KC, etc and the next its Sol B, chardok, Unrest, etc, whatever. Fabled stuff got people INTO the zones. The items were VERY nice for mid-range folks, and the events were doable by smaller guilds with a couple good groups.<br />
<br />
Another bitch of mine about &quot;past vs present&quot; IS this whole faction thing. I am a troll. I missed out on the Guise (camped it, but it didnt drop, troll was a twink at that time) so I decided to go for the Crown of Deciet. Well, as a troll, guess what I grew up killing. Yup, you guessed it, FROGS. Hell, I went to 32 in Upper Guk. Then, I didnt really do much in lower guk, because at that time, Lower Guk was &quot;Camping these 2 frogs in the hall by the ladder to the Ass room&quot; type of crap, heh. So, I totally bottomed out my faction. Suddenly there is a new Quest, but hey, you gotta be LOVED by those slimey nasty grobb stealing amphibian roadkill bastages. Have gone to get 6 Reet Crowns in the past month with friends, and they ALL got their crowns easy, becase they never did Upper Guk, why would they with whats out there now. But I didnt have the knowledge of the quest before I blew my faction, or I CERTAINLY wouldnt have ruined it. That crown is a killer item for any troll. <br />
<br />
Anyway, to cut the ramble to the point, when they put in quests which require some faction that wasnt previously unimportant, there SHOULD be a small, mini-quest to reset it to &quot;Out-Of-Box&quot; (which means a troll would still be KOS in Upper Guk, but not bottomed out). Make it something you cant do twice, or whatever, although I dont see how the few factions this affects would make any difference. I have probably put 30 hours into factioning AE style in LG, and another 20 while AFK (in Savant room, pet kills every spawn, I still get a faction hit), I have the Ghoul Lord Scalp, etc etc and I am STILL scowling in Upper Guk. Sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would have loved to have seen them and bought some but seeing AB never made it back up after first patch they were gone when I got in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I feel for ya Blazz, im in the same boat as you.  I killed in Upper till about 25 or so, now of course i want my helm and i cant get it. I have spent about 30 hours of AE kiling and another 5-10 afk killing and still scowling too, with my cap from the ghoul lord on.  Ahhhh well, maybe someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think they should bring back the Fabled items. It brought people to under used zones and gave good rewards. When they were in game, I managed to get the Fabled Mithril BP and it's almost better than ornate..ac 61  str 5  wis 10  int 10  agi 15 HP 90 Mana 75 save-vs cold,magic,poison 12.....and Fabled Prayer Shawl ac 12  sta 8 wis 10  agi 8  HP 55 Mana 75  save-vs fire and disease 10.<br />
These items were well worth the hours I spent camping them (and the long list of people ahead of me in line for them).<br />
It also meant that I had to go to places I had never fought in before.<br />
