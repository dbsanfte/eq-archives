<br />
However, I finally got mine yesterday - the culmination of quest that I started on February 20, 2001. I know its only personal preference, but I did the whole quest (no faction work) and I'm proud of that.<br />
<br />
Did Neh and Rak last night, single group (thanks Rystar, Cadarly, Lunden, Diaxiristis and Zaimial) and now I have my spear. I'm a happy bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WOOOOOT!!! Grats! It's not &quot;just&quot; a spear. It's a great weapon and you will use it for a long time. I don't use mine while raiding, but when soloing, it's very handy to stack on that extra damage. Besides that, it is the culmination of a LOT of work (as you did the entire quest 'as intended'). My heartfelt congratulations. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulations Weyalan on getting your SoF. I just got mine the other day and it was a great relief to finally finish up the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congratulations, Wey.  :)<br />
<br />
It's still a great primary, and you'll click it and use it for the resists occasionally even after you replace it.<br />
<br />
Just becareful where you wield it.  PoK is a very dangerous place to hold something that defines you clearly as a higher level shaman, and the LDoN camps can be dangerous as well (though it might net you a group invite there).   :p</div></div><hr />

What can I say but Congrats.<br />
Its the 1 item i havent got that i would really like.<br />
Got as far as getting the boots but stuck on next part as when you play only 2-3 hrs a day its quite hard to do.<br />
<br />
A  jealous <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not just a spear to me. Probably took me year and a half to get mine (started the quest at lvl29 when Velious came out, got blackfur boots at 39, and finished my epic at 56 right after Luclin came out) ... I hold it proudly to this day, it looks sweet, stats are nice and there are only a few weapons I would consider a &quot;worthy&quot; replacements -- there are many better in stats but to replace an epic it not only has to have much better power but it have to look just as cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congrats!</div></div><hr />

<br />
These days, everything in shaman epic is very doable with a single competent group. If you break down the epic into small bite-sized chunks, it is do-able in 3 hour pieces.<br />
<br />
Your group needs to be 60 - 65 and reasonably well equipped and reasonably on the pace.<br />
<br />
The boots are solo-able by any level 61+ shaman.<br />
The hole is a pain because Kirn is so deep, but a single group can crawl it in about 3 hours. <br />
Fear can be a pain to break into cleanly, and it is a nuisance to clear enough space to take out a golem without adds. Nevertheless, with a good tank and a good cleric + shaman heals, single group can take out golems<br />
<br />
All the books and pages in CoM can be soloed easily - and aren't that hard to get.<br />
<br />
Neh is easy to take, but you do need a rogue for the locked doors. A decent rogue can pull Neh all the way from her room down to the safe area before the reavers<br />
<br />
Rak is also quite doable for a single group. Either kill the last reaver until it stops respawning, or have someone off tank it with 1 healer while the other 4 of you take Rak - with modern gear, resists and AA, his HT is not so scary, and his AoE doesn't really stick much.<br />
<br />
If you can get a single group of good people you can do it.<br />
<br />
And everyone else, thanks for your congratulations. The Spear is the Uberest thing I have ever had, and I will not be replacing it in the foreseeable future. I was kinda tongue in cheek in my earlier words - not being in an uberguild, I dont have acces to VT / EP gear, so the Epic will last me a long time. And, as has been said before, it looks just too damned cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes yes, a lot is one groupable nowadays at levels 65 with helluva gear..<br />
<br />
I started my epic as soon as these quests were implemented into the game. I was in mid-high 40's by that time. Was much of a guesswork, but I did it eventually. Back then the planes were constantly camped and it took me some time to get all the pieces. Being in a small guild didn't exactly haste things up either. But once I hit lvl 50, pretty much after that I also got my spear. And you know what? I still have it and use it. It's very decent weapon, I do not see anything right now what I can get, which even comes close to it's functionality and usefulness (resists, stats, clicky DoT, LOOKS!). So, grats on your epic, it's a handy thing and will serve you well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for all the tips<br />
<br />
I do already have the boots.<br />
<br />
Looks like ill be kind of busy this weekend seeing how much of my epic i can do :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gratz Bud!!!  I think the spear is awsome, and moreso since you did the WHOLE quest!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grats on your epic bro, though i just read on our guildboard youre leaving the guild.<br />
<br />
Gonna miss ya. Take care heyokah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Holy Crap!!! Congrats!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grats, it still one of nicest look weapon<br />
<br />
wish VI add multi aug slot for it to make it useful again, like slot 2,3,4,5,6,7 total 6 slot hehe; that will make them call epic item again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't two of the Golems in Fear still death touch? <br />
<br />
Those don't sound one-groupable to me regardless of gear. Maybe 6 really really really high DPS people could do it, but it sounds difficult to me. Now, the third one, with the cold AE, he should be very doable by a post-60 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Don't two of the Golems in Fear still death touch?  <br />
Thats what Gnomes are for ...<br />
<br />
Grats on the pokey glowing spear.  I still hold mine with pride and it still looks better than holding a book.  I may replace it someday, but I kinda got attached to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wayalan - congratulations on your epic. It's a nice item for the level you can get it at, and will last you a while.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane: for Fear, you could always do what I did - tag along with a higher level guild who are clearing Fear for golems or even for Cazic Thule - many guilds at that level already have epics for all their shamans. You could volunteer shaman services, though they're likely to already have a shaman or two there. You could even volunteer to take the death touch for them.<br />
<br />
*Bow* to Celestial Rising on Xev for allowing me to come along, take a death touch and loot a tear. (It was some months ago, but I still remember and appreciate it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Congratulations!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Grats.<br />
<br />
I still use mine :)</div></div><hr />
