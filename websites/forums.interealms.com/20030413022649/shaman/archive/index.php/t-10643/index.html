<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are several ways to raise it but I was wondering if anyone knew which turn in/quest was the fastest.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Explain what is CD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CD = Coldain Dwarves? hmmmm... Not sure. :) If so, then there's some quest to turn in giant helms (or heads) but I don't know who the turn-in guy is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CD was the abbreviation for Chardok on the Nameless server. When I transfered to the Tribunal they had never heard of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if its chardok the best way i have found to raise my faction is invis your way through nurga and into rukgus's room, make pet and start your killing.. gobs there drop leather whips and fine steel so having a alpha pet is very easy.  i just give him celerity and jbb to help with the dmg so i rarely have to heal him.   i throw turgurs on the named mobs because if i dont then i would have to blow 400mana on kraggs mending but slow only cost 250 heh.  in around 12 hour total there i got a couple stacks of salt/green goblin skins and 3 idol of the thorned and that got me 12k :)<br />
and if you dont know about the turn-in faction quest.. go to chardok right at the zone-in there is a miniature sarnak called Herald Telcha, you hand him 2 unstacked salts or 1 skin and it will give you a +3point faction hit.   killing 1 goblin in nurga/droga is +1... I went to bazaar and bought some goblin skins.. theres always some for sale for 10-20pp each on saryrn, so if you have some money to spare its a nice way to save you time.   Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wipe out droga.  Do it again.  Repeat for about a week or 2 =P  Save all your salts and skins and turn them into the Herald, but they are only worth 1-2 faction points (killing a goblin is worth 1).  Easier to just kill another goblin than run clear to chardok usually.</div></div><hr />
