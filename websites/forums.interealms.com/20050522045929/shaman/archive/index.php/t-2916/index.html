<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Loramin wrote on another one of my posts Nope, they don't stack. Also, when you have overlapping ones (say spellcasting efficiency and affliction efficiency) the best one goes in to effect (so Dots would get the higher affliction efficiency rate, the rest would use the lower spellcasting efficiency rate).  <br />
<br />
I have a Chrysoberyl Talisman with Affliction Haste2 right now...<br />
If they don't stack, what are some good Focus combos that will play nice together?<br />
<br />
Will Affliction Haste stack with Affliction Efficiency?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Things that don't stack would be something like Spell Haste (works on all spells) and Enhancement Haste (faster cast, but only works on buffs), the focus item with the greatest benefit to the casting time of spell would take precedence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Serpentine Bracer is Affliction Extension II if memory serves.<br />
The 1AC is horrible (does have +9agi though), so either plan on root/rotting &amp; not getting hit, or swap it out for something else right after casting VOTS.  It should stack with your Chrys. Talisman, and is readily available.  I bought one off a vendor for like 58pp or something.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">soooooo  which items can extend the range of the epic dot?<br />
<br />

<br />
I believe that the focus items only affect normal spells, not right click items such as epic and JBB.</div></div><hr />
