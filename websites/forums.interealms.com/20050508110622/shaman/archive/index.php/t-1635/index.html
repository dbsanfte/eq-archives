<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jeez, I would hate to try to logon the first day of a new server. Can you imagine the over-crowded newbie zones? /WHO in FoB would be like 50+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wish it was split to reduce some of the high levels on AB as it is so top heavy. Should make it preference for Euro players as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is this going to be primarily US or European? I guess it will not be hard to start over since my Shammy is just 6th lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EU server (in amsterdam) to the best of my knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xaanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I've seen from the forums there will probably be pretty much 50/50 between americans and europeans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Evenly split between european and american servers should be good to reduce crowding.  I was in a mostly Australian guild on Brell and they were doing stuff in the middle of the night.  Was very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm think there will be extra lag for Americans, cause of the server being in Europe? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Playing from Europe on a US server gives me on average 130  more ping than my American guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tried KB last week (way to go server load testing, /who all returned 4 people). My ping on a completely empty server was 180 - 240. I'm on DSL and average 40 - 80 on a US based server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PH3NO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a person who posted to the Dev board EVERY two days, i can say that it's a european server in Amsterdam.<br />
<br />
I might finally get a decent ping, (born and bred in Belgium), so i'm quite exited.<br />
<br />
I'll be starting anew there with, how did you guess it, a shaman :)  (i'll be abandoning 2 lvl 30 chars on Mith Marr (bard and warrior), and have been playing for 3 years now, yes this is my third account, how did you guess ? ;)<br />
<br />
I'm scared it'll be quite a rush those first few days though... mostly peeps that want to be at the very top of the new Kane Bayle community, or want to see how a new server unfolds.<br />
<br />
I'll be starting with 2 of my other belgian friends, 2 DE's (cleric and chanter) and 1 troll shammy :)<br />
If ya feel like joining this merry band, send a mail, cause i haven't decided on my chars name yet ;-)<br />
<br />
Anyways i hope I haven't bored ya, i'm just lost on what to do while i'm waiting to join the newbie bashing.. So i decided to empty my guts here.<br />
<br />
Anyways hope to see you there, then again if yer gonna be lagging us up or stealing my kills, maybe not ;-)<br />
<br />
Greetz, and if ya got any pointers, share em :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sanctum Keeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll Be there has Sanctum Shaman trol :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What was the last server that was started this way in the US? Or should I go ahead and take the extra pings on this one? I would like to start on a &quot;New&quot; world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think SoE is shooting their business model in the foot by not doing this more often.  Old servers discourage new players and drive long term players into continuous head-butting conests between guilds for end game mobs.  The player base needs more opportunities to start fresh without any goofy rule sets.<br />
<br />
I always wanted to try a server where lower end gear was still worth something.  This poor server is going to get swamped and crash a lot for a few weeks :).<br />
<br />

There are 168 players in Everfrost Peaks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The pings aren't bad. I have a twinked monk that I moved to AB and it isn't that noticable when I play her. The mobs warp a bit more but you get used to it after a bit. The only problem so far was when I had a bit of a connection problem and instead of my ping going up to 200 it hit 600, that was fun ;)<br />
<br />
Have fun on the new server :D<br />
<br />
*Oh, Draznar, the last US based non-split, non-special rules server was Vazaelle. I think it went live in the winter of 2000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What was the last US serve non-split? and what rules?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Draznar -<br />
<br />
I *think* it was FV, the role-playing server that they just made some changes to. <br />
<br />
If you're looking for low pings and low population, that's the server for you. However, the trivial loot code is in effect as well as some other rules. <br />
<br />
The ruleset for FV and Sullon Zek (the other newer non-split) are on the Everquest home page :)</div></div><hr />
