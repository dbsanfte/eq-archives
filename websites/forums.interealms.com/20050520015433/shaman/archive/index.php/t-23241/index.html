<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My top 5, and why:<br />
<br />
1.  Druid -- 5K Heals, Group Heal over Time AA, HP Buff, Mana Regen Buff, SOE, Camoflauge, Tracking, Nuking DPS, DoT DPS, Insta-Succor AA, Succor, Teleport -- By far the most well rounded class in the game.<br />
<br />
2.  Necro --  Group Lifetap, Group ManaTap, ManaDump, Uber Pets, Uber DoTs, Feign Death, 93% Rezz, Fear, Snare, Undead Mezz, Lifeburn -- A well played Necro is a major force in a group, I'm constantly amazed at how powerful the Necro's in my guild are.<br />
<br />
3.  Cleric --  Rezzes, Best Epic in Game, Best HP/AC Buff, Complete Heal, Group Heals, Divine Arbitration AA (Best in game, IMO), decent nukes, decent stuns, Pacify, DA/DB,  DI -- Make healing look so easy...but I do not envy them the CH chains<br />
<br />
4.  Bard -- the only thing they can't do is Rezz<br />
<br />
5.  Paladins -- HP buff, 90% Rezz, currently best tank class in game (for groups), Stuns allow them to hold Agro all day, Group Heals, Lay on Hands<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok...that's my list.  Enchanters are sixth, but after that it gets muddled...I'd put Shaman at around 10th or 11th, with the way things stand in the game.  <br />
<br />
What's your list? and Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No particular order<br />
Cleric - REZ (most unbalanced ability in game)<br />
bard - everything<br />
warrior - most HP and highest mitigation of any tank class, aggro isn't an issue anymore either<br />
chanter - mez, charm with slow and haste<br />
<br />
you need no other class.<br />
<br />
also having these 4 in a group is boring as content is extremely trivialized ('cept GoD and raid encounters with one group)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a few classes when played extremely well are almost amazing and then there is the cleric.<br />
<br />
#1 Cleric. No cleric, no raid. No cleric no difficult experience group.<br />
<br />
#2 A well played Necro<br />
<br />
#3 A well played Bard<br />
<br />
#4 A well played Enchanter<br />
<br />
#5 A well played Shaman (YES, tis true)<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
Continuing:<br />
<br />
#6 a well played Pally<br />
#7 a well played cc/puller Ranger<br />
<br />
all the rest - good but can't excel with superior gameplay - there is no bad class in EQ currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Raid/Upper end content:<br />
<br />
1.  Cleric - heal/ae heal<br />
2.  Enc - CC/slow<br />
3.  War - tanking/off-tanking<br />
4.  Any dps.  High End Wizards being the best.<br />
5.  Bard - resists/cc<br />
<br />
Those are the quintessential classes for raiding. They are hands down &quot;the best&quot; in their primary field, and good enough in their secondary field.  They provide everything you need.  Everything else, from all other classes is &quot;nice&quot; but not necessary.  <br />
<br />
Of course, getting to the raid is easier with a mage, and recovering from a raid sometimes is easier with a necro.  Your raid goes easier with those specialty functions, but they aren't required.  Theoretically, you could live without them.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Grouping/Lesser content<br />
<br />
This gets into the &quot;ideal group&quot; type debate.  Which, of course, depends on the encounter/content.  In general though, the raid top 5 = the group top 5.  <br />
<br />
Tank:  Normal grouping, I'd prefer a Pally to other tanks, simple because the tank has guaranteed instant aggro.  However, for vxed/tipt level, I'd prefer a warrior still.  Defensive discs are unmatched.<br />
<br />
Healer:  Again, if you want this role filled, you can't go wrong with a cleric.  But, if the content isn't hard, I too would prefer a Druid for the greater utility.<br />
<br />
CC/Slow:  If you don't require backup healing, OR, if you require tremendous dps, Enchanter is the only choice here.  <br />
<br />
Pulling/Mob aquistion:  For tracking+pulling+utility, again, Bard is better in a group than a monk or rogue.  The bard, while not as much dps, provides way to much utility to not have one in the group.  However, if you don't need that utility, then of course monk or ranger is better for added dps.<br />
<br />
DPS:  In grouping situations, it all depends on the character AA and gear.  There have been proven log posts of necro's peaking at 500 dps, but they are rare.  Wizards and Rogues are the same way.  I can't really pick a top dps position for slots 5+6 because there are too many variables.  Usually I'll pick the last couple spots based on what other abilities the group needs.  Do we have doors to pick?  Do we need evac?  Do we need FD backup Rez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The above was fairly spot-on, but to be concise, it basically boils down to one thing: The harder the content, the more important the specialists are; the more trivial the content, the more valuable the versitile classes are.  The specialists definately get the sweet end of that deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In no particular order:<br />
<br />
1. Bard<br />
2. Cleric<br />
3. Warrior<br />
4. Enchanter<br />
5. Druid<br />
<br />
Actually, thats a pretty good order of what I consider the most powerfull characters, but I might be tempted to put druids at 4 instead of chanters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Overall power it looks like and I would pretty much have to agree with those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">since melee &quot;rebalancing&quot; to me the list looks like this:<br />
<br />
1. warrior ( they are now the only class that can tank a large % of the content of an entire expansion )<br />
<br />
<br />
a distant 2nd<br />
<br />
2. enchanter ( holy trinity #2)<br />
3. cleric (holy trinity #3)<br />
4. bard  (no other puller is even close now)<br />
5. rogue / druid ( toss up , rogue for pure dps but back up healing is so critical in GoD it's hard to say )<br />
<br />
btw, this is based on what's needed for the current &quot;high-end&quot; of the game. take GoD out of the picture and really balance wasn't nearly so bad. luckily my brief forays into GoD haven't made me want to go back and i'm still enjoying earlier content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As far as raiding goes its Warriors and Clerics.  Every thing else is situational.  After that I would go with rogues due to body recovery and scouting and DPS,  but they arent gonna hold many raids up if a rogue doesnt log in.<br />
<br />
One thing I am noticing as we grind our way through Txevu is that our DoTs land and most stuff (including bosses) slows to some degree.  Is it a trend?  I sure hope so.  Its nice to do something besides patch heal and rez buff after slow is stuck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your rankings way different than mine.  And I think its because of our relative value of solo utility.  <br />
<br />
Solo Utility while not worthless, is way less for me than raid/group ever since XP changes where grouping is better XP ((and loot)) than soloing.</div></div><hr />

Last: Clerics, Druids and Chanters to buff me out of group. And Bards, because as awesome as they are, they don't stack will with me in single-group content. We wind up stepping on each others' toes, unless I have my Bard and/or Chanter buddies on the phone.</div></div><hr />

Decent Amount of Undead in LDON.  mmc, guk, especially.<br />
Of all the specialized abilities (animal, summoned, undead) undead has a decent amount of locations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah but LDoN is crappy experience, and has nothing worthwhile for a lot of people except charm upgrade.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">OK, I've had enough.  You guys are truly jaded.  All of your lists seem to be compiled by folks that have 300+ aa's.  Well, that's not all of us, and since most of you have been playing for 3-4 years, even many of you spent most of your time in zones other than PoP tier 3 and Gates.  <br />
<br />
IMHO, in the zones I play in, PoV, BoT, HoH, etc.  Shaman are still gods.  Give me 5 good dps classes and I'll slow/heal an exp group in any of those zones, including LDoN.  No other class can do that, none.  So, at my level (15 aa's), if you want exp, stick with a shaman.  Sure it changes later, but in my world:<br />
<br />
1. Shaman<br />
2. Enchanter<br />
3. Cleric<br />
4. Bard<br />
5. Necro<br />
6. Pally</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as far as undead mobs, THEY will get the last laugh when Unrest gets revamped as an EP quality zone!  Laugh on, lvl 70 Jackolanterns of doom, laugh on!<br />
<br />
When it comes down to brass tax, though, I'd have to agree with Ungkor's post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's all very relative, depending on what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Lower Tier Exp Groups:<br />
<br />
1. Cleric - <br />
2. SK/Pal - Fast agro, decent utility, tanks fine<br />
3. Shaman - Good enough at almost everything<br />
4. Bard - If you can find one not swarm kiting<br />
5. Hunter (there's a diff) / Mage - AM3 and EQ are a big jump in dps / pets constant dps along with the 60's nukes provide for a quick upward power curve.<br />
<br />
GoD <br />
<br />
1. Cleric -<br />
2. War - The hps and mitigation really make life easier raid or group<br />
3. Wiz - Stackable raid DPS, great group DPS<br />
4. Insert anything but bez / Sk here - nuff said<br />
<br />
PoP High tier / Time<br />
1. Cleric -<br />
2. War - Tankage<br />
3. Wiz - Stackable DPS<br />
4. Bard - Resist / Mana / Makes wizards uberer<br />
5. Enc - Some CC situations still, DC pets are risky but can make up for gear in some instances<br />
<br />
Solo<br />
<br />
1. Necro - The most options, good kill speed, owns undead<br />
2. Bard - limited but with incredible speed<br />
3. Enchanter - anywhere there are things to be charmed<br />
4. Beast / Shaman - Blues / slower exp but versatile<br />
5. Wiz - Quadding a few places in pop for very good exp</div></div><hr />

Bards - uncomparable resist buff, best? pullers, great modifiers (rizolas etc), 2nd best cc<br />
enchanters - uncomparable mana regen, although bls are close, uncomparable cc.<br />
5th - necros - fd rezzing, feeding clerics, feeding clerics, what's the hold up? ahh feeding clerics?<br />

<br />
Weird, I look forward to that.  I'm in the KT / Ikkinz / Yxxta areas raid wise, and the other shaman and I have been joking how worthless we feel.  Not one, nada, zilch, zero of the main boss mobs have been slowable.  Even partially.  <br />
<br />
Take Yxxta for instance.  Upon zone in, nothing is slowable.  Then you enter the caves and the spiders and crags and insect things are partially slowable.  Then you get to a boss mob, and he's, of course, immune.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, rarely does poison seem to stick.  <br />
<br />
In Ikkinz, I think I remember 1-2 bosses that were partially slowable, but the vast majority were immune.  Trash was all partially slowable.  Bane seemed to stick ok on most things, but again, poison was tough in most cases.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to try Txevu out if more bosses are slowable and more dots stick then:)  I might feel better on raids hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sorry, everyone, I didn't mean to be so nebulous when I posted this on Friday, but I was running out the door.<br />
<br />
  When I meant top five classes, I meant overall.  Soloing vs. grouping trivial content vs. grouping hard content vs raiding....what classes are best, and why, when you take everything into account.   That's why I put Druids and Necro's 1 and 2...they work well in any capacity, and stack very nicely in raids (we use our druids in CH chain all the time, if short on clerics).<br />
<br />
I also comprised my list by trying to think of folks with bazaar gear and no AA's, vs. folks with Time gear and 300 AA's.  <br />
<br />
Now, if you go back 3 years, is there any way Paladins, Necro's or Druids make my list?  Hell no.  3 years ago it's:<br />
<br />
1.  Shaman<br />
2.  Enchanter<br />
3.  Cleric<br />
4.  Bards<br />
5.  Warrior</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My fav. grp setup is me and a whole lot of DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best thing about being a level 65 Shaman in pre-GoD, pre-high PoP areas is that I don't even have a &quot;favorite group setup&quot; for regular, non-raid adventures. Sure, 5 DPS characters are probably more efficient than anything else, but I can take any 1-5 friends that happen to be online at the same time and go do things.<br />
<br />
Last night I was the puller/MT/slower/healer/part time CC in Hate. We had folks (casters only - no melees) come and go, but as long I was there we could kill everything in Tiers 1 and 2 non-stop. We were picking up quest items, turn-in armor, gems and even Epic pieces left and right while having a great time. I can think of no other class that could serve the key role that I was serving given the same level of equipment (5K HP buffed).<br />
<br />
Granted, like any generalist, I can only stretch my abilities so much. In PoHate, I can tank one unslowable 300 hitter with just my own heals, but 2 would spell trouble. I can't tank more than 2 slowed 300 hitters at the same time without outside heals for fear of interrupts, or at least I can't do it reliably. My blast healing is very limited even with my IH4 arms. I depend on my DOTs and weapon proc for agro, so I have no &quot;agro on demand&quot; capability and have to rely on root when people over-agro.<br />
<br />
However, as my Monk would say, &quot;I wish I had your problems!&quot; ;) Or, in other words, Shamans are still number 1 in the zones where I and my friends hang out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A Friend made me realize something.. I find it pretty funny yet i agree with it completely. It's like Sony set it up by however much fun the class is to play, the more they suck. Take rangers for exampe, i find them to be easily the most fun class to play. Just sit back in an exp group and shoot stuff, great time. But clerics are hardly any fun at all to play yet they are very very powerful and wanted in all groups. I could say the same for bards, but some people seem to enjoy playing them. I just can't stand the 1, 2, 3, 4 twisting repetion. The only class that's an exception for is monks. They're no fun to play and they suck &gt;,&lt;</div></div><hr />

5) Tank: Pallys Warriors and SK's I like them all.<br />
6) Druid: yah I play a druid, and you really dont NEED us for anything. Kind of sucks atm. Yah we can do alot of things but nothing really well But we can back up heal.<br />
<br />
7) Mage/necro: Yeah they are good at soloing some spots, but otherwise they get shafted. I feel bad for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My top 5, and why:<br />
<br />
1.  Druid -- 5K Heals, Group Heal over Time AA, HP Buff, Mana Regen Buff, SOE, Camoflauge, Tracking, Nuking DPS, DoT DPS, Insta-Succor AA, Succor, Teleport -- By far the most well rounded class in the game.<br />
<br />
2.  Necro --  Group Lifetap, Group ManaTap, ManaDump, Uber Pets, Uber DoTs, Feign Death, 93% Rezz, Fear, Snare, Undead Mezz, Lifeburn -- A well played Necro is a major force in a group, I'm constantly amazed at how powerful the Necro's in my guild are.<br />
<br />
3.  Cleric --  Rezzes, Best Epic in Game, Best HP/AC Buff, Complete Heal, Group Heals, Divine Arbitration AA (Best in game, IMO), decent nukes, decent stuns, Pacify, DA/DB,  DI -- Make healing look so easy...but I do not envy them the CH chains<br />
<br />
4.  Bard -- the only thing they can't do is Rezz<br />
<br />
5.  Paladins -- HP buff, 90% Rezz, currently best tank class in game (for groups), Stuns allow them to hold Agro all day, Group Heals, Lay on Hands<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok...that's my list.  Enchanters are sixth, but after that it gets muddled...I'd put Shaman at around 10th or 11th, with the way things stand in the game.  <br />
<br />
What's your list? and Why?<br />
Frist let  me say that  all  calsses are important  on the game in my humble opinion. However being biased towards the shaman I can not  belive that you  didn't include only the best slower in the game  with the exception of Necro's for undead mobs, and  where can you do better than the buffs you get from a shaman? (stat) with the exception of Charisma you can't touch the buffs a shaman throws with any other class. and as far as slow goes the shaman gets upto a 70% slow spell lets' let you tank a  high end lvl mob with out a slow. Can you  say   Clr  with right clicky rezz stick??? LOL<br />
sorry for the soapbox just my opinion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">As of right now the best group I had with fastest kills best xp was this combo right here..  Granted this is just xp groups in BoT and PoV..  In order of group success.<br />
<br />
1. Paladin to hold agro if you dont got that then ur whole group suffers.<br />
2. Ranger to pull and CC gotta be a good Ranga - Bard/Monk can go here.<br />
3. I would say shaman for there buffs slow's and Debuff's think about it.  More AGI = AC more Sta = HP more Dex = more Dam..  this way playes take less dam and do more dam not everyone is 305 capped in all even after Fo7..<br />
4. Cleric Heals would choose a cleric over a druid anyday..  I just don't like em never did...<br />
5. Rogue DPS DPS DPS can't go wrong with a rogue. Wizard/Necro/Chanty with DC can go here.<br />
6. Mage pet plus nukes nice very nice just cause he is a good friend.  Anything can go here pretty much cept a priest class..<br />
<br />
Now this is the grp I had for 2 weeks..  lvld from 55 to 65 in that time..  When I was 60 we could do it with no cleric in PoV.  now that im 65 we dont need a cleric in BoT give me a 65 beasty or bard to slow..  Although with this setup I would prefer a Warrior to a Paladin..<br />
<br />
Well just some ramblings of a shaman...<br />

<br />
The way slow mitigation works in the game rigth now, if a mob that can only be slowed to &lt;66%, then Shamans, Enchanters and Beastlords have effectviely the same slow. And since many higher level mobs either mitigate slow (Hard LDoN+) or are completely unslowable, the whole point of this &quot;class defining ability&quot; becomes moot in certain areas. Admittedly, Shamans still have a small edge when mobs can only be slowed with a Disease-based slow.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as I pointed out above, there are still areas in the game where a non-raid level 65 (and lower) Shaman is still in very good shape.<br />
<br />
you can't touch the buffs a shaman throws with any other class.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs have a very minor effect even on non-raiders. Using Bazaar gear, any melee character can get his STA, the only important stat, to 200++. STR is trivial to max and AGI/DEX are of minimal import.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Ferine Avatar is still a very nice spell, although Beastlords get Ferocity, which is arguably even better.<br />
<br />
and as far as slow goes the shaman gets upto a 70% slow spell<br />
<br />
75% at level 60.</div></div><hr />

I agree with your eval of slow, mobs that are immune reduce us to buff bots and mediocre heals/dps.  <br />
<br />
However, let me point out, that with a mana cost of 600 mana, and a 2 min refresh, no BST will be able to keep Ferocity on himself and 3-4 other melees, just can't be done.  Let alone keep any of the other single target buffs they have, including haste and regen, up on an entire group.  BST have very good self-buffs.  But they are not suited for buffing and sustaining those buffs on a group with 3 or more melees.  So lets not get confused, BST do not replace us as buffers in most groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, a BST can be a semi-acceptable buffer in XP groups. They don't have group buffs or Fo7, their self-mana regen is not quite as good as ours and they don't have Avatar, but they get the job done plus they offer mana/HP/regen buffs that are in some cases worse and in some cases better than ours.<br />
<br />
On raids, it's a somewhat different story. When my Monk is pulling, I'll take Ferocity over FA any day of the week because of the resists. Of course, nobody will ask a BST to buff a raid :)<br />
<br />
Given the areas of the game that I spend my time in, I am happy with the SHM/BST balance. I have Root and even ghetto-snare, which can be insanely useful. I have a better slow against 90%+ of the content that I am facing. I have better haste, mostly better buffs, much better mana regeneration, much (much!) better blast and over time healing, similar tankability, gate, etc. BSTs have better DPS and mana regen buffs and, of course, they are much better at catching mice :)<br />
<br />
It's only in the recently released high level content that Shamans start having trouble when their signature line of slow spells is either unusable or irrelevant due to super-fast fights that are over right about the time the slow lands after Malo.<br />
<br />
Last time we were fighting an unslowable 1.2+K hitter, I was healing the rampage tank while trying to nuke with my pitiful nukes and wondering why I suddenly felt much less useful than I usually do. Thankfully, I don't have to face that content on a regular basis or else I would probably be unhappy with my Shaman too.</div></div><hr />

I agree Beastlords do not as a rule do this. I'm not sure it's because they can't or don't desire to.  Lets face it most Beasties don't work towards extending thier buff time from 6.5 minutes to 11 minutes like us Shaman's.<br />
<br />
With C5, SD, Mod Rods, and using thier AA PoS they can generate enough mana to toss around Ferocity a bit more and keep it up if they chose to.  Especially if they had extended duration gear and AA's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Top 5?<br />
<br />
1. Cleric<br />
2. Enchanter<br />
3. Warrior<br />
4. Bard<br />
5. Necro<br />
<br />
Now for the REAL unasked question - what are the bottom 5?<br />
<br />
1. Monk.  Two words - The nerf.<br />
2. Shaman. Hmm, USED to heal as well as a Druid, then that went 'bu-bye' just an expansion or two before mitigation. <br />
3. Berserker. Just not fleshed out enough. May get lubbin come OOW<br />
<br />
Really, just those three.  Anecdotal stories about how you healed in such and such group can't cover up the continuing erosion of the Shaman class. I don't gibes fek if we were gods in Kunark - that was 6 expansions ago.<br />
<br />
I want to be relevant NOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Chanter takes the number 1 spot in my book, best haste in the game, best mana regen in the game, best dps in the game and best CC in the game and ever so slightyly in second place for slows.<br />
<br />
over all one chanter can make or break a raid or an exp group, I have done some difficult raids with 0 clerics before, it sucks but its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">1.  Bard<br />
2.  Cleric<br />
3.  Warrior<br />
4.  Beastlord<br />
5.  Enchanter<br />
<br />
<br />
Several expansions ago it would have been Shamans &lt;&gt; Beastlords, but not anymore :(<br />
<br />
Though &quot;Top 5 classes&quot; just opens up a can of worms for various interpretations...do you mean power?  desirability?  popularity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Part of the reason I posted this was to get some feedback from all areas of the game.  Having played EQ (and my shaman) for 5 years, I know what my opinions on each class are.<br />
<br />
I put Druids #1 on my list, but I tend to only group with Druids in my guild, all of whom have 7K mana pools, FT15, and all of their spells.  I am constantly amazed at just how good Druids are now, compared to where they were 3 years ago when they couldn't get a group, period.<br />
<br />
Now, my basic question is/was, do people who have only played for a year, who have just hit 65, and spend most of their time in LDoNs or BoT, how do they feel about Druids being #1 on my list.  That was the whole point of this exercise.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to put up a poll.  Would probably be easier that way, and give everyone instant feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'll give you my 2c from 5+ years and 450aa's playing and I'm sure this is Druid board fodder.  I've played with maybe a handful of competent Druids, and none that I would for a second want to have in a primary healer spot unless no clerics were around.  Maybe, maybe in normal LDON but no need for them there with a competent Shaman anyway.<br />
<br />
So powerful? Ports are pretty much useless now since traveling is so easy.  Soloing isn't the big thing it used to be.  Druids fall short as primary healers and woefully short for the pure dps slot in a group.  So, they are like us Shaman in that they are now deligated to the utility roll in groups. <br />
 <br />
But I can see other classes looking at the utility spot in a vxed group and higher and saying &quot;Hmmm, chanter/beastlord can slow as good as shammy, druid nukes and spot heals are better, snare is good, evac (succor) is really useful - lets grab the druuuiiiiidddd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: So it gets back to Shaman as the Kings of trivial content and now Druids probably (unbelieveably) being a situationally better option for the utility slot in difficult content.  <br />
<br />
But more powerful than a great Bard, Necro or Enchanter? No Way! not even close.</div></div><hr />
