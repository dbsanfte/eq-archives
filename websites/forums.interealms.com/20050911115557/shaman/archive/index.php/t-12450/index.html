<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Halfling guards are really good for money making. they drop 10pp spears everytime, and they spawn relatively fast. They are low in hp.  The only downside is faction.  I fought at the wall in Misty Thicket, pulling Keld and Asler, Eigon and Poolt if they popped, and Felp, who is a little ways away.  Watch out for Budo and Drebo, they are pulled together and Budo is 100% magic resistant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thanks ill go trash my katts faction....bizarely my ogre shamsn is amiable to the guards(mucho tyme spent farming in runnyeye!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard that all guards have insane regen these days, is that true? and if so, do you just nuke them quickly and overcome it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didnt notice it, Venom of the Snake takes about half the health from Asler, the guard with the most HP, at lvl 41.  I got C3, and when I got there, I Rooted them, dotted them with Scourge and Venom of the Snake, and me and my pet hit them a little.  I could take 3 at a time at 41 and only lose about 2 bubs of health.  Again, watch out for Budo.  Pull to the opposite direction on the gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">btw watch out for that druid person.... she'll nuke u to hell  :D <br />
thats just about it...or u can go to paineel (need key or someone else w/ it) to enter and then start slaughtering the guards...dunno about aggro though...ima amiable to paineel. no factionhits no nuting. just cash + fs wep + shield (i think)  :p happy huntings <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The druid lady attacks you only if you are KoS to her.  She passed me several times while guard camping on my Barb and didn't attack once, conned amiably, but when my friends Dark Elf shadowknight went there, she killed him like every time she ran down the path.  Also watch out for that one Halfling NPC who runs around with Ember, he attacked me a few times, easy take down, but conned blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">of course it is camped when I get here :)<br />
<br />
any other guards that are good for loot, and around that level?</div></div><hr />
