<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thank you for the advice you gave pls check and see if this is more like i should be to last until lvl 50 + i am dead broke now lol  but i hope i made the right choices i focused on HP more than wisdom and i think i did good pls reply and let me know anything else i might do in the near future thank you <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=620100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anyone please ? basicly i want to know if i am set to last up to late 50s or so ? If i am not i am SoL anyhow lol broke now for a bit but just  curios if i balanced the hp/ac/wis factor thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have done very well.  <br />
<br />
Only things I can see now are the arms and the 2HB weapon.  Get some Jaundiced Bone Vambraces, The 18 AC will pay off far more than the handfull of stats you will get from those Shojen Vambraces even once they reach full power. There aren't many good choices for shaman arms at lower cost though. Giant Scale Mail or Ry`gorr are other options.<br />
<br />
The Tarnished Driveshaft is a great weapon, but not yet,  you pay far too high a penalty for being below it's recommended level.  You shoud be able to pick up a Frost Giant Femur for 20pp or less that will serve you better.  There are so many others even better that it would depend more on how much you can save before you buy.  Wait too long and you will grow into the TD.<br />
<br />
That gear should get you to the 50s though you will want to replace some of it as money permits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your magelo is accurate, you need to get your Agi to at least 75 before anything else.  Even at the cost of wisdom and hps.  You're taking a tremendous AC hit with your Agi below 75.  The most affordable upgrade for you would most likely be a Spider Fur Belt.  AC 10 Agi 5 40 hps iirc.  And as Cattywumpus said, JB Arms would be much better than the Shojen ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're taking a tremendous AC hit with your Agi below 75.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that with an AGI buff he will be over 75 and will not be taking that big hit.<br />
<br />
I am thinking that the odds are pretty good he will be able to have an AGI buff up pretty close to full time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would not like this setup at all.  HP is great advice for the those aproching 60 and beond but I would trade out a lot of your gear for AC at this time.<br />
<br />
You should do a little thinking instead of just asking for advice.  All the big post sixty shaman say go HP and that is great advice for post 60 shaman.  It does very little for a young shaman growing up.<br />
<br />
Why is HP nice in the end game?<br />
<br />
a) High attack ratings on PoP mobs reduce the effectiveness of AC<br />
b) Can V<br />
c) Very hard hitting mobs require a greater safty margin in the form of a large HP pool.<br />
d) compleat heal spells are more efficient <br />
<br />
Before you reach the 50s and start grouping in PoP then having a large HP pool is no more usefull then having a large mana pool.   Both provide an aditional level of safty but do nothing with how efficient you shaman is.<br />
<br />
This is not rocket sciense.<br />
<br />
The only things that effect how efficient you are at gaingin exp,<br />
<br />
a) How fast you regain Mana<br />
b) How fast you regain HP<br />
c) How fast you use Mana<br />
d) How fast you use HP<br />
e) Damage output<br />
<br />
Efficency must be balanced with safty wich is basicly the size of your Mana and HP pool. <br />
<br />
You can improve how efficeint your shaman is by improving any of the 5 factors and having a big chunk of HP at level 15 does nothing to make you kill faster.<br />
<br />
a) How fast you gain mana<br />
  FT items<br />
  Mana Regen buffs <br />
  AAXP<br />
<br />
b) How fast you regain HP<br />
  HP regen items<br />
  HP regen buffs<br />
  Canibalization<br />
<br />
c) How fast you use mana<br />
  Choice of spell / buffs<br />
  Focus Items<br />
  AAXP<br />
<br />
d) How fast you use HP<br />
  Combat damage<br />
  Canibalization<br />
  Spell Damage<br />
<br />
e) damage output<br />
  Spells<br />
  Click Items like JBB and Epic<br />
  Mele weapon<br />
  Hast Item<br />
<br />
When you have a look at a an item of equipment you should consider your situation and evaluate it benifits in comparision to other items you can pick.<br />
<br />
The best items you can get are those that dirctly effect your efficency like the Iksar Regen BP and a hast item and a good weapon.   Some Focus items can also make a significant differance.  Before level 50 or so,  AC is great to have because it improves how well you mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
How much mana or wisdome or hp an item has is almost meaningless untill you get to the point where you are fighting mobs that make it meaningfull and trivialize other more usefull stats like AC.<br />
<br />
A few items I would replace from your megalo<br />
<br />
Barbed Ringmail  &lt; Iksar regen BP<br />
Shojen Vambraces &lt; Jaundiced Bone<br />
Dusty Soriz Boots &lt; Jaundiced Bone<br />
Grey Flech Gloves &lt; SCHW for haste<br />
Eye of the Griffon &lt; G Idol<br />
Metal Linked Crown &lt; Jaundiced Bone<br />
<br />
Also an ODS would be nice.<br />
<br />
Basicly I think you have erred significantly in your choise of equipment,  you have far to much useless wisdom and HP and not are very soft and easy to damage.<br />
<br />
I am very sorry that so meny people give such crapy advice about HP.  I only hope that it is so because they are at the stage where HP is truly king and have forgotten what it is like to level up.<br />
<br />
I also play a Ogre shaman and with a good high ac setup we can be an amazing chain pulling killing system.<br />
<br />
We can spend almost no mana on damage and just pull with slow.  It is clear that you intend to keep all your mele skills up and this is very wise.  A good 2hb can add significantly to your DPS untill you get a JBB and a horse.<br />
<br />
I am sure a lot of people will disagree with my advice but I hope you will start to think criticaly so that you can make your own assesment and judgements based on your personal play methods and preferances.<br />
<br />
I personly think a large HP pool is meaningless untill you get Can V.  If you grow to understand what factors make a shaman efficient then you will have no need to come to this board and ask for equipment advice.<br />
<br />
I will put my megalo up for you to look at.<br />
<br />

<br />
Only very recently has my wisdom started to creap up and I have just replaced my iksar bp with a rune crafters.  Truly I would still rather equip the Iksar till 60 but I got the Rune Crafters at a guild event and do not want to be rude.  Untill just a short time ago my arms and feet where still Jaundiced Bone.  At this point I try to upgrade without sacrificing ac because self buffed I can break 1k ac.<br />
<br />
Self buffed I get to about 2300 hp and 1015 ac and this is working just fine with Can V.  When I get 60 and can cast focus I will have more HP to work with and will start doing AAXP for ND.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your gear will certainly get you to 50.  Some of the recommended level stuff isn't what I would choose if I were gearing up a young shaman - but you're not doing poorly by any means.<br />
<br />
Go kill stuff.  And, yes, keep an AGI buff up at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you all for the advice and the magelo is wrong i do have 75 unbuffed agi i put 5 points into it on making him,<br />
and last night i was not stop killing with him .... so it seems so far he is doing good, and i got to say so far shamans rock i have tons of chars i have taken to 50+ and 30s and hope this is one i will stick with till 65 so far i Love Him  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, good info Radag, but I don't think he'll be exping for AA at lvl 15.<br />
<br />
And it's &quot;rocket science&quot;... :c)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LoL Dyrk...  I don't think he is either I just wanted to point out some of the things that can have an impact on the basics.<br />
<br />
Hell I am fighting a loosing battle anyway.  People run and get KEI now and that will do more for you then just about any equipment choise you can make.<br />
<br />
If KEI goes for 100p and a fungy goes for 50kp then a fungi is about 500 kei casts....  I would think that would get you to 60 far faster then any equipment item.  The art of bing a shaman is being overshadowed by the ease of curent play.  The game is becoming something of a joke.</div></div><hr />
