<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given my aa in my magelo below, do you think that it's worthwhile to go for QB3 or should I just leave it at QB2 and go for something else right now?  I find that I've been the main healer in the group or soloing a lot lately so I don't have Reverence available and also don't have a spell haste item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a tough call for me.<br />
<br />
Argument A:  9 points is an awful lot and quickbuff can be nearly maxed at the second level with a mithaniel item (like the wicked bone atlatl)<br />
<br />
Argument B: You might as well max it and never be gear dependent on Quickbuff haste.  Of course, you might later want a Mithaniel item since it also works on Tnargs.<br />
<br />
Since I have a Speed of Mithaniel item, I stopped at QB 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went for it.  I don't like feeling like i'm stuck using *something* for beneficial haste.  Plus, I could never find attainable items that were better / as good as the ones I already had.  I think I did qb3 around the 100 aa mark, and it was well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>goreldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for 9aa u best get MGB first. even if your in a small guild that dont raid much itownz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree.. MGB will save your sanity if you're the only shaman on a raid. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stop at QB2, save the points, and use a Naki's ring from a Magician.  It will help you on more than just buffing, and with Blessing of Reverence you will still have very good generic spell haste.</div></div><hr />
