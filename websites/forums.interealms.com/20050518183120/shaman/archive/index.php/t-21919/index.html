<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman HoT's and Cleric HoT's stacked?  I'm sure this isn't the first suggestion of this; but, it would indirectly make us better healers without infringing on the clerics.<br />
<br />
I'd like to say that I don't endorse us becoming much better healers than we are due to my playstyle, but that's just me.  However, this would allow shaman and clerics to really complement each other with regards to healing.  Per the new Lucy spells, that would be Q (420) + SE (600) = 1020 healing per tick . . . not too shabby and not unbalancing, IMO.</div></div><hr />

That would actually be really unbalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Plus the GoD ones are 900+630=1530/tick...  That's quite a lot of healing - 255dps cancelled out by only casting once every 30 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really anymore unblancing then direct heals. WHats a comp heal heal for 7500? Not sure about the recast but even at 5 seconds a cleric can heal 500 dps all by themselves. SPam heals can keep up even better than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And one more thing, in your HoT example its 1 cast each for cleric and shaman in 30 seconds heals 255, a cleric with the right tank can heal 1 time without backup and heal for 250 dps. So to say that 2 toons combining to heal for 255 a second versus 1 toon doing it for 250 isn't a very good argument. The only difference is that HoT's don't cause agro or as much agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay... and why can't the cleric and shaman that have put their HoTs on the tank also complete and/or spam heal at the same time the HoTs are running?</div></div><hr />
