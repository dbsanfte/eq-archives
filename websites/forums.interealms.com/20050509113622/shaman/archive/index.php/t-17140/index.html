<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after 2 years, 3 months, and a /played of 62 days, 4hrs, I am happy to announce Ding!  60!<br />
<br />
/nostalgia on<br />
I remember when I started EQ.  All my friends wanted to make an all Faydwer guild, so i began playing as a wood elf ranger.  Life was tough scraping up enough silvers and gold to buy my first backpacks, and sharpen my first tarnished swords.  Straying from the trails meant a sure death at the hands of some wandering orc or goblin!<br />
<br />
I remember the first time I saw a barbarian.  He was a warrior, and he was UBER because he had 2!  :eek:  swords and bronze armor!  He was tall and cool looking.  Then I heard that they could be shaman, and that shaman got SoW at lvl 9.  That did it!  Korman was promptly born that day.<br />
<br />
I remember the truly nerve-wracking run from Everfrost to meet my friends in Faydwer.  Talk about heart pounding!  The 20 minute run through Western Karana, dodging everything!  The crazy suicide run through High Pass, hoping that someone was camping the orcs and goblins, keeping them engaged while I ran through.  The suspenseful runs through Kithicor; hugging the mountainside at night praying that I'd make it through.  20 minute boat rides to Faydwer.  My triumphant announcement to my wife that I had run all the way from Everfrost to Greater Faydark, and her responding with the eye-brow raise and patronizing &quot;thats nice, honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the memories!  I still play about once a week.  Have 2 children now that are lots of fun.  Sometimes when they're in bed, and my wife is reading, I miss the &quot;good ole days&quot; when EQ was still new and fresh for me.  I still remember being scared to death zoning into Befallen for the first time!   :D <br />

Call me crazy, or an old-timer, but what made EQ so immersive (sp?) and wonderful to me was that it DID take an hour to go to another continent; death WAS an extremely painful ordeal (corpse runs from the next continent); faction mattered; there were some things that you NEEDED help from other players.  That is what separated EQ from just another first person shooter game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agreed, most completely.<br />
=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulations!<br />
<br />
And yes, everything you said is what made EQ immersive.  Hopefully Brad can pull it off again with whatever Sigil is cooking up.<br />
<br />
The concept of an immersive world with consequences for mistakes has been completely lost in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good job on getting to 60. I'm almost there myself. I started playing the game last November and wish I had started long before that like I knew I should have everytime I looked at games at a store. I'm actually looking forward to a nice cold winter when it's too cold to go outside and I can just sit in my nice warm house playing EQ all night without the guilt of knowing I should really be doing some sort of yard work or something outside.<br />
<br />
Your post made me think of some of the memories of getting started myself. All the travels, mistakes, groups, mobs, the first time a mob dropped Platinum instead of gold or silver, and on and on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I miss the good old days well. I was disappointed when LoY came out. Click on the boat and it ported you to LoY. I miss language training on the boat rides. Only if EQ used those lanuages for something.<br />
<br />
Congratz on 60! I did the same run from EverFrost to Freeport with my lvl 4 barb warrior but I ran through the maze because i didn't know about highkeep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats!! <br />
<br />
No doubt this game has changed alot, but it had too. Keeping a virtual world interesting enough to stay involved in for over 4 years is pretty amazing.<br />
<br />
The runs were fun the first few times, grueling the 100th time. I don't hate druids like I used to.<br />
<br />
I remember the old timers complaning that LOIO xp rate was dumbing down the game, HA!<br />
<br />
Its sad to see all the level 65's in the game though, its only a sign that this games days are numbered or can we say 70?<br />
<br />
I must say that sony did hit a HR with Ldon after a questionable Loy expansion.</div></div><hr />
