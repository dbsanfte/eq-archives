<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, I jumped on the bandwagon when people were urked over the healing fix forgetfulness that SoE had with the patch.  It was fixed and we got a new 1550 heal.  We had an upgrade to Quiescence and our lousy dot was replaced with a new HoT, Breath of Trushar.  Now I come to the boards and I still see shamans complaining about healing issues.  <br />
<br />
      GoD is a brand new expansion; its also the new &quot;upper tier&quot;.  Its hard, its difficult, and it shows who can really play their class well.  I have currently been farming Vxt, Tipt with two groups.  Now while I have lost every roll (damn dice), we have come out of there with about a dozen pieces of gear/augments.  There is a spot for me in groups- a debuffer.  GoD is a rough expansion even for me.  It shows me where I need to work on aa's and gear.  GoD is rough on everyone; time geared peeps have it a little easier, but not by much.  Tanks are having a hard time tanking without dying.  Healers are having a hard time healing without drawing aggro and dying.  Hybrids and pullers are having a hard time assisting/pulling without drawing aggro and dying.<br />
<br />
     I enjoy GoD because it is a new challenge.  Bastion of Thunder is trivial,  Plane of Tactics is trivial, LDoN is super-trivial.  I can slow, heal, and even tank in those zones.  Did I have my problems in those zones when I first arrived there- yes.  I thought BoT and Tactics were uber, and how would I survive getting hit by mobs that slam you for 500 points of damage a hit.  I was running with about 2000 hitpoints unbuffed- it was scary.  With planar progression and LDoN I was able to obtain better gear and more aa's.  Alternate Advancement points make a big difference when grouping or soloing, just ask someone that has LR5, ID5, FOMM, or any of the healing lines.  It makes a big difference.<br />
<br />
     If BoT, LDoN, or Plane of Tactics is difficult for you then you do not belong in GoD.  You are just not ready for it.  Stay in BoT, LDoN, Tactics until you are.   We are already getting links of gear from GoD boss mobs that compare to or are even better to Time drops.  Should the average shaman that plays around in BoT have easy access to GoD drops- no.  That trivializes Plane of Time and the work that guilds have put into progressing that far.  What GoD will allow you to do is open up the Planes by having the uber guilds move out in their progression of the &quot;new uber&quot; GoD.  The game is about progression.  You have to learn to crawl before you can walk.<br />
<br />
     PoP really dumbed down the game with its stones/books and easily accessible zones/cr's.  In GoD, those days are gone.  People have gotten lazy in the game.  They leave groups if they die once, they complain about having to buy regeants, pet weapons, or have to make their own cr's.  Tough!  If you want easy xp go back to your PoV, BoT, Tactics.  <br />
<br />
     An expansion is always at its toughest when it just comes out.  It usually takes one or two uber guilds to progress to a certain point before the developers re-evaluate the encounters and tinker with them.<br />
A couple examples of this were: Rathe Council edit, Opening up BoT, PoV, PoS, and CoD to non-flagged, LDoN.  These changes made it easier for guilds to progress.  The Rathe Council edit made it easier for EP guilds to progress to Time.  Opening up tier 2/3 zones to non-keyed characters allowed easier access to Ornate and better xp.  LDoN allowed people to upgrade to near elemental quality gear with simple 6 man groups.  I see a lot of people complaining about not having access to GoD, but I see very few posts of people complaining about not having access to PoTime.  I &quot;do&quot; see a lot of posts about &quot; I am not in PoTime because I hate raiding and Planar Progression.&quot;  That's the point- those that hated it and did it anyway need new content.  GoD is that content.  <br />
<br />
     Right now I can't heal worth a damn in GoD.  I am not complaining because I haven't maxed my healing aa's or have gotten lucky and seen the new shaman spells drop.  I will re-evaluate my poisition once I have done that, but I see it as possible.  I will never be main healer for GoD, but that is fine.  That is Everquest working as intended.  We were not meant to be a main healer in new content- we were meant to be a slower.  We couldn't heal worth a damn when PoP came out because our new heal spells were out of reach- locked behind levels and content that we did not have access to at the time.  But as time went on we got those spells.  The puzzle of GoD is still being cracked, until its done just sit tight and progress through your levels and aa's.<br />
<br />
P.S. GoD group setup that I have been running with:<br />
<br />
Tank- preferably warrior, EP/Time quality<br />
Ranger- tracker/non-dot snarer (sk/necro snare conflicts with mez)<br />
Cleric- main healer, REZ! (rez is a big reason for cleric as main healer<br />
          right now)<br />
Bard- puller, kiter (bard speed), back-up mezzer (for chanter pet breaks)<br />
Chanter- the dps (chanter charm pets are the key to fast movement),  <br />
             debuff, better be a damn good chanter.<br />
Shaman- debuff, back-up healer (esp for cleric aggro)(we don't slow-   <br />
             takes too damn long when pet can kill a mob in about 4 <br />
             seconds.)<br />
<br />
Right now the group is very rigid, besides the tank everyone else brought in brings 2 necessary functions to the group.  Shamans are getting groups- the just tend to be guildies of the guy who is running the show.<br />
<br />
P.S.S. Rez is a dumb idea.  I get harassed for buffs enough, getting<br />
         more tells for rez in Z zone past zone X,Y would send me over the<br />
         edge.  If you really want to rez either A. buy a Staff of Forbidden<br />
         Rites (96% Rez 10 charges) or B. kill slimes in DN (50% rez 1<br />
         charge, may be self only)<br />

Rant On.<br />

You picked a very very specific group combo.  Good for you.<br />
I will tell you for a fact, that you are not needed in that group.<br />
<br />
A good chanter can and does handle both Pet and Slows.<br />
<br />
So grats you, on really prooving how wonderful it is.  <br />
<br />
Sure have a shm and chanter is nice.  But it is unnecessary.<br />
Replace that Ranger with a Druid.  and you have a group with Snare/Track still and a 2nd back up healer.  That would easily allow you to be replaced as well.<br />
<br />
Granted Shms are getting groups in trials, because there arent simply enough healers or chanters in combination.  When the guild does a trial day, I usually get a slot because there are only so many chanters to go around and/or healers.<br />
<br />
But for someone to say &quot;everything is fine&quot; and yet say &quot;sure the group is a bit rigid&quot; is idiotic in the extreme.   When everything is fine, the group isn't so rigid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a number of substitutions you can make.  Because we are not needed in every group does not make us broken.  A good chanter can slow and control pet, but I have yet to meet one that said &quot;omg, there is a shaman in my group.&quot;  We tend to chose a ranger over a druid in case of the bad pull.  A ranger can pop his weaponshield discipline and tank something for a limited amount of time where a druid can't.  The role I was playing in the group was not slower, but debuffer.  The chanters that I have met that run those trials prefer to have as much debuff power as they can in the group in the hopes that the pet breaks less.  <br />
<br />
     The key behind the group is keeping the pet under control, the mob tanked, and the cleric alive.  Its the same as its always been- just takes a little thinking outside the box.  PoP was the same way when it came out- except the rules were a little different.  Everyone desperately needed a slower, and tanks were finding it hard to be &quot;tanks&quot;.  Everyone wanted a cleric in the group, because they had the best heals and the best &quot;rez&quot;.  With every new upper end expansion that is brought out the Holy Trinity is needed again until the puzzle is broken.  I am not saying that we as a shaman class are perfect, but trying to play catch up with the other priests classes in the healing department will only lower their desirability in groups.  Why grab a cleric who only heals when you can grab a shaman who heals and slows thereby opening 2 group slots.<br />
<br />
     A lot of GoD is not just about the trinity, its about being good.  I have seen plenty tanks, clerics, and enchanters that just don't cut the mustard in the new expansion.  They will not get many tells for GoD until they work on it- does that make them unbalanced?  So far, by what I have seen once the tank/cleric/chanter has been determined its about a backup plan.  You want to have as many overlapping secondary abilities as possible.  We bring two to the table- healing and debuffing.  DPS is not an issue in Vxt/Tipt because the pet slaughters mobs in a matter of seconds, so a lot of those pure dps classes are not going to see much of GoD at all for quite a while.  I have only seen the ranger getting groups- not because of dps, but for snare,track, and weaponshield.<br />
<br />
     There are far worse off classes right now with this new expansion- Monk and more specifically Mage.  Mages have a debuff line similar to ours, but thats all they bring to the table in GoD.  I have already said DPS is not a factor, and pet toys can be bought in the bazaar.  GoD is fairly easy to pull with singles and sometimes doubles- a bard has more variety than a monk and therefore better for a group looking to overlap abilities.<br />
<br />
    The groups also tend to be regulars (i.e. 3-4 buddies/guildies with 2 invites.) This is done because groups going into GoD like to know that with all the trouble they go through they want to know that the group has a decent chance of success.  They want to be able to trust that their groupmates know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
     GoD is still an elitist expansion, I rarely see anyone pulled from the lfg window.  Compare the number of people hanging around BoT or LDoN camps and then check out who is hanging around the Vxt/Tipt portal.  After you notice that very different numbers- check out the guild tags.  All I see is Time/Elemental peeps, and a couple of really good Sol Ro/indy peeps hanging around.  GoD is going to be a pretty big puzzle to break- it looks to be extensive in its progression and its difficult content.<br />
I am sure many of you have seen equipment links coming out of there.  The guilds haven't even come close to the final zones content and we are already seeing time quality and higher gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you're doing tipt, then Surely you've noticed in your charm group that having the bard slow and having you backup heal is more beneficial?</div></div><hr />

          Oh yeah ,buy a 10 million pp staff ,or kill for nothing mob in DN because it don't drop since a long long time.<br />
<br />
          But back to the topic.......yes GoD is a challenge ,but a sony challenge . Just make mob hit harder and give them nasty proc and voila...an annoying challenge with no fun cr. Bah anyway in 3 month we'll have WoW  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still don't see how anything you've said negates the basic fact that at least 3 of the spots in any Vxed group, and up to 5 spots in any Tipt group, are AUTOMATICALLY delegated to specific classes, or to a VERY narrow range of classes. <br />
<br />
You MUST have a tank capable of taking the damage.<br />
You MUST have a cleric, because the damage even that tank will take is too high.<br />
You MUST have either a chanter or a druid, because without the insane DPS that a charmed pet creates, you can't take the mobs down in time.<br />
<br />
with Tipt, you MUST have a secondary healer, and right now at least, that healer MUST be either another cleric, or a druid. And btw, in my guild at least, thus far policy is to take a second rezzer on each Tipt group, because the death rate is so high (we are a Tier 5 Time guild, btw--killed all but Inny just last night). Preferred second rezzer is also a FD class, so they can wait and rez clerics and etc after mobs wander off.<br />
<br />
So that takes up 5 slots, as I count them. That last slot, sure, we can throw in some poor cousin who can throw a debuff here or there. Mage will work for that just as well as shaman can. Or we can make it DPS instead, because frankly, with charm pet, DPS is so high that Slow doesn't land until the mob is over half dead anyway, especially if you bother with Malos first.<br />
<br />
So, what this forces is a guild to force the same poor warriors and clerics and enchanters/druids to run Tipt OVER and OVER, just to drag the rest of our poor asses along. Or, alternately, they can just require all other classes to start new characters from the &quot;holy&quot; group, and level us up to 65, which might in the long run be faster than ferrying us through one or two at a time... :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the bard idea.  We have currently been running groups with 2 different bards, and to be quite honest I am not sure what songs they are using besides fade to help split.  I know its been very much touch and go to see what we can do while still balancing aggro.  It is very likely that one is using it (outstanding bard who normally leads.), but the other one while very good is still new to GoD content.  I have found it easier to debuff and back-up/spot heal with our fast mana regen to offset the cleric's manapool which is drained quickly in the encounters.<br />
<br />
As to the rez issue, I am sorry about the misinformation on the rez drop from the goo.  I knew that at one time it was dropped, but was rare with another clicky as a common drop.  Rezzing ability for myself would be more situational that practice.  It would be virtually useless at a 50% ratio pre-65 due to the loss in leveling-xp.  Plus-65 people would still want 90-96% unless we were rezzing a cleric/pally with a wipe, but then we are usually one of the first few to die anyway....  We know Sony doesn't usually give new abilities without handing out a few detriments along with it.  I can't see wanting to take more handicaps for a &quot;situational&quot; rez.</div></div><hr />

     PoP really dumbed down the game with its stones/books and easily accessible zones/cr's.  In GoD, those days are gone.  People have gotten lazy in the game.  They leave groups if they die once, they complain about having to buy regeants, pet weapons, or have to make their own cr's.  Tough!  If you want easy xp go back to your PoV, BoT, Tactics.  <br />
<br />
Actually, those three zones you list are the only ones available to the L65 non-raider- not sure where else the non-raid player is going to go to gear up to do GoD.  GoD = raid only, using your own logic.  Or to sum up your points more succinctly:<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop whining, if I can do it with other people carrying my near useless [cl]ass, anyone can!&quot;<br />
<br />
-- and, since you can't resist cheap-shotting people stuck in the aforementioned zones due to inability to raid --<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't want to leave your friends and join a raid guild? **** and GFY, newb!&quot;<br />
<br />
There, much less typing- just cut/paste that next time you want to rant.<br />

Nonsense. My regular group was working on the ikkiniz trials this weekend. We killed the first 3 nameds and were testing tactics on DD with a group that consisted of: Warrior (Me), monk, ranger, cleric, beastlord and a shaman. Not only that, the shaman was being played by someone who normally plays a pally. We had very few problems prior to DD. Allthough we are flagged for Time, we haven't actually raided there yet, so ours was a weaker group than ones from your guild. And Ikkiniz is a LOT harder than Tipt. You dont &quot;need&quot; a secondary healer in Tipt if you have a chanter, allthough it obviously helps to have one. A shaman does just fine (we just breezed through with a cleric/shaman combo when I flagged my shaman, so I know that for a fact - I spent most of the time doing malos/turgurs, the group essentially won with a single healer), in fact I would think that using a shaman/ranger combo is far superior to the druid/misc dps alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This doesnt change bot at all. It was already ez enuf to duo any of the wing bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I knew this was going to be a hot topic when I wrote it- I can't reply fast enough.  In reference to the group make-up- yes you are right with the tactics you are using.  For a guild to progress as fast as possible through the trials they are going to go with the best they can get to ferry the guild across.  While the groups I run with would love another rezzer (preferably a necro) it is currently not feasible.  Necros have had a pretty bad rap for quite a long time.  Most of your average players have no idea what a necro can bring to the table for a group, so for quite a long time on my server they are perma-lfg.  Many of those necros have since re-rolled, and there are just not enough left to fill the spots in GoD groups.  Most of the Time guilds on my server run with about 3 necros in their community- that's it.  Taking into account that their will be roughly 10% that can't play their class properly, 25% that just are not geared for it, and about 30% that just are not the level required- we are left with a resounding 35% to choose from.  It is a little more dangerous, but we have no other choose.  That is why we go with a bard as a back-up mezzer.  I try to balance out a cleric's spot heals in hopes that if aggro is pulled from the MT then I will pull the aggro, because if I die- I can recover in about 3-4 mins while pulls are still going on.<br />
<br />
The point I am trying to get at is this: We are not a required class for GoD where we were for previous expansions, but its not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
P.S. As far as gearing up goes- I haven't raided in a while with my guild.  Due to a move to a opposite timezone it is unlikely for me to be able to make it for their raids.  I chose alternate methods to gear up- LDoN, quests, and whatever else I could track down.  The new expansion has shown me the flaws that I need to work out in regards to gear and aa's- I accept that.  GoD is the new high-end expansion- PoTime is now considered the gearing-up zone for GoD raid content.  Comparing Class balancing to a new expansion where everyone is getting their butt kicked is not feasible at this moment- because a majority of the populous will not see it for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just look at it like this.  GoD can be done using other means.  Tipt/Vxed aren't that hard once you know what you are doing and have a competent group.  The reason that you don't see multiple people outside of the bigger guilds doing it is cause it's considered &quot;too hard&quot;.  Most people that I know have completed it mainly cause their guild put a priority on it.  If someone has decided that something is too hard, then most won't try it.  That's why no one is fighting in barindu, where you can literally see a named every 30 min fighting in the courtyard for easy hard ldon type gear.  If you know a melee or plate class or any caster that doesn't have all the items from the Sludge-Eating Fly from the lair, then you are slacking.  I think that everyone and their twinks in my guild have them, just because it's such an easy thing to get, considering the named pops next to the zone in point, and he's pretty cake for the average warrior to tank.  This stuff isn't that hard, it's considered hard only because people don't want to try new things, instead relying on places like BoT to keep around.  <br />
<br />
Want an easy 100hp/mana spell haste IV or Fungal Regrowth melee BP?  Go solo in Riwwi.  Hell, kill the named stuff there.  Nothing in the zone summons.  Root/rot your ass away.  Sure the exp isn't as nice as say PoFire, but good loot from trash mobs is always nice, plus the named are easily killed.  Beastlord friend and I duoed here for about 2 hours a few days ago and saw two of the caster bps.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, it'sjust kinda like hard LDoN adventures, people outside of the bigger guilds are too afraid right now to try it out, and if they did once and they wiped horribly, they are too afraid to try it again.  I'm sure it'll pass.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I don't even know what it's like to use a chanter's pet in Tipt/Vxed.  I haven't done it in the 20+ times I've been in the zone, and someof them have been with ah chanter.  I had to beg her one time to get a pet, but they decided to kill it before we got to the final named (to which of course we wiped when the tank forgot that he's supposed to agro the named on the pull).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know about you, but I cant think of anyplace where a shaman is required.  Anything and everything we do can be done as well or better by someone else.  Thats actually a good thing, requiring any specific class is a bad idea.  Of course, thats whats bad about GoD, required classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done Tipt and Vxed both twice without an enchanter. With a reasonable group who knows what they're doing, it isn't that hard.<br />
<br />
For example, I did trial 6 yesterday with warrior, shadow knight, cleric, druid, magician, shaman. A few days ago, I did trial 5 with warrior, cleric, shaman, paladin, magician, shadow knight.<br />
<br />
I must admit a lot of my guild is good at helping people out without always going for the conventionally required classes, and it means that we have succeeded these trials with combinations that aren't optimal, but which other people wouldn't even consider.<br />
<br />
For trial 6, you do need at least a very well geared warrior, a cleric and a backup healer (druid/cleric). I wouldn't suggest even trying it if you're not at least elemental geared.<br />
<br />
I would like to be at least good enough a healer to be a backup healer for some of this content, but I know that even with enchanters being prefered, I'm not completely unwanted as a slower.</div></div><hr />

Unless of course you are a cleric, warrior, bard or enchanter.<br />
<br />
I have currently been farming Vxt, Tipt with two groups. There is a spot for me in groups- a debuffer.<br />
Yes - debuffing the enchanters pet is useful (no sarcasm here - it is). Slowing MOBs is not needed at all. You would be about as well off just healing and much better off having a better healer in your spot.<br />
<br />
GoD is a rough expansion even for me.  It shows me where I need to work on aa's and gear.  GoD is rough on everyone; time geared peeps have it a little easier, but not by much.  Tanks are having a hard time tanking without dying.  Healers are having a hard time healing without drawing aggro and dying.<br />
 :eek: <br />
Well, I can honestly say I have never had problems with that.<br />
<br />
Hybrids and pullers are having a hard time assisting/pulling without drawing aggro and dying.<br />
I can pull 90% singles in any of these zones without any pulling tools. Any FD or pacify class can pull about 99% singles. A bard can pull 100% singles.<br />
And how exactly does anyone have a hard time assisting?<br />
<br />
I enjoy GoD because it is a new challenge.  Bastion of Thunder is trivial,  Plane of Tactics is trivial, LDoN is super-trivial.  I can slow, heal, and even tank in those zones.  Did I have my problems in those zones when I first arrived there- yes.  I thought BoT and Tactics were uber, and how would I survive getting hit by mobs that slam you for 500 points of damage a hit.  I was running with about 2000 hitpoints unbuffed- it was scary.  With planar progression and LDoN I was able to obtain better gear and more aa's.  Alternate Advancement points make a big difference when grouping or soloing, just ask someone that has LR5, ID5, FOMM, or any of the healing lines.  It makes a big difference.<br />
Noone complains about GoD being hard. I like hard. We complain because it is hard for shaman and knights and probably some others too - yet it is trivial for a group that stocks up on clerics, enchanters and warriors.<br />
<br />
If BoT, LDoN, or Plane of Tactics is difficult for you then you do not belong in GoD.<br />
Do I look like this fits me? Yet I complain about GoD. It has nothing at all to do with difficulty.<br />
<br />
You are just not ready for it.  Stay in BoT, LDoN, Tactics until you are.   We are already getting links of gear from GoD boss mobs that compare to or are even better to Time drops.<br />
Of course we do - you expect better gear two expansions later.<br />
<br />
Should the average shaman that plays around in BoT have easy access to GoD drops- no.  That trivializes Plane of Time and the work that guilds have put into progressing that far.  What GoD will allow you to do is open up the Planes by having the uber guilds move out in their progression of the &quot;new uber&quot; GoD.  The game is about progression.  You have to learn to crawl before you can walk.<br />
Now, answer me this: Why is it ok for a few classes to have it much much easier then everyone else?<br />
<br />
PoP really dumbed down the game with its stones/books and easily accessible zones/cr's.  In GoD, those days are gone.  People have gotten lazy in the game.  They leave groups if they die once, they complain about having to buy regeants, pet weapons, or have to make their own cr's.  Tough!  If you want easy xp go back to your PoV, BoT, Tactics.  <br />
So who here have you seen claiming that GoD is too hard? I cannot remember anyone.<br />
<br />
An expansion is always at its toughest when it just comes out.  It usually takes one or two uber guilds to progress to a certain point before the developers re-evaluate the encounters and tinker with them.<br />
The raids are easy by the way - besides Uqua that is.<br />
<br />
A couple examples of this were: Rathe Council edit, Opening up BoT, PoV, PoS, and CoD to non-flagged, LDoN.  These changes made it easier for guilds to progress.<br />
And none of that was unbalanced content. Hard yes, unbalanced no.<br />
<br />
The Rathe Council edit made it easier for EP guilds to progress to Time.  Opening up tier 2/3 zones to non-keyed characters allowed easier access to Ornate and better xp.  LDoN allowed people to upgrade to near elemental quality gear with simple 6 man groups.  I see a lot of people complaining about not having access to GoD, but I see very few posts of people complaining about not having access to PoTime.<br />
Noone complains about not having access to GoD. People complain about everyone else having it easier then they do.<br />
<br />
Right now I can't heal worth a damn in GoD.  I am not complaining because I haven't maxed my healing aa's or have gotten lucky and seen the new shaman spells drop.  I will re-evaluate my poisition once I have done that, but I see it as possible.<br />
I do not have the new spot heal. I have maxed my healing AAs and have an improved heal item, a spell haste item, a duration extender and mana preservation. Oh, and I have the new HoT.<br />
I still do not come close to healing as well as a freshly leveled cleric twink with 30ish AAs and no focus items who does not have a slower.<br />
<br />
I will never be main healer for GoD, but that is fine.  That is Everquest working as intended.  We were not meant to be a main healer in new content- we were meant to be a slower.<br />
Ok, I will say it again. Slow is not only not needed in the very zones you list as your example, in many cases you are actually better off healing.<br />
<br />
We couldn't heal worth a damn when PoP came out because our new heal spells were out of reach- locked behind levels and content that we did not have access to at the time.<br />
Tnarg's was locked behind content?<br />
<br />
P.S. GoD group setup that I have been running with:<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
and in that group you are useful for one thing, casting Malosinia on the enchanter's pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up:<br />
Yes, we want fixes to our class. Yes, these fixes would make GoD easier for us. We would like to have it just as easy as a cleric or enchanter or warrior. Is that wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree with a lot of what you say, actually. I still think a little more tweaking for shamans would be nice, but I've found enchanters aren't as *required* as some people seem to think.<br />
<br />
I've done Tipt and Vxed both twice without an enchanter. With a reasonable group who knows what they're doing, it isn't that hard.<br />
Oh, you certainly can do both without an enchanter. You just need yet more healing (for the boss) and you will take two or three times as long.<br />
<br />
For example, I did trial 6 yesterday with warrior, shadow knight, cleric, druid, magician, shaman. A few days ago, I did trial 5 with warrior, cleric, shaman, paladin, magician, shadow knight.<br />
Notice how there is always a cleric and a warrior in there? Could you imagine doing any of these without a cleric?<br />
<br />
For trial 6, you do need at least a very well geared warrior, a cleric and a backup healer (druid/cleric). I wouldn't suggest even trying it if you're not at least elemental geared.<br />
And you see nothing wrong with that setup for single-group content?<br />
<br />
I would like to be at least good enough a healer to be a backup healer for some of this content, but I know that even with enchanters being prefered, I'm not completely unwanted as a slower.<br />
So, you too say you are not even a backup healer for that content and you are not the prefered slower (not that slowing is remotely required . . ) and you do not see any problems with that?<br />
If we are not wanted for heals and for slwos where does that leave us in your opinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So, you too say you are not even a backup healer for that content and you are not the prefered slower (not that slowing is remotely required . . ) and you do not see any problems with that?<br />
If we are not wanted for heals and for slwos where does that leave us in your opinion?<br />
<br />
Yes, I do have a problem that all these things NEED warriors and NEED clerics. They don't NEED enchanters though.<br />
<br />
I have done Trial 5 as a backup healer, of all the trials 1-6, it's only the named in trial 6 which really needs 2 healers.<br />
<br />
We *are* wanted for slows though. That's my point. An *ideal* group might have an enchanter, because crowd control is so highly thought of, but a shaman is still a good choice, and we bring other things to the table. In much of GoD, a good FD puller means you don't really need crowd control, and in those rare cases where you get adds, a backup tank or root can do the job.<br />
<br />
My presence in a group means the rest of the group does more damage - the melees with FA, the casters with malos/malosinia. The clerics heal less because my slow is the best around, and because I help heal the group.<br />
<br />
What I resent slightly is that people see enchanters as slow + CC, but really don't consider shamans as healers. We get groups on the strength of the slow, and not for all the other things we can do, which is why the enchanters are in higher demand.<br />
<br />
So yes, I would like to be able to heal better, I would like to heal well enough that it's a consideration when people are choosing a group, and not just an afterthought. But on the whole, I think we're better off than the likes of paladins and magicians in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild want me in Tipt groups for several reasons:<br />

3)  I got in there early and know the event well (ie you can be useful for your non-class related skills as well)<br />

With a charmed pet it is really not necessary to slow most of the mobs.  I slow the trash because it gives me something to do, but on the nameds I just patch heal the pet/tank.</div></div><hr />

         Nah it's because of CHARM + CC + slow (in last because it the less usefull). <br />
         But i'm impressed by the reply of Murtak in all these topic, good job and let continu !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm glad people are happy with their role as chanter pet debuffer, pet healer.<br />
I'm glad people don't see a problem with having a few &quot;required&quot; classes, because when you get to the KoD trials you will no doubt be happy to wait around for a Warrior, 2 Clerics or Cleric + Druid, Puller,and Mezzer (required for boss adds) to drag your &quot;non required&quot; ass through.<br />
With Tipt you are walking the line of usefulness, with KoD, you will take another step down.<br />
The exact same problem happened with PoJ trials, but they didn't take up to 5 hours to complete, with up to an hour just to make it to the trial zone in.<br />
<br />
In short, if you are concerned about your role in a group pre KoD, you ain't seen nuthin yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, I do have a problem that all these things NEED warriors and NEED clerics. They don't NEED enchanters though.<br />
You do not need warriors or clerics either, strictly speaking. You could replace a cleric with 2 druids and a paladin and you could replace a warrior with a knight and a druid.<br />
Similarly you could replace the enchanter with 4 rogues.<br />
<br />
You could do either of the mountain trials with just bard / cleric / enchanter / warrior.<br />
And you cannot do it with similar 4 person groups of different classes - you can make up for any of the &quot;needed&quot; classes in different ways but you cannot find different optimal groups.<br />
<br />
In LDoN (hard) you can go warrior / cleric / enchanter / druid / monk / rogue. You can also go with paladin / druid / shaman / bard / ranger / necromancer and the group will not be off worse. Different, better in some areas, worse in others. This is as it should be.<br />
<br />
In GoD anytime you do not have a warrior and cleric (and in some zones enchanter or bard) with you the group is off worse.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the endless debates over the perfect group that used to pop up every so often? That part of the game is gone. Now we are talking about what you can make do with if you do not have the perfect group.<br />
<br />
I have done Trial 5 as a backup healer, of all the trials 1-6, it's only the named in trial 6 which really needs 2 healers.<br />
Or 1 - if you brought a warrior. Or none - if you brought a couple of enchanters.<br />
<br />
We *are* wanted for slows though. That's my point.<br />
And my point is, slow is completely unnecessary in the mountain trials. If you have an enchanter with you you are better off healing, even with a slow stick. If you do not have a slow stick chances are slowing or healing will produce about the same result (unless you have an enchanter - then healing is clearly better).<br />
<br />
An *ideal* group might have an enchanter, because crowd control is so highly thought of,<br />
There is no crowd. Enchanters are DPS - pet, mana, haste. There are things to mez in Ikkinz though - not that this makes enchnaters any less wanted.<br />
<br />
but a shaman is still a good choice, and we bring other things to the table.<br />
Like . . . ?<br />
<br />
In much of GoD, a good FD puller means you don't really need crowd control, and in those rare cases where you get adds, a backup tank or root can do the job.<br />
Any competent puller will get you mostly singles and the rest doubles in all of the mountain trials. Mez is not even an issue here. Backup tanking is not needed. Root is not needed.<br />
<br />
My presence in a group means the rest of the group does more damage - the melees with FA, the casters with malos/malosinia.<br />
Did I get this right? You say we are taken over an enchanter because of damage?<br />
<br />
The clerics heal less because my slow is the best around, and because I help heal the group.<br />
Slow is just silly in the mountains - you would have a point in Ikkinz (on the trash that is) but not in Tipt/Vexd. A druid would heal more then you can slow and heal for (and he can charm). An enchanter can pull singles and at the very least halve the need for healing ebcause he just doubled the groups DPS.<br />
<br />
What I resent slightly is that people see enchanters as slow + CC, but really don't consider shamans as healers. We get groups on the strength of the slow, and not for all the other things we can do, which is why the enchanters are in higher demand.<br />
We are getting groups because of what people think we can do, not because of what we truly can do. Slow is not needed, far from it. In GoD you need tanking, healing and damage. We do none of those.<br />
<br />
So yes, I would like to be able to heal better, I would like to heal well enough that it's a consideration when people are choosing a group, and not just an afterthought. But on the whole, I think we're better off than the likes of paladins and magicians in GoD.<br />
Magicians are great, they can Malosinia enchanter pets and they can stun just about everything in GoD with their pets, roughly slowing for 15% without spending mana or time on it.<br />
Paladins are great as a class, but the ridiculous melee damage put out by the MOBs makes them pretty weak in GoD.<br />
Shaman on the other hand were already weak at the end of PoP - the content just amplifies our issues.<br />
<br />
My guild want me in Tipt groups for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  The chanters like their pets to be malosinia-ed before they charm them - it helps quite a lot.<br />
2)  I make an adequate back-up healer to the cleric/druid main healer (yes, we have won tipt with a Paladin tank and a druid main healer)<br />
Did you have a charm pet?<br />
<br />
3)  I got in there early and know the event well (ie you can be useful for your non-class related skills as well)<br />
And this is relevant to a class balance discussion how? Of course knowledgeable, fast, non-afk, smart players are better players. That does not mean classes are balanced.<br />
<br />
With a charmed pet it is really not necessary to slow most of the mobs.  I slow the trash because it gives me something to do, but on the nameds I just patch heal the pet/tank.<br />
And you do this better then a druid or cleric?<br />
<br />
You said you are useful because you can debuff pets and heal pets. That surely sounds like a great role for shaman for future expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I haven't noticed any real needed group makeups apart from ikkinz.<br />
You do not need a warrior (a good pally, EP equipped works too, hell one in our guild healed for a vxed trial, while tanking). For the final named in Tipt, or some of the vxed named (umbiki, the named Ikaav), you'd be crazy to do it without a cleric, but that doesn;t mean it's not doable.<br />
By no means do you need a charming class, it helps, and it helps alot, but no you do not need it, depending on a non essential class doesn't say much for your adaptability.<br />
 <br />
Yes, a holy trinity is nice, a holy trinity is ALWAYS nice, but if you always depend on it, you're playing yourself out of contention. <br />
<br />
Ikkinz is another matter, we work very well here, but are non essential with the right group make up (as is any class, barring clerics, and in most cases, warriors). Tank,cleric,backup healer,dps,dps,dps is ideal.<br />
Our strength here is our adaptability, a shaman can reach reasonable dps here (not great, but enough to get by) or as a competant backup healer (shaman/cleric works great for ikkinz named).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did I get this right? You say we are taken over an enchanter because of damage?<br />
<br />
No, you didn't get this right. I didn't say we were taken over an enchanter for damage. I didn't even say we were taken over an enchanter at all, because I believe in GoD we're second choice as slower, after enchanters.<br />
<br />
I just said that we were still useful for helping the rest of the group do more damage. I didn't even say we were grouped for this, because I don't believe enough people take it into account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hmmm, you might want to check your facts before you make statements like this.  DoT was replaced by the new heal, BoT was upgraded.<br />
<br />
Ouch, sorry about that.  That was a pretty big goof up and I am not sure what I was thinking when I typed that out.  Remember folks, ALWAYS proofread your posts before you hit the submit reply button.<br />
<br />
Other than that it looks like I was eaten alive on the replies.  Slowing is not neccesary in the trials- so, we as shamans, fall back on healing/debuffing.  I have not progressed to the Kod'taz trials yet, so I can't comment on the content there.  I am happy to see so many replies from others shamans attempting GoD.  I didn't see much of that in the 20 or so healing threads that have been collecting up on the general section.  As for the Holy Trinity, there is not much I can say.<br />
<br />
Clerics have been basically a one-trick pony with a few extra utilities: Spell Haste Buff, Bulwark line, HP buffs, along with a slew of situational utility skills.  We close the gap with them in heals and they are taken out of casual content.  We find ways to replace them in high end content and all of the sudden we have clerics that only log in for raids.<br />
<br />
Warriors were broke for a long time, some say they still are.  Warriors are always good to have on raids for their defensive disc, but they are not totally necessary for every encounter.  I am happy to see these guys getting groups in the new content- I remember checking the lfg window before the melee fixes, and seeing warriors, necros, and monks on almost perma-lfg.  They just weren't getting groups.<br />
<br />
Chanters help expedite GoD content- the addition of the insane pet dps is nice.  While not completely necessary- it does bring a lot to the table for the risk involved.  With the speed and effeciency that people are farming the trials for the loot/augments, I expect either the pet or drops to be nerfed. <br />
<br />
Shaman balancing:<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between your high-end and your average player.  Shamans got a lot of versatility slapped onto them with minimal side-effects.  This meaning that most of our utility is NOT situational. <br />
<br />
Ex: Shamans can heal, slow, ghetto cc, ghetto tank, nuke, dot, and has a pet.<br />
<br />
Some of these skills can be situational due to immunity, resists, or dps of a mob.  For the most part though we don't pay for having &quot;non-situational&quot; versatility other than third, fourth, or fifth on the ability when compared to other classes.<br />
<br />
Other classes have &quot;situational versatility&quot;.  A Beastlord has nice dps if he has his pet, but loses most of his soloing power without it.  An enchanter can pump out insane dps with a charmed pet, but can't heal it.  If there is nothing to charm the they have average to below average dps.  A necro can slow undead, but nothing else.  They have snare, but its dot-based.  They solo by aggro-kiting- we don't have too.  The pally can almost heal as well as we can, but it will burn through their mana pool and they can't canni it back- we can.  I could go on with more examples, but the point is that shamans have some varied blanket abilities.  <br />
<br />
     Giving us a blanket fix, while nice, will hurt other classes.  If shamans are going to have problems in GoD- then you fix the problem in GoD.  I think that is what SoE was trying to do when they finally fixed our heals.  Is it enough? Maybe not.  Pushing our healing cap towards druids only hurts them.  Its as bad as nerfing them- because that is what we would be doing.  In groups, druids have 2 avenues- nuking or healing.  Druids don't get groups because people want evac or port ability- someone wants a healer.  If we heal as well as druids then they get replaced- because there are &quot;plenty&quot; of shamans.  We don't see the drawback on this because healers are always a coveted addition to a group.  Think of it as pallys wanting to tank as well as a warrior.  If a pally can, then why do you need a warrior? <br />
<br />
     More utility isn't the answer either.  We already have enough abilities that I am constantly switching out spell slots.  I don't want the hassle of more spells, the handicaps that will come with it, or the class envy that will shortly follow.  Whenever a class starts complaining and if SOE actually does something about it- a blanket fix is established, and content is ninja-nerfed.  We rarely see a patch with &quot;So-and-so has been hit with the football- have fun sucker!&quot;  What we &quot;don't&quot; see either is the ninja nerfs that are commonly done.  LDoN cash loot is one example.  We weren't told it was nerfed, but after a couple of groups we can see that it was.   Everytime they improve us the hurt another class directly or indirectly.  One area is soloing: the stronger we get the better we can soloing and the more we can solo.  Take Droga for example.  We have an entire zone of mobs that 1. don't summon 2. don't see invis. 3. named spawn often.  Because of our ability to slow we are able to tank these mobs and use the minimal aggro radius to our advantage.  This allows us to hold down multiple camps because we only have to kill the placeholders.  Shamans then have a lockdown on multiple loot tables.  While the prices slowly drop on what we loot and sell- it also raises prices on items we use.  Priest item prices go up hurting anyone but the farmers.  Chain items go up as well.  Six or so months later SOE sees this happening as nerfs one of the big drops that many of us were farming: Copper Hammer of Striking.  Now before Beserkers this 1hb was all/all with a nice proc that went off at lvl 1.  This item sold really well because it was nice even for peeps in their 60's.<br />
Players actually wanting this as an upgrade (not a twink item) had to deal with the outrageous price because they were competing with a large buying market.  SOE tries to fix this by raising the proc level and fixing the rec lvl bug on melee weapons.  Most people would see this as good for those looking for this upgrade, but it isn't.  The price drops by about a third and its enough to stop people from farming it- effectively drying up the availability.  When they fix shamans they have to compare us to all classes- because we effect all of them.<br />
<br />
As far as GoD goes, many people have already proven that any of the Holy Trinity can be replaced.  Many choices lower the efficiency, but it can be done.  I expect that their will be some nerf around the corner.  The chanter pet just has way too much dps and it is very easy to farm the gear and aug drops from the trials.  If it nerfs the pet then the chanter will lose their group spot almost completely.<br />
<br />

I don't care if using a chanter is the easiest quickest way to get through these trials.  I'm not here to sit there and wait for one of our chanters to log on so that we can do it that way.  If people of my guild ask for my help, I'll give it to them, and 99% of the time it isn't to babysit the chanter.  Like I said, I've completed these each at least 10 times and never have used a chanters pet for more than 10 min before.</div></div><hr />

Noone is asking to heal even remotely close to a cleric. We are asking to partially close the gap in one part of healing - spot heals - to druids.<br />

Warriors being balanced or not is a different topic - however lets say warriors where unbalanced before GoD. You say the best solution is to unbalance content to make up for it, making warriors desirable in GoD (but still broken in previous content) and knights useless in GoD and good in the last expansions?<br />
Would it not be preferable to have everyone feel useful in every expansion?<br />
<br />
Chanters help expedite GoD content- the addition of the insane pet dps is nice.<br />
Some people like to call it overpowered when a control and utility class outdamages any 4 DPS classes. How are rogues and wizards supposed to feel next to a charming enchanter?<br />
<br />
While not completely necessary- it does bring a lot to the table for the risk involved.  With the speed and effeciency that people are farming the trials for the loot/augments, I expect either the pet or drops to be nerfed. <br />
Sure, lets nerf the drop rate of items so they are somewhat hard to get for groups with enchanters and insaely hard for everyone else. It would fit the pattern of the expansion so far though.<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between your high-end and your average player.  Shamans got a lot of versatility slapped onto them with minimal side-effects.  This meaning that most of our utility is NOT situational. <br />
Shaman do not have more utility then other classes.<br />
<br />
Ex: Shamans can heal,<br />
as well as a paladin.<br />
<br />
slow,<br />
which is getting mitigated and in many cases not worth the mana.<br />
<br />
ghetto cc,<br />
Everyone with root can do that as well as shaman. Classes with root and either stun or snare are better at it then us. That means we out-CC warriors, rogues, monks, shadowknights, magicians and beastlords.<br />
<br />
ghetto tank,<br />
We outtank magicians and wizards.<br />
<br />
nuke,<br />
the worst of any caster and situationally worse then shadowknights and rangers (or paladins on undead).<br />
<br />
dot,<br />
the last time I got Bane to run for full duration was when the rogue was afk. That does not even factor in us being tied for worst DoTs with enchanters (not counting clerics and hybrids).<br />
<br />
and has a pet.<br />
I hate to talk badly about dogdog but he is not exactly a strength of our class.<br />
<br />
Some of these skills can be situational due to immunity, resists, or dps of a mob.  For the most part though we don't pay for having &quot;non-situational&quot; versatility other than third, fourth, or fifth on the ability when compared to other classes.<br />
That is a HUGE price. Versatility does not do you much good when you cannot do anything well. Consider this: You have a class that can heal 100 DPS. You have a class that can deal 100 DPS. You have a class that can either heal 50 DPS or deal 50 DPS. Which of these classes do you build groups with?<br />
<br />
Other classes have &quot;situational versatility&quot;.  A Beastlord has nice dps if he has his pet, but loses most of his soloing power without it.<br />
So a beastlord is weaker when he does not use his best spell - now there is a surprise. Shaman do not heal very well when not using heals either.<br />
<br />
An enchanter can pump out insane dps with a charmed pet, but can't heal it.<br />
Of course he can either have a cleric heal it for 7500 HPs per cast. Or he can just charm another pet when the old one is low on health.<br />
<br />
If there is nothing to charm the they have average to below average dps.<br />
Yep - about shaman damage.<br />
<br />
A necro can slow undead, but nothing else.  They have snare, but its dot-based.  They solo by aggro-kiting- we don't have too.<br />
Necromancers can tank stuff toe to toe I cannot even dream of. They are better at soloing anything but summoning very high HPs MOBs that do not significantly outdamage our HoT spells. That is a very narrow niche. Everywhere else a necromancer runs circles around us. Not that soloing has anything to do with group desirability . . <br />
<br />
The pally can almost heal as well as we can, but it will burn through their mana pool and they can't canni it back- we can.<br />
You should say shaman outheal paladins situationally.<br />
<br />
I could go on with more examples, but the point is that shamans have some varied blanket abilities.  <br />
And we are worse at them then pretty much everyone else.<br />
- We are the worst nuker.<br />
- We are the worst DoTer.<br />
- We are the worst healer.<br />
- We are the worst buffer.<br />
- We are the worst pet class.<br />
There is two things we are better at then other classes - slow and mana regeneration and both have been marginalized in the last three expansions.<br />
<br />
Giving us a blanket fix, while nice, will hurt other classes.<br />
No - it will make up for us not getting as many upgrades as everyone else for the last 6 expansions.<br />
<br />
If shamans are going to have problems in GoD- then you fix the problem in GoD.<br />
We have problems with<br />
- nerfs by omission (i.e. us not getting as many upgrades as everyone else).<br />
- direct nerfs (i.e. slow mitigation)<br />
- nerfs by content (i.e. fast fights)<br />
Accordingly we are asking for fixes for those.<br />
<br />
I think that is what SoE was trying to do when they finally fixed our heals.  Is it enough? Maybe not.<br />
It is not.<br />
<br />
Pushing our healing cap towards druids only hurts them.  Its as bad as nerfing them- because that is what we would be doing.  In groups, druids have 2 avenues- nuking or healing.  Druids don't get groups because people want evac or port ability- someone wants a healer.  If we heal as well as druids then they get replaced- because there are &quot;plenty&quot; of shamans.  We don't see the drawback on this because healers are always a coveted addition to a group.  Think of it as pallys wanting to tank as well as a warrior.  If a pally can, then why do you need a warrior? <br />
So druids can be healer or nuker (or puller or they can charm but thats beside the point here). Shaman can be slower. Why exactly should we only have one role?<br />
<br />
More utility isn't the answer either.  We already have enough abilities that I am constantly switching out spell slots.  I don't want the hassle of more spells, the handicaps that will come with it, or the class envy that will shortly follow.  Whenever a class starts complaining and if SOE actually does something about it- a blanket fix is established, and content is ninja-nerfed.  We rarely see a patch with &quot;So-and-so has been hit with the football- have fun sucker!&quot;  What we &quot;don't&quot; see either is the ninja nerfs that are commonly done.  LDoN cash loot is one example.  We weren't told it was nerfed, but after a couple of groups we can see that it was.<br />
I will make sure to immediately stop asking for my class to be fixed so SOE does not nerf cash drops.<br />
<br />
Everytime they improve us the hurt another class directly or indirectly.  One area is soloing: the stronger we get the better we can soloing and the more we can solo.<br />
A better heal will surely make unbalanced for soloing, right.<br />
<br />
Take Droga for example.  We have an entire zone of mobs that 1. don't summon 2. don't see invis. 3. named spawn often.  Because of our ability to slow we are able to tank these mobs and use the minimal aggro radius to our advantage.  This allows us to hold down multiple camps because we only have to kill the placeholders.  Shamans then have a lockdown on multiple loot tables.<br />
So we should not ask for upgrades so we cannot farm in Droga of all places?<br />
<br />
While the prices slowly drop on what we loot and sell- it also raises prices on items we use.  Priest item prices go up hurting anyone but the farmers.  Chain items go up as well.  Six or so months later SOE sees this happening as nerfs one of the big drops that many of us were farming: Copper Hammer of Striking.  Now before Beserkers this 1hb was all/all with a nice proc that went off at lvl 1.  This item sold really well because it was nice even for peeps in their 60's.<br />
Players actually wanting this as an upgrade (not a twink item) had to deal with the outrageous price because they were competing with a large buying market.  SOE tries to fix this by raising the proc level and fixing the rec lvl bug on melee weapons.  Most people would see this as good for those looking for this upgrade, but it isn't.  The price drops by about a third and its enough to stop people from farming it- effectively drying up the availability.  When they fix shamans they have to compare us to all classes- because we effect all of them.<br />
So your argument is we should not ask for class balance to be fixed because the increased number of shaman soloing in Droga once they got their upgraded heals in GoD will cause prices to go down and thus soloing to go down, making it impossible to buy twink items? *boggle*<br />
<br />
As far as GoD goes, many people have already proven that any of the Holy Trinity can be replaced.  Many choices lower the efficiency, but it can be done.  I expect that their will be some nerf around the corner.  The chanter pet just has way too much dps and it is very easy to farm the gear and aug drops from the trials.  If it nerfs the pet then the chanter will lose their group spot almost completely.<br />
You missed the point entirely. Noone is worried about lore nodrop items being farmed a little faster. We are upset about a few classes contributing massively more then everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">goddamn murtak you are annoying as hell when you dissect everyone's arguements like that.<br />
I like to do that when replying to many different parts of a post. I usually reply to many different parts of a post when I disagree with a lot of said parts. Do you actually have an issue with what I am posting or are you only bothered by the formating?<br />
<br />
I don't care if using a chanter is the easiest quickest way to get through these trials.  I'm not here to sit there and wait for one of our chanters to log on so that we can do it that way.  If people of my guild ask for my help, I'll give it to them, and 99% of the time it isn't to babysit the chanter.  Like I said, I've completed these each at least 10 times and never have used a chanters pet for more than 10 min before.<br />
I do not even have an issue with an enchanter making something faster. I have an issue with the different classes not even remotely contributing equally.<br />
<br />
Enchanters should not outdamage wizards and rogues and other classes who's main contribution is DPS and especially not fivefold.<br />
Clerics should not heal twice as well as druids and three times as well as shaman.<br />
Warriors should not tank twice as well as knights.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be nice if you could actually do single group content without a cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">And we are worse at them then pretty much everyone else.<br />

<br />
<br />
Not true. We're the second best DoTer, we're the third best healer, etc....<br />
<br />
But, one of the advantages of the shaman class is it can do all of the above. We slow best of all and our mana regen is great (though our spell cost is high so that's not as much of a bonus as it could be).<br />
<br />
Clerics heal best of all, but don't nuke well.<br />
Warriors tank best of all, but don't really do anything much else.<br />
Wizards and rogues are best at what they do too, but have little else.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I think shamans are in a similar situation to that which druids were in in Luclin when the heals were revised (when druids and shamans both got their level 58 %age heals). At that time, neither shamans nor druids could replace a cleric in an exp group, though either could heal somewhat. Druids brought a lot of versatility to a group, but mostly it wasn't sought after. If you wanted nukes, you got a wizard, if you wanted DoTs you got a necro, if you wanted heals, you got a cleric. Having a bit of all of these things is versatile, but it's not really what people look for when forming a group, so druids were left out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Since druids got heal improvements, they get asked for groups as a healer, or as mainly dps and backup healing combined. Snare and evac and their buffs are also nice to have. They are good enough healers and good enough damage that their versatility is a bonus, not a liability any more.<br />
<br />
This is where I'd like to be as a shaman - a slower and backup healer, with enough of each to be asked for groups for that purpose. As it stands, my heals are useful, but not good enough to be a solid backup healer even, and slows are situational.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be essential to a group, I don't think any class should be. But I want to have a firmer role than *just* slower. I want to be considered for groups because of my healing as well as slow, much like enchanters are considered for groups for CC and slow, and beastlords are considered for groups because they have DPS and slow...<br />
<br />
And yes, enchanters are also considered for the insane DPS of a charmed pet. While risky, I do think having enchanters as the highest DPS class is a bit much considering everything else they bring to the table too. (Best haste, best crowd control, mind buffs, etc).</div></div><hr />

veeshanMurtak is owning this thread- kudos for putting into words exactly what my casual friends and I are thinking, particularly the last line.  It's gotten so bad that I've retired Iz and we're all working to PL up my cleric so we can move on to LDoN hards and BoT wing bosses and whatever else.  This isn't just a raid issue- my shaman is nearly worthless in hard LDoNs.  We can't even consider going to GoD either w/ a shaman healer.  He's straight useless in our core group:<br />
<br />
- sk<br />
- shaman<br />
- chanter<br />
- wizard<br />
<br />
Swap out my shaman for a cleric and add 2 dps and that is a solid group for what we do.  Never thought I'd max my shaman as a casual, but here I am.  We were sick to hell and back of having our playtime held hostage to one (ONE [1]) class, so we've given up and are PLing a nerfproof healer, at least until WoW is finally released.<br />
<br />
Keep it up, veeshanMurtak, maybe someone will eventually listen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please explain to me how you propose to make things balanced?  If you want clerics to be replaceable, there are only 2 paths available:<br />
1. make us equal to clerics in healing power.<br />
2. make the content less difficult<br />
<br />
There are obvious flaws with either method.  Clerics can fill 1 role in a group.  We can fill a few, albeit at a lesser level than others.  That is THE definition of utility.  There has to be some sort of sacrifice made for   utility.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could explain what you would do to change it, instead of pointing out how wrong everyone is.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the love of god, people.  Stop basing class balance issues on what goes on in the damn mountain trials.  Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

3. make varied content.<br />
Onesided content with all low HP, high melee DPS, single pullable MOBs naturally favor onesided groups. Put in some nasty procs, AEs, splitting MOBs, swarm type MOBs, hard to pull areas, hig hHP MOBs and the like and then you can turn down MOB DPS without trivializing the content. With the current game design MOB DPS seems to be the only thing varying at all.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god, people.  Stop basing class balance issues on what goes on in the damn mountain trials.  Ridiculous.<br />
They are a nice example of what is wrong with our class and a lot of people have experienced them first hand. We do not fare better in LDoN hards or in Kod'Taz or in GoD sewers. We do better in Ikkinz on the trash and a lot worse on Ikkinz bosses. Mountain trials are not the only zones where we have problems in but they serve well for illustrating our points because pretty much everyone knows them and they are current content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you missed my point on this one.  Droga was just an example because it is a current one.  Your average (Bazaar Geared) 61-65 shaman was able to go to Droga and farm enough gear in &quot;1&quot; day to equate to about 40-70k after selling at &quot;reduced&quot; prices (selling cheaply to bazaar goons for quick sale).  Now, maybe for yourself that is nothing, but to the average player- that's a lot of plat.  While the currency does lose its value at the high-end it is still used to support tradeskills, MQ's for quests, and for random twinking/toys.  For the average geared player that plat means a lot- usually 2-3 65 level spells or an almost complete revamp of gear.  <br />
<br />
How do you think the rogues and rangers were feeling when Ornate Chain, which outside of gloves and Sol Ro is ridiculously rare in the first place?<br />
<br />
How do you think the clerics were feeling when they are shelling out peridots and pp for group buffs and C3?<br />
<br />
We have shown time and time again that, with a new expansion, we will find something big and nasty to solo that has a nice loot table that we will pawn off for whatever.  Velious had Lodizal and Yeldema- their loot tables at the time were almost uber and very droppable.  When other classes see this they have a hard time understanding how neglected we feel. <br />
<br />
<br />
You missed the point entirely. Noone is worried about lore nodrop items being farmed a little faster. We are upset about a few classes contributing massively more then everyone else.<br />
<br />
I think you missed mine.  Everyone has the same problem when a new high-end expansion comes out- the content requires the Holy Trinity. Before Pop, groups could get by without a slower.  Enter Pop and people wouldn't walk into the zone without one. Eventually, everything calms down a little bit- people get better gear, better aa's, better spells.  We pay a lot for versatility- the reason for that is that our versatility can apply to almost anything.  When compared our abilities to other classes- I think you named every single one.  Name another class that can be compared like that (remember, Bards can't direct heal.)  Outside of GoD, we are a good start and a good finish to a group.  GoD right now is a guild and friend-only zone for the most part.  The guild is going to pick the most efficient way to move people through the trials. A group of friends are going to go with who they trust.<br />
<br />
Certain classes have always been better at trials.  Are there ways around it? yes.  It is up to everyone to choose to go with what they got or wait for the perfect group.  Whether developers decide to make any changes is unknown.  But, who do you think is more pissed off- those of us who have been delegated to a back-up healer position or the dps class that was dropped to make room for it?<br />

Why should anyone capable of getting our new spells - which many advocate should be put into Kod'Taz - go back and farm places like Droga? And why should we care if someone might be able to farm a few items a little faster? As you already said yourself, every expansion new things are soloed and farmed. And shaman are far from the cutting edge in that department nowadays.<br />
<br />
I think you missed mine.  Everyone has the same problem when a new high-end expansion comes out- the content requires the Holy Trinity. <br />
I was not looking at stuff like that in Kunark but I heard alot about the holy trinity being needed. I cannot tell for myself really, it took me a while to reach Sebilis and the like but I did not feel clerics or enchanters or warriors were needed. Hybrids were underpowered though.<br />
I did not see any of it Velious or Luclin. I saw people screaming for slow+healing+tanking in PoP (note: not for classes, just for the ability as such). I saw the first bit of people wanting specific classes in LDoN hards.<br />
GoD is out and I see a cleric in every group and they do usually do not mind taking two clerics or a cleric and a druid and a shaman and a paladin.<br />
I see a near complete group waiting and passing up knights in hope a warrior will log on.<br />
This is not remotely like the previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Before Pop, groups could get by without a slower.  Enter Pop and people wouldn't walk into the zone without one.<br />
What I saw was people wanting a slower or a another healer and preferably a well equipped tank. And of course someone to mez. And good damage. But I did not see people not taking knights as tanks or druids as healers (or for that matter, beastlords as slowers).<br />
<br />
Eventually, everything calms down a little bit- people get better gear, better aa's, better spells.  We pay a lot for versatility- the reason for that is that our versatility can apply to almost anything.  When compared our abilities to other classes- I think you named every single one.

That is a moot point. Every class has a unique combination of abilities. No class can exactly replicate everything another class can do.<br />

You getting a group because you are known to your friends does not make the content or the classes balanced though.<br />
<br />

DPS classes having a hard time does not mean shaman do not need fixes. And by the way, that backup healer description is getting less and less accurate. I have trouble keeping people alive against slowed MOBs, there is no chance I can keep anyone alive against an unslowed MOB for even a short period of time, which is what I thought backup healers did.</div></div><hr />
