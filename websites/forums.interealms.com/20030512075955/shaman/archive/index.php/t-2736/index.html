<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siwi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which is the best class to plvl a shammy with at lvl 60?<br />
<br />
I can get a 60 enc with DC, 60 cleric, 60 war or 60 rogue on the 2nd comp to help my shaman kill stuff.<br />
What do you think would be the best class and zone for best xp?<br />
<br />
I used the cleric mostly, shaman just canni IV + V and pox / bane / epic in fungus grove, and i tried CT and ditched bane for chain jbbing. It was fine xp, but im wondering if i can do better xp with another method.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I would take the 60 warrior. I may be biased as I have a 60 warrior and 59 shaman. I have grouped with 60 shamans in FG and the killing time was incredible. A monk or rouge are great damage dealers but with a good warrior and slowed mobs you never have to worry about tanking or healing (particularly if the warrior has a fungi they can swap into every now and again). I have killed in FG using my warrior and a 60 shaman for long periods of time and never had to be healed once. The shaman pulls to the warrior and lets him go to work and when the mob is around half dead the shaman can pull and park the next mob so there is never any down time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to plvl myself tho, not group with the warrior. Outdamaging him could be a problem, and he in no way increases my damage output (cleric can CH me when i canni and drop in a 900ish nuke).</div></div><hr />
