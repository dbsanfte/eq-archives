<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is pretty snazzy.  Within about 10 minutes of being logged in (maybe 20) my video is reduced to about 1 frame per second.  It feels like a memory leak of some kind.  Buddy of mine with the same make &amp; model computer is having the identical problem.<br />
<br />
Just wondered if anyone else is having this and if they've found anything to help.  Intel 82810 chipset, onboard video, shabby crap they put onboard this dell ... I'm praying the lease runs out soon.  Already installed the 8/22/02 driver.  Clip plane is in teh face, everything's filtered off.<br />
<br />
The thing that makes it obvious it's video is that it slows down over time.  Starts to look like a slower and slower slideshow as the minutes tick by.<br />
<br />
Thought maybe someone will have a brilliant fix.  It's probably code in the new patch, but hey, can't hurt to post.</div></div><hr />
