<br />
With that being said, I want to get some input on levels and AAs.  I'm 56 with decent gear and my epic.  I currently have 6 AA points (Regen 3, Run Speed 2 and Metabolism 1).  I have long term aspirations of reaching 60 and beyond, but it's not something that consumes my playing.<br />
<br />
I am also an Iksar, so 20% of my incoming EXP is lost.  The normal exp bar moves so freaking slow it is infuriating, and watching the AA exp bar move is much more enjoyable.  So I find myself putting 80-100% of my exp into AA.<br />
<br />
Question I have is which AA should I be heading for in the 2nd grouping (class?).  I know I need Mental Clarity maxxed to get Cannibalization and I need 12 points in Class (nothing specific) to get MGB.  So I thought I would start with Mental Clarity and go from there.  But that AA skill sucks.  :)  I was leaning towards Spell Casting Mastery for the chance at reduced fizzles and mana usage, or Spell Casting Reinforcement to lengthen my buffs.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts on the other skills such as Natural Durability or Combat skills?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suppose I should just go with MC3 for now since it satisfies both the requirements for Canni5 and part of the requirements for MGB (or other 3rd level skills).  Although it seems a waste to get MC3 if obtaining lvl 60 is in question....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Everyone's advice should be mc3 and canni5 first, then go back for SCR or SCRM or MGB or whatever else you want. canni5 is simply amazing<br />
<br />
Yeah hehe, well everyone except me :D I have qb 3 but yet I still need mc3 then canni haha. I kinda farted about tho, spent my first 10 points in general, told myself back then didn't really care about the title, wanted a couple more stats :D  But even when I started arch I kinda dilly dallyed some more cause that crit on jbb was nice before they nerfed it... :mad: <br />
<br />
And once I got finally got mc2, had no patience and I had also heard at the same time qb reduced cast time on torpor so I was like omg NO WAY, and from there got really determined to shorten its duration by half which I did :p <br />
<br />
Now I don't really play no more so I've never had the opportunity to savour cann5, such is my sad sad life :( <br />
<br />
Hehe, kinda reminds me of that IKEA commercial and let's pretend I'm that lamp... *in a strong German accent* You feel sorry for this lamp? That's because you're crazy! :D <br />
<br />
Anyways, long story short, had I acted more sensibly in AA selection, woulda done 6 points in general then straight for arche. MC 1 2 3 takes a total of 12 points, which is how many additional points you need to start training in class (you'll need level 59 for that too).<br />
<br />
Then at class of course canni, but then I'd suggest qb all the way if you have torpor by then.<br />
<br />
Natural Durability is of course nice too, free hp always welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am not sure how you discriminate between &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;leisurely&quot; play, but I would recomend that you do whatever you can do to maximize fun.<br />
<br />
I have 56 aaxp with 24 in the bank right now and am thinking about leveling up to 59 to spend them.<br />
<br />
The lvl 55 priest skill set is very nice and this is the order I plan on doing them.<br />
<br />
MC         Done<br />
SCR       Done    I don't like buffing much.<br />
SCM<br />
ND<br />
CA<br />
CS<br />
CF         1 level...  a bug moved 2 poits from MC to CF Grrrr.<br />
<br />
After that I don't know.<br />
<br />
Right now I am just lvl 53 but am giving consideration to leveling up to 61 for the new pet spell.  Both my tailoring 158 and smithing 173 are getting to be heavy farming and the pet will help a bunch.<br />
<br />
A long time ago...  I sold my exp bar from 60 down to 51 to equip a twink but now I have started my shaman up again and I have not had a great desire to level back up.  If you have the big spells in the bank  ( i got em in da book ) then you might think about it.  Torpor and Malo are both nice.  If not I would just do whatever you think is fun and not be overly concearned about the most efficient path to 65.<br />
<br />
I found that the much more limited solo hunting options at 60 had a big impact on my enjoyment of Torpor / Malo and the shaman class in general.  If it where not for trade skill farming I think that I would just stay at 55 untill all the skills I wanted where filled.<br />

        Just curious what kinda plat that makes? ive seen the once in awhile mass coprse from sacrifices (assuming whatcha mean). I have a lvl 60 could be 61 warrior i have debated doing this with since my pally on that account is now higher lvl than warrior.           <br />
<br />
     Made the warrior cuz my guilds warriors were all gone and got him to lvl 60 than left the guild cuz it fizzled away. If i ever go to a bigger raiding guild no intention as going as a warrior and exp'ing have to much fun with the pally/shaman combo so like ive said debated doing this for plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shilzah, depends on your server, check bazaar for 'essence emerald' and see what the going rate is.  I took a character that was 51+4orange down to 45 and got 64 emeralds out of him (xp loss was drastically higher once he got below 50)<br />
<br />
Right now on terris 250-300p an emerald seems normal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd really say just slowly make your way to 60. Sure the XP bar moves slowly but, getting to 60 opens up a whole can of funorama! No matter if you can't get torpor or malo, just go for it :)<br />
<br />
Once you hit 60, then I'd aim for MC3=&gt;Canni V. Canni V is so much fun! I can now burn mana on nukes/dots/rains in xp groups ,even when I'm main healer and slower. There's nothing so frustrating as having to sit and wait to get mana back, and with Canni V that rarely happens. <br />
<br />
But, if you don't want to wait for 60, then I wouldn't worry with MC3 - 12 AA points is enough XP to get you near 60 anyway, and MC3 in itself is not very good. Either go for 60 now, or go SCR then SCM. Then maybe SCF for fun :)<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course :) Personally I went for 60 first. Got torpor after a month or two, for 32k :) Still waiting on malo, but no worries. After 60 I did Regen 3, RS3, MC3, Canni V, and waited to get the 61 pet. <br />
<br />
Now I have the pet, am 17% into 61 and going 100% aa for spirit call. Once I get flagged from the trials I'll ding 62 - I won't go for 63 until the 63-64 spells start coming in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the response drinnar. <br />
<br />
  Apologize for the mini highjack. One of those topics i kept meaning to look into and would forgot about and saw it mentioned here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got 55kp for my experiance bar.<br />
<br />
It does not seam like a huge sum now but back then it seamed like a lot.<br />
<br />
Strangly,  I am having a great time at 53 and don't miss 60 very much at all, but I am going to level up again as soon as I bank 30 aaxp....  got 2 more last night for 26.  It is all about farming drops for tailoring and smithing now and I have hopes that the new 61 pet will remove a lot of the greif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The trip from 55 to 60 is not that long in PoP.  At 56 it is easy to get groups in PoN and PoD.  56 - 60 is easily doable in 1 week at a few hours a day.  I would suggest going 100% aa or 0% aa.  My understanding is that if you go 80% 20% you will take a double dose of racial penalty.<br />
<br />
MC1 and 2 are worth the investment.  IMHO MC3 is vastly overpriced but if you are planing on going cani 5 (and you really should be) you are going to have to bite the bullet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As much as I hate it, I probably should concentrate on getting to 60.  I enjoy taking my time and seeing things while they are worthwhile (i.e., get items on par with level and getting exp).  And it is so much more enjoyable when you can actually see progress.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input everyone.  I think I am going to get 1 level in MC (1 1/2 AA to go) and then concentrate on leveling.</div></div><hr />
