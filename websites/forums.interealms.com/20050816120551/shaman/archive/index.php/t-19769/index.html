2.  2 - 3.  Ideally depending on the content, i would like to keep 3 - 4 at all raids.  Not enough for more than four people, but too hectic at times for less than 3<br />
3.  no bots.  We do too much to be using shaman bots.<br />
4.  We raid everything and anything.  Mostly doing GoD stuff now that time is about farmed out.</div></div><hr />

Hittin time, taking a crack or 2 at quarm.  Test hasn't been stable because of the expansion so it's been ruff to get a good turn out....then figure in some testing time, it's been a crappy month or better.  My boys are the best, bar none (not that I'm bias or nuttin  :D ).  They are growly and don't like anyone being added from outside our &quot;circle&quot;.  We keep our numbers low to ensure fun, in exchange we promise to mass focus occationally and not tear too many heads off in /ooc =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We have 8 shamans tagged in the guild, only 5 of them are active.  The rest I havent seen since I joined.  One of them is a bot that helps clear p1-3 of time, but then logs out as more people log in and we have enough mains to hit the 72 person cap.<br />
<br />
The person who plays the bot, as well as all 4 of the main shamans, have a 90%+ raid activity so we are generally all there, although the bot usually doesn't get played.<br />
<br />
In Time, we are all needed.  All the shaman mains are excellent players and excellently geared, and we can do a lot towards keeping a group alive.  On quarm, a group with a competent shaman usually has no fatalities, whereas groups without shamans have a lot of deaths.  For LDoN raids, we usually take the first 2-3 shamans to show up.  More is always good, but they 36 person limit is really harsh for a guild with over 100 people.  We'll have to wait to see how necessary we are in Gates.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild has been farming time for months and does the occasional LDoN raid.</div></div><hr />

A LOT!  Namely the 3 65's though, of which 2 only show up when there's loot to be had (I know, I know... the hardships of no DKP)<br />

 - We raid every night (unless no targets up).  Our first Quarm kill was 8 days ago, and 2nd was tonight, so we're still farming Time much as possible.  We skipped VT for the most part, so have spent more time than normal gearing up both old and new members.  Total active roster over 100.  Wait list for time often at 25+.  (Recent joke is that we raid Time, Emp, Seru and 2 LDoN raids all simultaneously!)  We have too many of all classes, not just shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guild has about 150 people in it, at a guess, of which probably 70-80ish turn out on any given night, so we usually have full raids by 7:30 EST. Members range from Madagascar and Switzerland on the east end to West coast US on the west end, plus some US service personnel who are stationed in places like Korea and Afganistan but still play when they can from there. We are clearing Tier 4 in Time atm (just got my Time's Antithesis last night!). I am class leader for shaman (blech!). We raid pretty much 7 nights a week.<br />

Everyone who shows up is needed, my guild makes that a point. I have attended all but two raids since I've been guilded, and I am main slow 99% of the time. I keep one shaman on backup slows, and the rest on SH in their groups and damage. Shaman groups rarely have deaths.<br />
<br />

Four or five usually. We've had as many as seven, but that is (of course) dependent upon where we are raiding and whether or not I tell them to BE ONLINE THAT DAY, period, lol. <br />

The number or Shaman needed on a Raid.  Actually, that depends on the other slowing classes.  If you have 3-4 Bards, Enchaters and BL then you only need a BoT Shaman to FO7 maybe STA and maybe toss a Malos or Malosinia on incoming.<br />

6 'active' shamans, a couple of 'retired' ones and a handful of secondary alts. Only active shamans participate in raids, though.<br />
<br />
&gt; How many shamans are needed per average raid? (please don't muddy question with specifics)<br />
Needed is subjective. Hell... an 'average' raid is also a subjective concept. Let's say we're comfortable with 3 or 4 for most content.<br />
<br />
&gt; How many shamans in your guild normally show up to the raids?<br />
Again, on average, 4. As little as 2 or 3 and as much as 6. Sometime people bring their pet shamans for flagging but they do not actively contribute.<br />
<br />
&gt; How many of the shamans in your guild are bots?<br />
No raid shaman is a 'bot. Some 'bots may be brought along, but strictly to give them access to exp areas.<br />

Null, on Xev, is newest elemental guild on the server. We've demolished pretty much every elemental mini we had the occasion to go against, so far, except for the Arbitrer of Earth to which we gave a first go last night (the rings were nicely challenging, as a first go went, and we learned a lot getting the AoE down to 15%). We're still very much in the 'less get some equipment for the next round' phase.</div></div><hr />

I looked at the roster last week and counted so I'm glad you asked this.  Out of 15 level 65 shaman on the roster only 2 were not bots (alts).<br />

My guild is just about flagged for elementals.  We do frequent raids on Luclin content (burrower, THO, occasionally we kill Seru),  we raid PoP bosses a lot (Xanamech for melee, Mujaki etc for casters).   Currently trying to beat RZ.</div></div><hr />

Well, Jenguran doesn't care the answer to this one but everyone else might.  I happen to be the Shaman officer in his guild on RN.<br />
<br />
1. On our roster atm we have 11 shamans that I would count.<br />
2. Shamans needed, I would say me and jeng can handle pretty much anything we've encountered to date so 2.<br />
3. We normally have 2 on any given raid with a few that have 5, and more then a few that it's just one of us.<br />
4. 2 shaman bots, 1 innactive.<br />
5. We are currently working tier 2 and 3 encounters in PoP as our primary focus.</div></div><hr />
