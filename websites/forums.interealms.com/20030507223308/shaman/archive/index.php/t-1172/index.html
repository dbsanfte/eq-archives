thinking about restarting as a troll on a 2nd account as i think $50 is a bit harsh to transfer. mainly, i'm looking to use the shammy to duo with my rogue, and snare would be awesome. so in question comes the troll necklace.<br />
<br />
how long cast time is it?<br />
<br />
it's a 30% snare, good enough in your opinion to be a snare? or do mobs run too fast?<br />
<br />
how are resists? say, a lvl 55 shammy on general sebilis mobs for example (ie not MR at all).<br />
<br />
thanks a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's a 6 second cast, duration is 30 seconds. It's good enough to snare if you don't have anyone else around to do it, but it does allow mobs to move when they enter the fastest &quot;run mode&quot;. I also used it early on mobs just to strip sow, even if it would wear off before they were anywhere near death. Resists were never too bad with it, but give yourself time for an extra cast just in case it's needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got a DE cleric with this toy.:D <br />
<br />
Cast time 6.0, overwrites sow (Nice for shaman caster mobs), like 25damage DoT, and a small snare.<br />
<br />
Note that when a mob runs it wil still move slowly, but smack it a few times and it will stop, when a normal running mob would just slow down.  This is uber for my cleric, since I duo with melees a lot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I lub mah inny necklace. I've had mine since around lvl 26 or so and use it all the time when soloing and quite often when grouped with no snaring classes. It stops runners dead in their tracks.</div></div><hr />
