<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ode to the NBG (true life story, of course) and feel free to random the classes, I'm not picking on warriors and clerics.<br />
<br />
Ok, group gets started in BOT tables.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hi all<br />
Druid – hi, Chanter – hi, Cleric – hi, Warrior – hi, Monk – hi<br />
<br />
Druid – So how we going to do loot? Random stuff? Upgrades ok?<br />
Shaman – That’s fine with me<br />
Warrior – I want ornate bracer mold<br />
Cleric – I want ornate bracer mold<br />
Druid – hmm, what drops here?<br />
Shaman – This is good camp, 3 mini named, ring, drums, staff etc all worth about 2-7K and ornate bracer mold which is dropping well is worth about 40-50k.<br />
<br />
Druid – Wow!<br />
Warrior – I want ornate bracer mold, it’s for plate classes doesn’t matter what it costs in bazaar<br />
Cleric – I want ornate bracer mold, it’s for plate classes<br />
Shaman (to himself) – I want ornate chain bracer pattern<br />
Druid (to himself) – I want ornate leather bracer pattern<br />
Monk (to himself) – I want ornate leather bracer pattern<br />
Chanter (to himself) – I want ornate silk bracer pattern<br />
<br />
Shaman – Ok, are we going to random stuff or default the ornate bracer molds to the plate classes and roll on everything else? Everyone wins before starting again.<br />
Druid – grumble<br />
Monk – grumble<br />
Chanter – grumble<br />
<br />
Druid – Pickup groups should just random, that’s the fair way to do things, everyone contributes, everyone has shot at good loot.  It would be different if this stuff was no-drop, but heck you can buy this stuff in the bazaar every day and everyone needs their ornate bracer.<br />
<br />
Shaman (trying to find compromise) – Well (druid) how about if we default the ornate bracer mold to the plate classes as long as they don’t roll on the other junk? But, everyone wins something before we start again.<br />
Druid – grumble, ok<br />
Monk – grumble, ok<br />
Chanter – grumble, ok<br />
Warrior – No way, its not fair, NBG man, NBG man, I will roll on everything and trade up if bracer falls.<br />
Cleric – ditto<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hmmm,  (points to warrior) a greatstaff of thunder also drops here every once in a while warrior only, what would you do with that?<br />
Warrior – NBG man, Christ what the heck is wrong with you, that’s a warrior weapon, you would just sell it.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hmmm, well friend if you were defaulted the greatstaff would you then also expect a default on ornate bracer mold?<br />
<br />
Warrior – Of course.<br />
<br />
Warrior – (looking at Shaman) If ornate chain dropped here you would want default?<br />
<br />
Shaman – If ornate chain dropped here, and if I needed I would ask the group if I could get default and not roll on ANYTHING else.  If the group was ok with that I would thank my lucky stars that I have a generous group.<br />
<br />
Warrior – That’s BS<br />
Cleric – That’s BS<br />
<br />
Shaman – How so?<br />
<br />
Warrior – NBG man, that’s how it’s done. Frickin frackin what the heck is wrong with you, you are GREEDY!<br />
<br />
Shaman – Is that so?…..well I beg to differ…Now like the druid said, if you couldn’t just buy these things everyday in the bazaar it would be completely different.  Do you think it is fair to have loot priority over everyone in your group?  You know we all need things.<br />
<br />
Warrior – I don’t believe this.  What the heck type of greedy peeps are you? NBG man, NBG man.  Warrior exits group.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Well, lets get another tank.  Cleric you ok with getting default on bracer as long as you don’t roll on the junk?<br />
<br />
Shaman – (silence)  ??????  well?<br />
<br />
Cleric – Lets get a tank and see if he needs the bracer.  If he doesn’t, then I’m fine with default, but I still want to roll on everything.<br />
<br />
Shaman – Hello? Earth to cleric??<br />
<br />
Cleric – I’m out of here, you guys are greedy.<br />
<br />
Other 4 peeps look at each other in mystified silence.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always set up pickup groups as /random all (everyone) and make sure everyone understands, and specifically /tell folks we're inviting in later BEFORE they arrive to replace someone (I tend to start a lot of groups). Even then, folks STILL freak out when the warriors random on spec parchments.<br />
<br />
erm, what part of /random all did you not understand?<br />
<br />
Equal Risk, Equal Time, Equal Chance at a reward. WTH is so hard to comprehend? NGB is for your friends and guildmates.<br />
<br />
I've even gone out of my way to explain to someone who was freaking...<br />
/Random All is the only fair way in pickups. I *Say* I still need my spells. You don't know me. You have NO IDEA if I'm lying or not. How is that fair to the melees?<br />
They still didn't want to allow them to roll. /boggle at greed<br />

just had to toss that in...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That Warrior and Cleric were greedy sobs... it should have been random on all non no drop and they wanted NBG and to roll on everything else... wow some people.  Doesn't surprise me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">NBG doesnt work with droppables.  It becomes hidden greed is all.<br />
<br />
It gets sold in the bazaar, and the person comes back the next day to tell you they NEED another.  You cant believe they wont sell it.. if that were true, then there wouldnt be any for sale in the bazaar right now.<br />
<br />
Its a jaded view, but I have even seen guildmates selling ornate they were awarded on anon traders they think no one will recognize... the lure of large amounts of plat is hard to resist.<br />
<br />
They should have made that stuff no drop, at least then you earn your own.... I know making it dropable made it easier for those who cant hunt there to get it, but I hate the strife it creates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What i sugest usually is nbg execpt on paterns as they value is that much higher now if the mobs had  the chance to drop the 4 different types of patterns for a slot (plate chain leather silk) then straight NBG be fine. But lately im moving more toward the pure roll mentality ive seen peeps claim NBG then i see them auction the item off ... once even before looting was done.<br />
<br />
NOTE i have NEVER rolled on anything but a chain pattern, even when the oppurtunity has presented itself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">imho, NBG is much greedier than just a completely random FFA.  All pickup groups should, imho, just be FFA.  If something drops that someone needs, and the lose on it... hey, tough luck.  Chances are good, though, that you'll get another piece of loot later that you can trade for it, or even another chance at the same drop.  If you're after a specific item that drops at a specific camp (plate bracer for example), chances are pretty good that after a few long sessions at that camp, you'll have it.<br />
<br />
I am a nice guy, though.  Whenever something drops in an FFA group, and someone needs it, I roll on it.  If I win, I usually hand it over to the person that needs it (unless I am in dire need of money, or just don't like the guy).  In most cases, they will give you something in return if they have anything.  This served me well in SRT.  I gave someone a plate bracer they needed, and later they gave me chain arms, which I needed<br />
<br />
If it is a group of guildies/friends, then it is almost always NBG.  If it is like half guildies, half pickup (which most of my groups are), then we FFA.  If one guildie wins something in the group that another guildie needs, he almost always gives it to him.  I won plate legs once in a group with a guildie cleric and 4 random people, then handed them over to him after I looted.<br />
<br />
FFA is a good system, but I do believe in karma.  If you do nice things for other people, nice things will happen to you.  Remember, it is just fantasy money.  You can sacrifice something that isn't even real (plat) and really make someone's day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NBG is the devil in pickup groups for droppable loot. Nearly everyone can use platinum for something. I always insist that melees be given a chance to roll on specs/runes if they are so inclined. Some roll, some don't. Either way, I don't view it as my job to equip the server by defaulting droppable loot to certain classes.<br />
<br />
Among friends and guildmates, NBG is fine - and if no one needs it, put the item on someone's Bazaar mule and split the proceeds. Everyone wins that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stripperfella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If in guild group then NBG rules.<br />
In pick up groups its gonna be tough to satisfy everyone.<br />
<br />
My first main was a warrior, and all the good drops always seemed to be caster and I never got anything good drop for me. What I did was change the location where I went LFG, I went to Velks in the Top Spider camp and in a month won  a SCHW at least once every 4th day. Plus I could carry a ton of velium that sold extremly well. There , everyone always /random all unless ya had 1 on ya.<br />
<br />
When I got to UP, all of a sudden a 15k bracer drops and they give it to 1 person saying NBG. Which really shocked me, I thought everyone had a chance to roll. <br />
Then moktor legs drop and the gave it to the cleric and I had acryla legs and moktor would be a huge upgrade. It turned out they were all friends and looking out for one another.<br />
After getting jipped a few times   I put my warrior to sleep as bazaar mule and created alts I can solo with.<br />
We should start a new thread of Horror stories where we get robbed in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">after loosing a roll to a wizard in seb for the haste belt as a warrior (and she was a guildie to boot). all loot that's droppable is /random. unless specified otherwise. and my warrior was one of the first to start rolling on ethreal parch's for the same reason. <br />
<br />
she said she rolled so she could sell it to get money for her spells, i roll on spells to get money for my weapons. it all works out, even if i do ruffle some feathers. (of course war is retired and now i have a SH and a SK to feed and he needs weapons and spells..hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've always prefered nbg.  For every idiot who scams the group and makes of with something, theres a genuinely nice person who gets a genuinely nice upgrade, to me thats a worthwhile trade off, especially when you consider BB is a fairly tight knit community, news gets around fast.<br />
<br />
Although yes, I expect that if someone calls nbg on something, they will have the decency to pass on the gravy.<br />
<br />
And before anyone comes out with it, no I have nothing to gain from nbg at all, I have all my spells and ornate or better, hell my twink has ornate or better and all spells too.</div></div><hr />

In guild groups we the same except if all those needing have 1 need, they can then claim another need until all have 2 needs, like a ranger and a shaman rolling on chain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Need before greed here. I rarely group with unknowns anyway - or at the most one person in the group is new to me.<br />
<br />
If a tradeable item drops that is usable by a specific class, they get it.<br />
<br />
I find that by letting that happen, people who have better will tell the group and we all roll for the bazaar. On the odd occasion I have grouped with someone who opens their mouth and insists that they get a roll on all items, I just don't group with them again.<br />
<br />
Example: The haste belt in Veksar (Can't remember what it's called). A guildmate and his friend had been camping it for a couple of days with no luck. I show up and luckily enough we get the drop. They tell me to roll and I pass as honestly, they need it and I only just got there.<br />
<br />
3 days later the new friend hails me and hands me a copy of Primal Essence he'd been keeping on one of his alts. He's now a member of our guild and yet another good, honest friend to group with.<br />
<br />
Karma man. Be kind. Put it out there, and you'll rarely have to group with bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also believe in FFA on everything dropable in exp, its just the only way for it to be fair. Esspecially when your at a spot where only melee things drop or where only caster things drop. But by FFA do you guys mean roll on everything all the time no matter what you won before? Because today i had a group and the cleric (from the highest guild on the server) Said FFA on all loots dont like it then speak up now. So a spectral droped.....He won it. Couple more mobs go down and yet another spectral drops.....He won this one to. I said 2 in a row? dont you think you should let other people that could use them have it? he replyed with FFA on all loots dont like it then speak up now. I think that this wasnt fair seeing that i and probally many others in the group acually NEED 63/64 spells when he would just hand it in to any class to SELL it because his great guild just gives him all the specs he needs. I always thought that when you say roll on everything, it implyed that you dont win 2 very nice items 2 times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">grrr double post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When I got my ornate sleeve pattern, I was in a group in BoT and I was the only chain class in the group and had been in the group for several hours that day (was a pickup group - not friends or guild). It took about 15 minutes for them to finally decide to give me the pattern (which was an upgrade over my wolf caller's sleeves), while I sat quietly waiting to see if greed would win out. It was very quiet in the group and I assume people were trying to decide if they were going to FFA the pattern, but didnt want to say it in group. Eventually after the MT (who was holding the pattern) said to give it to me a few times, the rest agreed. <br />
<br />
Now, had they let their greed win over and randomed that pattern. /disband greedy *******s - and the MT probably would have done the same.</div></div><hr />

How about this:<br />
<br />
If something drops that someone can use, they *buy* it from the group for an agreed upon rate. They get the item, everyone else gets a fair split of the cash, everyones happy.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about other servers but on tunare the top guilds have pretty much everything the need and are very nice all the casters i have grouped with said they had all their spells and passed on all specs/runes if you are truly doing FFA then he wasn't in the wrong but i think u got jiped he had his spells and he was just selling those for money getting 2 in a row would have ticked me off usually in a group we do NBG and this works out unless u have greedy lying bastards i dont take anything unless i really need it i dont have a bazaar mule or the kind of time to mess with it but the thing that really gets me is F*cking clerics in bot ALOT of diamonds drop in bot and for some reason they all go to the cleric to cover his dot cost which is complete crap 1 diamond should cover dot cost for any xp session but i have seen clerics taking several thousand plat worth of diamonds and running off even if i say were rolling on diamonds ahead of time the cleric takes them all and splits even if i ask several times to random<br />
<br />
ANYWAY on to my story...<br />
<br />
I was in a pickup group in bot, we were fighting the south top where the sand named guy pops and he happened to pop while we were there so we kill him and he drops a RUNE of all things one of the crappiest named in bot drops a rune so we random on it and the leader said for the casters to random well i end up winning it but the rog who just joined us randomed and got a higher number then me and when everyone said for me to loot she was like w t f? we told her only the casters were rolling and she said i rolled for my alt who is an enc we then told her u dont roll for alts and she was like F*ck this /disband i got Fo7 off that rune :D the last spell i needed cept for FA which i still dont have doh</div></div><hr />

Thats one of the stupidest things i have ever heard if they had the money to buy the item then they would go buy it from the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here's my problem with NBG is any situation:<br />
<br />
As an example, if we both start out as level 65 Shaman with identical equipment, for the sake of this let's say we both have really sucky bracrers (like plain old banded) at level 65. <br />
<br />
I do alot of trading in the bazaar during my play time, trying to make some platinum to buy myself some upgrades and work my butt off to get enough money to finally buy myself 1 ornate chain bracer. <br />
<br />
You on the other hand don't. You go out and get some AA's, so you've got more than I do, but you are still wearing 2 banded bracers while I now have 1 ornate chain (that I bought) and 1 banded.<br />
<br />
We go on a raid and a chain bracer pattern drops. You automatically get it because you need it more than I do?<br />
<br />
That hardly seems fair to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We go on a raid and a chain bracer pattern drops. You automatically get it because you need it more than I do?<br />
<br />
thats not how NBG works (at least not the way i do it) plus you are talking about a raid which is way different then a pickup grp most guild raids are on DPS-dragon point system or some kind of point system but usually if the item has 2 people that it would be an upgrade for then the 2 of them would random not just be defaulted to the one who needs it more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">BoT minis and patterns, always good for a nice little dispute.<br />
<br />
What i try lately is to state loot rules BEFORE approaching a mini and i have no problems with FFA at all.<br />
<br />
Yesterday lost a chain gloves pattern with a very nice (and NOT greedy) group to the SK, so what? The SK did a great job with pulling and contributed to the group as much as everyone else (Ok, ok i was a bit miffed at first  ;)).<br />
<br />
Problem with NBG especially in BoT seems to be, that some minis regularly drop only junk like plate patterns  :D , so other classes have zero chance of a nice drop. To call people using FFA greedy is just plain silly IMO, it is only a different way of handling loot. Don't like it - don't use it - no need to insult those people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">NBG is only useful in a guild group, imho.  Pick-up groups are pure FFA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Want to come back to the post of Shavedman about a person winning multiple items in a FFA group. This is something that really ticks me off - I had a case where 3 times in a row the item was randomed to the same person. That's bound to cause some bad blood in the group...<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be better in a FFA group that the person who wins something passes for the next randoms until everyone has one item ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you're in a pickup group, All roll is only way to go IMO.  If you're dealing with droppable loot, ML it and everyone rolls at the end.  Highest roll picks first and on down the line.  If there are more drops than group members, I personally prefer that the second round of choices start at the bottom and go up.  That way the person with the highest roll gets their pick of the BEST item dropped and the person with the crappiest roll gets compensated by getting 2 items which are almost certainly going to be the two least valuable items.<br />
<br />
As far as eth/spec/runes go.  Ethereals and Spectrals are so common now that pretty much every group I've been in hasn't worried about them.  If someone says they need a spec or eth, then it's almost always agreed to just give it to them and not sweat it.  Runes on the other hand are still pretty valuable, but in many cases they still go NBG if someone needs them.  Overall spell prices on Tribunal aren't nearly so horrid as many other servers though, so that may contribute to why people don't freak over specs/runes as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Personally I prefer NBG.  Yeah sure, there's drops I wouldn't mind for the bazaar, but if there's a class that can use a droppable from some BoT named that just got whacked, and it's only one person who can use it for an upgrade, I'm all about handing it over to them if it's an upgrade.  Some folks will even donate their old item to a /random for the group so someone has a sellable/usable item...also helps with that greed thing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Im only 6 months into the game(and guildless), my gear is sub par for 65, so when I see something that I can use, I sit in the corner and drown in a puddle of drool until either I win it, or some one else wins it.  From most groups I've had on Cazic (same as Shavedman to boot...friends even, go that), people will definately give you a drop if you can use it...if I had a nickel for everytime I've watched a non-spell user pass on a ethereal/spectral, I'd be a very rich man.  Im not fond of double loots either (winning 2 before the entire group has won 1 item)...been days where I pas on spectrals...just because I have *most* of my 63/64 and it's good to see another who needs more, get that spell they may need.<br />
<br />
Just the other day I turned in a spectral..and got a backfire of malosinia..again....so I mention my usual streak of luck to a friend who was hoppin her way to turn hers in..only to get a double of group diaku...made for a very nice tradeoff..I got her diaku, and she needed sinia.  Made my day...done many trades in a FFA group to get an item I need....but thats just me too..Im bad luck for anything I can possibly use... *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wouldn't it be better in a FFA group that the person who wins something passes for the next randoms until everyone has one item ?These are the only FFA rules I use when I run groups.  I don't really care how much you argue &quot;everyone should have a fair chance at everything&quot;.  You get one decent win(no, you're not out of a pattern if you win a diamond) and then you're out until everyone else gets something.  Usually I run one list for moderate stuff(gems, vendor trash &gt; 100p) and one list for the higher end stuff.  And the other poster is entirely right about clerics being awarded WAY too many gems.  I'm happy funding any expenditures the cleric makes in my group with one or two diamonds, but in no way am I going to pay for the past and future expenses the cleric has with groups and dots.  That's up to the cleric to manage.  Way too many people say, &quot;Diamonds to cleric&quot; without watching just how many diamonds the cleric is making off with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">LOL, my favorite Bot story is an ornate silk boot pattern drops.  We have a necro in group and since we had not clearly established the looting rules (like usual) I ask necro to link his existing boots.  Frankly, I'm fine with NBG unless peeps are being excessively greedy.  So, necro links Jboots.  I go over to him and inspect and he is well equiped but there is nothing in his feet slot.

However, if the whole group rolls than so will i and i'll give to my guildie.  I have all of my 63-64 spells (i have zero 65 spells), but i always roll on specs in pick up groups claiming i'm missing only one spell and i turn them in for guildies.  <br />
<br />
I always do nbg, melee should never roll on parches/specs *** are you going to do with it?  Yeah i get sick of defaulting all those plate bracers but who cares.  I won chain sleeves at Rorek and was happy, and no i didn't sell it and i grouped again with the ranger i beat and he wantd me to link the sleeves just to check em out.  That's why i don't sell **** because you end up grouping with the same people most of the time.  Greedy people are ****ing annoying.  If i had 100K plat i could buy all my 65 spells, but that don't mean i'm going to take away your armor from you and sit in the baz.  Ussually there is always a plate class in the group, but ussually one of the other groups leather,silk,chain is missing.  So we can just lotto whichever one is missing.  When i group with guildies it is strictly nbg.  When we raid we use DKP for items and we /random runes.  FFA is stupid, being greedy doesn't make friends.  If you ffa something over someone in my group that needs it a lot more and everyone else wants to nbg then fine i'll let you have your item but you're gettin booted and chances are you aren't a shaman like me who can get a group in 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">if you ask me it's pretty lame when people say someone's greedy because they do ffa..<br />
<br />
i personally perfer ffa. it's more fair then nbg is because you can never trust people when they say something's an upgrade.     so am i greedy if i win the silk legs in a group over the people who can use it?  some might say yes.   so if i go trade those silk legs for a set chain legs i just bennifited from that as did the person i trade with.  is that greedy?<br />
<br />
when you roll in ffa. and win something people generally trade it off for something that upgrades there own gear imo that in no way is greed.   so you reach a bad streak luck dont win much should you complain that everyone is greedy and that all they want stuff for is to sell so they can make money?  <br />
<br />
everyone has there perfered way of awarding loot.. non of them is right non of the are wrong.   it's how someone likes to do it.     lots of the posts in this thread say people are greedy because they take loot in ffa. and thats BS..  <br />
<br />
some people are out for greed (like the case with the jboots and no feet slot)  others just simply wanna upgrade there own gear to make there character stronger and better equipt.     and i dont see how that could be called greed.<br />
<br />
it could be diffrent if in bot (most used zone in the thread)  all camps had a chance to drop all items..  then nbg may work.. but it dont.  when someone sets up a group they ither pick the camp thats open.  or go to the one that they know something drops in.     hows it fair to a group that all spend 6 hours (random period of time)  and 1 chain bracer drops.  the entire time.  only chain class gets it.  what does the rest the group have to show for there hard work and effort that they contributed?<br />

lots of opinions and thoughts..   there's no reason to insult anyone for the way they like to do stuff.</div></div><hr />

Others said sure you can , I said nothing. I decided to let his values decide. He rolled a 95 and I got no parchment. I have been in similar groups like this before and sham, dru, cleric belt dropped in HoH (belt of mithaniel I think).

Warriors seem to be the primary culprits (Anybody remember Seb Guardian and claiming NBG on Lammies? Only to see them 3 days later claiming NBG again?)<br />
<br />
When I'm in charge of loot:<br />
<br />
1) Spectrals are caster only.<br />
2) Ethereals are melee only (They get a kick out of that) or loot to clear corpse. (Normally all casters in group have every ethereal they need)<br />
3) ND items rolled on by class useable<br />
4) All other is ran 1 1000.<br />
<br />
My Enchanter won Ornate Silk Boot pattern after defeating the Necro in a ran. They were the only two to roll. IMO, (and I told the group this) as happy as I was - it was not fair. The Warrior, Cleric, Bard and Monk all contributed to the group as much as I did. But, I'm a lewt whore, so I abided by the pre-agreed upon rules and looted the pattern.<br />
<br />
I have found that if you consistently apply FFA in pick up groups you WILL eventually score items. NBG is a sure fire way to screw people over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Personally I still like NBG. I like seeing people get stuff they will actually need and use. Sure some people abuse it and get the same item multiple times or use it to get items they don't really need to sell but I can live with that.<br />
<br />
I think there are a couple reasons people potentially abusing it don't bother me.<br />
<br />
1) I haven't really been needy in a while. I've got pleanty of PP in the bank and it's been a while since I've actually needed anything thats dropping. Hard to worry much about stuff when you are already well equiped with a fat bank account.<br />
<br />
2) I've typically been ahead of the curve so to speak. Hunting BoT when you have to have  a key to get in and have to kill one of the bosses to get keyed is a bit different than hunting bot now. 3 groups was crowded and odds are you knew most if not all of the people keyed already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I avoid pickup groups like the plague they are, but I'm generally off the '/random all' mindset on the rare occasion I get stuck in one.<br />
<br />
Normally I am either just dual boxing by myself (arguements over which of us get the loot are rare), or - more often these days - I start off dual boxing and get joined by one to 4 guildies or Alliance members.<br />
<br />
Depending on where we are, we either /random or combo NBG and /random (and in the case of Dulak, we just rotate through gem drops. You may get screwed in that some other guy always seems to get diamonds on his turn, but since it's a set rotation, you don't feel like someone else is being greedy)<br />
<br />
I've been in SkyFire for a while now trying to get Shards for my Cleric. When guildies show up, we do NGB for spell drops and (in theory, at least) /random everything else (except the shards that still haven't dropped. Being the only Cleric present, and the reason for being there, they would default to me. If another Cleric came along, I would /random the first one to set the loot order, then rotate)<br />
<br />
In the cases where we do a combo NBG and /random, everyone gets to /random...even if they got an NBG item.<br />
<br />
The only trouble i have run into there is the occasional person who keeps rolling when they have won 2 items and someone else has gotten jack. Usually a /tell solves that. <br />
<br />
On the rare occasion I do end up in a pick up group, I'll do the same thing as some others here...if I win a roll on something I know someone else can use, I generally give it to 'em. Good will usually goes farther than platinum.<br />
<br />
I'll never argue over loot...my time is too precious to worry about that crap. If they want to argue, they can have it...if it annoys me enough, I'll go somewhere else, and leave them to their greed.</div></div><hr />

That's not NBG. That's just limited FFA for those that can use it. If it was truly NBG, you would pass on it because you dont NEED it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I always advocate GBN (not NBG) in pickup groups, I just don't trust people.  That being said, I won't not join an NBG group, just that my vote is with GBN.  In a perfect world NBG would work, but this world is far from it.  People lie cheat &amp; steal (I cannot tolerate!!) as a matter of course in EQ and it's foolish to give anyone you don't know the benefit of the doubt.  The fairest way about it is to /random on any droppable loot; if you can't use the item, I'm sure you could find a use for the pp you could get for it.  In many cases the item someone's claiming NBG on isn't even an upgrade for them, and even in the case that it is, a good portion of people would rather have a bunch of shiny, useless pp than an actual useful item which would be an upgrade.  The most devious might go so far as to carry around a bag or two of crap gear, switching in the proper piece (or pieces, for an all-over poor look) and humbly offering themself up for inspection after making the switch.  I think many/most NBG advocates are either young, naive, or a combination of the two, in many cases bolstered by an experience where they could have made out like bandits but instead, fairly, someone else won the roll &amp; got the loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Old thread but I'll post. Full random on everything is the only fair way. NBG is abused way too much. In full random everyone has a chance to score, if you don't score item you wanted, the chances are you will score on an item you can sell/trade for what you want.<br />
<br />
NBG encourages abuse. How can we tell whether Bob has all his spells and needs that parch/rune? How can we tell if Fred really needs that mold or just switched out his bracer so he'd have a pity chance at a 18k item for the bazaar? The answer is we can't. Pickup groups should be full random, I'm not there to equip a server of strangers, I'm there to AA xp and get me some loot as a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
Pull that nbg stuff in guild or friend groups. I do pick up group a lot. The guy that insists on NBG is almost always revealed to be a selfish arse who quits the group the first time he dies or has to work hard. On the other hand, pick up groups that agree to random rolls on everything usually relax, joke around, get along, and end up awarding dropped items unanimously to people who deserve and really need them in the group anyway. <br />
<br />
Enough ranting, NBG is a tool used by greedy people since Old Guk and Sebilis. Share because you are a good person and your gut instincts tell you to. Not because of some stupid rule thats abused all to heck.</div></div><hr />

How about this:<br />
<br />
If something drops that someone can use, they *buy* it from the group for an agreed upon rate. They get the item, everyone else gets a fair split of the cash, everyones happy.<br />
<br />
This is one of the best solutions I have every seen. Everyone wins here. The NBG person gets an upgrade at a nice discount, and all the other group members get a bit of cash for their effort.</div></div><hr />

In BoT its always FFA (unless all friends/guild) in addition if i'm hydrain gin the group, I usually roll for both.  Why?  I'm not only handling the pulling, contributing a good portion of low maintenance DPS, but slowing, doing back up healing, doing some DPS w/ nukes/dots, and offtanking if need be.  I have had very few people complain when I roll for both.  In BoT especially, everything is FFA.  When some plate/silk/leathr class says NBG I tell him to go look at the drop tables and find me some chain in the camp were doing.  That normally shuts him up.  But I have no problem with non casters rolling on parches/runes.  Frankly once your in BoT you should have most your 63/64 spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I am always NBG, regardless of whether it is a guild-group or a pickup group. I do not group for plat or for drops. For example: I was in Plane of Storms with some VERY nice people from Celestial Fury last night. Unbeknownst to me (I'm an admitted planes noob) they were working on BoT keys. I joined up with the group, and a head dropped off ... it was probably the third or fourth giant we'd killed. I looked up, realized they were in the same guild, and told them to not worry about me looting, to get their drops and perhaps if there was one extra and they had time, I'd take it once they had theirs. They went nuts. Their responses? &quot;What, that is ridiculous ... you fought, you are doing your job very well, and you roll.&quot; I told them that I wasn't in the group for drops, I was there for experience, the chance to learn a zone, and friendship. It got quiet. Then ... &quot;Wow.&quot; That was from the cleric. Ultimately I convinced them that it'd be just fine if they wanted to roll on the drops between them, and once everyone had theirs, to get one for me. That worked, and we also awarded drops alphabetically. Everyone was happy, we all got what we needed (I'm two drops away from the key, thanks to them) and we made some new friends.<br />
<br />
Someone posted a bit earlier about rolling on everything and then giving it to the person who needs it if they lose ... I do that as a rule. If a group insists I roll, whether I can use it or not, I will roll, and immediately send a /tell to the person who said they needed it and trade it to them right then and there. This is a great system ... I've made a lot of friends that way, and people I can barely remember will often send me /tells that start with &quot;Hey, remember when you traded ...&quot; and they'll ask if I need the item they've got. No, that doesn't happen often, but the few times it does are enough to make me keep doing it.<br />
<br />
I just don't care about loot or plat. Maybe that makes me shortsighted. I've got decent gear for my level, 95% of my spells ... it doesn't matter. I'd rather see an item go to someone who can use it than sit in the bazaar trying to sell whatever it is. And if I need plat ... well hell, there are a couple great zones for farming stuff that will give you plat pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Someone else posted something I think is just great ... <br />
&quot; ... I do believe in karma. If you do nice things for other people, nice things will happen to you. Remember, it is just fantasy money. You can sacrifice something that isn't even real (plat) and really make someone's day ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Whoever wrote that, you're exactly right, and I wish more people felt that way. A *deep bow* and a raise of the glass to you, friend.</div></div><hr />

A few months later I had my bracer, life was good, and NBG was the rule of thumb on Xegony at the time.<br />
<br />
What turned me off to it was a group in KC one night when the drolvarg captain or whatever spawned with the Jade Mace.  Lots of folks in the group wanted to roll on it, heck, even me and the group decided to random.  The warrior in the group wanted the mace, claiming all sorts of reasons why he needed it and why it was better for him and he'd get more use out of it, etc.  Group finally still went random, I won the random and got the mace.  For 20 minutes the warrior sends me solid tells about how that's unfair and why did I roll on it when I don't need it and will probably just end up selling it the next day or keep it in a bag, etc.<br />
<br />
So finally, I gave in and just gave him the (*#&amp; thing.  The group breaks up about an hour later and we all camp for a while.  I log back in a couple hours later and there's that warrior in /auction in DL WTS Jade Mace 25k.<br />

A little while ago I was doing a pick up group with my warrior in LDoN.  The group consisted of a me, 2 other members of my guild, and 3 random others.  Before we started we discussed loot rules, with me and my guildies arguing for NBG because we knew that we could trust each other and we tend to be a giving bunch at any rate when someone needs a particular item and we do not.  Of course the SK that was along for the ride had to insist that we did FFA, but he had to take it a step farther and insist that winning on augments and winning on items dropped off named were seperate wins, and did not count as double wins.  We reluctantly agreed figuring anything that the guildies won would be given to whomever needed it.  So of course when the +INT augment dropped that no one else wanted but the SK, and of course did me no good, I rolled and won.  And then when the 2hs dropped that was obviously a huge upgrade for the SK and he oohed and ahhed over it, I rolled and won.  And I didn't feel one lick bad for him, considering that had he decided to go NBG with us he would have gotten both items.  <br />

In my experience I've found that most people who have trouble trusting other people are usually untrustworthy themselves.  They assume because they would screw everyone over that everyone else wants to screw them over.  Being suspicious and assuming that everyone is going to screw you over gets you nothing in the end, much like this SK got nothing.  So when people want FFA rather than NBG I play by their rules, but just as often I find they're the ones who are unhappy about the way the loot worked out, not me.</div></div><hr />
