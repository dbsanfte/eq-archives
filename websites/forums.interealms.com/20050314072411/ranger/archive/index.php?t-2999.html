When did this pop up, anyway?  I remember seeing PST everywhere all of a sudden, but it wasn't big during the first two years, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

When doing a business transaction there is nothing wrong with stating the prefered method of your customer contacting you back.<br />
<br />
I've seen in shouts like this.<br />
<br />
Seller &quot;WTS Item X&quot;<br />
Customer shouts &quot;Whats the Stats for item X? How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's simply a request to do business in private instead of a public channel.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raztick</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another common reason for using PST is because people have other chat channels turned off like shout and ooc. PST means that they want the conversation in tells rather than spamming the auction channel which I agree with. To those of you criticizing this practice, please realize that you don't know everything and people sometimes have reasons behind what they do.<br />

PST could also mean Pacific Standard Time if in a different context.</div></div><hr />

QUOTE]<br />
<br />
A) If there were no idiots in EQ then PST would not be needed, but please don't tell me that you think that is the case.<br />
<br />
B) lets see, they could use say, they could use shout, they could use a channel dedicated to auction. Have you truly never seen someone say in one of these channels including ooc or auc, &quot;How much is so and so?&quot; or &quot;Would you take a trade for so and so&quot; or some stupid comment about your price being to low or high.<br />
<br />
I will admit there are probably quite a few people that use it just because others are, but for some people there are reason's. I have never had to use PST because I leave all my channel's on.<br />
<br />
I'd like to be on your server if you never have full conversations about price haggling and where they will meet, and will you trade this or that...in the auction or ooc channel.<br />
<br />
Too many people on this board are quick to criticize. PST is just someone politely asking for that type of communication. Haven't you ever had to say in EC &quot;Take it to tells people!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: Typo</div></div><hr />

all of which I have recieved, sadly!  If you see anyone type pst, flee for your sanity.  PST is totally useless, its a waste of MY eyes.  If you are selling something, you dont need to clarify you want tells, youre going to get them, and if someone wants to offer you 500k for that rusty dagger youre selling, do you really care how they respond?</div></div><hr />

My point was what it was - it seems to be a phenomenon of players younger to EQ in general. Most older players see it as silly since they have played the game 2+ years without the need to type PST. This is my  personal observation, which I would wager is the case on most servers.<br />

If you need to criticize someone about something this trivial to make yourself feel better then you have some serious issues. Would any of you think it was a problem if at the end of and auction someone typed, &quot;Please send me a tell because I have all other channels turned off and I am busy in a group and might miss it if you don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
PST is just like any other dumb abbreviation in the game. It is used to shorten the amount of time typing.<br />
<br />
The person you are criticizing could be a better puller than you. They could be a nicer person than you. They could be a smarter, richer or more popular person than you. But because they use PST at the end of a message you call them noobs.<br />
<br />
The other thing that annoys me is that most of the people using it probably only do it because they see others using it. There is no printed manual on auction rules when you get this game, and people are probably just trying to be polite and fitting in by doing what other people do.<br />
<br />
Do you make fun of people who leave a message on you answering machine and say, &quot;Please call me.&quot; Well duh, what else am I going to do, use shortwave radio.<br />

Bah!!! The whole thing is stupid. If you need to criticize someone about something this trivial to make yourself feel better then you have some serious issues. <br />
<br />
No, you don't have issues.  It's a very natural reaction to a change in EQ communications that came out of nowhere, for no good reason, and due to the sheeplike nature of the younger players, spread like wildfire.  It's annoying as hell, and the fricking acronym is already TAKEN THANKS. It means Pacific Standard Time. Words mean things. So do acronyms.  SoW is not shield of words btw god%T@!#%.<br />

PST is just like any other dumb abbreviation in the game. It is used to shorten the amount of time typing.<br />
<br />
No it's not.   The noobs who are using it are doing so purely in imitation of others, without a thought in their heads for the reason.  Trying to fit in with dorks, just like kids wearing saggy pants at school. <br />
<br />
<br />
The person you are criticizing could be a better puller than you. They could be a nicer person than you. They could be a smarter, richer or more popular person than you. But because they use PST at the end of a message you call them noobs.<br />
<br />
No, they aren't.  Smart experienced players don't use it.  Annoying EC tradewhores and noobs do.  They might be richer though, give you that. <br />
<br />
<br />
The other thing that annoys me is that most of the people using it probably only do it because they see others using it. There is no printed manual on auction rules when you get this game, and people are probably just trying to be polite and fitting in by doing what other people do.<br />
<br />
Sheep. They need to develop their own style.  Preferably one without multiple exclamations and question marks after each sentence, or imitation of asian keyboarding styles.~~la keke thx plz (DIE)<br />
