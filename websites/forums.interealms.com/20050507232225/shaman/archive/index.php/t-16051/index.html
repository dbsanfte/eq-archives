<br />
So, I wanted to add a new account to my multiboxed army. I head down to the store and see one box on the shelves for Everquest - the Planes of Power expansion. I ask the guy working there and he says that that disk will also create a new account. So, I pick up the CD for 19.95, set up the new account and log on and try to create an Iksar. It tells me &quot;You can't play an Iksar unless you buy the Kunark expansion&quot;. ***? I have to buy Kunark-&gt;Luclin separately? Did I buy the wrong CD? Anyone know what the heck I'm supposed to do?<br />
<br />
Pretty annoying to have played this game four years and they make it confusing to try to set up a new account.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Narcleus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you need to buy every expansion starting from kunark.  that is if you want every expansion.  You are starting from scratch when you create a new account so you would need to have registartion codes for each expansion you want to play on.  if you want to do that, the easiest way would be to pick up a copy of everquest-evolutions which has every expansion up to LoY for about 29.99 at ebgames.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'm just a little annoyed that apparently paying 19.99 to make and account with the PoP cd is a complete waste of money. The 29.99 Evolutions is going to have everything, so I basically bought the wrong thing. Oh well, live and learn.<br />
