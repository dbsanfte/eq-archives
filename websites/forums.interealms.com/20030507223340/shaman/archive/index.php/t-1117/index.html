<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dornin23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can someone please tell me the spawn time on this elusive MOB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's random, with placeholders every few minutes. Dont know exactly how often placeholders spawn, but it's not a real long wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually find him in the left hand stables as you leave the courtyard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I finally got my courier, we were camped in the hall across from the stables, clearing the 2 buildings, and the stables area.  Finally popped in (with the stables to your back) building on the left.<br />
<br />
Right after he spawned for me, he spawned near the entrance of com, at the 3 spawn right passed the bridge.<br />
<br />
I could swear I've seen him near the temple on the other side of the courtyard from the stables, but I can't swear to that.<br />
<br />
I've also had druids and rangers say they've seen him on track inside the castle somewhere.</div></div><hr />
