<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes I was one of those people who went to see it at midingiht, opening morning.  OMG (to quote Sinf) Visually impressive and and ver true to the story. Certainly a must see and I can't wait for the next episode.</div></div><hr />

ARGH!  I can't get there till Friday.  I would tell everyone to keep it to themselves until then, but I have the plot memorized anyway.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was there at midnight as well.  I consider myself quite the Tolkien purist, and had very high expectations for the movie.  I am glad to say that I was only slightly disappointed on two occasions, and those were almost completely forgotten in comparison to what the film &quot;got right.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was worried about what all would be cut from the original books, and also worried about some of the things that Peter Jackson was planning on &quot;adding&quot; to the story.  I was pleasantly suprised to find that I didn't really miss anything that was cut from the books, and the added parts didn't overshadow the original story (more like exaggerations than additions, really).<br />
<br />
I think that all but the most hardcore purists will be completely satisfied with the films (&quot;satisfied&quot; is kind of an understatement).  The film does an excellent job of catering to both hardcore fans and the &quot;newbies,&quot; although I think it may be slanted a bit more toward those with some kind of &quot;Tolkien experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to mention how overjoyed I am that Alan Lee and John Howe were the conceptual designers for the films.  These two are probably the most popular Tolkien conceptual artists, and they really bring Middle Earth to life just like I imagined it.<br />
<br />
THE BALROG OWNS :eek: <br />
<br />
I'll be seeing it again tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very good movie, go see it!  I went at 12:01am also, and I'm payin the price today. ;)  But it was worth it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Humfrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want Tom Bombadil!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Going tonight...can't wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I missed Tom Bombadil as well, Humf - but that's about the only negative thing I can say about LOTR. And I can understand why he was written out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Humfrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, yeah I suppose 30 minutes of non stop singing could annoy some viewers. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DraxonWyrmslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IVE JUST SEEN THIS MOVIE went to the 4:00pm showing Central time zone that is OMG.............thats all i have to say<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
                            OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG<br />
<br />
                            if u havent seen it yet SEE IT <br />
<br />
<br />
i cant wait for the next 2 movies 3 hours long my butt started hurtin. Was offered to see it again afterwards... BTW movie just got over for me and i just got home but...anyway but my bum was numb from 3 hours of staring at the big screen. It has got to be one of the greatest.....er THE greatest movie ive ever seen at least from what i can remeber.was a HUGE line for the 7:15 showin glad i came early but anyway if u havent seen it SEE IT<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ok ill stop rambling im still in shock........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Saw it at 1pm and 4pm...Would have seen it at 12AM as well but no local early showing...:(...<br />
<br />
I wish they had kept the Nasil reforged line clear but all in all great...<br />
<br />
I loved the entire Moria Sequence and the Rivendell Ford sequence was great (would have been easy to go overboard on the FX but I think they hit it on the mark)...<br />
<br />
All the storyline adaptations were acceptable and understandable given that edited it runs 2:58...And long run-time be damned...I didn't get fidgety once...Then again I'm a Kurosawa fan so...its not that long to me...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HELUVA FLICK!!!<br />
<br />
Probably the most visually stunning movie I have come across.  I found most of the settings extremely tasteful, and I think they did a heluva job with the adaptation to the big screen.<br />
<br />
/agree on the sore bum part...long time to go without a smoke.  Believe me, I wanted one after the Balrog scene!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ROCKS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fingelfin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also saw this movie at midnight, and I must say that it more than lived up to all the hype.  It had incredible special effects, and it was about as true to the sotry as it possibly could have been.  (Without being 6 hours long.)  They did leave out Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel, but I just don't see how they could have included them without messing the whole rhythm of the movie.  Anyway, go out and see it - you'll be glad you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the folks here at work decided to take the afternoon off for a &quot;multimedia presentation&quot; read: we played hooky to go see the afternoon showing :)  I'm still in awe at the attention to detail that was played.  While I too would have loved to see tom bombadil (since he is one of my favorite characters) 30 minutes of non stop singing might get tiresome :)<br />
<br />
we are all planning a day when all 3 movies are out on DVD to sit down one saturday and watch the entire series, marathon style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I haven't seen the movie yet but am going soon. My first concern was why didn't they make Bilbo or Frodo or whoever it was look like a Hobbit? What about the other hobbits and dwarves? I mean he just looks like a human kid. Do the Hobbits at least have furry feet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mathilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with th posts this movie is AWESOME!! if you havent seen it YET, GO NOW!! Be safe all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Went to a 10pm show last night.  Fantastic movie but boy am I tired.  It's 3 hrs for those that didn't know.  I honestly could have sat for another 6 hours to watch the next 2 parts without any problem though.<br />
<br />
I think I'll end up seeing it again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DraxonWyrmslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ok in the previews and stuff frodo looks human but in the movie he looks like a halfing(hobbit) they did extreamly well on everything!<br />
<br />
and yes bemidian they have furry feet :D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
heh i went back yesterday to see it again was just as good the 2nd time ....its a movie i could watch over and over.....at my own house on my cumfie chair rather then those damn theater chairs that make me bum go numb after the first hour........prolly the only reason i havent see it 3 times now bum still hurts ( theater near me has the most unconfortable chairs EVER)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Fantastic movie.  Also, it is nice to see that we only have to wait 1 year for next one....unlike Senior Lucas who makes us wait 3... weeeeeeee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was all set to be disappointed by the film, but still expected to be entertained. I love the books and Hollywood rarely does justice when translating the written word to screen. However, they hit this nail right on the head. Despite slight alterations, the movie far exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend it....... And yes, I'm going to see it a second time. :D <br />

<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That was me too, VB.  I went in expecting a visually stunning fun story in a fantasy setting with some names I would recognize.  I got a visually stunning FotR with some understandable cuts and some very minor adaptations  (Hollywood decided they need a little bit of a love interest in their film, not overbearing though).<br />
<br />
Have seen it 3 times now, and am guessing it will break my record for in theater films exceeding 2 hours (Empire Strikes Back is the top with 28 showings - but it was 2hours.  Gladiator hit 6 showings, and is my current top for long films).<br />
<br />
I am glad they are almost done with the third film.  This thing will be huge with Tolkien fans (both new and old), but the pacing on the story is Tolkien (slow by Film standards), so I am concerned it will not be a huge finacial success (it will be big, but not Titanic.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">IMAX RULZ!!!! <br />
<br />
Yes, went to see LoTR on Friday at an Imax theater. 40ftx40ft screen /drool. The movie rocked, only bad thing about the movie was my brother kept saying &quot;Sweeeeet&quot; every five minutes. I plan on seeing this again soon :).  What amazed me most about the movie was not the strictness they stuck to the book, the scenery design, or the graphics, but the way that the design of the movie fit the image in my mind to a T and in some cases exceeded it (the Balrog).<br />
<br />
The one major bitch about it, wtf were they thinking getting An Agent to play Elrond, all I could think of when he talked were the lines, &quot;You have two choices.....Mr. Anderson&quot; ARRGGGG!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I noticed that right away...<br />
<br />
Agent Smith.<br />
<br />
I love that guys speech patterns...  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the movie .. one word sums it all.. <br />
<br />
Tolkien</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You live two lives Mr. Baggins.  In one life you are a go-lucky layabout who just inheritted his uncle's hole in the hill.  On most days of the week you lie about do nothing or causing some trouble with your friend Sam.  On Mondays you even help your neighbor with her garbage.  In your other life, you carry the power of Sauron and go on grand adventures.  One of these lives has a future Mr. Baggins.  The other does not.  <br />
<br />
I kept expecting a speech like that, but I got over it.  Can't fault a man for having a well known role in a very popular film.  Seeing him as Elrond did make it apparent that he was not really acting in the Matrix.  He obviously has difficulty talking any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I thought Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) was a good Elrond.  He only sounds like Agent Smith when he talks at a normal pitch.  When he was yelling at Isildur to throw the ring in the fire, he seemed to have a bit more &quot;range&quot; I guess.  But yeah, I kept waiting for him to say something to one of the Men like &quot;It's the smell...&quot;<br />
<br />
Anywho, if I was going to gripe about elves, then I would say that the guy playing Haldir (forgot his name) was too chubby for the part.  Not that he is fat, but I have never heard of an elf that looked anything ither than slim and trim.<br />
<br />
Another funny part during the Council of Elrond...when Gimli gets all uppity and tries to destroy the ring with his axe (destroying his axe in the process).  About 30 seconds later Aragorn pipes up with the &quot;You have my sword...&quot; and Gimli says &quot;And my axe!&quot;  What axe!?!  You just broke the damn thing! Maybe you mean that guy's axe behind you! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Unbelievable.  just plain old unbelievable.<br />
<br />
<br />
How the heck does a filmmaker reach into your mind and pull out images like that.  EVERYTHING was exactly the way I imagined it the 60 or so times I have read the Trilogy.<br />
<br />
Dang, they even got the archery right.  Watch Legolas shoot.  His form is correct, his hold on bow and string are correct, the timing is realistic and his execution is sheer poetry in motion.  Going to have to watch the credits and see if I can pick out the archery coach's name.<br />
<br />
To hell with a year.  I want to see all three of the movies on DVD at my home by the end of next week.  I could marathon my way through the whole story several times. <br />
<br />
<br />
And for those who complained that the movie didn't have an ending, my wife ( who has never read the books ) kept me busy on the forty minute drive home asking how different threads of the movie developed in the latter two books.  Might even get her to read them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Saw it this afternoon - just a couple quick thoughts:<br />
<br />
Special effects were great, but in my opinion the best visuals were the monsters and landscapes.  The orcs FREAKED me out the first time I saw them - the black blood and all, and the scenery fit in perfectly.  Also, Isengard is absolutely stunning.<br />
<br />
Characters were all portrayed well, but I want more dwarves!  Gimli was great, but he was the only one 8(.  Stuck to the storyline very well, and was tremendously entertaining.  Fastest three hours of my life 8).<br />
<br />
Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You'll have to see it a few more times, Amarin.  There were tons of dwarves.  The best kind of dwarf too.  Dead ones littering the halls of Moria by the hundreds.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Fazzar and I went to see LotR with Coatie and Xunil on Sunday and all i can say is WOW!!!! With the long wait to see these books materialize onto the big screen, nothing would have been more disappointing than if these movies didn't live up to the hype. Fortunately these movies lived up to the hype and surpassed it IMO. The only thing that would have made it better is if they released all 3 movies together....9 hour marathon! WOOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dar,<br />
<br />
The odd thing is, I have a &quot;Making of&quot; CD for the Matrix with quite a bit of interview time of Hugo Weaving.  The man has a heavy British accent and doesn't talk at all like either of these characters.  I'd go so far as to say he seems a bit, effeminate.<br />
<br />
After going back and researching a bit of Elronds back story, I would say that the abrupt, impatient immortal was exactly the right read for this character, though.</div></div><hr />
