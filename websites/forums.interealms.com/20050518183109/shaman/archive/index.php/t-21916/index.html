<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">God bless you all.  The positive posters, the negative posters, the long mathematical posters that keep me up nights tryng to figure them out, the sarcastic posters who sometimes make me wince - sometimes make me laugh.<br />
<br />
From each and every one of you I learn something.  Maybe it is to log back in Lori and parse something.  Or maybe it is a good /feedback suggestion.  <br />
<br />
Even in the angry posts where you guys do the venting, it calms me to see that others have my same frustrations, and I learn something.<br />
<br />
Without your passions, towards good or bad, I truly do not believe we would be at this junction of possible change. <br />
<br />
You are effectively pumping blood back into Lori, at least to the point where I am willing to pause over the &quot;cancel billing&quot; button.  If you have the patience to do the good fight one more darn time, I have the patience to come here, help with the /feedback, and march with you.<br />
<br />
I read each and every post.  It doesn't matter what I learn from it, or how it makes me feel, I read them.  <br />
<br />
Please, and I am begging here, keep it up.  I promise, you have an audience of 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
God bless you all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make it an audience of 2, Lorianna.  I won't hit cancel cause I still enjoy the game.  Although I haven't logged my Shaman in almost 2 months, I refuse to delete because I still hold hope that things will change.<br />
<br />
I come to this board every day becuase of the loyalty, passion and experience of the majority who post here.<br />
<br />
A sincere thanks to the positive contributors of the Shaman community for all you do.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Lorianna its nice to know some one is listening. <br />
Maybe we are beating our collective heads against a brick wall, or maybe it will do some good. Sometimes I think it is only our passion for the Shaman class that keeps us going. I for one will keep trying to bring this issue to Sony's attention, even though it does seem at times the blinders are more of a blindfold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know in SWG the players who were Wookies got pretty upset overthe stat of their race and so they organized a march of wookies. Everyone that cared t omade a new wookie on a specific server and met at a specific location and had a huge protest. We could all do a similiar thing. Everyone make a Shaman of any race and meet up in PoK for a couple hours of protest. All we would really need to do is set a date time and server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sure is nice to know you are not the lonesome voice in the crowd hunh?<br />
<br />
As a whole I love playing Snoww. But I refuse to play her in a world that just doesnt care if I am there or not. I play EQ because first and foremost the people, and If I feel that my presance playing the charecter I love is actually holding them back I get almost sick inside. <br />
<br />
I want to be useful in the skin I have chose. The skin of a shaman. Give me the time and I can move mountains. But in the day and age of sprint fights I am sorely outclassed, because I weild a big hammer and that takes time to swing. <br />
<br />
Snoww Brokenhammer Bashy Rabid Bear E marr -Still retired. But thinking about that light at the end of the tunnel... Train.. or hope... I still don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That makes me feel all warm and tingly inside, like when you jump someone in Bazaar arena. I feel like such the outcast posting with my crummy rep 8( Maybe my sig will make people smile!<br />
