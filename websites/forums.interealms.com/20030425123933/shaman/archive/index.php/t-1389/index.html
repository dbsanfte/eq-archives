<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was trying to make potions of Somber Origins (decent triv level, and can sell 'em to noobies for their selling, oh and cheap to make), bought all the ingredients, and no go. Do we have any proof any of these work? I know that EQ Shaman has a list of ones that are supposed to work, and Somber Origins is one (I sent in an FYI). I'd love to make some of these because they are decent effects and are cheap enough to make that you could sell 10 stacks for like 10 plat and make a good profit. Hell the ultravision potion and the levitate potion would be great to sell too! Any info would be much appreciated!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check the EQ Traders Alchemy Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm).  All of the Old Alchemy recipes shown have the most current information I've been able to find.  Somber Origins and Troll's Essence are most definitely broken.  Assailing is effectively broken, since cyclops eyes are not dropping.  Calimony is bugged and has the same effect as Soluan's Vigor.  They've all been reported as bugs, so hopefully fixes will be coming soon...hopefully...maybe....</div></div><hr />
