<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rule 1) Items sold must be something noone wants.<br />
<br />
Rule 2) Any items you may want you will not be able to afford.<br />
<br />
Rule 3) Noone ever sells something that everyone else doesnt want, but you do. (addendum to rule #1)<br />
<br />
Rule 4) When you're buying, as soon as you log someone is selling the item you were trying to buy for 6 hours following your departure.<br />
<br />
Rule 5) When you finally DO buy something you have been auctioning for hours to get, three people will join the channel and be selling the exact same item for half of what you just paid.<br />
<br />
Rule 6) Full words are forbidden, full sentances are punishable by death.<br />
<br />
Rule 7) When someone is auctioning to buy something you have they will be three zones away from the nearest port location, and they will expect you to go to them.<br />
<br />
    Rule 7 subpart A) Said buyer will also be a porting class.<br />
<br />
    Rule 7 subpart B) Upon reaching said buyer they will proceed to go linkdead, and will remain so until your arrival at your previous camp. At which time they will come back and again expect you to travel to them.<br />
<br />
Rule 8) Upon traveling to a buyer they will find themselves to be a minimum of 500pp short of what you agreed upon.<br />
<br />
Rule 9) When selling an item, you will be informed that your price is too high, regardless of what price you ask.<br />
<br />
Rule 10) The day an item becomes incredibly popular and high in demand is the day you realize you gave all the ones you had away.<br />
<br />
Rule 11) The day you sell your prized posession is the day they nerf its drop rate.<br />
<br />
Rule 12) Any time an item is worth more than you can carry, the seller wants cash only.<br />
<br />
Rule 13) Any time you make a trade the seller will demand an item you dont have, even if what you're offering is woth more<br />
<br />
Rule 14) An item that is worthless today becomes priceless after it no longer drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all I have for now, will add more as I think them up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You must put wtt 10 pieces of crap that add up to mabye 1k which nobody wants for 1 uber item that sells for 10k+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Liberal use of PST is encouraged<br />
<br />
-- At least once every 10 minutes someone must request a PC of a Centi LS (lore or non-lore)<br />
<br />
-- At least once per half hour the price of a Fungi must be debated<br />
<br />
-- No less than once every 15 minutes someone is required to forget that they have put the auction channel on the raid channel and must announce to auction that they have slowed Mob_01<br />
<br />
-- The seller is required to ask for an offer then proceed to berate you that the offer is way too low and that they feel the item is worth your offer x 2<br />
<br />
-- You are encouraged to only announce the type of armor and not the slot.  For example:<br />
<br />
Ok = &quot;WTS: Barbed Ringmail&quot;<br />
<br />
Evil = &quot;WTS: Barbed Ringmail Tunic&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus, just mentioning &quot;Netted Kelp&quot; by itself is more than sufficient.<br />
<br />
-- No seller will be within 30 minutes of travel unless you are the seller then the buyer will be at least 30 minutes of travel away.<br />
<br />
-- Selling anything worth less than 3kpp is actively discouraged<br />
<br />
-- All shaman spells regardless of common occurrance must cost at a minimum 2k.  Anything that sounds interesting and is a shaman spell must sell for 5k.  The rule is superceded by the active buyer clause that states that any shaman looking for a spell must then pay double the normal price.<br />
<br />
-- PSUs will last a long GD time as a BL, so suck it up, get your epic, and get the F out of the auction channel.<br />
<br />
-- You're not to answer any PC under any circumstances.  This is a bannable offense<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is by far my favorite.  I love seeing:<br />
<br />
enchanter_01 tells auction, '&lt;&lt; an ire ghast &gt;&gt; has been TASHED !!!'<br />
<br />
I normally give them congratulations in the channel since it was such an important event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My auction mule is a total hardass.  I don't need money usually, so I don't go out of my way to meet anyone halfway or something to make a deal...especially....<br />
<br />
 Rule 7) When someone is auctioning to buy something you have they will be three zones away from the nearest port location, and they will expect you to go to them. <br />
<br />
Nope, my mule is way out of the way in EC.  It's easy to find, but it's quite the jog. You want to buy something, you come to the store.  I don't care how much you're encumbered :P<br />
<br />
Really the only way to stay sane while auctioning is to screw with people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't forget:<br />
<br />
Putting all your auctions on one line and then using shift+uparrow to repeat it is forbidden.  The only proper way to auction more than one item is to put each individual item on its own line and give it its own hotkey.  This is especially important to do when the items that you are auctioning are pieces of crap that you picked up in KC because no one else wanted to loot them (i.e. kunzar cloak, drolvarg mantle, etc...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your popularity and esteem among your auctioning peers is directly proportional to the number of lines on your WTS useless_crap_098 Hotkey.  Bonuses are awarded to anyone who can fill up the entire chat window at max size with a single keystroke.</div></div><hr />

lol, too true:<br />
<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS BABS CHEAP!!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS PBB CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Orc Fang Earrings CHEAP!! PST!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Orc Fang Neck CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Bronze BP CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Drolvarg Mantle CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Kunzar Cloak CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS Grimling Mining Pick CHEAP!! PST<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS +2 wis rings CHEAP!! PST!!!<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ CASH ONLY!!! PST!!!<br />
<br />
Another thing that bugs the hell outta me is when someone auction something for 3 times more than anyone else:<br />
<br />
Jobbernoob tells auction 1:/ WTS FBSS 7k<br />
<br />
What bugs me even more, though, is the argument that ensues because someone tells him that it is WAY too much for an FBSS.  dood, if it's too much for you, don't buy it, and shut yer spam hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You forgot:<br />
<br />
Any time you auction multiple items, you will automatically get one of these tells:<br />
<br />
an_orc_pawns_lover01 tells you: 'I'll buy that'<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
an_orc_pawns_lover01 tells you: 'what r stats on that'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for us Shamen, if you're selling potions:<br />
<br />
an_orc_pawns_lover01 tells you: 'I'll take 10 SOWs'<br />
<br />
You tell an an_orc_pawns_lover01: 'One 10-dose or ten 10-dose potions?'<br />
<br />
an_orc_pawns_lover01 tells you: 'yes plz.  wru?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you ask for a pc one every half an hour for half a day and never get a response, then someone new pc's the same item they get 5 responses.<br />
<br />
(maybe this is just our server but) anyone under level 30 doesn't deserve a response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recognize most of these allthought I must say I may not always be on your side of it...<br />
<br />
But I must agree with Vaaxx, selling has become a lt more fun and successful after starting to screw with people.<br />
<br />
If someone for a long time or repeatedly spams selling a reasonably pricy item send a tell offering a shamefull price between a quarter and half it's value. You'd be surprised at how often you can daytrade. The value of the items you offer on should of course depend on your wealth and level. If you're levl 60 or if you have more than 50k cash buying something worth 5k for 3k isn't worth the trouble but if you're lvl 50 and have 7k it is. Never ever daytrade with low margins, you are doing them a favour selling teir itemm 40% profit as in my example should be a minimum.<br />
<br />
When someone tells you stories about what they've seen item X for and such pretend to agree that your price is too high and send them to meet you in the most out of the way place you think is plausible. When they arrive simply tell them that you found someone paying more. This can also be done to those guys offering bags of crap for items in the auction channel if they annoy you enough. Even to the lots of line spammers allthough they're less likely to fall for it.<br />
<br />
When they ask to see something you've told them the stats of or when they ask to see a very expensive and widely known item just say no.<br />
<br />
Your customer is NOT the guy auctioning to buy the specific item you're selling. He's wants to buy it because he cant afford it in 90% of the cases.<br />
<br />
If someone is for a very long time and often auctioning an item for a very high price, which is their right of course, but should this annoy you make repeated low offers and have your friends do the same. Increase low offers in increments of about 1% of his asking price start out at half the normal server pricce of his item.<br />
<br />
When someone PCs an item toomany times in a row, especially obscure ones, just make something up. This is better if you have friends supporting the price.<br />
<br />
Any overuse of abbreviations or caps is grounds for screwing with the perpetrator as much as you bloody well feel like.<br />
<br />
I've had a lot easier selling stuff made much more money and had much more fun since I decided to be a jackass to anyone who annoyed me and even to some who don't.</div></div><hr />
