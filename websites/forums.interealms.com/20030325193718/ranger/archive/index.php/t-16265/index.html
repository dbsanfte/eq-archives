<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">LVL 60 ranger AM2/EQ....where is the best place to hunt to level solo.  also to get AA's.  Heard about rats in PoD.  Any advise from you all would be great ......enjoy fear kiting as well as SAFE arrow kiting.  Any ideas would be great as well as tactics in those areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shariq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can do diseased rats in PoD but there usually aren't a ton of them around.  Ravenous Nightstalkers in PoN are pretty good - can single pull them with harmony and fear kite.</div></div><hr />

In POV there is a cave where razorfiends and lumberingjacks(?) spawn.  Accross from the river is a nice little area to do you bow thing.  Fairly easy to snare these mobs even at lvl 60 and they are AWESOME xp.  POS has some great xp also, just not as familiar with that zone.<br />
