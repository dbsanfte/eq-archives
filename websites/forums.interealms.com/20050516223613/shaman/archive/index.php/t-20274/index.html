<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like theres a new clicky illusion item now.  Yup illusion guktan.<br />
<br />
When they added the Enchanter spell illusion guktan, it had a side quest of froglok stone.  Which had one charge of illusion guktan, that was rechargeable.  Yet recharging ment going to the darkelf city and using a illusion potion to do the hand in.  I did the quest just for the 1 charge item, but todays patch  seems to have changed it to unlimited charges.<br />
<br />
The quest has been on allakhazam for months.  Only took a day with me and a monk duoing it.  For good races to do the quest, i had to use a few illusion potions, enchater or bard to charm the npc.  Not sure if faction is required, I did the nek red wine quest  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=159)  for faction long ago for the halfing illusion mask.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope its not *fixed*.  True upgrades take time, entire guilds and lots of work............as it should be.  Cool little items like this are what quests should be about. Dunno how the bards, chanters and rogues will feel though. They are very territorial about something as simple and fun as illusions. I'm sure there will be a rant post at least on the chanter forums if this stays in. I still remember the whining over the elf mask infringing on their territory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the main reason frogloc illusion is nice is you dont see the horse head.  i never liked the lizard mounts, and hate shrinking. i made a barb to be tall ffs...</div></div><hr />

Had to get my brother to help me with this.<br />
<br />
I bet there's probably a way around it.. maybe you can bring big momma elsewhere and the tiny spiders won't even attack?  Dunno.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Agree, this would be so much FUN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ordee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Very nice change,<br />
<br />
  I got mine a few months ago and just handed it in for a re-charge last night and got the surprise of my life. Unlimited charges of Froggy. Free ultravision, no more horse head in the way so no more memming shrink when I use the horse, gets me into places where a Troll is KoS, and lets me change back into the old Troll model so my beautiful Velious textured Ornate will show up and I no longer look like a naked Troll running around. Absolutely amazing how much fun this little item is giving me now. It's prolly just me but I prefer my old Troll look over the skinny Luclin model. Never took Ordee too seriously, so the fat Troll suits me perfectly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>frroooaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Let them know what you think of their suggested fix with /feedback and post on the eqlive forums. (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=26382)<br />
<br />
Seriously, it's their bad if it was never meant to go live. People quested for the new changes. They should get to keep it. The fix should involve a new item ala the old guise of the deciever. Just because some tard posted a walkthrough on rpgexpert.com and made the quest overly popular doesn't mean everyone who quested for it should be punished.<br />
<br />
The new change in no way affected enchanters negatively other than giving them unwanted competition for the last stage of the quest. Any savvy enchanter would foremost prefer the spell for project illusion and I'm sure they'd also be interested in the upgraded stone as an insta-click item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I cant see why they would ever consider changing it back when all this item does i add role play and fun factor to the game... the guktan illusion offer nothing that the other all/all clickly illusion itmes do and the spell itself has no real value to chanters other than roleplay and fun.  but leave it to soe to nerf even something with no game value...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">if they had a full brain, they would leave the item alone for every one who has already done the quest, one of the spawns for the quest is a 12+ hour repop.. so really not that many per server have the item<br />
<br />
if they had half a brain they would add a 12 sec cast time to the illusion, im sure a new insta clicky will screw up the few pvp servers even more !<br />
<br />
but since they have no brain, it will be full nerfed to 1 charge<br />
<br />
my self i love frog illusion, since it removes the gay horse head ive been looking at for 2 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I almost hate posting this, but there is one thing you need to consider....<br />
<br />
When this quest for the chanter illusion spell was first put into place, there was a good and an evil side of the quest, depending on what you needed to get the quest.   Now, the froglok stone was a SIDE EFFECT of the evil side quest, meant more as a continuation of a story in a quest than as a permanent clicky item that could be quested by all classes. <br />
<br />
I almost think that in just this case, it makes sense to repair it back to it's original one charge &quot;as intended&quot; item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is precisely why they will nerf it to single charge. Chanters, the class this quest was originally designed for will now have to compete with every other class on the server to get a spell they all want because it removes the horse head graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Shrink and buying a drogma also remove the horse head graphic.<br />

Unless it's a bard speed mob dropped horse I can't understand why anyone who has an issue with the horses head hasn't traded in for a lizard.</div></div><hr />

hhmm, most people don't have Gates, why should most people get one useless expansion over another &quot;LoY&quot; was only good for 2 spells and a broken raid zone.<br />
please, think carefully next time, this is SoE after all, this will probably be fixed befor anything else, wich is the truth.<br />
<br />
one more little joy pill ...<br />
the last GoD zone, the END GAME, will probably be so buggy as to make the &quot;Time glitch&quot; look like a walk in the park, if it is anything is like some of what the Devs have done lately. (balance, zones, spells, content, tradeskills)</div></div><hr />

Yea good point man, but when the quests first came out all the evil race enchanters were doing the &quot;good version&quot; of the quest.  They are enchanters after all.  It was the first full walk through to be posted so folks just opted to use it.</div></div><hr />

Is that the new one?  Its not unlimited but 255 charges is pretty damn nice if you ask me.  And if its rechargable then it might as well be unlimited.<br />

I'd like to know if someone uses all their charges and recharges it if they recieve the 255 charges again or not. I'm guessing the 255 charges was a fluke in their system though (how many other items have been changed like that?).
