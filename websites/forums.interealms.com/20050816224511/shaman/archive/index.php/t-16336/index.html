<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For todays live changes, most of the spell changes say &quot;Changed Unknown130 from 100 to 0&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually know or can intelligently guess what this is for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds to me like they didnt add the spell info to the spa.dat. Problly becuse they dont want us knowing what they do atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all those spells are group spells i think... think they might have modified how &quot;AE range&quot; on group buffs is kept in the DB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That just means lucy doesn't know what to make of that info. No one from verant tells them what means what. They just have to look at things, compair spells and compair how they work in game and guess what they mean and come up with a description based on that. Those descriptions aren't always right either. A good example of that is all the affliction focus's say limit hps allowed. Should really say something more like hps or dmg required.</div></div><hr />
