Helm of the tracker, gloves of earthcrafting(???) and now all the damn nice bows....do those of us following karana get ANY diety specific equipment?</div></div><hr />

Their original cultural armor was Vale Studded leather and Vale Reinforced leather.   It could be imbued with a plains pebble to me made Karana only.  I found the recipes on EQ Traders and the stats on EQ Maps.  That's the only deity-specific gear I know of for Karana right now.  The stats are pretty horrid, but it's out there...<br />
<br />
There's more halfling tailoring coming... http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessageRange?topicID=4163.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20<br />
 read the 3rd post down.   Possibilities maybe?  So far no good, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
Maybe human cultural smithing can be imbued with a plains pebble? Has anyone tried?</div></div><hr />

Wood Elf Cultural Smithing has Karana only versions of its weapons ... therefore it is a possibility that all the arrows and bows could also have Karana only versions ... Has anyone tried this yet? The only difference between the Karana only version and the Tunare only version is the imbued gems used in the creation of the item .......</div></div><hr />
