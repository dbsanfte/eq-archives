<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is that according to my wizard friends, their DD crits generate no more aggro than the normal spell but crit on DoTs a few times and it's summoning time? Fix this. Shamans have no way to shed aggro like Necros so we are hamstrung on raids and have to resort to our lame nukes if we want to live. If I run more than 2 DoTs now on a raid with max crits and max DoT focuses (up through Time) I will die before the mob does. I only ran Bane and Anathema last night on TZ (I avoided Blood to try and keep aggro down) and as soon as the MT died I was the first one summoned and killed. Last try where we won (thanks collision bugs making us take 3 tries) I was a little less careful and refreshed the DOTs as soon as they faded instead of waiting a tic or two and I was summoned and squashed with TZ at about 15%. And this is all without throwing slow aggro on top of it because Time Gods are unslowable. Hell if I can't slow the damn mob at least let me do damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This issue is really hurting us baddly. With DOTs, we can actually do some decent damage WHILE we do other things like spot-heal or nuke. But with the aggro generated by a 300 damage tic of BoS, its just not worth it to bother. <br />
<br />
I want to be able to stack 3 DOTs then heal. This, after debuff, is the stackability of my character. Not an unbalanced amount of damage. Not an unbalanced amount of healing. 100 dps (average while ticking, not overall on the encounter) and a few 1800-2200 heals on the MA isnt too much to ask for, is it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do DOTS generate so much aggro because of the counters or because of the damage?  Or both?<br />
<br />
I've always wondered if the lazy gits at Sony / Verant coded DOT damage so that the sum of the DOT damage was calculated and assigned at the time the DOT hit.<br />
<br />
(On second thought, that doesn't make sense.  Oh wait...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It’s almost a joke.  For two years we have all know about the insane agro of DOTS.  Then we get a crappie upgrade for DOT crits that doesn’t even compare to DD crits.  DD crit doubles damage while ours well we hope to see an extra 25% damage out of it.  I believe this is due to the fact that if we did get the full effect of every tic criting we would die for casting Tainted Breath criting for 20 damage a tic and SONY knew this.  It just gets under my skin that the entire DOT doesn’t crit every tic so we get double the mana to damage that a DD spell gets.  It takes 2 days to take full effect anyway why not throw a bone our way.  Fix DOT agro and make DOTs crit check the first tic and if the dot crits every tic for the remaining tics crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wonder...maybe our dots (all dots?) are calculating damage/aggro based on total dot potential...EACH tic? That might explain why everyone around us is out DPSing via melee, DD spells, etc, but we're (dot casters) snatching aggro so easily. Something is certainly not right though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Counters definitely are a factor. Those of us who've been playing for a while will remember when slows got disease counters added to them and caused aggro problems. Verant then decided sk's using thier low level disease dot for aggro was wrong and changed the aggro on disease counters. <br />
<br />
Poison counters are known for being high aggro ( pretty much the only reason tash has aggro as far as i can tell is because it has poison counters so it can be cured) which is probably way our magic dots like bane are lower aggro than blood of saryrn even tho they do more DPS. <br />
<br />
Even with that said all indications are that even with out counters (some necro and druid dots) dots gerenate much more aggro for the damage dealt than nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kinda funny but I posted this another thread and people were saying there that they didn't see the problem.  Maybe they are just used to insane aggro generated by our dots and so they just never use them, and so never see the problem.  But I play a DoT class, and I should be able to DoT effectively and be at least a decent dps class so I use them as much as possible.  This is a big problem and I hope someone out there is petitioning for us (hey Glori :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have /bugged this one everytime I play with a DD class that has crits.  After a while you just give up though and max your DD crits and forget about DOTS.  I still use Bane here and there but everytime its resisted I bug it or try to make a mental note to bug it before I log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How about they fix dots period.<br />
<br />
With the exception of bane, using dots any more on experience mobs is a big waste of time.  They absolutely must shorten the length of dots, increase their relative damage, and then fix the agro problem.  Our dots should be LESS agro and LESS mana intensive than nukes, for the sole reason that we are spreading out our damage over time.  But because we can't make full use of this time, because we're forced to both debuff and canni on mobs that die quickly, our main form of damage is worthless.<br />
<br />
Fix everything about dots, not just the agro.<br />
<br />
And then, when they're done fixing dots, how about they fix crit aa.  Why can't they make our crit aa on par with that of the nuking classes?  There is absolutely no reason why it should be the way it is now.  I demand changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I 3-box with a mage.  My mage can cast her level-59 rain spell Manastorm.  It does 3 waves of 675 damage, for a total (if unresisted) of 2025 damage.<br />
<br />
My shaman can cast his Bane of Nife spell, which does 1648 of damage (plus a random amount from my bone-clasped girdle with BA III).  For the sake of argument, let's assume it does 2000 damage, which is probably too high if anything.<br />
<br />
The shaman will pull agro every time.  And hold it.  My mage can throw in a Seeking Flame of Seukor, which does another 1024 of damage, and still not pull agro off the shaman.  <br />
<br />
In total, my shaman does, over the course of 42 seconds, maybe 2000 damage.  Meanwhile, the mage does well over 3000 damage in less than that time, and won't pull agro ever.  <br />
<br />
So I'll second the notion - please fix DOT agro.  This is just silly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dot agro is a joke for all not just shamans. Toss in Necros and Druids.<br />
<br />
This is the very reason I do not spend the points on critical dot aa's on my shaman. With my necro its max and I will get summoned a lot if I dont FD. Poor shaman cant do anything to shake the agro and it would be instant summon.<br />
<br />
Casting Sudlety does nothing for DOT agro either. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah, i've been saying this since I got dot crits, that they are way too much agro.  I remember asking in beta while talkin to the dev if dot crits would give me more agro, and they said that it shouldn't, that it should function just like DD crits... but we know that isn't true.<br />
<br />
Think I responded on another thread, if I'm running two dots on a mob and the MT dies, then I'll be one of the first summoned guaranteed.  It doesn't matter if I slow the mob or not.  When I land bane on a raid mob at 90% (with only having cast malos prior), cast VS twice and get summoned at 20% something is wrong.  I got summoned three straight fights two days ago from nothing but dot agro before the mob died (thankfully the mob died everytime before I died).  <br />
<br />
One of my beastlords uses a ED and he's an agro magnet.  I swear, him and I can draw agro from just looking at the mob wrong.  Last night, i malos and slow attempt the mob in Uqua once, and then he got stuck in the wall for about a min.  Well, as soon as we got him out, I was tanking him for the next 60%.  I didn't even move, I just sat there while everyone else around me did whatever to kill him.  <br />
<br />
I just think that dot agro in general is bad, but so is our agro on anything.  It's a running joke in my guild that I die on every pull.  Sometimes it's me, but most of the time, I can't do anythign without stealing agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too have noticed this problem but on a smaller scale (ldon).  What I am wanting to know is have any of you sent emails to SoE about this or to your shard guild leader or anybody involved with EQ in any way?  It is one thing to actively try to change things and get noticed.  It is another to compile a post of complaints and hope to get noticed.  Yes I know I will get flamed for this post but lets do something about it.  Send an email of what the problem is.  Don't complain or sound like you are crying.  State the facts.  Player x can direct damage for 3k plus and my dot only does 1k but I am the only one beat on.  Another good piece of information is the poster that talked to a gm.  It shouldnt cause more agro but it does.    Before you say they wont listen just give it a try.  What should be included in the post is  1.  The problem.  2.  Provide examples that may prove there is a problem.  3.  Give the reason why you think there should be a change.  4.  Give some of your solutions for the problem.  3 and 4 probably go together.  Writing an email or posting on a dev board saying something basic like ,Our Dots suck fix it, does nothing to help us.  Before you send the email make a copy of it and send it to everybody and your brother at EQ that it pertains to.  I could be wrong but I think a major problem with communication is the fix it sucks issue.  State fax cleary explain why and give your opinion on how or even why it should work that way 'could' help us.  Just a suggestion, flame on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I died on a VZ raid after casting Pox and BoU once each, there were at least 6 paladins chain stunning for agro but for my blistering 260 or so per tic I get to eat 2 of those nasty ass arrows back to back...dot agro is fine if you solo but I dont know alot of shaman who can solo their way into time/GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot; Casting Sudlety does nothing for DOT agro either. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree, I die about 10 seconds after those without it. =-) I even have a spell set called &quot;suicide dots&quot; that I use for Boss/Raid mobs. I simply load those and let other shaman slow/malos and what not and I suicide myself ... it's pretty fun really.  You just watch the ticks and wait to die.  For even faster death, once dots are all on, toss in a few SoT's and let the tanking begin..errrr death.<br />
<br />
I look at it this way. It is either dying on a raid on Attempting to heal the MT with my crap heals for zero 13 or 14 times. I think Death is the only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when GoD came out i saved up 30 aa's i put most of them into dot crits....<br />
<br />
<br />
SUCH A BAD IDEA, throw a bane, crit , summon, i tank for rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
i had to beg a GM to roll my character back, i usually throw bane every now and then, but with DoT crits, i flat out refuse to do it.<br />
just with the crits, i was able to pry aggro off of 2 time+ warriors.<br />
EoE has nothing on bane critting once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the rogues and wizards take bets on how many times a raid i will die.<br />
im usually the only shaman, we have a recruit now, but hes almost never on.<br />
i once, (now this is totally true) died 34 times in plane of air, just doing mini's.<br />
tirgirs + spider = no no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">rofl Razco, that is so true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I actually went 45 seconds before getting summoned by DXXT on a late night VT raid.  This was stacking Bane, BoS, BoN, Pox, Ulter, &amp; EB.  I still wonder how I went so long w/o getting aggro.<br />
<br />
I do have better luck on the slows though.  I routinely AE slow in Time 1-3 (and trash on 5), VT, PoAir, and PoE w/o to much difficulty.  Having CA3/LR5/CS3/ID2 really helps though as I botted a guildes shaman for a flag once who didnt have the def aa's.  Boy did she die fast/often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My perception is that the counters the DoTs put on the mob make the mob read a DoT as a debuff when it comes to agro, and we all know how much they like debuffs.</div></div><hr />
