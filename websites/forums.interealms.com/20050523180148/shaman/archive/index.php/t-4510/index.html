<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i finally dinged to 34 last week and got my pet.  It has made soloing much less tedious and have a lot less medding downtime.  I'm wondering what some good places to solo at 34 are?  I've been soloing the spires in SK for some pretty good exp and loot (i'm 1 yellow from 35 now) but unless I get there early they spawns are already camped.  I solo'd zelniaks in DS to actually ding to 34 so I can do that but there isn't any loot to speak of.  Any other ideas?  I was thinkin of trying tribals in DS, maybe after i ding to 35 snice i'm so close already and my spine chill spear wills tart proccing then.<br />
<br />
What are some other good solo spots for a 34/35ish shaman?  Thanks<br />
