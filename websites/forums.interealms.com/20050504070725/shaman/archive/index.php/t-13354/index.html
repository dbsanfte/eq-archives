<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">EQ Atlas was always one of my favorite EQ resources.  Though I&#8217;m overjoyed the site hasn&#8217;t shut down, I&#8217;m greatly saddened that it is no longer being updated.  I&#8217;ve downloaded the maps from that site for my mapping tool.  However, what I&#8217;d prefer to have is a map I can hold in my hands.  I like being able to look over a zone before I get completely lost in it.  I&#8217;ve been to a couple of zones in LoY but I can easily become lost and with all the hostile mobs I&#8217;d hate to be lost when invis dropped.  With a printable map I can have a good idea where I&#8217;m going before I get there.  Do any such maps exits?  All my searches have uncovered are maps for the mapping tool.</div></div><hr />

Click on the minimap on the right and you can print them out.  No where near the quality of eqatlas but it may serve your purpose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">www.eqmaps.com, lots of player submitted maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the links.  The Toolbox maps, as mentioned in the post, are not as nice as the maps on EQ Atlas, but they are a great help nonetheless.  It&#8217;s really nice to see how the Dulak ships are laid out.  I tried to access the maps on EQMaps, but it seems to be a pay site.  It does offer a 14 day free trial, which I may use when I have time to do some massive downloads.  *grins*  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At eqmaps.com, if you use the link on the side called &quot;Maps by zone&quot;, you can get a free maps listing, but you have to scroll through to find what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly, the maps on EQMaps are the worst part of the site.  And that's a compliment.  I've subscribed to it, and it's a great resource.  For every zone, you can find mob and loot table information, and also beastiary information.  It's not a complete compendium, but it covers a lot of area.<br />
<br />
It's prob my favorite EQ reference site.  I go to EQAtlas for the maps alone; EQPrices for item information, and EQMaps for everything else.  <br />
<br />
*duck* I go to Caster's Realms for spell information... I know it's not that great, but there are few other spell information sites out there that I can rely on.  If anyone knows a better spell info site (besides Lucy) that would be great.  It would be nice to have a site that listed every spell for each class, along with vendor/drop locations, prices, spell info/description, etc...  and was sortable and filterable.</div></div><hr />
