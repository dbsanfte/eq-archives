<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celestialknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K I am wanting to grind xp with the chance of some decent loot so I am looking at either City of Mist (Green Jaded Broadsword) or Karnors Castle in Dreadlands (Tolans armor).  As a lvl 46 ranger which zone would be the best for me. I would need to find a group once I get there. Thanks<br />
<br />
PS Just curious--Looking to make a little plat--could I solo ok in say Mistymoore and farm Fine Steel or would they wipe me out.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of the choices you listed, I would say CoM hand-down for XP. The problem is, at least on my server, CoM is usually a ghost town unless someone is raiding there - so you'd have to BYOG. You could probably solo there at 46 with good equipment, but I don't know if the downtime would make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
KC (or anything else in the LOIO-OT-DL-KC cycle) is unpalatable to me unless I have a group ready-made, just because of the huge numbers of idiots in the zone. You might be able to find a group in KC if you're really set on going, but 50+ players seem to be preferred for groups.<br />
<br />
As far as farming FS, you could do that in Mistmoore. I'd recommend Sol A though: there aren't many people there these days, and it has better FS drops IIRC.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should be able to farm MM for finesteel but will be tough to get very deep solo. I also hate DL KC. If you don't mind Fear Kiting look into going to DSP and or EW. not much for loot but better than the Idjits you will ussally find in DL KC<br />
Also KC tends to be an 50+ exclusive club on Luclin unless you are a cleric or chanter and the group is in desperate need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SolA is better than Mistmoore, mobs aren't as tough.<br />
<br />
As noted before, don't plan on getting pickup groups in CoM, and KC is full of idiots. I'd grind in DL or check out Dawnshroud Peaks or Scarlett Desert, as some other options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">don't go to KC, i hate that place, i'd suggest fear kiting griffawns in jaggedpine at your level.<br />
<br />
And Sol A is better then MM, just don't like those stupid wizzy's.</div></div><hr />
