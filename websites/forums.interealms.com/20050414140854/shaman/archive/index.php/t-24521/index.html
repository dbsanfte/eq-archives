<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumor Spiritdrifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wonder if anyone here can offer up a suggestion before I take a sledgehammer to my computer.  It all started last week, I logged on to EQ to kill a few gobbies in veksar and bam.  My screen froze and I gotthe pop up from EQ saying my client has crashed blah blah.  So I restarted and figured it was just a fluke.  Well it must have been a whole school of fluke because I have been unable to keep a char logged on for more then 7 mins since then.  <br />
<br />
I first did the easy stuff - I ran a full scan with my av software and with spybot.  Then I ran disk clean up and defrag.<br />
<br />
Then figuring it must be a driver issue, I went back to the previous vid driver from 61.77 to I think it was .76.<br />
<br />
After that failed me I burned memtest86+ to a cd and ran a test.  Lo and Behold.  Memtest found over 4 million errors before it was down with test number 4.<br />
<br />
So I went on newegg and bought a gig of matched corsiar xms 3200ll memory.<br />
<br />
Installed the memory and the problem is still there.  My next train of thought was maybe my vid card has just had it.  I was using a Geforce 3.  So just to test this I went out and bought a Geforce FX 5500(I know its not a great card but it was cheap and dx9 compliant).  Well this didnt work either.<br />
<br />
So now I re-formatted my HD and tried again.  Still no Luck.  I have tried every driver from the 56.72 - 61.77 and it still happens.  I dont know what it could be.<br />
<br />
The comp is not over heating its water cooled and stays at 27C when playing EQ.  I have replaced every single component in the computer over the past few months except for the HD though I don't think its that because I would imagine that these things would happen outside of EQ also.<br />
<br />
Here are my comp specs incase it helps.<br />
<br />
ASUS A7n8x-e Deluxe Mobo<br />
AMD 3200XP Barton CPU<br />
1 Gig Corsair XMS 3200LLPT matched memory<br />
Geforce FX5500 vid card<br />
Koolance Water cooled Case(water blocks on CPU and Vid card only)<br />
HD is a 80gig drive dont remember the brand, its nothing special not even a 7200rpm drive.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long winded post, if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear em, I am at a total loss at this point.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Maybe motherboard if your running your network from it.<br />
your ehthernet card if yoru running from that.<br />
<br />
At one point i had made changes to my sounds realism and effects and i got those crash's constantly so i just turned all sound off.<br />
<br />
run a complete file check as well on eq to see whats up.<br />
<br />
send me a copy of that mem scan :P j/k!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just to rule out the hard drive possibility, I'd boot in to DOS (use an old Win 98 CD if you have one, or search the net if you don't) and run chkdsk.  You can run scandisk from inside windows, but chkdsk sometimes catches stuff scandisk misses.</div></div><hr />

You may want to post this in general also.  Board nazis here arent too hardcore (I dont think).<br />
<br />
I had some issues a while back and thanks to the peeps on this board, I fixed my problem.</div></div><hr />
