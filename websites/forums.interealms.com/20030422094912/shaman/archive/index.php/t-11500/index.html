<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i need money<br />
can a lvl 59 shm solo here?<br />
no epic..no JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah. i remember being here at low 50s and being impressed and scared and stuff. then i went back at 60 and i was amazed how easy it was..i tore the place up. that was before i got torpor, and i don't have malo either. you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd give PoG a try first, the money is 10x better than Seb. Without JBB and epic you'll really need a horse in PoG. It's a total breeze at 61 with pet and horse and I'd imagine 59 would work albeit at a slower pace.<br />
<br />
On my server the pyra/necro camp in OS is almost always taken and that's where the good gems drop. Gangerous camp drops decent gems too and iksar blood which is easy at 61 but probably a bit risky at 59. ZI mobs are soloable but not that great for money and peeps are always killing those mobs on their way to other camps so it can be very slow going. Overall 60 is a much better level for soloing seb because you can single pull much more reliablly. 61 is ideal  because of the new pet and replenishment give you the power to choose dhall/pyra/gangerous and do them quite easily.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd try PoG first. 95% of the mobs there drop a gem worth 120pp+. They hit weak but average about 10khp so they are lengthy fights.<br />
<br />
There's also Felwithe, guards there drop swords worth 20pp every time but they are annoying because of their high MR making landing malosini and slow a pain sometimes but overall it's easy at 59.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
