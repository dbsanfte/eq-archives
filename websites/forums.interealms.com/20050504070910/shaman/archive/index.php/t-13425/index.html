<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i am a 54 almost 55 shaman on the good team on sullon zek... which means exp loss during death involving pvp when within 5 levels.  Now most people AA on sullon zek at 60 it seems... but if i level to 55 i am going to lose a great load of exp dying to these lvl 60 AA'ers... My question is &quot;Is 55-60 worth it to try to level through to get spells for pvp?&quot;  <br />
<br />
55 i can't see anything worth leveling for pvp, 56 Bane of Nife seems great, 57 i am assuming malosini is going to be resisted anyways so why bother til malo.  58 is crap for pvp.  59 Pox will be great and finally 60 our crowning achievement malos/torpor etc.<br />
<br />
I was going to try to get enough AA's for rabid bear if thats worth it for pvp and then save up some for Spirit Call... maybe its just me... i'm used to playing melee's in pvp but did shaman's get the short end of the stick pvp?  I know pre 49 for sure we did... once i got plague and ebolt i've been able to handle my own and them some but as i gain in levels it seems harder and harder to kill people my own level... help please.<br />
<br />
I open with insidious decay, then plague then try ebolt then if both land root til it sticks and then nuke at the end.  Any advice on what i should be doing differently?  I know i should debuff at the beginning before doing alll this...  If i had enough time to prepare then i have dogdog out he puts in some dps but not nearly enough =T</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use the dispell line of spells, that always works great for me. Otherwise I used a similar tatcic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dump dispells and go for the malo line of spells.  Once thats on will attempt to root and dot with poison.  Blind is also usefull as it will cause most people to run allowing you to mem new spells etc.  Another option is to slow people and melle them with a 2hd blunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play on RZ since I started eq in beta 1998.<br />
PvP has changed a lot, to the good and bad so at the moment I would suggest, that you level to 60 asap as the key spell for shaman PvP is MALO. I don't know how it is on SZ but on RZ without malo you won't land any dots, even after insid decay sometimes.<br />
<br />
Rabuid bear is not really an option, as you miss too much in melee. Although with my bone of bertoxx a caster MIGHT get in trouble, yet not reliable.<br />
<br />
For PvP get Radiant cure AA, it owns for removing dots, tash, malo. lvl 2 is even better for multiple cures. 3min refresh, short cast. Spirit call is good to annoy people in pvp but long cast and paralying earth is resisted too much.<br />
<br />
PvP pretty much goes like this with decent resist gear:<br />
<br />
dispel / dispel / malo / insid decay / dr dots, pr dots blind root if ya can or AE poison DD's.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yes it is worth to level to 60, shamans are inredibly more powerful.<br />
<br />
Malo / Torpor alone is worth it. Have phun!<br />
<br />
Since MB and ranger arrows are nerfed kinda, the only thing that should be able to kill us shamans are  SKs with disc HT. Other than that we can outheal any class one on one:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get 60 asap so you have malo.  Then you can switch to using PR dots as your primary offense.<br />
<br />
DR dots suck in pvp - damage too slow, you need to separately debuff DR (time/spellslot).<br />
<br />
At level 55 your biggest weapon is plague.  Plague is a laughable spell when fighting some of the regen rates you'll find on 60+ players - and 1 healer of any kind makes killing impossible.  60 with bane of nife and malo you're in alot better shape (65 with malo(s) + bon/son + bos = booya).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In support of levelling is also the bonus 5'ish to every resist check for each level you gain. At 55 the lvl60's spells are going to land alot easier than if you were similar level, aa's or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, Level isn't a huge thing on Rallos (all PvP is with in 5 levels)  And on Sullon you can gear up.  Here's things to think about:<br />
<br />
55 is new pet, but puts you in xp range of level 60's  and since corpse camping is legal, I'd reccomend staying out of there, the only AA's you need in 55 immidiatly are MC3 for Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Malo is HUGE for PvP, but make sure you have the spell before going all the way to 60,  Get a Journeyman's Walking Stick for tash, and a Di'Zok Oracle Shileah for Togors, and Epic for DoT, and you'll be a mana free machine.  Procs have a very low resist rate on PCs, So you can Tash with the stick, then slap a malaisment and it will be similar to Malo.<br />
<br />
Shaman own Melee in pvp..  Slow, Tank, Pet and DoTs... Disease of course works best, and remember that shaman are all about longevity, not the quick kill.  invest some time into getting snare items, and those melee items to further aid that.  Magic Resist is key against pure melee, as its stops snare, which is the only thing to be really afraid off.  Stoic will be your best freind, *most slowed melee can't deal over 26dps except a ranger, or a really good strafeing rogue, use mouse look to follow a rogue and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Rallos PvP isn't xp loss, but if it were I'd be at a lower level I can promise ya (well maybe not if I get xp for killing people) but as far as AA<br />
s go...  Canni5 is amazing, it lets you keep going and going and going, energizer bunny style, but then, Spirit Call, VP, and RC.  All three of those are amazing in PvP, RC will cure DoTs ect that are on you, VP will push a melee back and root him... and its Disease based /drool, and SC3 is like 5K melee (unresistable) damage from multiple pets (meaning harder to kill them off) personally, I would stay 54, get the AA<br />
s for MC3, Mass Canni, SC1 VP1 and RC1, and then power to 61.  You will then be a pvp machine.  58 pet, 3 dogdogdogs,  push back (interrupts) root, and disease cure, infinite mana with Canni 5 and torpor, and Malo.  Rabid bear is only good if you can get them to stay still, and silly people don't wanna stay still.<br />
<br />
on a side note, Spirit of Cheetah (non-pvp don't tend to know this) makes snare bounce on you.  and IIRC will cancel out snare if you're snared, and is the fastest movement in the game.  Scale of Wolf is nearly selo's speed, and only turns off if you attack, cast a spell or are hit by a spell.  it no longer breaks if you are hit by melee.  Making them better on a pvp server than a blubie server.  And while resists are nice, hitpoints are everything.  Lure's cancel out the need for most resists other than magic.  IoS + Talis + STA, is waaaaay better than HoS + STA, cause it takes more annuls to get rid of the buffs<br />
<br />
Other proc sticks to watch out for: (and get dex to 230+ with IoS/HoS and Rage)<br />
Mortificator Spear, 7/22 procs stun (drops in Kaesora)<br />
Mortificator Staff procs Mana Sink  (drops in Rathe Mountains)<br />
Soulsipper 15/23 procs a 75 point life tap (drops in Dulak)<br />
Dathor Great Hammer (from UP) rediculous high damage, 75 I think, great for jousting<br />
if you know anyone who can take you to VP, there's a 13/23 spear that procs ensnare<br />
Blight, Hammer of the Scourge, procs.. scourge<br />
Seventh Cudgel procs Tainted Breath and is 12/26</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow thanks guys... i am probably going to get my AA's first and then level to 60 due to the fact that there are exactly like 2 places for a lvl 60 good shaman to level without having to fight off evils/newts every hour or so.  And hopefully over the summer sometime i can just powerlevel to 61.  I am using the soulstripper which is awesome with HoS but i definitely will look out for the journeyman's walking stick.  What is IIRC? is that lvl 2 RC? For malo and torpor i'm going to have to go to Legends and get it there... the only copies i ever see for sale are those from legends and they are extremely expensive.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot guys for the info =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can get you Malo and Torpor if the price is right. ;) Oh yeah, Hammer of Spiritcalling is pretty good in PvP as well. I want to try out soulstripper though, so if you want to trade it for my hammer let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe.. price is never right on Sullon Zek.. i'd rather go to Legends and get it there for half as much... i have to pick up a Windblade or two anyways and some cultural armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Malo alone is worth leveling to 60th for you. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure &lt;3 for pvp. Virulent paralysis gets resisted alot but hey its fast cast and mana free. spiritcall takes too long to cast and the dogs dont run fast enough heh.<br />
<br />
If you can slow a melee, its a win. End of story. Malo will help you do that. Casters are trickier but its hard for them(barring wiz) to outdps our healing. At least for joe average in range of 60th.(lots of aas changes this).<br />
<br />
Anyway.. yeah get 60, worth it for malo for pvp =p</div></div><hr />
