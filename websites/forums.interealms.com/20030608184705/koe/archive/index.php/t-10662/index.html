<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where: Tenebrous Mountains Vampyre Castle (loc +500, -1000)<br />
When: Monday, January 13th, 2003 starting about 1700 cst (5:00 p.m.). Later arrivals expected and welcome.<br />
What: Vampyres Galore!<br />
<br />
This is for the Loyalist Shield of Honor. A shield and back item with 50 AC, 75 HPs, and even 15 wisdom. Same thing we camped for Rizz and Tempin. The final component in the quest is from the ultimate vampyre Valdanov Zevfeer. He's Level 62 and has an insane regeneration rate. We've found that dots win the day with him. The information that only vampyre bane weapons worked on him have proven false. But, I'm gonna bring mine anyway.<br />
<br />
Valdanov will spawn when we kill Heratius Golden. Heratius Golden will spawn when he feels like it. From what I have observed and read, Heratius is a random spawn on the third floor of the castle with other winged vampyres as place holders. We typically keep the castle, and sometimes surrounding area, cleared of mobs. Although I'm not sure that it helps the spawn we want, it certainly entertains us. It also helps with Katta and Nathyn faction. Factions necessary to perform the quest, although MQ works as well.<br />
<br />
Tenebrous is listed as a 30-50 zone. So, bringing an alt would be fine, too. As long we have enough fire power to take Valdanov down.<br />
<br />
Hope to see you there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moonshae<br />
P.S&gt; Plus this is good for IF Acies and I ever tie the knot (looks over at Acies) we plan on holding it in the Catta Cathedral so if your a KoS type and want to come this is awesome faction for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll be there if I can manage to be online. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wyn Ann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Off subject but great great movie. Anyone who loves campy movies its a must see. It's sad to see Sharon Tate sorta. See it if you get a chance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Soriis should make exp there and is 54 now. I will probably switch to Nad for the main fight for dotting purposes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well though I am by no means fearless I'll bring Plop along if you need him.  Count me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well I can possibly make it late.. I work till 10pm est. and hoping I get out ontime..If ya all are still there when i get home I will swing on by..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I haven't been around lately... have been workin on rl stuff.. and in game workin on my horse lol... but I should be able to show up... hopefully this time I won't be charmed and casting malosi on everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Todd, was finishing up my cannib II quest with the Great Oowopp in TD last night, gated back to PoK, then logged. So I didn't log while in TM like I wanted which means I will be a little later than I had hoped. Will be logging on at 4:00 PST and will try to get to TM as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Woot, it was great grouping with everyone last night. I was amazing fun. Kinda chaotic though. Doesn't help that for a good 10 minutes there I was having some GUI problems. The tanks were taking down the mobs so fast that the only thing I was doing was nuking, which was fun for a change. Was able to slow the winged named vamps though once someone resist debuffed em. Good fun, can't wait to go back there again. Easy to get to with a TL to Grimling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not sure what to do about this camp. Both Maliin and I need it. Perhaps we can try a lowbie night each week until done. I'm available every night this week thru Sunday night. Wednesday has something scheduled already. What do the rest of you all think about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I will be online every Tuesday and Thursday between 4:00-7:00 PST (wife is in class at those times). Also I believe a lot of the lowbies alts are good for Monday nights, same with me, monday nights are good. Go ahead and throw something up on the younger gen page for Scheduled Monday nights and if you wanna do tuesdays and thursdays too, that's fine with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moonshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would love to join in just give me a heads up!!<br />
<br />
Moonshae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry we pulled out on yas for the raid. The next PH did pop late just as some TL'd out but it wasnt the pre-boss.<br />
<br />
It would be a great camp for 40-50s but the boss is a bastage and would need a stronger force I think. ( we had a group set to assist last night if a pop )<br />
<br />
The other 2 times I helped the camp it took as long if not longer than this one to pop the guy, once 3 hours. Thus the loweres exp during the wait would be good exp. ( but not those 6 mob pulls )  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Okay folks. Want to try this again? Say Thursday night? That's my next night off from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thrusday night is good. Eden is at school on thursday's until 6:30 PST. So I'll be on at 4:00 PST. This time I'll try to at least get a port in advance to grimling so I just have to log on and run over to the mountains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey Todd, not gonna be on this Thursday sorry, I've been sick this week and need to make up hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's fine. Looks like something else is going on Thursday night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Um what time Todd? I have to leave for work at 11pm.est.</div></div><hr />
