<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My playstyle thus far in WoW is pretty much solo unless and until my rl friends login, in which case we group up.  Every now and then I accept a group invite out of a morbid sense of curiosity.  So far I'm batting 0/7 on pickup groups.  I realize that they don't have the coordination that my crew does after playing together so long, but still.  Is basic competence asking too much?  Some classics in the last week:<br />
<br />
Classic #1: Invited to a group in Lakeshire to do some elite quest. I tag along and the warrior pulls an elite mob, then proceeds to train the group with 6 more.  I desperately try to heal 4 other people besides myself but go oom in about 15 seconds.  Then all I hear in group is &quot;heal!!!&quot; &quot;**** heal!!!&quot; etc...  After wipe I get a chance to look at group composition: warlock, warrior, warrior, warrior and me (paladin).  Erm, yeah, I'm going to main heal 4 clowns on an elite quest. /disband<br />
<br />
Classic #2: So this morning I'm doing another quest that requires me to break into a densely packed orc camp and work my way into the mine behind the camp.  Using my &quot;l33t&quot; pally skills I work my way through taking out groups of 1-3 at a time depending what spells I had up.  A group comes up behind me and invites me- like an idiot I never learn and accept.  Now, instead of simply following the path of cleared mobs to me or asking me to come back, they walk through the center of the camp and train 8 mobs onto me.  Complete wipe.  I disband, rez and continue on.  The following conversation then occurs:<br />
<br />
Clueless pickup groupee: Sorry, not sure what happened.<br />
Me: No offense, but I have yet to meet a competent pickup group.<br />
Clueless pickup groupee: We're not incompetent, we just didn't know how to avoid all the mobs in the center of the camp.<br />
<br />
They then proceeded to walk through the camp again and got owned (again).  Fortunately while they were running for the hills I was able to grab the ore node and chest the mobs were guarding, so not a total loss.<br />
<br />
After that long introduction, has anyone been in a competent pickup group?  I don't remember LOIO being this bad which is saying something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been in two pickup groups as my thief. <br />
<br />
Both were great.<br />
<br />
In one we did the Orc castle in Lakeshire and went through several areas. We all communicated well and when they found out I could sap like a beast they fell in love with me. <br />
<br />
The other was a exploratory group in stonetalon mountains with 3 others. We went through and fiddled around and had a ball.<br />
<br />
They are out there. But in both I pushed to be allowed to pull to control the flow of mobs like I always did with my shaman. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hosted a pickup group for &quot;The Lost Master&quot; quest a couple of weeks ago. I was helping my wife get the nice belt reward (sub quest: Leave by Force) and others asked for help. <br />
<br />
We cycled 8 to 10 players through the group and completed the quest one by one as needed. Anyone who didn't follow my direction got booted. End of story. I was the highest level (17 at the time, vs. lvl 18/19 furbolgs), had done the quest several times (ST1, ST2/OB, retail) so knew what needed to be done.<br />
<br />
1 death because the guy started the quest before I said 'go' (allowing group to get ready). We moved on to the next person in line. The guy came back, apologized, and got back in line. Some people actually learn from their mistakes. :) We completed his quest soon after.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups with &quot;too many chiefs&quot; are doomed to fail. You wanna join my group? You follow my lead. If I was to join yours I'd show you the same respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had mixed success Iz.  Like you, I normally team up with long-time, online gaming friends, but occasionally find myself in a position where I want to finish a quest and the gang isn't on.  In WoW, I find the group quality varies pretty widely - like EQ when you are under level 40.  At higher levels, folks presumably will be playing their characters better, but in the 20s it's a real crap shoot.<br />
<br />
My philosophy is: I get into a pickup group with the lowest of expectations, do the best I know how, and feel good if things actually work out.  Keeps my positive attitude going.<br />
<br />
The death penalty in WoW compared to some of the other games out there, make group wipes somewhat less traumatic too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is very much the case.  I have had mixed results with pickup groups.  I haven't grouped up much outside of instances - Wailing Caverns, Shadowfan - so my experience grouping is completely limited to those runs.<br />
<br />
The best groups were the ones with one person who had been in the instance a number of times, and would just clearly say: jump down here, boss mob in 5 mobs, etc., and gave clear directions.  The worst ones were with all chiefs and no indians.  (By the way, I play a priest and I'm really starting to get annoyed with the &quot;Heal mee!&quot; messages - I think I'm going to macro &quot;Hold Aggro !!&quot; back in reply -- thank heavens for Fade and PWS).<br />
<br />
I think you can pretty much tell in the first 10 minutes or so if the group knows what they're doing.</div></div><hr />

Very true, in each instance they managed to either get me killed or blow all my invul abilities while I hitch up my armor and run for the hills, all in 10 mins or less.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kill quests only, and if they do that goddamned jumping around everywhere they are booted instantly.<br />
<br />
I hate pick up groups with a passion, for every one good, mature person out there there seems to be 20 dumbasses.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's a good example, I did Gnomeregan(sp?) with 2 different groups.  In the first group, loot rules were group loot, and the members were morons.  About 2 hours in, I had looted a grand total of 3 quest drops, while of course the melee corpse whores up front had 25+.   I excused myself to go wash my hair when a blue bind-on-pickup weapon dropped and was looted by the same guy.  Constant trains and zero loot rolls as well.  <br />
<br />
The second group, after 2 hours I had most of the quests close to finished with equitable loot for everyone and a good time had by all, we ended up staying for several more hours and finishing all of the quests.  Group #1 would never have survived the first alarmbot appearance, and they were much higher level.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately unless you are lucky enough to know lots of people on your server levelling at the same pace, pickup groups are inevitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i don't do much pickup groups, i usually group with guildies or friends i know are good outside of guild, this helps cut down on the heart burn, i just recently hit 32, windfury totem and being a shaman gets me so many tell in a few moments when i say &quot;32 shaman experienced in RFK instance, seeks help&quot;<br />
<br />
i farm instances with my guild too, we are about 24 people, so we split up into squads and mow down the opposition, we make one guy the designated crap loot holder, hes usually me (because i have the best gear so far, and don't need almost anything that drops) and i sell and split so i can cover the cost of reagents and tradeskills.<br />
<br />
its good just to get a small group of people you &quot;know&quot; are good, and create a repore with them, sometime giving some random guy you grouped with a decent item you made because he needed will make you a long term buddy.<br />
<br />
and above all, avoid people who can't type english ... some people do it on purpose just to rip you off of items, and ALWAYS have the leader set loot to &quot;designated looter&quot; or &quot;NBG&quot; because some noobs will roll on anything, blues, greens anything with a cool sounding name!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've done a grand total of ONE pickup group, and although it worked out fine, it was a horrid group.  The reasons it was horrid you ask?  The mage ran around if he got aggro and ran AWAY from me trying to heal him.  The mage trained the group MULTIPLE times even after being told not to explore.<br />
<br />
Me and my friend decided that he was going to die on the final mob fight without a rez, but he SOMEHOW managed to survive thus ruining my nefarious scheme.<br />
<br />
The only reason we even succeeded is because 3 of us were really too high for the instance.  I'm just glad that a good majority of the under 40 content so far can be solo'd or duo'd with ease.<br />
<br />
My motto for other people is don't expect them to be anything other than a complete moron.  This way, I expect the worst and sometimes am pleasantly surprised.  This motto also makes me seem old and bitter, but oh well~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take the time to teach them instead of letting them be blissful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The way I have handled the few times Ive grouped is I ask as soon as I join a group if anyone in group has played EQ or a compareable game.<br />
<br />
The ones that have I send a tell to and work out the details... who will pull who is gonna heal etc... <br />
<br />
I find this works well when you have 2 or so people that all are on the same page... It seems the others that have no clue fall into line with those that know what they are talking about etc... <br />
<br />
I have found some kids that seem to just want to run around.... Ive also found that not healing them and letting them die cause of thier own stupidity works wonders in them calming down and working within the group to accomplish the instance....<br />
<br />
Once I had to send a direct tell to our tank cause he was over mining some ore when a Deviate Viper was trying to eat our Hunter who was pulling through traps.... but other than that its gone pretty smooth once you take the time to educate the masses =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">but other than that its gone pretty smooth once you take the time to educate the masses =)<br />
<br />
Well, some are educable and some are not :)<br />
<br />
I did my first instance the other night, Ragefire Chasm. We had 3 EQ players: me playing my 19 Shaman, another 65 Monk/Shaman/Necro and a Velious-era retiree, both playing Druids. We were 17-21, still learning our classes, to say nothing of other classes' abilities, and we were new to instances. Naturally, things were not perfect and we died shortly after we killed the last boss, but that was to be expected even though we were a bit high for the dungeon. We were learning, upgrading equipment, finishing quests and generally having a good time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we also had a 26 Mage along for the ride during the first half of the trip. He was not communicating, pulling random mobs even though he was not the puller, never sheeped anything and was pretty much soloing for all practical purposes. He jumped off some cliff into a boss mob's pit, died and we never heard from him again.<br />
<br />
So the lesson, as I see it, is to add the good guys to your friends list, the bad guys to the &quot;black list&quot; (not necesarily the ignore list) and try to educate people within reason but not fret over it. It's not like a wipe deep in Fear in 1999 after all :)</div></div><hr />
