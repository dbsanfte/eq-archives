<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I read the patch message and saw that more points would now be awarded for completing a Hard adventure.  This is good, the disparity between the two levels of play wasn't enough to convince even uber folks to waste their time struggling with a Hard adv when they could just blow past a Normal one with little to no risk, and often very little time.  I've done Normal adventures in under 25 minutes (so fast that the Adventure recruiter won't give us another one for like 10 minutes, so we've all had to wait until he'd give us another one).  I've never completed a Hard adventure in under 65 minutes tho.  A strong disparity on time spent, risk taken, should yield a greater reward, right?  Not to mention that the mobs hit like trucks and you need a far better balanced group to succeed.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, thoughts?  Experiences?  Oh, and someone say how many points the Hard adv's are now giving up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personal best on a normal level mission: 16 minutes (including getting the mission and zoning in)<br />
Personal best on a hard mission 49 minutes<br />
<br />
On average i finish a normal mission in 30 minutes (with a guild group that is not dps heavy)<br />
<br />
There is still no reason why one should do hard if you need the points.<br />
We can only hope the rewards make it worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hard missions do still have loot drops that are decent for non elemental equipped folks and barely better augments. Its not much, but its there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah ok, now i know that Hard missions give up 105 points per mission.  So unless it's taking you over 70 min on avg to finish a hard mission, it's actually more efficient to do them for points over Normal missions.  Since the adventure recruiters wont give you or your group a new adv for like 30-40 min after you recieve one.  And travel takes time.  So it's theoretically better to do a Hard mission now, if you have the right group to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">... if you have the right group to do so.<br />
<br />
I guess, that is the point here. Never did hard missions so far, but would you say, it is reasonable to even try with a pickup group (let's say, where you know some of the people and believe, all are doing their part)?<br />
<br />
I know, on 'normal' you could always have 1 or 2 not so experienced members with you, as long as nobody was completely screwing up, there was no problem. Would love to give it a try, any thoughts on the basic group requirements? Doable without EP- or VT-equipment?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the small derail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since the adventure recruiters wont give you or your group a new adv for like 30-40 min after you recieve one.  <br />
<br />
There is a work around for that. It works great (checked after patch) be it a little bit of work and coordination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So exactly how many points is the hard adventures giving now? the fabled 150?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So in the same patch they increase the amount of points you get by doing hard adventures but nerf the equipment you can buy with the points?<br />
<br />
None of it really affects me but does it make sense?</div></div><hr />

http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13620.topic<br />
I am thinking also that hard is not worth doing yet. Still think there should have been a normal, medium and hard level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would definitely stay away from doing a hard adventure with a pickup group... unless that pickup group happens to contain mostly uberguild players who do hard as a matter of course. You will not win on hard with pre-VT gear and a pickup group, at least, not without being incredibly lucky. <br />
<br />
I've only tried one hard adventure so far, so it might not be QUITE as bard as I think. But it's very difficult. My guild is in the &quot;some VT equipment&quot; stage (we're in there, but haven't farmed it through that many times yet). I was there with a previous guild also, so have a lot of VT gear, but a lot of us don't.  With a good group our average completion time for normal missions is typically in the 45-50 minute range, if that gives you an idea where we stand. We've occasionally been sitting waiting for the guy to be willing to give us another adventure, but not often. <br />
<br />
The hardest thing about hard, IMHO, was the pulls. It's very easy, as my bard, to split up the pulls in normal adventures into 1-2 mob pulls. It's MUCH harder in &quot;hard&quot; due to lull being critically resists frequently. And I didn't have enough FT to Fade nearly as often as needed to abort pulls. I'm prep'ing to pull hard, by boosting my CHA as much as possible, and getting all the FT I can get my hands on. I'm hoping that once I'm ready to pull it, I can take guild groups in there and win. <br />
<br />
If you are in pre-elemental gear, the mobs in hard hit too hard to take on 3+ mob pulls with any consistency. They come in unslowed and hit for 900. Unless you have multiple people who can take that beating for a while without a heal, sooner or later (probably sooner) people are going to die. Of course, since the mobs are L 64-65, the resist rates are quite high on mez/slow/etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally haven't tried a hard adventure yet but I will probably start doing more of them. With them giving 105 points on a success they are at least close to providing the same points per hour as normal if your looking just for points. If your just looking for as many points as possible I think normal with as much dps as possible is still the way to go but hard looks like it will be a reasonable option if you can handle them. I'm sure i'll keep doing normals too especially when i've got strange group make-ups. The 2 necro, sk, shaman cleric druid group ripped normal missions a new one but not sure it could handle a hard.<br />
<br />
As far as the difficulty of the missions themselves goes they sound alot like exping in the elemental planes as far as how hard the mobs hit, resists etc. Do you have to be in the elemental planes or better to handle hard? Probably not but I definitely would not do it as a pick up group unless it was all elemental planes or better players. I've been doing exp groups in the elemental planes basically since I got access. Difference is that when we first got into the elemental planes you wanted one of the top warriors in the guild as your tank and had to have a cleric to even consider it. Now that people are used to mobs hitting for that much, we've had months of farming gear and most people have picked up alot of aa's things have gotten alot easier. I've done groups in the elemental planes with pally/sk tanks, druids as healers. Heck i've even been the primary healer for hours at a time when our regular healer went ld and didn't come back. A group of friends who are used to working with each other could definitely give it a good shot and probably get some nice loot out of it especially if they are willing to take a fail to kill the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the info. Seems like a no go to me.  :( <br />
<br />
/auction WTB medium difficulty adventures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've only done one hard adventure.  We succeeded, but it was pretty close.   I would definitely not want to try it with a pickup group, though -- unless it was a really, really solid pickup group where I knew that all the players were solid.  I don't think it matters much what gear you have (as a shaman) in those adventures, but having better gear will certainly improve you're experience at least somewhat.  <br />
<br />
With the hard adventures being worth more points now, I'm inclined to give them a try more often though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anybody know how tough the hard adventures would be with a group average under 63?<br />
<br />
Just wondering how many points would be given too. On Normal the difference between a &gt;63 and &lt;63 group is huge. I can usually do the lower average with a mix matched group of friends but when doing the higher ones we always need to balance ourselves out and get very specific about who we invite.<br />
<br />
However there are times when we have a lower than 63 average with a real well balanced group and the adventures are just too easy for us. It would be good to know if the Hard Adventures are doable for us to give us more of a challenge, chance at better loot and more points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Selecting hard basically nocks the adventure up one difficulty. So if youre group has an average level below 62.5 you'd get a lvl 60 adventure normally. If you selected hard you'd get the normal level 65 dungeon which is what your looking for. When you select hard with a lvl 65 group your essecially getting a lvl 70 adventure. So your low average groups should be able to select hard to get the adventures your used to. Just make sure your sure about everyone's levels cause getting thatlvl 70 adventure is really gonna suck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Perfect, that's what I wanted to hear. Looks like I'll be giving it a shot sometime. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My question is this:<br />
<br />
Group #1 65 65 65 65 59 59 (63 avg) plays on normal getting a 65 dungeon<br />
<br />
Group #2 65 65 65 64 59 59 (62.8 avg) plays on HARD getting the same 65 dungeon<br />
<br />
Will group #2 get more points for success with the change?  Or did the change only affect 65 HARD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Normal and Hard just mean &quot;What modifier to add to the dungeon&quot;.  Nothing more.<br />
<br />
Normal is &quot;+0&quot; and Hard is &quot;+5&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you have a 62.5 avg level group, you'll do a Normal (+0) adventure of 60.   If you bump it to hard, you'll do a Hard (+5) adventure of 65 (60 +5).<br />
<br />
The &quot;HARD&quot; dungeons... are the level 70 ones.   That's what you get the 100 points for.<br />
<br />
So a level 65 adventure group, selects Hard (+5) and ends up in a level 70 dungeon.</div></div><hr />

As I understand it group 2 would normally get the lvl 65 adventure anyway (62.5 is cut off not 63) so you you selected the hard and got the lvl 70 adventure and actually beat it then yeah you would get more points. Bascially the patch msg should really read the level 70 adventure gives more points now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually the cut off is 62.99999 -- it rounds down.  I have been in a 62.86 avg group and it gave us a 60 dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, it seems to be 63, not 62.5. Done it many times now and I'm sure I've had 62.8 or so and still gotten the level 60 adventure.<br />
<br />
I'd need to do it again to confirm 100% but I'm pretty certain it is 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok after finally getting a chance to try my first hard mission my previous post seemed to be about right on. We went in with a pretty loaded group for our first try. We had me, our top warrior (1900ac 10khps), top cleric, our best bard, a good echanter and a good ranger. A bit ligher on dps than we had intended but was a very effective group. Got a slaughter mission in ruj. Took us about 1 and 15 minutes to finish it. Normal mobs seemed to be lvl 63-65 and the level 65 could hit for up 1k. They didn't seem bad for dps on the tank tho altho your milage may very depending on the tank =).<br />
<br />
We even managed to off 2 named while we where in there. Killed the first one about half way threw and got a decent cloak (13ac 70hps 90 mana some misc stats and resists and ft 2) which upgraded the clerics hiero cloak. The second named we put off a little bit till we finished the adventure and then killed him and got a shield with 30ac 100hps and some other stats and furious bash for our warrior to play with.<br />
<br />
As far as shaman side of things everything miditgated slow to some extend. Regular mobs where &quot;mostly&quot; slowed. I didn't pay attention to the named altho I think they where mostly slowed too. Resists where pretty rare altho I was malosing everything and the enchanter was tashing. Things definitely had more hps but still died quickly enough with that group. I could land bane on mesed mob right after it we started killing it and it usually died right around when bane wore off.<br />
<br />
I can already tell that hard missions are gonna be my prefered option when I can. Overall it was about 1:30 from start to finish which isn't bad compaired to normal. I can beat that pace in the right group if everyone is pushing to do the adventure as quickly as possible but thats about equal to my average normal group. I will still stick with my normal assement, any group that can handle exping in the elemental planes can handle a hard missions. For those not in elemental planes try exping on the giants in PoS or the frogs in the cave with the zone in to BoT in PoS. If you can handle those safely then you've probably got a good shot at a hard mission. (disclaimer, i haven't done either of those in ages but when pop first opened they both could hit for 800ish and where pretty hard)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't done any hard adventures since patch on last thursday, but was won 11(6 Ruj, 3 MM, 2 mira) lost 1 on hard (Ruj collection)<br />
<br />
I do this with a regular group in good tier3 gear to sol ro (no VT/emp). make up each time has been:<br />
<br />
65 Paladin (240ish aa, 8500 buffed)<br />
65 Rogue (110? aa but all damage aa)<br />
65 Enchanter (340aa)<br />
65 Cleric (110aa, max div.arb etc)<br />
65 Ranger (270 aa)<br />
65 Shaman (190aa)<br />
<br />
We hunt a lot together, work well as a team and can 'second guess' each others actions to an extent.<br />
<br />
Usually takes us 60-80mins to win a hard mode. If we get a CoD pet early on we can win in 40-60 or so, but CoD mobs are not always available, depends on map/mobs etc.<br />
<br />
Difficulty wise, i'd rate it Ruj &gt; Mira &gt; MM, although CoD pets more readily available in Ruj. Havent tried tak/guk but would imagine they are harder than the other 3 due to mob type/placement.<br />
<br />
I usually make an aa in under an hour regardless of dungeon type, but the extra points will bring it in line with the extra skill/risk required compared to farming eas..er NORMAl mode ;)<br />
<br />
We play the hard mode for fun and challenge, most of group are bored with farming points on normal difficulty. <br />
<br />
We have had probably 5 or 6 goods loots out of 13 adventures, some average crap. <br />
The most amusing was getting FOUR named on a kill em all, and having 3 NO DROP Bard Lutes drop (Lute of the Vampyre or some such from Mira). Hence we now do all hard mode for 'phat lutes'<br />
<br />
Fastest adventure was 40mins on RuJ. We got a CoD wolf 5mins in, tore through stuff fast and when we killed the 60% for named to pop he was 5 mobs away.. Closest was also Ruj assasinate. Reached the guy after 65 mins, wiped pulling him (shaman mob heh), rebuffed, Rogue failed escape pull, rebuffed rogue, took 1 min to rethink and calm down, then made final pull and kill with 1 min left ;) was a great rush..<br />
<br />
Finally, I wouldn't play hard mode with pick-up/strangers, gear dosent matter in that one badly handled named pull WILL wipe 99% of uncoordinated players ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just want adventure counts though.  So I sill do normal adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Difficulty wise, i'd rate it Ruj &gt; Mira &gt; MM, although CoD pets more readily available in Ruj.

<br />
<br />
So far I've only done Ruj missions on hard but from my missions in normal I would have thought ruj would have some things going for it as far as easy goes. The long halls in ruj for example seem perfect for pulling 1 or 2 at a time. Also the mob mix seems fairly friendly. Fairly melee heavy, not many clerics etc. Guk for example seems like it would be a nightmare with the constant rooms packed with mobs and alot more cleric/enchanter mobs. What did you see that made ruj harder than mira/mm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The other day, a group of guildies (plus a non-guild ranger) did a couple of assassinates back to back in Miragul's - the first was normal, the second hard.<br />
<br />
We were Warrior, Ranger, Shaman, Enchanter, Wizard, Cleric. All decently equipped, all but the ranger with at least some elemental gear.<br />
<br />
Both dungeons happened to have the same map, but the named spawned in slightly different places - the hard one being fractionally nearer.<br />
<br />
In comparison - as expected, the mobs in the hard one hit harder, and mitigated slow, and had lots more HP. But they were typically similarly spaced, in some cases less dense, so it wasn't fatal to rush rooms (which is what we were doing both times, not pulling).<br />
<br />
The most surprising thing to me was that the mobs in the hard one didn't really resist that much more than the normal ones - I could typically land slow before Malos in both cases, with a few resists.<br />
<br />
We had a named in the normal one, and made a slight detour to kill it. No named in the hard one.<br />
<br />
The normal one took us around 45 minutes, the hard one took us around 65 minutes.<br />
<br />
If it takes your group typically less than an hour to do a normal adventure, I'd suggest you could do a hard one. I would recommend a bard or enchanter though - 3 mobs on normal don't hurt much if loose, but on hard will easily kill.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I must say that wizard with his Eye of Zomm has been very helpful to find bosses on various adventures - much more so than rangers or druids who don't seem to know how their own tracking works. Of course a good wizard and a good ranger/druid together works best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Taraddar, go do a few mira/MM on hard, i'd estimate 20% less healing needed per adventure ie: the cleric can afk to fetch food and I can heal for 4-5 mobs a lot easier on these two than in Ruj, although our paladin is using that rune3 sword with a life tap augment (vampiric Kiss?) so doesnt need too much healing.<br />
<br />
Also, a bad pull in Mira/MM ge I find we resist a lot of what the mira/MM casters throw at us while they stop to cast; whereas a bad pull in Ruj is just lots of heavy unslowed melee all over the healers ;)<br />
<br />
 I've  also found some of the RuJ bosses (assasinate) a bit rougher than than the Mira/MM counterparts.<br />
<br />
We tend to always move-kill-move in short hops, assist range is lower in MM/Mira than RuJ and we have to waste less time on pre-targeting the busier rooms for CC/pull. We usually have ranger pulling and calling targets pre pull etc, snare gives us some time to work CC, and we regularly have 2-4 parked most of the time in any of the themes. <br />
<br />
Ranger will fetch more a lot of time in RuJ , whereas MM/Mira don't have to move so far.<br />
<br />
For Example, didnt have any raids last night, so after a quick 5-man rhag1 we did 2 hard adventures in MM.<br />
First was asssinate, we got a pet near the start, got to named after 5o mins, spent a few minutes clearing gargs from his room, then killed him in 3-4 mins with 1 add. total time including running out was 65 or so.<br />
Second was kill 58. We had a mini wipe 10mobs in but recovered and ressed in fight, pulled in back to 40mobs in 50mins everyone cranking DPS as hard as we could before we finally got to CoD pet mobs. Killed last 18 or so in 12mins.<br />
<br />
So that was 210 points in 130mins or so, add another 20mins for faffing so say 210 in 2 and half hours. As the ranger commented, we'd be pushed getting 204 points from normal in 150mins, even at 30-40min wins (usual on normal for us)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">We had a bard with us who did a good job of keeping the pulls coming steady and single/double pulls. I think we only ever got 1 3 mob pull the whole clear and that was the largest. Our tank is pretty beafy as I posted (nearly 10k hps with 1900+ac and he has the rune procing 2hder augmented with a yak stun proc) and the healing wasn't bad at all. I could have easily kept him up once things where slowed. Definitely willing to try some of the other dungeons when I get a chance we've just been raiding ele planes pretty heavy lately so its sometimes hard to put together good groups late night after raids.</div></div><hr />

I like hard adventures. Unfortunately it is hard to find a group to do them unless you live 24/7 in EQ with yer same friends. Most people like the safe and easy 51 points.</div></div><hr />
