<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Disclaimer: I know we have balance issues remaining. However, given SOE's general reluctance to address them, I'd like to ask for some changes to make the game less tedious in the meantime.)<br />
<br />
Has anyone else felt like a @#%$% buff machine lately? I swear, I'm already longing for the days of PoP, when I could just MGB Focus, throw out a few STA/CHA buffs here and there, and start raiding. Sure, we had to do Trib once in a while, but it's not like every mob had a PR/DR/prismatic/chromatic AE. Oh my, how times have changed. Now I'm piling on the buffs like a madman. My chat windows are lit up with tell spam asking for this buff or that buff. I'm alternating between buffs and shots from a bottle of JD I've been keeping handy for raid times. Raids pass a lot quicker when you're unconscious after doing 20 shots in the first 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I applaud SOE's efforts to make our buffs more relevant (even though the actual effect hasn't been proven by parse yet, I'm going to go and assume that they actually work). I was kind of hoping they would improve our existing lines, rather than unleash the buffing nightmare that we have right now. Look at what we have to keep running on 54-72 people:<br />
<br />
1) Focus for everyone.<br />
2) Spirit/Talisman of Fortitude for everyone.<br />
3) Spirit/Talisman of Sense for everyone.<br />
4) Tribunal for everyone (happens a lot with newer prismatic/chromatic AEs.)<br />
5) Spirit/Talisman of Might for all melees.<br />
6) CHA for warriors, bards, clerics.<br />
7) Ferine Avatar/Champion (let's just not even go there).<br />
<br />
That's a whole damn lot of buffs to keep active on a raid. Does any other class have to deal with this kind of horror in terms of keeping buffs active? I mean, when I die I just send a tell to a druid for 9/Steeloak and a cleric for Symbol, and I'm good to go. When someone dies and sends me a buff request, they usually say &quot;Buffs please&quot;, because it would take 15 minutes to type out all the stuff they need.<br />
<br />
Please - for the sanity of the 6 remaining shaman who still play EQ and raid, show us some mercy. Here's what I would wish for:<br />
<br />
1) Combine Focus and Spirit of Might.<br />
2) Combine Spirit of Sense and Spirit of Fortitude.<br />
3) Give FA/Champion a base duration of 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
This way, we have one offense buff, one defense buff, and one special buff that only a few get. I'd be happy if SOE would just do this and give us nothing in return - but if they feel compelled to fill up those spell slots, here are a few more things to make life less tedious:<br />
<br />
-Replace Spirit of Sense with a group 60% haste with the same base duration as Talisman of Alacrity<br />
<br />
-Replace Talisman of Sense with our new bearform! Now with a sexy new illusion!<br />
<br />
-Replace Spirit of Might with something or other. New group SoW, perhaps.  <br />
<br />
-Replace Talisman of Might with our new Malx upgrade, Malolololo (or whatever). Give it a -70 to ALL resists, 3 sec cast time, 2.25 sec recast time, 425 mana.<br />
<br />
-Spirit/Talisman of Might would be our new combined STA/aviodance buff. Call it Spirit/Talisman of the Defender.<br />
<br />
-Wunshi/Talisman of Wunshi would be the same, just add the 5% damage modifier in there.<br />
<br />
These changes would make a lot of shaman happy, I think. Yet, they wouldn't address the fundamental balance issues that seem to make SOE so nervous (healing, DPS, slow mitigation). Nothing original or scary here! What they would do is help preserve shaman sanity. Everyone wins - after all, people in mental hospitals don't pay monthly account fees.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. If SOE is unwilling to implement these changes, I hope they will at least put in a new /buffbot command, kind of like the new /melody for bards. This would allow us to put one shaman in this mode and have him autobuff everyone who sends in a tell requesting one of our 47 buffs.</div></div><hr />

Aye, it's a pity.<br />
We have only one MGB, and unlike many classes, no hastened MGB AA.<br />
<br />
I'm a shaman who loves to raid.<br />
I'm half tempted not to let anyone know I have the new OOW spells, cause I'm already nearly LD from the raid alonel, letalone every single late comer to the raid who thinks they missed the MGBs and pretains to be of more value as to who should get buffed.<br />

But the point of it, pick 1/2 buffs don't do more, gotta share the buffing love.  Oh yea, applicants make great buff bots :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I guess we can't have our cake and eat it too can we. We complain that our buffs are useless so they make them useful. Now we're stuck casting a ton of spells. Would be nice if they combined things down some. For me so far the biggest problem so far is i have group for everything but might but only have single might and sense so I have to group sta and most annoyingly group focus to buff anyone who dies, is late misses mgb what ever. Gets pretty mana intensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Champion as a group buff has a good timer now if you have scrm.  Maybe bump it up 1-2 minutes in duration.  30 minutes would be way too much.  For FA, triple the current timer.  Consolidating a few of our buffs would be the way to go, but since they gave us the ability to get more buff slots, I don't think they'll end up doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't raid regularly, and I when I do it's often in pickup raids where the majority of the other shaman seem to be ebayed and I end up practically buffing the entire raid myself, but stil ... isn't this a good thing?<br />
<br />
I mean, guilds keep how many clerics on tap for the CH chain?  And one tank isn't enough, you need an SA, a TA, extra tanks to handle the extra things that spawn in various events, etc., etc.  And heck, before they nerfed manaburn, all you really needed was a couple groups of wizards and the rest of the raid could just hang out and play gems.  So why can't guilds use 3-5 shaman?<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the issue here is more with guild leaders not understanding our class (&quot;those shaman have infinite mana&quot;) and not feeling the need to have more than one or two.  Even if you had only 3 shaman, one could MGB Focus, the 2nd Sense, and the 3rd Fortitude, then one could TGB Tribunal, the 2nd could TGB Might, and the 3rd could TGB Cha and maybe help with Tribunal.  And then they all could divide up the responsibility for FA/Champion.  Then if you had 4 shaman, even if its just a retired player bot, even Tribunal could be MGBed...<br />
<br />
I understand that a lot of people probably take pride in being the only shaman on a raid and managing to keep everyone buffed.  But unless you are in one of those guilds that tries to do everything with as few people as possible (in which case you have less people to buff), I don't think this is a realistic expectation, nor IMHO should it be.  We used to be the &quot;masters of buffing.&quot;  Now that our buffs are useful again, let's not waste time asking for more even combo buffs (after all, both focus and tribunal are already combo buffs right?), which I don't really see SoE giving to us as they already upped the buff slot limit and don't want to allow people even more buff slots, and would just lead to raids only needing one or two shaman.  Instead let's try and appreciate the fact that shaman have increased guild desireability now.<br />
<br />
I mean, multiple friends of mine in different guilds (including the 2nd best guild on the server) have been telling me that their guild needs shaman, and I don't think its because shaman are leaving the game in mass numbers over the rusty dagger issue.  For the first time in awhile I have the opportunity to join in an environment where I would actually make a useful contribution, instead of just being a backup backup slower, a third-class healer, or a 2/5 (estimate) of a wizard in damage.  IMHO, that's pretty damn cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try being the only shaman in your guild thats keyed for Time with Wunshi (not the group version, heh). <br />
<br />
Personally, I think I am going to push my guilds shaman to go back to the old days, assigned buff duties. Then one /raidsay every half hour is all I need:<br />
<br />
/rs Blazz for Wunshi, Shaman2 for Fort, Shaman3 for Might<br />
<br />
Stick that on a reply macro too, so when some joker says &quot;load me up&quot; I can spam that back :)<br />
<br />
I am also going to suggest we set up group-buffers pre-raid, so we can save our MGBs for Ancestral. If each shaman has an assigned group buff, he can run down the list without worry on times of high-death, or after an hour, or whatever. <br />
<br />
So, each shaman has an individual buff to keep memmed, and each shaman has a group buff assigned during buff-periods. I am already sick of mem-unmem-mem-unmem-mem-unmem, and I am NOT gonna keep 4 buffs up every raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Until I got the group Wunshi version I keep MGBing Fo7 and overwrite it with single Wunshi on the main tanks and offtanks. That's pretty much the end of the line I will go to.<br />
A bit off topic: Did anyone parse our new Sense buff yet? I am still wondering if it actually does something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My apologies, Grizlor. I missed your original post somehow.<br />
<br />
To address Loramin's concerns: You might feel differently if you raided on a regular basis. After a while the buff burden starts to really drag me down. It's to the point where I am starting to dread raids, simply becuase I know I'll be constantly managing the buffs of 50+ people. It isn't that bad when you're doing content your guild has already mastered. However, when you're learning new stuff, total wipes are not that uncommon and people always seem to find a way to die left and right in any case. It's all so damn tedious, and it really sucks a lot of the joy right out of the game.<br />
<br />
I am glad that we have gotten some relevant buffs. That is a good thing. But buffing isn't the same as actively playing the game. It's something you do so you can get to the good stuff - healing, debuffing, slowing, nuking, DoTing, whatever. No guild would ever recruit more shaman just for the purpose of buffing, and making our buffs hellishly annoying does nothing to increase our raid desirability.<br />
<br />
It's been almost 2 years since PoP was released, and the horror of Ferine Avatar was inflicted on the shaman class. Finally, we get a group Avatar (just need to get a decent duration slapped onto it). Now they saddle us with the burden of endless &quot;Wunshi Might Sense Fort CHA Trib please&quot; tells? The prospect is too painful to contemplate.<br />
<br />
I didn't sign up to be anyone's personal buffwhore. The way things are now, a lot of the time I feel like a squire who spends all of his time getting his lord ready to fight, but never really gets into the thick of things himself. I want to be the knight out on the field of battle, not his waterboy. <br />
<br />
I think Grizlor said it best in his earlier thread:<br />
<br />
I know some asshat enchanter or cleric trolling these boards is gonna step forward and say &quot;You made a shaman, buffing is what you do!&quot;. No, I made a shaman to be tall, cast spells, and beat sh!t to death with a huge spiked club, and if I have people harrassing me nonstop for stuff I have to keep rememmeing and casting constantly, I can't live that dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Every raid I have some variation of this typed up:<br />
<br />
Bethiana tells the raid, 'If you are a tank, /tell me for Focus of Wunshi. If you are not a tank and you /tell me for Focus, I will do horrible things to your reproductive organs with a wire coathanger, some superglue and an angry Puerto Rican named Fransisco. I do not care how much your ovaries or testes clench with joy to see higher numbers. It's not my problem unless you're a tank or offtank. If by some chance you do not understand this, /tell someone who cares.'<br />
<br />
I wish the other Shaman in my guild would get up off their asses and TRY to get their spells. It's annoying as hell to get emailed at work asking when you'll be home for the raid because people want the new spells. Thank God for group Stamina and Dodge, or I'd go mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i did mention that oow turn us in to buffers and nothing esle:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We usually have 3 Shamans on nightly. We all passed the first 3 70 runes to one shaman to get group Wunshi for her then it made it easier on  us. The three of us all have at least one desired groupable buff. Working out well. <br />
<br />
Just need to purchase more buff slots lol..clicking off HP buffs for resists buffs sucks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We have adopted a system of giving out 1 buff per SHM and calling that buff in our Shaman channel.  It works great for us as long as 2 or more SHM are online.  The guild is informed of what we're passing out and what we are not which is generally determined by how many SHMs are on that night.  The MT's and the TM'ers always get everything, but otherwise buffs are given out in order of who's around.  We usually end up with:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Focus<br />
2.  Stam<br />
3.  Sense/AGI<br />
4.  Might/ToT<br />
<br />
So, if only 2 shm's are on everyone but the MT/TM's can expect only Focus and Stam.<br />
<br />
If anyone dies or asks for buff we just cast our buff on that person and the other SHM see and cast their's on the same person.  The sytem works remarkably well for keeping the raid buffed quickly and efficiently.  Of course, I think we're the last guild in the game with 5 active SHM who don't 2-3-4 box during raids.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tempting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">6) CHA for warriors, bards, clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, what am I missing here, WHY give warriors or clerics CHA??  I can understand bards, but most I've asked have declined CHA because they have maxed out thier cha.<br />
<br />
Dex affects procs, and if I'm having trouble maintaining agro off that rogue that doesn't understand max melee distance I'll ask for a NDT. But unless I'm selling something I don't care if my cha is neg 1000.<br />
<br />
A VERY long time ago it was thought cha would help prevent mez/charm but I thought that idea was dispelled 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
On the buffing point, my very small guild has a normal attendance of 3-4 shaman on raids, so buffing isn't a problem, especially considering we are doing good to get 2 groups to a raid and more often then not the shaman are &quot;assigned&quot; people to spot heal to free up cleric mana.<br />
<br />
In my last guild it wasn't unusual for my shaman bot to be the only shaman on the raid, and yes, with 3-4 groups to buff it was a long, trying process, but once the buffing was done all she did was rebuffs after rez's (being bot'd and me being MT the chanters would normally slow)<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you or your guild have spoiled your members with massive buffs and you need to maybe back off to only buffing what's  needed and then as you have time/mana adding extras.  Cha and FA should be among those passed out as &quot;extras&quot; - FA the MT and puller then as time/mana allows hit other melee, but dump the extra bs and tell em they really don't NEED to use all thier buffs slots just for the sake of having something in them.  Tell that mage that &quot;has to have&quot; extra hp buffs cause they are gonna die if they get hit to quit being lazy and manage thier agro and stop ping-ponging the mob, the rogue shouldn't need all those buffs, they shouldn't be getting hit, the ranger should never get hit, he should be back shooting his bow at them....you get the picture.<br />

I find that the /afk works pretty well, but when you're the only shm OR 1 of 2 and people want multiple diff buffs it gets FRIGGING ANNOYING!

I'm the lowest SHM in the guild so my buffs dont hold over all the others...I get a tell because there are a cpl mins left..I say in /rs CLICK OFF OLD FOR NEW! ....cast MGB...10 holds out of 40....I tell them SoL ask another shm if it didnt hold, thats my solution.  /rant off.

<br />
CHA goes to warriors and clerics because it improves the odds of Divine Intervention* firing successfully.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to say &quot;people shouldn't be getting hit&quot; or &quot;people shouldn't be dying&quot;. The simple fact of the matter is that people do accidentally get aggro, and I am certain that the raid leadership would not tolerate a refusal to buff someone just because they happened to mistakenly wander into AE rampage range and die. Heck, I know I wouldn't tolerate it. Part of our job is to keep people buffed - and I don't view this as spoiling people.<br />
<br />
However, other classes have this job, too. After you die on a raid, you probably send a chanter a tell for VoQ/haste, a cleric for Symbol, a druid for 9, etc. That's fine, and 1-2 buffs represents a normal buffing load - not too distracting or annoying. It's only the shaman who gets asked for 4-6 buffs by everyone. Why should this be the case?<br />
<br />
The shaman in my guild already split up the buffs as suggested, but that still doesn't explain why we are the only class stuck with such a massive amount of buffing. Buffing is not an exciting gameplay dynamic. It's something you do so you can get to the fun, much like waiting in line for a ride at an amusement part.<br />
<br />
*Gotta keep up with those sneaky clerics! I forgot about the change to TotD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Dont you feel a sense of pride knowing that you can keep an entire raid buffed single handed while your also doing all the other raid stuff...  granted I have only been on a couple raids  but Im usually the only shaman and had to buff the whole raid with the single target focus because I didnt have Fo7 and no MGB AA all manually for 20 or so people just get there early..  also we ask for better buffs they give us better buffs and now we tell them its to many for us uber mana loving shaman at least this gives us a reason to click canni...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just a FYI, cha doesn't help clerics any more.  When touch of the divine was refunded to clerics (same time as the wards), it was changed so the cleric only got a free rez when they died and they kept their buffs.  But it was also changed so that the only relevant modifyer for it going off is the number of ranks in ToD, not based on Cha like DI is.

<br />
<br />
Because shaman ARE the buffing class, that and slow is our job, would you rather turn that over to Bsts and let them get the groups because they have better dps then we do?? Give all our buffs to the bsts with thier dps, add a chanter's slow and cc and there's no need for a shaman in the group or even raid.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, fish or cut bait, if you don't like doing your &quot;job&quot; then play a different class.  Shaman buff and slow, that's our job on a raid or in a group.<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to not buff them or refuse to buff them, but that they'd be the last ones with extra buffs, give out the group buffs to all, then the indivual buffs as mana/time allows, holding up a raid or a group because that mage wants to see how high he can get his hp is just silly and a waste of time, especially since if he wanders into ae range (should he be wandering) or accidently gets agro he's probably gonna die with or without buffs--without focus and 4.5Khps he's gonna take 1 quad hit and die, with focus and 4.8Khps he's gonna take 1 quad hit and die--where's the difference?<br />
<br />
I do /rs Casting Focus, remove old or self buffs now cause I'm only casting it once, then I cast sta then focus, give it a couple seconds to sink in and there are still some it misses. When I get the tell saying it missed them I just /r wmp, believe me, if you let them go a fight or 2 without they will remember to click off whatever blocked it next time.  Some people only learn the hard way.  When I'm MT and someone constantly breaks mez I'll /rs The next person that breaks mez will tank the mob without heals - or /rs The next person that attacks before it's called will tank the mob without heals, I've never once had to enforce either call.  Threats make the learning curve shorter. When I was a little tank in the old days and tanking the HG's in RM I had a hot key that said &quot;If you get agro and start running around I'll chase you once, the next time I'll sit and wait for you to bring it back to me, you've had your ONCE&quot; never had to chase a caster 2 times.  The thing is, threats WORK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, we wanted more buffs that mean something, and now we got them.  I've been faced this past weeks with being the only shaman (well.. happens alot but these past two weeks especially) and it's been killing me.  Most of my major concern is because I don't have group focus yet and it pisses me off to have the people that dind't click off their self buffs and not have 7 overide it, and then with the people who already have wunshi not have it override it either.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind buffing a lot of buffs.  That's what we are.  We are buffers.  However, what's just kinda sucked for me is being the only shaman.  Personally, i think that all of your whining to other people have gotten in the way of what we are.  We are the best curing class out there, and with omens, everything that you kill has an AE or two that needs to be cured.  So, I personally think that guilds should add an extra shaman or two just for that reason.  That's why I'm pushing my guild to recruit at least another one (on top of the new recruit we just got, and the few others that are part timing it right now).</div></div><hr />

I didnt get a sense anyone is complaining about buffing a group with single target buffs. Just raids of 30+ people with single buffs. No big deal can not like every part of the job.

That new spell slot is definitely getting some heavy use that I would have never predicted before OoW and I &lt;3 my TA that much more now for freeing up another gem.  Some simplification would be nice to see in the spell lines, but it is more of an issue now because many guilds are feeling the pinch of having a REALLY small shaman core post-GoD.  A few years ago nobody would have batted an eye at our current lineup because there were more shaman around and we were able to split buff duties up.  Remember life before TGB/MGB??<br />

Don't forgot the wonder of the raid window and /rt.  I'll probably have nightmares about writing the following, but how about:<br />
<br />
/shout Send tells for STA<br />
player1 tells you, &quot;sta please&quot;<br />
player2 tells you, &quot;sta please&quot;<br />
player3 tells you, &quot;sta please&quot;<br />

/tar player3<br />
cast sta<br />
/tar player4<br />
cast sta<br />
.<br />

<br />
Buffing nowadays is really easy.  The trick is to create spellsets.  This becomes even easier if you are only designated one or maybe two buffs to cover.<br />
<br />
player1 tells you, &quot;sta please&quot;<br />
/mem buffset<br />
/rt<br />
cast sta<br />
/mem raidset<br />
<br />
My guild has one shaman per raid that is designated rez buffer and will also generally handle every other buff request as well because it's put into the raid notes.  This process became a bit annoying though when OoW came out since we all have different level buffs now, but still works pretty well if the designated shaman can stay through the whole raid.</div></div><hr />

Seriously you should have been raiding in the RoK/SoV era where group focus didn't exist, you used the single target verisons of your +stat buffs cuz the group versions were worse, (And yes lots of people wanted them cuz stats still mattered at that time) spell extension foci and AA's didn't exsist and you actually had to stock emeralds for Avatar.<br />
<br />
I was in a guild that had 2-3 Active Shaman at that time, 1 of which was the raid leader so I did a ton of buffing.<br />
<br />
these days I have both Group / Single Sense and Group / Single Fortitude and Single Wunshi. Yes I do alot more buffing that I did before OoW, but it is still not even close to what has been reqired in the past. Suck it up and do your jobs~<br />
<br />
Quit whining, even in comparison we still have it easier than it used to be, casters in general were seriously spoiled when the spell lines from SoL and PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's awesome that our buffs are once again in demand and we have regained some of the usefulness/desirablity we had previously.<br />

not quite true, 50% correct we wanted our buffs to mean something , not more ! i never wanted more buffs than we had, just what we had to do somin.<br />
<br />
on to another subject, our buffs are in demand at the moment because there are new and to be frank most poeple have no idea what they do apart from obvious ones. I will be beting that sense will soon be not bothered with as others buffs will be better, now i am not saying this will be the case , but i would give it abit longer till some bright poeple actually work out how useful some of this buffs actually are.<br />
<br />
our basic problems havent left, and it could be that once poeple get more used to it and get better gear etc etc as in pop/ldon/god we will be left behind, in all these i was in demand at the begining. However i do hope that my feeling is wrong, but really nothing has been done to correct the flaws that shaman faced in pop etc, there are still there, diguised well, but still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Astonishingly enough, I was also around and buffing raids during the SoV era. I do remember what it was like when our group stat buffs were worse than out single target ones, and having to cast Focus of Spirit single on everyone. Raids were smaller back then, at least - and /serverfilter was broken, too. The 70+ person hordes didn't show up (at least for me) until PoP.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the attitude people have that embracing tedium is a virtue. Do you wish that SOE would split up the VoQ/Clairvoyance line into a mana regen buff, a mana pool buff, a WIS buff, and an INT buff? Stuff like that does nothing to enhance gameplay. It simply makes life for the buffing classes more of a hassle. It makes every rebuff after a rez or wipe all the more painful.<br />
<br />
I've never said to myself - &quot;Man, I sure buffed the living $%#&amp; out of that raid! I rock!&quot;. Buffing is not challenging, just time-consuming and dull. The raid moments I will always consider to be great times will be when I landed a key slow to hold off a wipe (back in my ToV days), or when I held a group together through a savage AE all by myself, or when my spam healing on the MT saved the day. I loved the time when I tanked a (slowed) mob during a raid recovery, barely keeping myself alive with Torpor. I'll screenshot a round of DoT crits, or anytime when all 3 waves of a poison rain crit. These are some of my favorite raid memories, and my buff casting isn't part of a single one of them.<br />
<br />
What memories do you guys cherish?  Those fantastic MGBs? That time you kept your FA rotation going all night long?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  The shm buff line is still divided.  Essentially it's still agility, stamina, strength = The shaman version of KEI for melee.  <br />
<br />
KEI = Mana regen, Mana pool, Wis buff. or, everything a caster wants.<br />
<br />
Shaman should have:<br />
Blessing of Medu (medu=old norse for inspiration, transformation)= 7% avoidance, staminia overcap, 5% dmg mod.  or, everything a melee wants.<br />
<br />
ToT remains ToT<br />
Focus remains Focus<br />
<br />
OR, what would be a great AA for shm.. the ability to combine any two buffs into 1 buff, using the lowest buffs duration:)<br />
<br />
Click AA &quot;Infusion of Magic&quot;, Message &quot;Your next two beneficial spells cast will fuse into one&quot; , click MGB, cast FoS and Sta.</div></div><hr />

i think this would be hefty coding, too. And it is good the way it works atm cause other buffs are getting a bit stronger with every level you get so it is ok that buffs from a higher lvl shaman overwrite those of a lower lvl shaman. to define those stacking issues for every single spell would be not worth the work i think....and btw this problem won't matter in a few days anyway cause then nearly everyone is 70</div></div><hr />

Keeping a group alive during heavy AE encounters through healing and/or curing; especially, any cleric(s) that may be in group, in which if they died, could cause the fight to fail.  Sometimes, that crit heal on an RT or even MT when he/she was in the purple and perhaps saved the raid.  The killshot on a mob, especially when things are going rough and few are left alive.  And currently, rezzing the cleric that saves a bundle of time in xp groups.  That's what I get thanks for.<br />
<br />
People love our buffs.  I get told that a lot when I may buff someone in PoT/PoK.  But, many other classes buff, and they get told the same.  I really don't see us any more special than the many other classes that contribute enhancements.  Which is why I don't understand some feel that buffing is quote: Our Job .  As in, &quot;we should have many buffs and if that's the only thing we do, then you should love it.&quot;  I'm sorry, but that's a really poor use for a class.  I can find it pretty tedious with an overabundance of buffs.  It can be distracting when getting tells for &quot;must have&quot; buffs during a fight, when it's obvious you are busy trying to keep a group alive or cured.  <br />
<br />
As I've said, many other classes buff.  It's what's done for setting up before an encounter.  The real battle is... the battle, and what goes on during it, not the buffing.  A solid CH rotation (or quick heal rot.), the tank able to hold agro throughout the fight, the rangers' TS, high wizard crit nukes... that's what people see and remember and congratulate on.<br />
<br />
The shaman always had buffs from the beginning.  I know when I started back when the game came out, it was neat having high stats (for the time), but it was really the SoW, nuking, slowing and healing, that was attractive and notable, and the reason why I continued playing the shaman.  Too much buffing is why many shamans have stopped playing.  It's why so many have boxed shaman.  I believe there are just as many buff bots in my guild than main ones.  When playing becomes a job, then that's wrong.  Maybe for some it's jolly and neat, but there many better way to utilize a class.</div></div><hr />

maybe buffing is nothing special and nothing cool you remember but buffing can PREVENT the raids from getting rough. a sense buff could let the tank avoide that hit that would have killed him too! and there would not have been the need for an exceptional heal which is total luck if it goes off right in that second. everything u mentioned AND buffing is our job. if you only want to cast 1 or 2 buffs and then blast heal or nuke...play a druid<br />
<br />
<br />
and btw u mentioned buffing can be done by other classes .....slowing, healing, nuking, doting, etc can be done by other classes too so this is not realy an argument</div></div><hr />

Yes, I do tell them to click it off.  Once a minute before I rebuff, then again a few seconds prior to the MGB.  If I'm a rez buffer, many times I buff a newly rezzed just to see my spells not take hold because the Shaman in their group already did the rebuffing.<br />
<br />
Do you like this annoyance?  What's the point of opposing such a fix to something to illogical?  Just a personal peeve of mine and every other Shaman or player I've had to coordinate buffs with.<br />

Don't get me wrong, I mentioned it simply because this bug just complicates our problems having so many seperate buffs now.

What we really need is some serious Parsing of the new buffs, some hard info that proves one way or the other that they are worth casting at all. if NewUberBuff_lvl_70 is supposed to be +5% reagent conservation and it parses out at +.00005% you can tell people to either A:come here and read the parse info or B:take a flying leap off a short pier.<br />
seriously who buffs agi after reading that a 100 point boost only gives a 3% avoidance? <br />
<br />
parse this **** then decide what needs to be combined or added to the heap of useless shaman buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yep but also a lot of the lower level spells increase in duration as you get higher so this code would have to be left in place.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about spell lines, I'm talking about identical spells cast by different level players.  The level of the player casting the spell is only for one thing: overwriting a lower level players cast of the same spell, or blocking a lower level player from overwriting the higher level players cast of the same spell.  Spirit of Sense doesn't give 5% avoidance cast by a level 66 player and 7% cast by a level 70 player, for instance, it's the exact same spell, duration and all.<br />
<br />
It works with anything that has an icon.  For example, does it make sense that Turgurs cast by a level 66 player can be overwritten by a level 70, but the level 66 can't overwrite the 70?  The spell is exactly the same cast by either player - level is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Now, as far as debuffs are concerned yes that would require a slight bit of coding because there are debuffs in the game that actually do change slightly depending on level, but after 65 do not.<br />
<br />
Yep but whats this got to do with anything.<br />
Surely like i said then the fault lies with the people being buffed not with the spell itself.<br />
And if the shaman in their group already done the buffing then the fault is bad coordination between Shaman.<br />
<br />
MGB is where this issue is most annoying because you have to get everyone to click off old buffs.  The fault lies in poor design and with the new levels for players it compounds the problem.  As has been said, sure the problem goes away when everyone hits 70 but many players don't have that luxury.  I have a valid complaint about what I consider a bug so the mentality of &quot;you know about it so work around the problem&quot; isn't a fix.<br />
<br />
And i would in no way oppose it it just seems that you as a shaman are trying to blame the clueless devs at Sony for the thickheadedness of the people you buff.<br />
<br />
Sounds like somebody has a case of the &quot;thank you sir, may I have another&quot; syndrome.  I guess the thickheaded players I raid with should just go on happily clicking off every buff they have.  Otherwise, the Talisman of the Boar on them that was cast by a level 70 Shaman that has 5 minutes left will block the Talisman of the Boar I am going to MGB.</div></div><hr />

Heh nope.<br />
Do you when you MGB Focus or whatever /rs &quot;inc Focus please click off old&quot;. ?<br />
<br />
If you do then how can that be a bug that your Focus didnt overwrite their old Focus that they didnt click off.<br />

<br />
In an earlier post,&quot;Yes, I do tell them to click it off. Once a minute before I rebuff, then again a few seconds prior to the MGB.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, I didn't also mention that I say to click it off in the actual casting message too... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />

<br />
Ugh.  Ok, going to say this one last time.  You shouldn't need to click off a buff to overwrite it with the *EXACT* same buff!  As far as I'm concerned, that is a BUG.  It might be considered &quot;working as intended&quot; but it's a really bad way to make something work.  It was extremely annoying to deal with from 50-60, then from 60-65, and again from 65-70.  Myself and many others will endure the annoyance because we have to, but that doesn't mean I don't have a valid complaint.<br />
<br />
Surely its their fault it didnt stick not the spells fault.<br />
<br />
As it stands it is the players fault, but it shouldn't be required that the player have to do that for the exact same buff cast with the exact same buff extension.  Unfortunately, since this is how the game actually works, it remains the players fault when it's really a case of poor design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">maybe buffing is nothing special and nothing cool you remember but buffing can PREVENT the raids from getting rough. a sense buff could let the tank avoide that hit that would have killed him too! and there would not have been the need for an exceptional heal which is total luck if it goes off right in that second. everything u mentioned AND buffing is our job. if you only want to cast 1 or 2 buffs and then blast heal or nuke...play a druid<br />
<br />
<br />
and btw u mentioned buffing can be done by other classes .....slowing, healing, nuking, doting, etc can be done by other classes too so this is not realy an argument<br />
<br />
To the last parapraph, you totally missed the point.  While other classes can buff, there should not be one class (such as the shaman) be overloaded with so many more buffs than them.  It's spread out, until it gets to us.  <br />
<br />
My guild has had a really bad turnover rate with shamans since GoD came out.  Prime reason?  Too much buffing and not enough &quot;fun time&quot; (notably lack of creative spells and AA's with GoD) to have a moment of peace away from the &quot;I need buff_00&quot; at any given time.<br />
<br />
I like our new OoW buffs.  I keep Sense and new Stamina on me all the time.  I cast at on groups, xp or raid.  I love Spiritual Channeling.  MGB down and raid wipes?  No problem, I'll use SC.  My issue isn't buffing for the raid, it's during it.  With new people usually always showing up during a raid or a handful of people (notably pullers, but not excluding others) dying all the time for whatever reason, it's not uncommon having 3-5 different buffs asked on a whim... while others may only have one to deal with.  It can easily distract me watching my group's health or slowing mobs that need to be.  And that's not good, and that's my big beef with so much buffing responsibilities.  If you love it, then more power to you, but I'm quite positive most shamans get a bit tired of it. <br />
<br />
Finally, don't give me the &quot;go play a druid&quot; crap.  If you don't like shamans having different concerns about the class, then go read a different forum.</div></div><hr />

Personally, people not wanting my buffs has never been a problem for me. A much larger problem has been people wanting buffs from me that are useless. Buff class my ass. Buffing is not what I started my shaman to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ramhorn's problem is why my guild usually dedicates one Shaman to buffing so that we aren't all fumbling around trying to fill buff requests when there might be more important duties needed.  Although it does help that we very rarely have less than 4 or 5 Shaman on a raid :)  It might be a bit of a drag sometimes to constantly be buffing, but it's also a lot easier for the other players of the raid to just have one buff station to send a tell to.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I suggest using varying spellsets to cover buffing.  For a while I didn't want to bother with the spellsets, figuring I hadn't needed them for years why start now?  I sure wish I had started using them the second I could though they are really that useful when fine tuned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I wonder if it's the newer shamans complaining. I dunno, I remember raiding old school hate and keeping a pencil and paper by my desk that I used to keep a buff list and a stopwatch to time them all. Then if somebody died you moved them to the bottom of the list. So on and so forth. You knew exactly when all buffs were gonna drop and when you needed to refresh. With MGB and Group Buffs that rival the single targets we'll never have to go back to that. <br />
<br />
My opinion, suck it up. Love the fact that our buffs do DO something and are highly desired. I play a monk as well and I can tell when I've got the new OoW buffs up and running. It is a noticeable difference, not just a placebo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Well being a low level shaman(rerolled an ogre so only lvl 9) but a simple ldon is bit of a pain, only group buff i had at 29 was the lvl 9 group str, so casting str/sta/dex on the tankish people, and i toss dex on bst pets does become a bit of a burden, takes time and loads of mana and canni 1 is not all that hot, funny thing is after buffing before entering the adv people tend to rush in without giving me the time to get some mana back and starting an adv with 60% mana being the healer and slower sure is nasty :)<br />
<br />
I do use a drakescale belt with ee II so my buffs lasts around 41 minutes but rebuffing is needed most of the time.<br />
<br />
Guess playing a shaman is all about buffing so not going to complain all that much but i can see how buffing an entire raid over and over can get tedious, feeling this a bit on my chanter to when doing slows/haste/cc, with more then one melee mana runs out fast when rebuffing is needed, and as you know haste has a short duration at the low/mid levels (chanter is 42 so haste lasts around 16-17 mins with ee II)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">If you do then how can that be a bug that your Focus didnt overwrite their old Focus that they didnt click off.<br />
Wulf, his whole point is very simple. If a player has 1 minute left on Sense casted by a 70 shaman with 50% extension, then the MGB by the 68 won't overwrite it, despite the fact that they are IDENTICAL buffs. So now, the person who was AFK when you said &quot;MGB coming, click off old buffs&quot; has his blink in a minute, and of course, sends you a tell &quot;Hey, my Sense just faded&quot;.<br />
<br />
This isnt more than an inconvience for buffing, but in can be downright dangerous in regular play. Chanters cannot overwrite a mezz by a higher chanter, they HAVE to wait til the mob breaks. So the 70 chanters mezzes 2 mobs, then the 3rd kills him, and the 69 mezzes it, but now he is stuck. He has to wait until the 70's mezz wears off in order to re-mezz. <br />
<br />
My guess is that its coded this way because level can have an affect on how well a spell lands on a certain mob. A 55 Shaman isnt gonna land Turgurs on Fennin Ro too easily, but a 65 can. Perhaps this is similar with buffs. A 66 lvl Sense has a higher chance of being dispelled in those situations than a 70 lvl Sense. I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">i think it is more the fact that spells change with higher lvl the turgur of a lvl51 shaman lasts 5.1 minutes the turgur of a 65 and higher shaman lasts 6.5 minutes<br />
<br />
<br />
same with buffs our lvl 44 stamina buff gives 37 sta when casted by a 44 shaman but when a lvl 50 shaman casts it it gives 40 sta<br />
<br />
with other spells it is the same even if it does not work with sense that way so i think the devs defined that spells of any kind casted by a caster with a lower lvl than the one who casted before can't overwrite it. to change this they would have to define it for every spell it self and i think you can imagine how much work this would be just compare<br />
<br />
a few lines of code to define it for all spells or the same few lines of code for every spell that exists</div></div><hr />
