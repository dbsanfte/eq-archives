<br />
I cant really check alot of the site out cause its so graphic intensive, my dial up is kinda dieing on it, but im wondering if you do them all by hand then scan/photoshop them or how exactly you do them.<br />
<br />
Some good stuff there, though, good art http://www.quake3world.com/ubb/icons/icon14.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, I went through and got the portrait made and all...then I couldn't save it. Print screen doesn't work for me (windows XP...anyone know how?)<br />
I tried Alt + PrtScrn/Sys Rq various combinations...no dice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have Windows XP, and alt + print screen works fine for me :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Re kailan, yeah no shields is a bit of a shame, but regarding taking the screenshot, just printscreen alone was enough for me, pasted in to psp and went from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's kind of depressing that the only spear on there, that I saw, was the epic.  Oh well, guess this just means I need to finish mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Please be sure to check out the forums for information and assistance.  If you are looking for specific weapons simply ask on the Special Ops board and I am sure that any number of the very amazing artists will help create it. <br />
<br />
Gloriana got her custom chain quite quickly. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Sheilds and helms are items that are in the works but not yet up.  Right now its simply just the basics, if we can call all those amazing works of art basic.  I do know that some of them are already created and should be up sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I actually played with this a while ago.  The method of making 'dolls' is what I finally used to make my uber sig.<br />
<br />
But...now that they have iksar I had to try one out.  Don't I look cute as heck?   :)<br />

I might be stating the obvious (to everyone but me) here, but hitting the Print Screen button all by itself should save a copy of the screen to the clipboard.  (Nothing will happen visibly.)  Then open a graphics editor, even plain old Paint, and hit alt+v or go to Edit|Paste.  Then you can edit, save, print, etc.  That's how I've always done it, so I'm not sure what the Print Screen plus various other keys does that yours isn't doing.  It works fine on the three XP machines I've tried it on lately.</div></div><hr />
