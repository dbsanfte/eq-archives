<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi :)<br />
<br />
Ok, in the past, I haven't been using my wolf pet in dungeons because he tends to run off and will sometimes bring friends back with him who tend to hate me.<br />
<br />
It isn't an issue limited to only me.  I know SEVERAL good high level shamans who complain of this same problem.<br />
<br />
I was wondering...has anyone else had this issue with wolf pets?  If so, are you using your pet in LDON adventures?  I used it in one last night and I had to summon him to me twice...even though I made sure to wait for him as we moved.  He would just suddenly disappear.<br />
<br />
I don't have the AAs for better pet control yet...but I am wondering if that would even help.<br />
<br />
Thanks for feedback...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I may completely wrong, but I thought they changed pet aggro issues.  Meaning a pet will not pull aggro from everything around it like a player would.  Like I said, I may be completely wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless the pet is actively engaged on a mob it will not receive agro.  Your pet chasing down something will bring you just as much as agro as something you hurt running away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, as far as the title goes, yes, I've had numerous problems with pets in LDoN, primarily the Mistmoore's Crypt adventures. The pet poofs during combat. No enrage from the mob, the pet just vanishes. i know the spawned pets are supposed to do this, perhaps there's a coding bug that makes normal pets do it, as well. Also witnessed this with epic pet as a mage during beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OMG, you guys should have seen how it used to be, LOL.  Unless you have been around for a while you have no idea how tough it was with puppy when he could break mez and wandered around and agro'd everything in sight.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the traps killed puppy.  I have not seen any problems with puppy pathing and I've done 20 dungeons so far.  Kudos to Sony on pathing and making our puppy a viable part of a dungeon group!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive been hunting in MM mostly, and have to say I can see almost no problem's with Wuffy, maybe it's diffrent in some zones, who knows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use dogdog all the time in LDoN, no issues at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had 3 pets poof on me in an orc assassination adventure.  It pissed me off to no end considering I had equipped them with obsidian shards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My pets have been dying/poofing (mistmoore), but I figured I was just being lazy with enrages.  I'll keep an eye on it from now on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been using my puppy all the time in dungeons.  He isn't a great source of DPS but every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have had no issues with dog dog so far in LDON. I am still waiting for my first sight of dog dog running over the horizon like he is prone to do in other zones, but he seems to be sticking pretty close atm. Maybe he is just nervous in the new zones, and once he gets comfortable he will be back to the usual uncontrollable git.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've had no problems with Fido in LDoN.  But yeah, the enrage in MM surprised me last night.  Good thing Fido has enrage too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No problems with my pet in dungeons. The first <br />
thing I do after summoning him is &quot;/pet guard me&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've used my pet in every dungeon I've done (which is basically only the dungoens in everfrost) and I've never had a problem.  I summon, /pet guard me, /pet hold, and then I just go about my business.  I've actually been impressed over the last few months with the pet changes they've made to allows dogdog to move with me more effectively than he did before.  He always finds his way to me now when I run ahead, even in the wierdly shaped LDoN dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have used dog dog on every adventure so far with very few problems.  I have seen him ghost a few times but I have come to expect that. <br />
<br />
However, it did kind of force my hand to buck up and get the pet discipline aa (23% away now).  I have only been on one adventure where I have not been the cc.  On a 5 pull (war pulling), dog dies almost every time.  Tigs and then a little in your face slowing, VP and clicky rooting...it is tough to keep him off and still do the cc.  <br />
<br />
The only time I don't mind is when there is a vending machine (mage) in the group :p  Can usually get em back up, buffed, geared, and attacking as we progress.<br />
<br />
Edit: Normal of course.</div></div><hr />
