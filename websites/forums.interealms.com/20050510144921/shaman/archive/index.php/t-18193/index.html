<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/ooc Casting KEI near main bank for donation.<br />
Sometimes I will grab one and pay around 50pp.<br />
<br />
I have always wonder...how profitable is that? I have heard people making 10K per day...I find that kinda hard to believe. But I also heard those casino dudes are making like 100K per day...<br />
<br />
Someone in my server is doing the casino crap daily, min bet 5K max 200K. /ran 4 - 0,1,2 loose, 3,4 double the money. I never tried those but one night my friend wanted to try one with 1K just for fun and he ended up losing 20K to that guy LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow 20k?lol. I can believe the gambling ones. Lotsa people addicted to gambling and are enough people who do them regular without scamming i can see some people having problems losing money like in real life. <br />
<br />
  As for the kei i dunno how it goes anymore. Guess 10k is doable had a friend c3 some people two weeks ago and got roped into casting for awhile and made 800plat in 45 minutes. Was little busier so it varies. I cant do it myself i hate sititng in nexus or pok dealing with the rude ones. Dont take many rude even with mostly nice ones to make me irritable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">10k per day doesn't sound like much - depending on how long your day is.  If it's 1k per hour for 10 hours, I can probably do that well farming.  If it's 5k per hour for 2 hours, it's good money.<br />
<br />
As far as the casino goes, if you have 200k seed money and set your percentages right you should do well.  But use an alt created specially for that situation because you're going to piss off a large number of people with your /shout/ooc/auction spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kei used to get a lot more than it does now.  I remember payng 100 plat ever time for a hit and being insanly happy about it.  Now I dont offer more than 40 unless I send a tell directly to a chanter, and then I usually offer anything from 70 to 200, depending on my desire and how busy the enchanter is.<br />
<br />
I had an enchanter friend that had KEI back in Luclin and he could easily make 3 or 4K an hourin the Bazaar hall in Nexus.  (500ish/group with a revolving door of customers)His lifetime goal was to be an EQ millionaire, so he took a week of raiding and did only KEI for a solid week, for 5 or 6 hours a night.  He did make it, but was so burned out because of it that he never did it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since everyone pays 50pp for KEI I don't personally pay more then 10pp everytime I get the invite to the group for this buff. The chanter makes his profit from the others anyway :) <br />
<br />
And KEI only when I solo. I don't find it useful as a Shaman much in groups unless I'm the only healer which doesn't happen often att all. Most of the times I run also to a guild chanter.<br />
<br />
So as stated in the previous posts I do not think people pay more then maximum of 50pp today. It gets down to the same prices like Druids/Wizards had once for the TPs/TLs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ended up in a group with someone the other day that I couldn't see their group messages.  The rest of the group could.  I relogged, but it didn't change anything.  I figured out about then that I had put the guy on ignore because of his casino spam.  I made him relog 3 times before I told him what had happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem with this, is now EVERYONE gives 10p (not just you) and eventually its not worth the Chanter's time to offer the service. And you are right its going to be just like TLs and Ports, i.e. only available if you KNOW somebody.  <br />
<br />
I try to pay at least 25p per cast and usually more.  If everyone (or most) did that, then the chanter would make 100p per cast which he/she MIGHT find worthwhile for the effort.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
My spouse has a 65 enchanter w/ a full PoP spellbook.<br />
At various times both of us have sold clarity (KEI, VoQ) using the enchanter character to raise cash.  I generally average 1k-1500pp an hour, and because both of us are fairly well known (not necessarily popular :p ) we end up giving out alot of buffs for free to friends and acquaintances.<br />
<br />
In my experience you can make 2-3k an hour and then you will also have dry spells where you only make 200-300 in an hour.  The times you sell and your location have alot to do with it. also.<br />
<br />
Your pain threshold for dealing with idiots is also a factor.  That and the fact it kills a ton of time (which is valuable to me) is why I don't do it hardly at all anymore.  But, if I'm feeding the baby, it only takes one hand &amp; very little attention in order to do it -- farming cash myself is more fun and profitable, but it does require more of my attention.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Freckles is wise. Her experiences (congratz on the baby) are very similar to mine.<br />
<br />
These days simple KEI isn't good enough. There is &quot;extended super-duper,&quot; KEI, and for my 63 Enchanter, plain ol KEI is like the blue light special at Wal-Mart. ( A chain discount store in the United States for those not in the know).<br />
<br />
Back about a year + ago I could make 1k an hour easy in the Nexus. Of course you got stiffed once inawhile, and dealing with future guildies of said stiffer always made for a fun conversation.<br />
<br />
Selling KEI is a way to kill time. But to log in simply to pass the time by casting on others - no way. If I was waiting for a group I would read a book and <br />
<br />
/ooc &quot;Pimping KEI for donations at {insert loc}. Open trade window for invite.&quot;<br />
<br />
EDIT: Umm wanted to add I am a dude. Therefore I was talking about Frekkles experiences with KEI and not vis-a-vis having child. I can do a lot of things, but controverting known science isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">2-3k and hour is what I have heard quoted.  A lot of chanters figure out they can make more money charm farming bot/tactics named with a partner or two though.  Such tough choices for such an underpowered class ...  <br />
<br />
I still give 50pp when I can't find anyone I know to hook me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think that the enchanters arent being smart enough with the marketing of their services -- I see people yelling 200 for kei at the adventure camps -- desperate because they dont want to delay the mission to go to PoK etc.<br />
<br />
If you were to set up at the adventure camps and go camp to camp you could probably get quite a bit more than you can in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used to shell out the 50pp, now it's usually no higher than 20pp.  They can't use the &quot;I need it because I paid 35k for that spell&quot;  excuse since ever class has expensive spells now.  If I &quot;expected&quot; 50pp for a Fo7 I'd get laughed at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what they make an hour i have no idea, but with the number we have doing it, it has to be profitable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I rarely actively seek out Kei anymore but if I do, I pay by the AA title the chanter has.  I pay 20p for no title and up from there, I figure the chanter has put in time and effort to get AAs to make their product superior (ie. last longer) so I will pay more for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always donate for KEI if I'm seeking...but I only give 25-30p...sometimes a bit more if it's massively extended.  I've offered to pay 100p for KEI when there was nobody spamming it (usually several are most of the time) and I really wanted it.  I can survive without KEI but since it's so readily available I generally use it.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people either don't donate or give gimp donations which causes enchanters to not want to cast...but on the other hand many give ridiculously high donations and raise the chanter's expectations.<br />
<br />
I know a few enchanters just turning KEI age and one of em said he was making 3-7k per hour if you can believe it and had one group pay him 800p to do the whole group.  Considering the huge amounts of plats they spend on themselves and their alts compared to me I tend to believe them.  Just more proof of how Xev's economy is totally messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My 62 chanter is retired now, but I never found vending KEI worth the effort.  You have to deal with some amazingly rude people - certainly not worth the 10pp you get for an 800 mana spell cast.  When I put on LFG, I would get ten times as many tells for KEI as for groups.  Even if I told people that &quot;no, I am not casting KEI for donations atm&quot;, some people would not take no for an answer and go just harrass me until I buffed them.  Some made it to my /ignore list, but there is only space on the list for 25 names or so hehe.  There are certainly more fun ways to raise money then vending any buff.<br />
<br />
Now my chanter only comes out to buff the toons on my second account or friends.</div></div><hr />

THAT is one of the best ideas I've seen in months.  I would pay for another expansion just for that feature alone.  No more screwing around trying to find sellers in PoK, waiting for groups to fill up, etc.  Just get in, get out, and get on with it.  <br />

The odds are slanted in favor of the house, and the house has a lot of money.  The house can keep going forever, due to having so much money and there being limits on bets.  As long as the house never goes broke and the odds are in their favor, they will make money - it's a mathematical fact.<br />
<br />
So, if you have a few hundred K in the bank, you can make more plat easily by setting up a casino.  I've never done it because the idea just doesn't appeal to me, but it is a pretty sound moneymaking scheme.</div></div><hr />

Not really, no.  Casinos in RL are very closely watched by the police and the feds in the US.  I'm pretty sure you will never have a casino in RL go LD on you when it's payoff time, unless you're the mortgage company or tax collector.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh sure. Use a anon mule or alt, because you know, that you will annoy/disturb other players with your behaviour. Perfect solution ...(/sarcasm). Really Weissblau, i normally enjoy your posts, but i fail to understand that one ??<br />
<br />
I would have a ton more respect for a player, who needs money and runs a casino open, fair and NOT spamming than some greedy hiding coward (not directed at you here, Weissblau - as i don't know, if and how you casino at all).<br />
<br />
Hint: if you are acting fair and reasonable, you have no reason to hide - atleast in my book.<br />
<br />
While i am rambling, some tips for 'honest' casinos:<br />
1. Don't scam (doh).<br />
2. Be upfront with ALL of  your rules.<br />
3. Don't spam multiple channels every few seconds.<br />
4. Try to avoid crowded spots.<br />
5. Don't add to silly 'casino pro/contra'-chatter in /ooc or /shout.<br />
6. If you like and are older than 12 years, try to avoid dood speak.<br />
<br />
Casinos are not my thing, but i could atleast tolerate such people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My rant about people that say &quot;Casting (insert spell here) for donation&quot;... is the following, the definitely of the word &quot;donation&quot;...<br />
<br />
do·na·tion  n.<br />
<br />
   1. The act of giving to a fund or cause.<br />
   2. A gift or grant.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not a donation if it's required. Donations are gifts, not a requirement. Required compensation in return for an item/service is called a &quot;purchase&quot; or &quot;sale&quot;, not a &quot;donation&quot;.  I have never looked for or otherwise asked for, any sort of buff for soloing (I don't solo) or even before I go to a group. That includes KEI/VoQ, Aego/Virtue, etc. If I did ask someone if they had it, I'd be more than happy to donate some platinum for their time (which is the true definition of the meaning donation), but if someone's yelling they have it and are only casting it &quot;for donations&quot;, that is NOT the definition of the word.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I realize it's a bit off topic, but if anyone is going to use something like this to generate some platinum, then at least do it by using the proper wording.</div></div><hr />

If you can determine when he's got the bot running un-attended just run up and offer him 1 cp, he'll still invite you and cast.   We usually start advertising it in /ooc just to punish the looser :)</div></div><hr />

Yep, when they say &quot;donation&quot; they mean they expect to be paid. Thats why they say &quot;donate&quot; to be targeted. If they use that word they are setting themselves up for the less perceptive (more perceptive, depending on how you look at it  :p ) people saying they want the spell but don't choose to &quot;donate&quot;. The caster will most likely cast for them, but they won't be so inclined to help that person in the future. Nor will they be inclined to cast for &quot;donations&quot; for any length of time in the future if lots of people are stiffing them.<br />
Pesonaly, I could care less how they phrase it, I will pay for it if it is available and I want it. I've done customer service in real life and I know how stupid people can be. The casters time has a certain value, and I benifit from the spell, so why not &quot;donate?&quot;<br />
On the flip side, I've noticed that the casters I used get KEI from who were red to me are now mostly blue. It seems that the better chanters can find other things to do with their time.</div></div><hr />

We had a bot like this on the Rathe, he would invite on anything opening the trade window (fishing grubs, 1cp, rusty dagger, you name it).  Word spread of course, so he adjusted his macro to only invite and cast on a 10pp+ payment.  <br />

I was tired, but a Cleric friend happened to /ooc for KEI as I zoned in to PoK...so I invited him and announced (as no one was casting it then) that I had 4 open slots. They filled quick. <br />
<br />
Then, a had a few stragglers.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later, I had 260pp in donations. (Yes, donations. No money was mentioned and in future it will be &quot;Donations accepted but not required&quot;)<br />
<br />
I had no one looking when I camped, so I would have been 'dry' for a few minutes had I been doing it for profit.<br />
<br />
In future, I will probably set up shop once in a while...if no one else is casting and there is a demand. I may even spend one full day at it once I get the SCRM AA's together. I will NOT make a habit of it.<br />
<br />
I probably will check at the various camps between missions, though. Or check in zones when I go to some distant zone that people typically hate to travel back and forth from.</div></div><hr />

I used to like it when enchanters actually priced their kei but did it sort of level based (45-49 25pp... 50-55 50pp, stuff like that...)<br />
<br />
Basically my point... if people keep stiffing enchanters, they're going to come to the conclusion that they could get more plat over time faster elsewhere killing stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">50-100 a player and 5 in a group. That adds up very fast. i would say its much more then 10k in 10 hours, thats not very much at all. I mean you can pull 1k a hour in seb without even trying and thats truly low end money for a enchanter or shaman these days.</div></div><hr />
