<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking about firing up our EQ2 accounts in light of the recent changes.  Primarily, we're hoping that there are (or will be) ways to duo WITHOUT being tied to the tank/priest set.<br />
<br />
Basically, I was hoping for examples of good experiences people have had with (or better insight into some of the changes making possible) alternative duos with good survivability as well as kill rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly I would guess that a Healer and a Nuker might work out well with the new changes..Mage pets seem to be able to tank pretty well if you get the Adept1 and beyond versions. Im not sure about lower levels atm but I know the 34 mage I group with regularly has a pet that tanks fairly well and has a decent amt of hit points.<br />
<br />
I think the real answer is make two toons and try them =) Some odd combinations might work out better than expected. Dont limit yourself to  anything without trying it. HP/power regen from having decent food/drink makes downtime a LOT shorter even when you dont have a healer in the group so its a worthwhile investment.<br />
<br />
(I duo with a monk (RL GF) who can tank just fine but you were interested in stuff outside of the priest/tank set)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mostly I think we want to get away from the required healer - as neither of us is very interested in being stuck with that role.  And having only 4 character slots means we've already deleted as many characters as we've got active...<br />
<br />
But thanks for your throughts.  We may go with a friend's idea to try a couple of nuker-types (assuming we get around to turning the accounts back on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The enchanter/summoner are supposed to compliment each other well.  I have a duo set up like that with my husband, but we are only in the teens so I can't tell you with certainty that it really does work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The conjuror/wizard combo does very very well.  Lots of DPS, have buffs that compliment each other, have tank to take aggro.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I play a conjuror now, and duo with a wizzy friend of mine on occassion.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is me guessing, so no facts in this post.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that anything but a tank and a healer will be limiting.<br />
Options here might include paladin as both thank and healer.<br />
<br />
The reason I think it might be hard is that so many encounters are multi-mob. I would guess that the pets will only be able to hold aggro on one mob.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of duos that work very well indeed. But I think they will run into problems against the multi-mob encounters. Possibly if one of the classes is an illusionist?<br />
<br />
As long as you stick to solo mobs or single groupx2 mobs a lot of combinations would work though. I would likely avoid any melee class if you do not also have a healer. <br />
<br />
A duo that might be interesting and that likely has the capability to take on multi mob encounters would be one paladin and one DPS class. Nuker or scout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the ideas and input.  Oddly enough, at level 15, we're doing pretty well with monk/bard, believe it or not.  I think our upper limit is 4 heroic (green++) gnolls - I'm not sure if that's weak or impressive, though.  ;)  High DPS seems to be our big asset - but of course, success in the teens may or may not last through later levels...  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Finn, I'm very curious as to your success with the conjuror/wizard - we have a pair of characters with that makeup, but he's been reading a lot of griping from conjurors about their pets not being able to tank later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm currently 29, with the adept3 level 24 pet.  They have fixed the pet-dance issue, and it seems to be able to be able to tank very well for now.  I do not know what's installed later, and frankly, I'm reluctant to read more about class limitations now, and just try to enjoy the game, rather than to over-analyze everything.<br />
<br />
My only problem with the high dps wizzy is that he manages to pull aggro off the pet too easily sometimes.<br />
<br />
Come to think about it, a conjuror and rogue might be a good combo.  Because if the situation goes bad, you can always evac.<br />
