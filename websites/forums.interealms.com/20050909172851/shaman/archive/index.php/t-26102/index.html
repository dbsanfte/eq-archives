<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All pvp aiming at group/raid pvp end game, especially BG.<br />
<br />
Mid-40s atm, thinking of pushing to a lightning shaman (TM).<br />
<br />
Standard 21 Rest to NS because any healing is going to be valuable. I'd really like to get purification, but it costs too much if you include the extra 4pts cost needed on crap talents.<br />
<br />
But, for the ele tree there is no waste. <br />
<br />
30 Ele includes Lightning Mastery: 1 sec cut on lightning spells, gets synergy of lightning crits: 11% from tidal mastery and call of thunder, plus your base int bonus, plus any from gear, plus ele fury for 100% crit damage. Standard shock spell talents, plus the 2 sec nova bomb.<br />
<br />
Gives you a baseline healer, backed by the ability to crit 1/8 maybe more for 1k+ on chain light first target or 800-ish on 2 sec light bolt. Will be able to run in drop totem when needed, run out, cast heals, and be ready for a damage burst on key targets when needed.<br />
<br />
I'm interested to hear from any pvp shaman using the enhancement tree in group/raid wars how their builds work. Seems to me, the only thing i would miss is the fast ghost wolf for battleground mobility. Can't really see a shaman making much difference in group melee--too easy to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I been using a lot of enhancement, I know maybe not the most optimal at the high end and for PvP but for me it is fun. And considering that for the horde there is no other tank than warrior, it helps to be able to offtank in some capacity when needed. We have a severe lack of level 60 warriors in our guild. If we start getting a lot of warriors at 60 I may respec to a bit more healing or elemental. Right now all I have in elemental is the shock line and that ability that gives you a free cast 10% of the time. In healing I just have lowered healing wave cast time. Rest is in enhancement. It's fun for me so far. Once BGs are in will most likely switch it up and get better totems and damage spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you will listen, I will throw some stuff in here. We have 3 level 60 shaman in a small guild, I play one of em occasionaly. One is specced restore/enchance, the others are elemental with some in enchance.<br />
<br />
As far as pvp, chain lightning is a great spell, provided you have time to cast. That is usually the problem, and why so many shaman rely more on their shocks, and a insta crit earth shock is pretty devastating if you spec in the elemental tree.<br />
<br />
Restore is good, in that you get nature's swiftness, instant spell cast of any nature spell on 3 minute(?) cooldown. This includes CL and your best heal, can be a life saver and you still have your shocks as instant, just not as powerful or quick.<br />
<br />
Enchance, specced well down the line seems to be not as usefull. You can hurt casters pretty well, but against heavy armor, or rogues(which there is alot of) the last thing in the world you want is to be in close and meleeing. Shaman need to kill fast, or kite, seems to be very little middle ground. kite obviously isn't great for group pvp.<br />
<br />
As litch pointed out, enchance is good if you are tanking in pve alot, a well armored shaman, while not taking as well as a warrior, can still take a decent pounding, and rock-biter is a damned good aggro holder.<br />
<br />
Pvp I would say elemental with some in enhance is probably the most powerful build, restore more survivable but less damaging.<br />

Pallies seem to be tough for shaman in the sense that it takes a hell of alot of mana to chew through their lives, and shocks are really inneficient compared to heals.<br />

I'm only lvl 41 right now, done with the enh and ele trees, on talent 2 of the rest tree.  I play on a PvP server and I gave up on the melee heavy builds.  They are cool and really effective, but streaky as hell.  I like the durability I get with a shield and I like the fast hits from a dagger.  Because I have very little CC I can use my durability effectively in PvE as well.  At my level unbuffed I am roughly at 3100 AC, 2200 HPS and 2000 mana.  I have tanked 3 exp granting elites at once (and won ... barely).  With my potions punched up I sometimes get a little too frisky.  Still learning PvP as I came from a carebear server in EQ, but I use purge and shocks heavily.  I use grounding, tremor, earthbind often in PvP and stoneskin and searing totem often in PvE.  I never use lightning in PvP, takes too long.<br />
<br />
In group PvP, even at my level, I notice the Palliance targets the shaman first.  Whenever I enter group PvP I get lit up like a frigging x-mas tree.  I tend to shock, drop totem and run.  By bolting the fixxation on me tends to tie up the hunters and mages as they send pets/nuke/shoot me and are forced to chase me down.  While I'm doing this my horde mates tend to hit the softies. With free action potions and a 2 second GW, lesser healing wave, a nearby river (to hose mounted opponents), invis pots and using geometry I can usually survive most enemies, at least long enough to put the odds back in the favour of my horde mates.  My guildies love the tactic as it allows them to gang bang any heavy hitters.  What can I say, I'm good at running away. ;)  Warstomp and IGW are my friends.  In 1v1 I'm one of those dumbassed shaman who uses frost shock too often, but not exclusively.  Purge is always used and I use earthshock on casters and flameshock on rogues.  I always keep LS up.  When I hit 60, I'll respec to drop IGW and use improved LS.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are a lengthly fight that drain my mana, but towards the end I just take em in straight up melee with my LS up.  I only FS a pali when they try to run, I don't bother kiting.  I use ES and Flame shock more than FS on pallys.  I haven't lost to any pally who was within 8 levels of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah reason we don't use lightning is the casting time increases at hugher levels from your n00b days. It's just too damn slow in PvP unless maybe the elemental tree can get cast delay down enough on them. So what else can a Shaman do for damage? Shocks, melee, totems. Totems get wacked a lot and have a short range. Melee we crush casters but are not at powerful as straight up melee types. In group PvP I think Tarthug is right. We are targets so it's best if we are not so much offensive as either bait or support. If we get in and try and mix things up we get killed and quickly. At least that's been my experience. Best to dash in, drop some totems, and dash back out. Heal allies when needed and use frost shock and earth bind to stop runners. Drop some grounding totems to stop nasty spells and melee casters to death when appropriate. Running in and meleeing in group pvp seems so far like a quick ticket to the graveyard. But I need enhancement for PVE at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Totems get wacked a lot and have a short range. <br />
Actually, this is an advantage sometimes.  If a warrior is spending rage on my totems, he's not spending rage on me.  Earthbind is great for this being cheap and scaring people who panic at seeing a debuff up.  Too bad you can't spam it anymore.  Also many people still suck at targeting and if the time they take to target the totem and retarget you is time they are not whacking you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dueled our guild shamans a bunch, they are pretty well equipped, 4200 or so hps, 4400 mana on one, and less hps more mana on another, and number one rule, ever, is avoid totems, ignore them.<br />
<br />
If I don't close instantly and land a snare it is all over but the crying, once snared, they are generally dead. Give them a foot though, and they take a mile. I am glad I don't have to face shaman in pvp. I may not be able to kill a paladin before reinforced or hearth away, but I have time at least, shaman beat you down awfully quick.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This build is not particularly aimed at 1v1. I'm pretty comfortable that i have a fairly good chance of winning most encounters 1v1.<br />
<br />
Yeah reason we don't use lightning is the casting time increases at hugher levels from your n00b days. It's just too damn slow in PvP unless maybe the elemental tree can get cast delay down enough on them. <br />
<br />
A feature of my build was to get the 1 sec saving on lightning spell casting. Being able to cast a Chain Lightning nuke in 1.5 secs that will crit possibly 1/8 or more for 1100+ in a pvp battleground and hits 2 other targets seemed like a pretty good investment. Or if you really needed to hit the &quot;win&quot; button, you could ES, drop nova, hit NS, CL, ES again for the chance of a 5 sec spam of 2-3k damage on one target and some incidental damage on others, depending on crits.<br />
<br />
Also, in a BG or raid you may need to snipe from range sometimes, so you could use the low mana costing lightning bolt for the chance to hit a 800 crit damage nuke to soften targets up. Cast time 2 sec.<br />
<br />
Taking Lightning Mastery to get the cast time saving means you have to give up faster ghost wolf though. Assuming you go for NS, which seems too good to ignore.<br />
<br />
I just can't see any gains from the enhancement tree except flurry as a better alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At this point, I've got 16 points in elemental (all the shock stuff and clearcasting), and the rest in Enhancement.  It works ok for me, but I'd rather change my spec over to restoration with enough enhancement to get 1 second ghost wolf and the 2h axe/mace ability.  The talent from enhancement that gives you another attack is kind of ok for trying to do a fast kill on a mob.  You attack with that special attack, lightning shield (this gets 20% more damage while the debuff is up.  bonus), earth shock, melee, earth shock, and watch the mob die soon after.  Problem is, it's a HUGE drain on the mana.  I can kill something like 2 mobs in a row, then I need to drink.<br />
<br />
The best thing about enhancement, aside from 2h mace/axe is the flurry ability.  I want lots and lots of agility gear at this point.  With decent agility, you are critting very often, and every crit is a *free* 30% enhancement to your damage output for 3 swings, aside from the general defensive bonuses of high agility.<br />
<br />
I am level 56, and haven't done any raiding yet, so I don't know how necessary it'll be to go into restoration for me to be really useful.  I hold my own as it is now, but I'd rather get the benefits from restoration than most of what I get in enhancement.  My style of fighting is generally to plop down 4 totems, melee the mob to death, and tag a nearby mob dragging it into the totem range.  10% mana savings on totems would be very nice.  The bonuses to mana totems would be nice too.  Mana tide totem would be huge for group mana regen on raids.  And in instances so far, almost the only spells I cast are heals as it is, so I might as well get better more efficient heals.<br />
<br />
The only reason I don't respec my talents at this point is that every time I have to rechoose my ability to wield 2h weapons, I have to entire skillup again in that weapon.  It wasn't too bad when I changed my talents at level 30, but in the high 50s, it takes way too damn long to get my weapon skill up with slow maces and axes.  They really need to do something about that, and that if you buy higher level talent skills from trainers, and retalent, you have to buy them again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lightning bolts are great for ganking.  With lightning mastery I can get off 3 plus a shock at the end before they even hit me if they are charging me from max range.  With talents, I usually can count on at least one spell criting dealing a total of about 450+450+900+500 =  2300 damage.  If course this an ideal ganking situation. I couldnt live without 1.5 second chain lightning either.<br />
<br />
With that said, the most important skill to get in PvP is still Natures Swiftness.  I consistently beaten almost every non NS-shaman ive ever dueled while only around 50-50 against those that do.  The toughest shaman spec for a shaman to fight is probably an enhancement shaman with NS.  Haven't seen many of those though.<br />
<br />
NS is basically the only way to heal against a shaman because he will earth shock your normal heals.  Same goes for mages and counterspell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they target the Tauren first.  You're a big, fat target.<br />
<br />
In my group of 5 we have 2 shamans.  I'm a Tauren, my buddy Mikey is a Troll.  Rest of the group is Undead Priest, Undead Mage, Troll Rogue.<br />
<br />
I can usually count on getting hit first.  After a couple fights, some people will figure out who the priest and go for him,  but in the quick confusion of group PvP it's easy to just click on the big guy and attack.<br />
<br />
Litche are you Tauren as well?<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see how often Troll or Orc Shaman is targetted if there is a Tauren Hunter/Warrior/Druid in the party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think they target the Tauren first.  You're a big, fat target.<br />
My buddy who is a 60 orc shaman has the same issue.  He gets reamed first.  That said, I totally agree that noob opponents just pick out the easiest target to click on.  Basically I'm screwed on both counts.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm not fat, I'm big boned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah I'm a Tauren and I agree that is definately part of it. I mean try clicking on a gnome in a huge laggy pvp battle? Impossible sometimes. If I am in that situation I just click tab or whatever and attack whomever I get and let the chaos ensue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, tauren shammy on euro here, and although I'm PVE I still get targeted alot when the situation arises.<br />
<br />
I'm just so easy to click on, but it helps having a couple other Taurens around (warrior and hunter regularly group with me)<br />
<br />
I almost went female for the smaller size when I created my toon, but decided to reverse my old froggy shaman name from eq, makeing bullorc so it didnt make sense to be female, plus it doesn't sit well with me.<br />
<br />
As for talents, I'm only 25 atm, but I repecced already.<br />
<br />
I intially put all my points in elemental but then discovered my mana going down so fast it wasn't great. Becasue of the five second rule, I try and cast all my spells in batches, then melee for a bit while my mana regens. This makes faster cooldowns on shocks a bit less useful.<br />
<br />
I am now fully delving down the enhancement tree to parry, then probably onto restoration for NS. Perhaps for higher levels elemental will be more viable, buit for general pve grinding I find enhancement gives a constant return for the points invested in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Playing on PVE i figured when the going gets though I'm mostly a healer so I'm going to go for restoration with defensive in the second row.<br />

<br />
Yes, it's a tough choice, but i left it out for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. To get Mana Tide you need to spend 10 pts in Eventide and Impr. Mana Spring which look like a complete waste of talent points. <br />
<br />
2. In pvp the battlefront is constantly shifting. I can see it being a good downtime reducer between skirmishes or after rezzes, but there's other ways to deal with downtime (potions, food, etc).<br />
<br />
3. I'm really looking to boost my combat healing, so if i tried to get NS, purification, and mana tide it would cost 37 points in Rest, leaving only 14 pts for Enh and so no flurry or parry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The point of the mana totems and healing totems isn't for downtime.<br />
The point of them is for mid combat regneration.<br />
<br />
Mana Spring Totem rank 4:<br />
Summons a Mana Spring Totem with 5 health at the feet of the caster for 1 min that restores 10 mana every 2 seconds to group members within 20 yards.  205 mana cost<br />
<br />
Apply 10% mana savings on totems.  Mana cost is 185.<br />
Apply 15% extended duration from Eventide.  Duration is 1.15 minutes, or 69 seconds.<br />
Apply 25% enhancement onto the effect from Improved Mana Spring Totem.  1.25 * 10 = 12.5 mana every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
69 seconds / 2 seconds = 34.5 ticks<br />
34.5 ticks * 12.5 mana per tick = 431.25 mana regained<br />
<br />
Every person in group will regain about 430 mana every minute and a bit.<br />
The shaman casting this will regain 246 net mana himself if he's the only one benefitting.<br />
The entire group will regain about 1970 net mana every time you cast this.<br />
<br />
And then the mana tide totem.  Cost is 60 mana minus 10% making it 54 mana cost.<br />
Net gain is 960 mana per group member every 5 minutes.<br />
If you have 5 group members, that's nearly 5000 mana regained for almost free.<br />
That's huge for anyone ever going into an instance.<br />
Hell, it's big even for a quick recovery in the middle of a big pvp battle.<br />
<br />
In pvp, the enemies that go for shaman totems die.  If they go for your totems, you've already won.  If they leave your totems alone, you can probably slip this totem through and give your entire group mana back mid combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I realize the benefit. I'm just not aiming at an instance build. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way, for 10 talent points you get a benefit of 125 mana per mana using group member, and it takes slightly longer to achieve. Hardly significant. And it requires every player to stay in range.<br />
<br />
Most battles i've been in have barely stayed in the same spot for 10 secs. <br />
<br />
The mana tide totem is well worth it. At this point i'm just not prepared to sacrifice the immediate boost i can see from a 10% + heals or the melee boost from enhancement talents. <br />
<br />
When i'm on the losing end in group pvp it's because someone wasn't healed fast enough, or we didn't kill the enemy targets fast enough.</div></div><hr />
