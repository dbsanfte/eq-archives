<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious about the possibility of camping for Torpor myself, with me and and a monk in a duo group.  I understand the spell may drop from Guardian Wurms in Skyfire (can anyone confirm this first hand?)  - and it would seem like this would be the easiest mob it drops from.<br />
<br />
What level would a monk / shaman tandem need to be?  How long should we expect to camp before it drops?  How rare a drop is it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks kindly for your advice and thoughts!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Confirmed first hand: torpor did drop for me off a GW in SF.<br />
<br />
I kept a log of all GW drops we got: I was interested to see if the shaman drop rate was as bad as I had read. We killed a total of 185 GWs for 1 copy of Torpor, 2 copies of Avatar and no copies of Pox or Malo.<br />
<br />
I was able to buy Malo from my share of the proceeds from selling non-shaman spells.<br />
<br />
Most GWs we got by killing the 4-5 EWs in the tunnel to VP.  Doing that you will see on average 2 GWs per hour.  Respawn time on the EWs is 24 mins.</div></div><hr />

btw...we cleared the guards in the Emp room...it makes the fight with the Emp trivial !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 58 with the shaman for kraggs and 55+ or so with the monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm so far, about 4 x Talendor, 1  x Gore, 12 x Emp, 114 guardian wurms.<br />
Seen malo, 2 pox and avatar and talisman of the raptor drop from a Guardian wurm.<br />
Talendor dropped my own Malo and Avatar.<br />
Emp dropped Talisman of Raptor. I think Emp is more likely to drop spells than guardian wurms however hes a rare pop. But in crypt you can make some  money there, I've seen hiero cloak and JBB drop while I was there. Sadly I didn't win either, however won a form of the hunter from  Emp and sold it for about 15k.<br />
If you can recruit a rogue I think you can do emp for some nice money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DandainMandragoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About 60 Gwurms killed and got Torpor and Malo from them.  Malo was from the 2nd one I ever killed and Torpor at about 30 or so.<br />
<br />
64 Pally and 62 Shammy make Gwurms look like gimps so High 50s monk and shammy should be ok...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do it with a 61 Shaman and 60th SK. It's not easy. You've got to be on the spot with malosini and turgurs. 55 monk with the nerf might be asking a bit much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've duo'ed GWs with a monk. I'd recommend a class with a few more HPs if possible. Monks lower hps leaves less room for errors when healing them. GWs can (probably won't often) do more damage than Kragg's heals in 10 seconds. <br />
<br />
I'd also recommend that you ask the monk to use a 2hb. If he/she misses the enrage message or is slow to react while dual wielding he'll be dead before you can think about healing him. Sadly I've seen the results of a monk missing a GWs enrage message. Its not pretty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i was dual-boxing i did gwurms with my 56 monk, post defense nerf also.<br />
<br />
A couple of tricks:<br />
GWurms are really slow. Root and debuff before engage.<br />
Keep chloroblast and kraggs memmed.<br />
Chain cast kraggs until you get into the rhythm.<br />
Let monk and pet do the damage, unless everything is going too well.<br />
<br />
There's a good thread about gwurms in the spells or combat section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One thing about Emp Chottle in Seb... his guards do not assist him nor his PH. Just pull him, you will get him solo every time.<br />
<br />
As for GW, either root/debuff first is definately the smart way to go. Their melee range is huge so be careful. Once they are slowed, a 61 pet can tank them moderately well if it comes down to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One tip to not get adds during your fight in SF:<br />
<br />
pull the G.wurms across the west wall, there is a huge canyon behind this wall, with almost zero roamer (one time to time in the whole canyon).</div></div><hr />

One thing about Emp Chottle in Seb... his guards do not assist him nor his PH. Just pull him, you will get him solo every time. <br />
<br />
To add to this, kill Emp at the door closest to his spawn point and he will not attempt to gate.  Cause if he gates and summons you in, ya guards will attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If the drop rates are anything to go by, your looking at maybe anything up to 90 hours of camping to get the spell in SF.<br />
<br />
90 hours in the crypt will probably make you enough to buy malo and torpor a couple of times over. Trick would be to do it with as few people as possible. I have done it with rogue (without which you cant get in), shaman, monk and pally. You could probably do it with just the rogue, shaman and monk if you are good. Better to get a tank though.  Pallys are good cos they can stun the guardians and prevent their CH.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is the guardians in the main hall. As you wont have a mezzer, keep one rooted in the main hall and pull the other one outside and kill him out of line of sight of the one in the hall so they dont heal each other. Once you have them broken its pretty much a cakewalk. You will need a 60 though to ensure a single pull on the emperor.<br />
<br />
Im not a sham, but i won a copy of malo in the crypt. I didnt realise how important it was till i asked a few people about it, as I thought it was just another spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You will need a 60 though to ensure a single pull on the emperor. <br />
<br />
Have seen him pulled successfully with a 54 (iirc). Just can't blast him, or some other piss off everybody and their friend type spell.  I was single pulling at 58 (iirc) with a Javelin (range 205).<br />
<br />
I have NEVER seen him try and gate. I HAVE seen him waddle, walk to the hallway beyond the locked door. If you're soloing this is bad news because of said locked door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman will definitely need KM to duo a GW and even then you might be pushing it with a mid 50s tank. 58+ shaman and melee could probably do it but would be an exciting fight. Make sure your tank brings a big old 2 hander to the party. <br />
<br />
We used to do it with 3 people in the mid 50s, shaman to debuff, dot and hold agro, monk beats on 'em from behind to avoid those 530pt ripostes, cleric heals shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So, a 62 shaman and a 60 monk both with at least 18 AA should have zero probs with GWs?<br />
<br />
I had planned on twisting arms with my reg crew (64 cleric, 60 chanter, 61 wiz, 58 warrior, 58 rogue, 62 shaman) but if I can grab a monk and go...</div></div><hr />
