<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Entium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, Keepers, its a funny thing when you know your days get short, as mine are, i find myself wanting to raid more, and after conuslting with some officers, i have decided my road is raiding, or quiting. As i found myself hitting /guildremove, it was so hard hitting enter, this isnt about loot or grudges this is about whats fun for me now:( , I love so many of you, and will never forget some of the memories<br />
 <br />
To the officers and guildleaders of KoE, i give you my best wish's , and if you need my help at anytime let me know<br />
 <br />
To the members of KoE,  *hugs* a wise man once said, Great Minds have always encountered violent interactions with mediocre minds. I want you to keep your kool when things get tough. and remember your all friends. and i will always be yours even if you hate me:( <br />
