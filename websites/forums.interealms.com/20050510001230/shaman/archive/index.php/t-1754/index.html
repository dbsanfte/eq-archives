<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maladroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can any1 give me anby tips? i am going to try to semi twink him with my 40 beasti :) <br />
Any low lvl quest i should do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If ya gotta PLer .. screw the quests.... Just PL him like no tomorrow ... and be smart by doing it in a greenie(to the Beast) dungeon... <br />
<br />
My word of advice is to look forward .... like the neck quest(which religion are you?) and hunt for factions/XP ... or the cudgel quest if ya Cazic Thule and hunt in Kurns/Loio to get faction/XP... or do what others do hunt CB Orcs/EC Orcs for belts and turn into dorfs/humans for factions/xp.... Heh, do it now while you still get Xp and factions!<br />
<br />
Guess it ultimately depends on what the twink will be for... but even then time changes the mind and even that will change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.  Don't PL yourself.<br />
2.  Level in dungeons when possible and keep in mind that Gate is not always the best spell to have memmed.<br />
3.  The Kaglari mana doll quest will teach you everything you need to know about questing in the future including faction work and skill building.<br />
4.  Never forget you are a troll and anything that is smaller than you = food.  Bigger things just need to be cut up first.<br />
5.  If you mistakenly chose to worship Innoruuk you are young enough to correct that decision :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maladroit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I picked Cazic (the man) and i am in grobb, never hunted here before, where des the doll quest start? any other cool quest instead of twinking him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quest starts with Urako (sp?) in the shaman guild and I'm sure Allakazam's has a bit on it.  You will need to faction Clurg and Dooga in Oggok which is not easy, but can lead into some of the ogre quests.  <br />
<br />
If you are looking for a superior reward stop now, twink on, and faction Cabilis.  Grobb does not have what would be considered &quot;good&quot; quests for shammys, but you can learn quite a bit of the game from there.</div></div><hr />
