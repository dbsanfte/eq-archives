I two box a monk which works very well. Two months ago I would have said ranger rather than warrior because warriors are just mana sinks for healing... but with Kraggs available to you soon this would not now be an issue. Warriors have had some good recent boosts from Sony but then rangers have too.<br />
<br />
Rangers might be preferable outdoors... and outdoors is easier for 2 boxing than dungeons so I would probably take a ranger but it is really just personal preference (ie. what appeals).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mastahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have duel boxed a 55 shaman/48 ogah warrior. Lots of meat to protect ya from those mobs. Any outdoor zone is cake with a snaring weapon in offhand. Even played the lguk game with no problems. With Sup heal in my inventory, and now Chloroblast since I've dinged 55, healing the meatshield is no issue, especially once the mob is slowed.. I actually plvled this warrior from 20-48 in 5 days playing time.</div></div><hr />
