<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been seeing a lot of numbers tossed around board lately.  I think it might be helpful to provide some information about who we as shamans are so that developers might get better picture of why we feel the way we do.  Even if they never read posts, at least community might begin to understand itself better.  Sure it won't be 100% accurate since not every shaman reads the Crucible and posts here but maybe adding background to the statistics will help.<br />

Approx 300 days played<br />
Guild: Sol Invictus, The Tribunal server<br />
Raid leader<br />
Half raid/half group (raid 3x a week)<br />
Velious was by far the most fun, followed by PoP--both have raid features, but also group and solo content--spells for velious were well thought out and &lt;gasp. reasonably balanced<br />
GoD is the worst--no point for shaman, horrible story line (ie, no explanation of what to do, where to go, nor why we should be doing it), and (worst of all) someone let Rytan design shaman spells<br />
Chose shaman because it was a healing class with dps potential (and it wasn't a dr00d)<br />
Best thing about being a shaman--right now, nothing.  Previously, the ability to make any group decent, a decent group good, and a good group godly.<br />
Worst thing about being a shaman: Rytan now gets to design our spells<br />
Would I do it again: ask me again when we get the final word from SoE on shaman changes (or lack thereof)--decent chance I'll be retiring.<br />

<br />
Time played? over 200 days<br />
<br />
Guild? Affliction (www.afflictionguild.com) <br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? Raid focused, exp bores me<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? Raiding<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? Raids, I like to see big mobs die.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? Tradeskilling. Tedious and painful (baking 250, brewing 248, smithing 199, pottery 199, fletching 150, alchemy 200, tailoring 150)<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? I wanted a class who could heal and buff. SoW was also a big draw. I had no idea what slow did (or even that we got a slow). I pretty much played like a melee character for the first 30 or so levels (go go GWC!)<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Versatility.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Poor stackability on raids, powerful in long fights/weak in fast fights, other classes can perform our role and contribute more<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? Definitely, still my favorite class. I have no alts :)</div></div><hr />

No. of AAs: 42<br />
<br />
Time played: ~30 days<br />
<br />
Guild: Valiant Spirit (http://valiant-spirit.com/) <br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.): Casual<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.): My guild considers us to be &quot;Family-Raiding&quot; which means I PL lowbies, exp grind and try to get enough people online to kill some boss mob of outdated content. I've been spending more time in my server's open raid group of late and enjoying some of the PoP encounters as well.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? Velious is a blast and should become more so as my guild grows (and can kill outdated content with less people).<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? GoD, cause I paid for it and can't do very much there.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? My small group of RL friends that plays EQ was choosing classes and we needed a slower.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Versitility. I can do just about everything. Healing, buffing, slowing, Crowd Control, DPS, solo, group, raid, I can do it all.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Versitility. Just cause I can do everything doesn't mean that I'm actually good at any of it. While I can perform all the above roles, as soon as efficiency becomes an issue, I can't do any of them well enough to be considered viable. This makes me the king of old content where I can perform 2 roles at an adequete level and make room in the group for someone low to suck exp.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? Hmm... tough question. I have to admit that I'm drawn towards a beastlord or enchanter. But I realize that this is only so because they can perform many of the roles my shaman can and still provide meaningful DPS/Utility/Stackability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. of AAs? 160ish<br />
<br />
Time played? Since Kunark, about 20 hours a week on avg. I think about 150 days played<br />
<br />
Guild? Reviction, Morell Thulle<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)?  Casual raider<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)?  RaidsWhat content do you think is the most fun? Why?  Raids: PoP's RZTW, Fennin Ro, Coirnav, PoTime phases 1-3.  Regular LDoNs are great for just pure fun. Spending hours doing CRs in L Guk w/ a friend back when we were level 50ish was a lot of fun being fustrated/frightened.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why?  GoD's swarms of hard-hitting mobs that all look alike. PoE raids get kind of dull fast (again, swarms and swarms of mobs that all look alike).<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class?  As a level 6-9 ranger in Blackburrow, the shaman passing through from Everfrost were always very helpful and seemed like a cool class.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Versatility. And duoing with a warrior friend from levels 5 to 50.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman?  Not stacking on raids. The secret suspicion that the group should have taken a BL/chanter/bard instead.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why?  I'd probably go to CoH if I switched today. If I stayed with EQ, I'd probably go w/ a rogue - stacks well on raids, useful DPS  or a cleric.</div></div><hr />

Time played?  180ish days<br />
Guild?  Yes  ;) <br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)?<br />
Way more than casual, way less than power, absolutely not role<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)?<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why?<br />
I really enjoy raiding if I am the only shaman present.  I find Ssra raids fun b/c I can actually do some dps and not stare at the ceiling until the mob dies.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why?<br />
Tradeskills fo' sho'.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class?<br />
After starting with a warrior way back when and following up with a monk, I really wanted a class that was versatile, that could fill many roles in a group, that could solo if I couldn't find a group, and that could heal but still do damage and melee.  The idea of being a pigeon-holed class (like the enchanter or cleric appeared to be at that time) didn't appeal to me.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman?<br />
The versatility (provided the right content)<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman?<br />
Need a heal right now?  Don't look at me.  I have to be psychic to keep you alive.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why?<br />
At this point, no idea.  If good fixes come along, yes.  If not, maybe Beasty.  Maybe Necro.</div></div><hr />

Time played? On Snoww Around 350 days. Thief 200 other days. <br />
<br />
Guild? Drowned Legion (Family Guild I started some 3-4 years ago)<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)?Used to be Roleplaying adventurer. Now More of a casual Catalyst for xp groups of friends and Small raid leader<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? Groups and Hot box Duoing And leading Groups and small scale (Less than 12 people Raids)<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? The Adventure of a new place that isnt broken or horribly overpowered to a casual gamer. KAesora At the advent of Kunark And level 30 for me was some of the most fun in the game. And Howling stones from 50 Onward to 60. <br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? Raiding. Being a cog in the wheel Even if the most important cog is mind numbing. Anything over 24 people and the fun starts to seriously break down. And the requirement of 6+ clerics to do anything is rediculous. <br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Casue I lvoed the look, the feel the lore and the cold northern feel of Halas. And I was a warrior who somehow had the ability to speak tot he spirits and was the protector of my race. Now I depend on a god damned Wood elf or Stinking cleric to heal my breatheren.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Standing in the front lines with the Wolf spirit at my side and the words of rage on my lips smashing into the enemy with my Brothers beside me. Calling down the plauges of the natural and unnatural to choke the life from the foe of the moment while the spirits aided my comrades to fight ever onward. <br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Dps calculations and the feeling of looking to others to protect my loved ones because I can no longer do the job I was born to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? The shaman of Velious, Kunark and Old world Certainly. This new shaman. No. What use is someone who cannot protect the limited among them. As a shaman I feel as if I am a liability now to groups unless it is trivial content. The specialists are now crowding out the generalists because the margin of error requires them to succeed, and this makes for a unfun game.  I would pick a Bard. Simply because they have the generalist Vibe but are melded in such a manner to be effective.<br />

Good enough awnseres I hope..<br />

<br />
Time played? 305 played on Kaloog...120ish on old main, Kalamath.<br />
<br />
Guild? Grey Hawke, Karana<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? Power/raid - I lost role playing for the most part years ago, though I do still dabble.<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? #1 Raids #2 exp/adv grouping<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? I enjoy all the content for the most part. It all has it's ups and downs. Probably the most FUN though would be small group stuff, with close friends.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? LFG, nuff said. EQ Tradeskills are also a down point for me. They inflict great pain on people too obssesed to stop.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? In the old days, pre-kunark, we were amazingly versatile. We did so much stuff well. Plus I wanted to be a Troll.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Being versatile...we can do so many things.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Being versatile. We can do so many things, that at this stage ofthe game we dont do anything very well at all, compared to other classes.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? Start over in EQ? Never. But if I HAD to...probably warrior. As a shaman, I have to work SO hard to be useful, that my fingers are literally numb at the end of the nights raiding. I really could use a break from all this casting and constant canning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time played? EDIT: 117 days; born 11 Jan 02<br />
<br />
Guild? SoulBound of MithMarr (&quot;Family guild that likes to raid&quot;)<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? Used to be serious raider, but took a step back and transferred servers. Now casual.<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? Grouping in LDoN and 1-2 raids a week, 3-5 group raids on Vindi, Paffa, Mujaki, BoT Towers, etc.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? LDoN - because it's always a new group of people that I can show what a Shaman can do (in this setting). Example: today I was the only toon in the adventure with a mana bar.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? BoT XP grinds - same old boring crap over and over. At least with LDoN, the scenery changes (slightly).<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Started with RL friends; I decided (after a brief tour as a rogue) that in a magical world, I wanted to be magical. I decided no more non-gaters, and Shaman sounded interesting.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Complementing just about any group I join, in one way or another. I'm like 3M; I make the group do what it does better.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Not being invited to groups because of the belief in the Chealer/Tank/CC/DPS/DPS/DPS paradigm as the 'one true group makeup'. Also: Joining a group with a Cleric/Druid and a Monk/Bard... and only getting to slow.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? I would not start over again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guild?  Sol Invictus on the Tribunal (I'm Chut's personal pain in the ass.)<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)?  Oh, somewhere between Casual and Power Gamer.  Hate exp groups, can't stand being bored.  I am much happier if given a goal to work toward, even if it does involve massive amounts of rinse/repeat.<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)?  Duo's on up.  Do some farming, exping, REALLY stupid stuff, or just sit around yakking at guild or in whatever channels I happen to be in.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun?   Velious, hands down.  Kunark was fun, but there is NO WAY Kunark would support the current player base.  Velious would have a chance.  Or, I'd like to think so.<br />
<br />
Why?  That expansion was completely tuned top to bottom.  All the raid zones except ST could support multiple raids at once.  Had very nice quests to do and they could be done by anything from a single person to a full raid.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun?   LoY.  At least there is a point to GoD.  What the hell is LoY for other than spells, and bank slots?<br />
<br />
Why?  Ummmmmm......  Only reason I EVER went to LoY was get stuff for my spells.  That's it.  Yes, some people swear by it for exp.  But, I can't stand soloing for longer than an hour.  WAAAAY too boring, and you won't find groups in LoY zones.  Too far out of the way.  Maybe the new stone will change this.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class?  First character I made was a DE Rogue on some PvP server.  Well, *I* didn't know it was a PvP server (although that never came into play) at the time.  All I knew was that I was lost in some damn city and I couldn't find my way out.  So, after getting help on how to camp out (yeah, but everyone has to be a n00b sometime.) I restarted on Lanys Tyvl (sp?) as a Monk.  Got to level 10 and a friend got the game.  Quit the Monk and restarted on Tribunal as a Warrior.  Human.  With LOTS of points in Intelligence (/shrug.  What did I know?  : p)  Got to level 20, figured out I had made BIG mistakes in character creation and restarted as a Shaman.  Was hooked from day one.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman?  I assume you mean now?  I mean, before, Shaman were KING at making groups work.  Didn't matter the group make-up, Shaman made it work.  Now?  There is no best thing.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman?  I'm useless.  Dead weight.  I cannot point at a single thing and say no one else can do that.  Oh, and buffing.  I can't stand buffing.  Focus, fine.  FA on the big fights, fine.  Don't ask me for Agi, Sta, Str, Dex.  Charisma gets a pass.  Makes the tanks happy.  I'm gonna be really unhappy if they put in all those new damn stat buffs.  Even WITH the extra buff slots and the added % mods.  Only way I could stand to do it is if they made it a group buff that combines all the effects and lasts 3 hours.  I wouldn't care if they made it non MGBable as long as it was TGBalbe.  Nor would I care if they made it cost 1k mana per cast.  Did I mention I hate buffing?<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again?  Honestly?  I don't know.  Maybe.  But, I have a 65 Monk and a 65 Beastlord too.  They are both fun.  <br />
<br />
If not, what class would you pick and why?  I might just go with the Monk.  No buffing at all there.   And even though people say they are broken, they are incredibly fun to play.  Well, maybe I am just seeing that through the mud-brown, tinted glasses Shaman get to wear........</div></div><hr />

Guild: Fires Within (http://www.fireswithin.com) <br />
Player Type: Raider<br />
How do you spend most of your time: Chatting with Friends, Raiding, Groups.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? PoWater with a mostly DoT casters group, and a crazy SK tank. Though ikkinz 1 was pretty fun when I did it yesterday, I even healed for like 20 minutes cause the cleric was afk and the druid was LD. Yay for fully slowable trash =) I liked crawling Veeshan's Peak with 1 group, too, or dragons in ST with a group or two. basically places the benefits of my abilities aren't rendered useless.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Coirnav event is pretty sweet. Props to whoever came up with it, anything that requires something other than MT/CH gets my vote.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Ugh... Solusek Ro's Tower, the mini bosses. There's like 500000 trash mobs that die in 15 seconds on the way to the boss. It's like Vex Thal without loot, and the mobs have no HP so I can't use DoTs. Also zones like Veksar, Umbral plains, and a couple other luclin zones where mobs are 100% immune to both poison and disease. What is this crap? I haven't started Ikkinz raids yet, but the trash mobs in ferubi I don't even bother slowing, they die just plain too fast. Can we get some content where quality &gt; Quantity of mobs? at least in VT you had adds, you assigned teams to offtank, it took some coordination which was cool. P3 time sucks. P1 time is cool (though getting boring now that I've done it a bunch). More &quot;event&quot; type mobs basically that require a balance of abilities to win, not just DPS/Blast Healing/Defensive.<br />
<br />
Vxed and Tipt (the latter somewhat different) are mostly just &quot;Lawnmower&quot; style zones, and for the most part, are just boring and/or frustrating mindless slaughter. Why should every challenge require killing legions and legions of single pull trivial mobs within a fixed respawn to get to the actual boss (or flag)?<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? I wanted to be big and cast spells and beat **** with a club! (no joke)<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? When I pull something off with a combination of my abilities I never thought possible.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Being forced into a role I can't fill due to inadiquate abilities (Healer in Yxxta was a pain in the ass, I can't contribute damage without also tanking)<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? I'd probably still pick a shaman, but</div></div><hr />

Note:  I retired from the game several months ago and now I just lurk on the boards because I have nothing better to do.  Feel free to throw these results out if you only want current players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level? 65<br />
<br />
No. of AAs? 405ish<br />
<br />
Time played? 240 day or so<br />
<br />
Guild? between long term guild enrollments<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? power<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? use to be raids, is now groups/solo with my play time cut to 1 day a week over the last month and a half.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? running through old raid content with 1 or 2 precision groups of friends.  i enjoy this because we are revisiting tough content and breaking it down with a core group of skilled players who are willing to take risks to reach the win.  umm my favorate expansion is kunark for some reason though lol...<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? tradeskills/factioning/reflagging for the 1000th time.  long boreing and dull.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? i liked the idea of alchemy, and i liked that i could melee + cast...boy was i way wrong...<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? i can solo or group so i am never truly bored...bear form and alchemy are so cool even though they are near worthless =)<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? it is tough to find a role we define that another class can't do resonably well without adding DPS/some other crucial element we don't have.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why?  if i ever quit my shaman main i would quit EQ, i find no other class nearly as fun to play (necro and SKs come close). if i did start over i wouldn't put points into charisma (i am sexy enough with my glass eye.)</div></div><hr />

/played, it comes out to a little over a year. Been playing since kunark's release<br />
Guild is Elders of Time, on Saryrn<br />
I consider myself to be a Casual, with powergamer tendancies. I find it impossible to roleplay in EQ's environment<br />
I spend most of my time wishing my voodoo3 was good enough to play Everquest, mostly. In the game, I spend most of my time grouped or solo. it's 50 / 50. Raids are almost a nonconsideration<br />
What content is most fun? Interesting mobs in interesting, unique dungeons, hopefully with reasonable challenges that CAN be worked with, instead of simply being immune to whatever<br />
Zone wall pull-grinding. Overthere, Dreadlands, Plane of Valor, ANYWHERE i have to sit, slow, and then sit again and wait for the next thing to slow.<br />
I have no idea why I wanted to play a Shaman. Honest, I don't. I DO know that I wanted to play in Everfrost, so that's why i'm Barbarian, but I think SoW was the selling point on being a Shaman... Then again, I have a strong interest in Shamanism IRL, so that might be a part<br />
Best part of being a shaman is back when there used to be real balls-to-the-wall situations, where i could save my group by yanking aggro, root-parking, slapping a few heals and slows at the right time, and STILL be at 80% mana after the last critter dies<br />
The worst thing is that i haven't been able to do that in almost a year now.<br />
If I had to start over again... Eh, well, i kind of HAVE, with a Beastlord (because it's like a Shaman, only with melee and a neat-looking pet). Barring that, I would say rogue. Never played one before, and they seem to have a nice assortment of potentially useful abilities in certain situations, while still having a strong main role</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And, before anyone looks confused at my level / AA versus time played... Let's just say I've had a tumultuous relationship with EQ and play too many alts :)</div></div><hr />

lvl:  65<br />
<br />
AA's:  117<br />
<br />
Time played:  ~93days-ish..cant remember exactly and can't log in atm.<br />
<br />
Guild:  Link is in my sig., /proudly points to the Decade above her head<br />
<br />
Type of Player:  Semi Casual raider and grouper (about 1/2 and 1/2 raid and grouping)<br />
<br />
Spending my time:  Raiding and grouping, I havnt touched tradeskills aside from some alchemy.<br />
<br />
Good Content:  everything up to and including most of PoP.  I love running around in old world zones and attempting to kill things that I once thought was the scariest stuff around (like The Tangrin in FoB....YAY DEAD MONKEY, revenge is sweet).  I also LOVE LDON!  That had to IMO almost be one of the smartest expansions yet.  <br />
<br />
Bad Content:  GoD...need I say more?<br />
<br />
Love my Sham:  I love my sham.  I am great at what I do, I busted my arse to get where I am and what I have.  I love how if I really try I can start a group for just about anything aside from GoD, simply because I am a shaman, and when you /tell soandso 'Wanna start a group for a Hard LDoN, shammy here' I get an 'ok', usualy because im a shaman.<br />
<br />
Hate about my sham:  GoD.<br />
<br />
Why I picked my sham:  Because I wanted to be able to SoW my self at lvl 9. :p<br />
<br />
Would I change my sham if I started over:  NOPE!  I love my shaman, would change a few things if I had the power (GoD)  BUT...over all I love my shaman, just wish SOE loved our shaman too.</div></div><hr />

Time played? This tune Since Kunark, leveled enchanter and shaman to 40ish before rolling Purdypog <br />
<br />
Guild? Moonlight Crusaders, Quellious<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? All<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? probably 60% groups, 40% raiding<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? I used to like LDON especially hards but after 250 adv's I like it less (lol).  My favorite is definitely a good group making its way killing in vxed and tipt.  The harder the better as long as it isn't impossible (good risk vs reward).<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Well when I am the only shaman or 1 of 2 raids are fine especially killing new content.  Worst is being the 3rd, 4th +++ shaman on a raid, might as well go on autofollow.  The 2nd worst is the mindless leveling like in BOT.  It was good for a while while the zone was fairly fresh, but just grinding for grinding sake sucks.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? I like to play Diablo II and am pretty quick at the trigger finger, so it was shammy or bard and bards don't have anything on the way I play Purdypog.  Hence my huge disfavor over our slow casting spells.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Versatility and being able to fight with efficiency back in the old days (I guess I am a power player at heart, lol).  It's also nice to just grab 5 folks (any class) and hit a ldon.  And, as another person said it is a good feeling to save the day on a bad pull except no one ever notices (I swear peeps in other classes have no clue about what shaman are capable of nor is it obvious enough I guess - but I know so it's ok).  It's like group saying &quot;nice heal cleric, wow really saved the day&quot;, shaman grumbling in background &quot;hmmm how about the guy who slowed everthing, parked all the extras, Q'd everyone and actually made the patch heal which saved the tank but because it was so small no one noticed? boggle).<br />
 <br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Not stacking on raids is probably the #1.  Also it sucks casting a DD and not having it land because of the slow casting.  I also used to enjoy casting and stacking DOT's (back in the old days) and I lament having an entire line of spells that are 100% worthless.  I suppose the shaman AC line falls in that category also.  I almost said FA, FA, FA plz (some polite melee out there), FA, FA.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? There is no doubt that I would not play EQ if I had to start over again.  This is a great game that Sony has just wasted for the most part.  With instanced zones Sony had the ability to do wonderful things, and up to this point I think they have completely underwelmed me with content, class balancing and especially customer relations.  They should hire me to lead the EQ ship (shameless plug).<br />

<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class?  Well, I got sick of all the bugs in UO and decided a change was in order.  Five of my friends decided to come with me and after some consideration I suggested it would be fun if we all started Trolls together and be the 'Bad Guys'.  Was a tough call at the time, I almost started a warrior but instead picked the battle priest.<br />

Since it might represent the Crucible folks and thereby a community I am proud to be a part of, here some answers.<br />
<br />
Race? Iksar<br />
Level? 65<br />
No. of AAs? bout 160<br />
Time played? 200 days on the lizard, another 100 on other toons<br />
Guild? Shining Alliance, a casual guild that raids. Elemental but mostly doing VT and backflagging atm.<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? Casual raider.<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? 80% raiding, rest chatting, tradeskilling, char maintenance. Used to be different until GoD came out. But I currently do not see any reason to improve my shaman anymore.<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? raiding with the guild. Preferably PoP mobs, VT is still fun though.<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? GoD trials /GoD because of: unpleasant gfx, unpleasant location, stupid lore, keyed zones, everything KoS, everything deadly to a 65 shaman with 6.7k hp and 1300 AC, ... its just one ugly, ****ty place I have no interest what so ever to go to. And no! those crappy nodrop spells don t help either, the only really good spell being an ancient spell.<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? SoW at level 9, no kidding. Well, when Kunark came out I had played a mage to level 19, a monk to level 20 and a druid to about 15. I just knew I had to have one of these deadsexy lizards. So I went for the class that had SoW ;)<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman?slowing time itself.<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman?There is no bad thing about being a shaman. Well, maybe that we can solo some nasty stuff and canni, people use that as a reason to not grant any development of the shaman class for 5 expansions.<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again?  If not, what class would you pick and why?I don t know. Maybe SK. My SK twink is only level 48 but he is a damned sexy lizard too. And kicks some major butt as well.<br />
<br />
Maybe a little addendum. I am kinda semi retired. That means that I log on for our scheduled raids and maybe once or twice a week to chat some and maybe hang out in a guild exp group. Not sure why this really came about but I think my disappointment about GoD has something to do with it. It is not that I did not try, if you check my magelo you will see I even have one of those nice earings from the sewers. But, as mentioned above, I found GoD definitly unfun. No nice place to hang out at, not beautiful sights to admire, no impressive mobs to take a screen in front of. Just ugly, bleak, deadly zones. Hopefully SOE recognizes this problem and improves on the aesthetic qualities in OOW, and that does not just mean more polygons and bump mapping.</div></div><hr />

What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? That is hard to answer ... none of those or maybe all<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? in this order raids, chatting, groups<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? Small raids, for the feeling of accomplishment and the challenge of having to do without the perfect tools<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? Soloing and tradeskills. Mindless clicking is not fun.<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? I wanted to heal, I wanted to be different, I wanted to whack stuff with a hammer<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Having different roles in different encounters.<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Cannibalizing. My &quot;1&quot; key is hit more often then any other key on my keyboard, including the spacebar and enter.<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again?  If not, what class would you pick and why? If ogres could be druids I would probably start over as a druid. I would probably end up as a druid or enchanter, not sure on the race though.</div></div><hr />

Race: Troll<br />
Level: 65<br />
No. of AAs: 220ish, Born Oct '99<br />
Time played: 250+ days (note: I have 150 days played on a Paladin, my former &quot;main&quot;, 130 of it pre-Kunark)<br />
Guild: Omani (http://www.omani-guild.com/index.html) <br />
<br />
Player Type: Raider and Soloer<br />
How do you spend most of your time: Raiding, Solo content, either farming or questing (I AFK a lot during the day, so I solo a lot. I also enjoy quests, and recently finished up the Aid Grimel Signet of the Arcane quest. Talk about a time-money sink!)<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? I have enjoyed PoP quite a bit. There are a lot of different zones, different bosses, different strategy required for them. Now that I am EP, its kinda vanilla. The gods are mostly fun events, with the exception of Fennin, lots to do for a Shaman on Xeg, Coir and TRC. But the minis are too predictable. I am hopeful Time has more variability (just recently flagged, have yet to raid in Time). <br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Currently, I am not enjoying the whole Gates experience. I do not like 4+ hour committments with very very little reward. The trials need adjusting, period. NO trial should take more than 90 minutes, 2 hours TOPS. <br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Best combination of melee, spells, and utility (Sow and buffs, since slow wasnt &quot;a big deal&quot; when he was created). Mine started as a twink to my Paladin. I happened to have a spare Manastone and Rubi BP and it was awesome. That is also why I picked troll, the regen. I could Manastone myself &quot;purple&quot; and come back to life, heh. <br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Many people in many groups underestimate how extremely powerful shaman are, especially in &quot;lesser&quot; content. I have been on pick-up LDoN normal runs where we completely overpulled without a Chanter, and after I was finished parking, slowing, DOTing the parked ones, dropping Quies on everyone, beating on them with my BOOM stick, etc, everyone just went &quot;No idea how we pulled that off&quot;. I just smile. <br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? I do not like being conisdered a &quot;healer&quot; especially on raids. They tend to stick shaman with caster groups in my guild sometimes (well not so much anymore) and when you are the only shaman or maybe 1 other, you just are not gonna save anyone because all your duties are at the BEGINNING of the fight, not the middle or end. Since the mobs aggro is the most unstable at the beginning, people die in my groups. Oh well, thats why we bring clerics too, I guess. I also EXTREMELY dislike people requesting useless buffs, forcing me to mem, cast, re-mem my original set, etc. I have begun asking people &quot;why&quot; when they ask for thing like PE or AGI. Funny how they dont have a real answer most of the time. <br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? Absolutely, but I would make an SK on another account to 2-box. Shaman would be my main though.</div></div><hr />

What is the worst thing about being a shaman?  Well - there really aren't many hot chicks...  *sniff*<br />

<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? GoD, Tradeskills. GoD is just too alien, storyline is crap, too many classes suck on many encounters. As for tradeskills i just find them total waste of time, another timesink and totally boring. <br />

Why did you choose shaman as class? I liked the idea of healing &amp; making my allies stronger while weakening &amp; cursing my enemies.<br />

<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Poor stacking on raids, Unable to cope with newest content, being able to do many things at the cost of being (below) average in them.<br />

Level? 65<br />
No. of AAs? 161<br />
Time played? 200+ days a year ago when I returned, started pre-Kunark<br />
Guild? Sword of Fate  (http://www.swordoffate.com/)  on Prexus<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? between casual and power, play enough to be power but hang with more casuals<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? Raid when can, otherwise single group crawls looking for challenging and new things to try<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why?  Challenging single group (or a few groups at most) stuff like GoD, anything that is a crawl, also really enjoyed PoP and getting to Elementals, I enjoy raid leading, though probably wouldnt enjoy raiding quite as much if I didnt help lead<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? Tradeskilling and grinding xps so I dont do either<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Versatility and soloability, had no idea what slow was but everyone wanted sow, ability to help other players (pre kunark)<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? soloability (older stuff), ease of travel, often still able to make a weak group strong and good groups stronger<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? newer content often makes it impossible to be the only healer in a group<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again?  If not, what class would you pick and why? Already started over kinda with a rogue mainly because we couldnt seem to keep any in the guild, not because I didnt love my shaman, but was fun to duo them.  If I had to start from scratch, I'd probably pick a bard or enchanter.</div></div><hr />

Time played? too depressing to look<br />
Guild? decade<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.)? Power<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.)? raiding<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? any high end content.  I enjoy the challange, even if it's broken, because it requries lots of skill to actually beat it.<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? GoD trials, they take way too long.<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Veratility, and the ability to kill just about anything (pre pop) as long as you have all day<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Being able to solo anything.<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Not being able to solo anything if i don't have all day to do it.<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? Yes, I enjoy the 'needed' sham slows on raids, even though i know it's only needed in their minds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">-Retired Barbie Prophet (lvl 65 114 AAs when I retired, maybe more, been a while)<br />
-I had around 285 days played on my shaman since June 99 to Feb of this year when I quit.<br />
-I was a class officer for my small casual guild, through open raids we had managed to fall a god or 2 short of Sol Ro.<br />
-I spent most of my time towards the end LFG as my guild went through a quit time prior to GoD.  I had been primarly on LDoNs, some group madness, and stupid stuff (trying to push mudflation to see if we could do what had been full raids into one group or partial group encounters).<br />
-I rolled my shaman because I wanted to try a caster, but I didn't want to be a wimp and I wanted to be able to take a beating.  I had heard shamans could melee.<br />
-Kunark stuff was the most fun.  the dungeons were tight and challenging solo, while in groups I loved using AE slow and rains, I ALWAYS had some degree of fun.<br />
-The least fun content for me was Luclin.  I had no issue with balancing as I did pretty well in Luclin dungeons, I just hated the look and feel and the stupid traps everywhere.<br />
-best thing for me when I played my shaman was having a party member call out &quot;adds&quot; and have me reply &quot;saw em, working on it&quot;.  Mhen my guys saw the &quot;working on it&quot;, they knew I'd deal with them or end up at my bind point, or both.  For a smart shaman, you can do lots with the class's diversity, but in fast paced content that ability is HUGELY diminished.<br />
-worst thing is we are COMPLETELY scaled towards longer fights and SoE is reluctant to put longer content in the mix.<br />
-If I started over, I'd play a rogue, monk, BL, ranger or SK, MAYBE a pallie (if I was drunk or something).</div></div><hr />

Time played - 150 days<br />
Guild - Deadly Horsemen, The Nameless<br />
<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself (casual, power, role, etc.) - Casual<br />
<br />
How do you spend most of your time (groups, adventures, raids, tradeskills, soloing, chatting with friends, etc.) - Guild groups<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Why? - GoD zones because for myself and my guild it's a challenge.<br />
<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? Why? - LDoN because it is too repetative for my tastes.<br />
<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? - A RL friend started an ogre warrior at the same time, a shaman was a good partner.<br />
<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? - Knowing that I can make a difference with slow, or a quick MT saving spot heal, or fire off a quick root at any second.<br />
<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? - People who demand buffs. Especially people I don't know. They just walk up and send me a tell, &quot;Fo7&quot;. That annoys me to no end.<br />
<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? If not, what class would you pick and why? - I probably would pick a shaman again. I've played several classes (enc, sk, warrior, ranger) and always come back to my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Race: Barbarian<br />
Level: 65<br />
No. of AAs: 128<br />
Time played: 121 days<br />
Guild: Pima Aspectus (Guild recently gained access to Sol Ro tower and killed Agnarr)<br />
What type of player do you consider yourself? Casual-raider<br />
How do you spend most of your time? Mostly raiding, but I do a fair bit of the other stuff off and on.<br />
What content do you think is the most fun? Most everything I've seen (I never bought GoD).<br />
What content do you think is the least fun? See above.<br />
Why? I guess I obtain some sick masochistic pleasure from spending hours upon days working at goals (VT, planar progression, etc).<br />
Why did you choose shaman as class? Because they turned into bears, had the best melee buffs, could heal and most of all...because at level 60 you get the title Oracle. Which for me was just coolness, cause my identity at a message board community was once the self-proclaimed Oracle Raccoo. =)<br />
What is the best thing about being a shaman? Being versatile, although that versatility has diminished returns now.<br />
What is the worst thing about being a shaman? Content outgrowing us.<br />
If you had to start over, would you pick shaman again? Yes.</div></div><hr />
