<br />
Where's a good place to PL my level 44 shaman? I'm looking for a good spot to PL him to 49, then I'll level in the first tier planes with him.I have a 65 Ranger 150aa's, with 5k unbuffed on another account, and computer. So I was wondering where would be a good place to take them. Any advice on a good way to PL the shaman would be helpful. Right now I have been pulling 5 to 6 dogs in solb with my ranger, using my rangers dmg sheild for the dogs to get beat up on, then casting posion storm with my shaman so he gets the exp. However this is time intesive and exp is starting to get worse. Is there a better way to do this, should I group them together and move to a higher lvl zone? I tried velks but think my main is sucking up to much exp still to group them together.</div></div><hr />

I just did this 2 weeks ago with my 60 Ranger and 44 Shaman (now 50). Grab C3 and head to Echo Caverns and pull Gnome guards with ranger and let dog and shaman kill them. Put a DS, skin and chloro on dog. Haste and str on Alpha pet from shaman. Pull, sic dog, and nuke with Shaman. Apply root with Ranger if needed. They die quickly and exp flies up to 49 in no time.</div></div><hr />
