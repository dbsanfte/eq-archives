<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Paradime</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I rolled a Troll Shaman Brews on the Torv server a few weeks ago. He is now about to ding 19. But for a deity I picked Cazic-Thule. Is this a bad thing? Please help. If I have to reroll I would rather do it now than in my 30's. If it is a bad thing to be of that deity could you tell my why and what I'll be missing out on?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your help, I do appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you planned to do the snare necklace quest, then you messed up, deity requested is Innoruk, beside that, there is nothing wrong chosing Cazic-Thule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, about the only reasons to pick troll now is the slight regen at lower levels and the snare neck quest. Therefore, you may want to consider going back and changing to innorak. However, If you do not wish to suffer the rather large racial XP penalty, I suggest rolling a Cat shaman. Nice racial bonuses, looks cool, no huge faction issues, and no XP penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I chose Cazic Thule, also....  I regretted it for the longest time, but I've made due without it.  I got all the way to my 40s or 50s before I learned of the snare necklace, so I didn't want to re-roll... but at 19, I'd consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blazz is right, as is Poguk.<br />
<br />
I chose Cazic, and kinda wished I hadn't later on.  But the exp penalty for trolls and Ogres is a much bigger consideration.<br />

having fun?  keep going.<br />

They have a &quot;presence&quot; about them.  :)  Moreso than any other shaman race.

<br />
Ogres have soul.  And frontal-stun immunity.  The troll regen is awesome for a canni'ing class like a shaman and they got plenty of soul, that's why i chose a troll.   Troll rhymes with soul.  ;)  I'm a fan of ogre and troll shamans.</div></div><hr />

The ability to snare is great to have, but I think I live with out it. I have made to many friends with Brews the Troll to reroll just for one item.<br />
<br />
One more question though. There is an item that I need to get at 45. I don't know the name of it, but every Shaman needs it to help with soloing. It's a clicky item, but I don't know the name of it. Do you guys know what I'm talking about ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im a Cazic worshiping Troll too.  To be honest, i dont think the clicky neck is worth it to reroll even if you are sub 20 still.  I was able to lvl to 65 just fine without it, and when i reflect on my lvling, i dont think there was ever a situation that i needed it to survive.  Its nice to play with, my cleric plays with it all the time, but it really isnt a must have item.  The JBB is however, get that bracer asap when you get in lvl range for it (45 i think for kunark gear).  Root/dot/nuke/nuke/nuke/nuke/nuke/nuke dead mob, very little mana, is so nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cazic is a fine choice and the choice of many trolls who didn't want to be stuck worshipping some skinny, bow-legged Inky god.<br />
<br />
Most trolls post-snare neck quest have been Inny, but the CT fear necks are nice to have through your late 50's.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't reroll unless the snare item was the only reason you chose to make a troll in the first place.  If that is the case, you are prolly better off with a frog or cat. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If I had it to do all over again, I would have gone Ogre. Immune to stun from the front is much more useful than some regen, and the higher stamina would have made life tons simpler when choosing gear now.<br />
When I started playing, faction, travel, were really the only issues that got me to play a barbarian, it was difficult to get to where my friends were (wood elves and dwarfs) as an evil.<br />
These days? Meh play what you think looks cool, plenty of us have survived a good long time with no snare necklace, no fear necklace. The exp penalties arent that huge a deal now with the removal of hell levels (if you dont know what these are, consider yourself lucky) and the increased ZMEs a lot of zones have now, and the common knowledge of what these zones are. Good example, when I was in my mid 20s, the place to level for 90% of the game of that level was LoIO, a place that has a NEGATIVE ZEM, thus taking exp from you.<br />
Dont crunch the numbers that much, play what you like, where you like, it really does all even out in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say that I use it all the time at 65, but there are times when it comes in handy. The casting time is a bit too long and the duration is a bit too short to make it a good source of snare in a group, but it's better than relying exclusively on Root when there are no real snarers around.<br />
<br />
I usually use it while dual boxing my Monk either by myself or in a small group, and it does make dungeon crawling a somewhat more relaxed experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I use the snare necklace at 65 also. Its very handy.  I'd rerole as an Inny Troll if I were you. <br />
<br />
If I had to choose something other than inny troll shaman, I would have chosen ogre shaman and gained the stun immunity. Thats darn handy also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You will still need to do some faction work before you can turn in those bone chips (just less than a non-Cazic worshiper).  An Inny troll is still able to do the quest with just a little more work. <br />
<br />
The best way I found was to kill the iksar bandit types in FoB.  They will give you Legion of Cabilis faction that you need for the troopers and Brood of Kotiz faction hits which will make you safer in Cabilis once you get there without giving any important negative hits.  Once you are non-KoS to the troopers you can start handing in those chips for faster faction hits with everyone else.<br />
<br />
You can hand bone chips to Trooper Mozo while still KoS to the Crusaders if you stand on his left side as far away from him as you can get and still open the trade window.<br />
<br />
There is a very informative thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=8900)  in the Quests forum already.  It's worth the read if you want your cudgel.<br />
<br />
I would say that the snare necklace is much better than a few hundred bone chips though.  At level 20 I would consider re-rolling myself but then I don't mind the low-level game and can level a toon back to 20 in a couple of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Jraven1, you and Nytmare are saying the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doh! I misread what he wrote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am a cazic troll, and I know I SPECIFICALLY found places to solo or duo where mobs either didn't run, or running wasnt a big deal (OT, DL, etc).<br />
<br />
If your committed to Troll, I vote re-roll Inny. 1-19 is a jokes worth of leveling, even in fairly basic gear. If you were 25-30, then no, I would probably not lean that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">the snare necklace is just a somewhat useful clicky whose usefulness is situational at best and generally decreases the further you get into the game.<br />
<br />
similarly, the symbols of cazic thule (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=bol+of+caz) are nifty clickies with situational but certainly not game-changing uses.  i know even in the end game, shadowknights often use their low level fear spells for fast-casting, low-mana agro spells.  so you might find more uses than you'd think from the fearage, who knows.  at 2 second casts they're probably pretty decent pulling tools too.<br />
<br />
if you like your ct shaman for roleplay reasons or because you've made friends your level or because you don't want to do the same twenty levels over again or whatever, just keep him.  if you want some questing fun do the ct deity quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">what is the snare necklace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">what is the snare necklace?<br />
<br />
Regent Symbol of Innoruuk (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1254) <br />
<br />
It's a right click snare effect item that can be quested at a relatively early age.  It can only be used by worshipers of Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Regent Symbol is nice but not a reason to re-start.<br />
<br />
One of the few quests that was actually cool to do...until the final turn-in; can't fit up the steps; can't shrink; couldn't do turn-in if NPC was aggro'ed to come downstairs. Spammed more /bug /feedback at that time than I ever have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">haha, did pretty well without the snare necklace, but was kinda embarassed when I saw that I picked the wrong deity in my 40-50 ^^.<br />
<br />
Truhl shamans are just so cool ! 19 levels aren't that hard to do, so you may want to reroll. But you can do without the necklace. ( Maybe I would say something else if I had the snare necklace ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I personally would restart... I'm not saying that you NEED the necklace, but I'm sure that once you started using it, you'd prize it.  I'd restart before it is too late, simply because it's so easy to blow through levels these days.<br />
<br />
I'm a barbarian, and have never had the necklace, but I know that the JBB I kept hearing my Iksar friend insult roxxored my soxxors up until about 58, when I could do more &quot;mana free&quot; DPS by canni IV and Ice Striking.<br />
<br />
If I had it, I probably wouldn't use it a ton, but there are a few situations, like killin off a few things in natimbi, where snare would help a lot toward avoiding adds and such.  It would sure be preferrable to my useless non-pet-giveable hammer summoning Tribunal necklace :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ashunshugar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">To turn in the bone-chips, just use an essence of Iksar potion.

I sort of wish I had made a troll shaman just for that.  But, Cazic as a deity isnt all that bad, I mean look at the Iksars, they have him :)  My Iksar shaman sure does anyways!</div></div><hr />

Sure it was an iksar? Iksars can't use Jaundiced Bone Bracers, at least they couldn't the last time I checked.</div></div><hr />
