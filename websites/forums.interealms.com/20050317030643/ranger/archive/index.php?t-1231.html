<br />
I have been looking to buy a car for the past 3 years.  This has been something I have wanted so bad and I have been saving religiously for the past 2 1/2 years.  My whole paycheck has gone to my savings account, minus about $20 dollars (10 for eq :p and the other 10 just for random things like fast food)<br />
<br />
Well the other day I got home from school and my dad called me from work and told me he had found the car.  1996 GT v8 5-spd all the extras I wanted etc..  We called the dealership to confirm what it had.  They told us it was coming down in price by $1000 dollars this weekend.  Also, since we were going to cut them a check, straight cash deal, that they would drop another $500 dollars or more off of the price.<br />
<br />
Later that night we talked with my mom, who surprisingly, is very enthusiastic about me getting one.  She ok'd the deal so my dad called the dealership at about 7am yesterday morning to have them pull the car from the lot and hold it for us till we could get there to test drive it and give it a good look over.<br />
<br />
About 10 minutes before we leave to go check it out we got a call from the salesman that had been handling the deal and he told us that the car may have been sold to someone else.  It turns out that it was sold to someone else that night even though the salesman said he would pull the car from the lot for us and hold it till we get there.  (I live a good hour from the dealership)<br />
<br />
I can honestly say at that moment in time I had never been so pissed off in my entire life.  I couldn't even hang around the house, I went off and walked around the neighborhood for 2 1/2 hours.<br />
<br />
So this morning my dad and I decided that we were going to go to the dealership and tell them exactly what we though, civily though.  We could control our emotions today.  So that is what we did.<br />
<br />
We pulled up to the place at exactly 11am today.  And believe it or not guess who was standing infront of the place when we got there?  If you said the salesman who had set the whole deal up then you get a cookie :)   He about **** his pants when my dad and I introduced ourselves.<br />
<br />
He already knew why we were there ofcourse, he had just been expecting a telephone call today rather than us showing up.  So he goes and finds customer service for us to talk to.  We ended up in an office with the man who is the head of the entire used car lot they have (this place has like 500 cars, A LOT will work).<br />
<br />
He was an extreemely polite man and let us tell him completely what happend before he said a word.  He found a few things strange though.  (On the intial phone call when we made an offer the salesman said he had to go talk to a manager to make sure the number was about right.)  The man we talked with today said he was the only one that hanlded things like that there and that he was never onced talked to about that.  The salesman also told us it was a 5-spd which was not true and he later said that he never told us that, complete lie.<br />
<br />
Also, when he said that he was going to remove the car from the lot and put it where no one would get to it he didn't.  What he did do is move it right infront of the main show room in plain sight where you couldn't miss it.  (It's kind of hard to miss a shiny red mustang anyways hehe :) )<br />
<br />
The salesman tried to argue that the other person who bought the car had a the money first and that the used car sales buisness is like the antiquing buisness.  BULL****!  How the hell was I supposed to put a deposit down on the car when I am over an hour away from the place.  We later find out that they can take your credit card number and use that for a deposit.  Well never once did the salesman mention that to us.<br />
<br />
So we left with an offer to us that ANY car we saw on the lot we could get for the price he had on his sales sheet.  No liscencing fees or anything like that, just the price of the car.  I left fealing really good that I knew the salesman was going to get what he had coming to him.<br />
<br />
I learned 2 things today, well 1 of them last night really.  First: You can't trust a damn thing that anyone says these days.  Secondly (and the better of the two): If you believe in something, and you are justified, never quit till you have acomplished what you know is right.<br />
<br />
So we left and wen't around to the other car dealerships in town since we were there.  The only thing we saw was a 1997 Cobra  /em drools.  I really began to start taking a shining to the post 1998 body styles.  I have always liked them really but never considered a car that new because of the expense.<br />
<br />
I don't really have a huge demand for a car at the moment but the car economy is down and I thought I would get one while they are cheap and on sale.  But, at the same time I kind of feel like saving and trying for a newer body style, the post 98.  I am not quit sure what I should do so what would you do?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience if you read this whole thing :D   I know it probably took a long time and I appreciate your oppinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My brother just brought me some food (I am at work) and said my parents are seriously considering helping me get that cobra.  Its got to be a bunch of bull though.  There is no way in hell I could get a decent insurance rate on it.  It's fun to dream though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Salesmen, especially in the used automobile industry, are notorious for working several deals on the same piece of merchandise expecting most of them to fall through.  When they have a sweet car, they will play one buyer against another trying to jack the price up.  Occasionally they make up other buyers to see how bad you want the car.  <br />
<br />
Good for walking away from the lot and letting them know that they have forever lost one potential customer.  Consider writing the owner and documenting what happened on the lot.  Name names, tell the exact truth and talk about how it felt to have the scumbag lying jerk call you a liar to try and save himself.<br />
<br />
Business is business, but a major part of any business that wants to stick around is keeping to your word.  I remember one time walking away from a car deal because I caught the salesman lying to me, went back to get my own car, which was going to be a trade-in, and found another salesman trying to sell it to someone else on the lot.<br />
<br />
As I was berating the idiot, the people who were looking at it left the lot so they lost two sales and got bad word of mouth that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, you should have been involved in the fracas that was my first personaly purchased auto hehehe ;)<br />
An automotive guru friend of the family said &quot;go to THAT dealership and get the  red Mazda 323!&quot;  SoI went with my first $1000 EVER to hit my bank account in hand for the down payment.  I aquired my car and decided to drive back to the hometown to have that person take a look and to show off my new wheels ( far superior to my '83 VW Rabbit diesel, or so I thought)<br />
As we travel (hubby and I)  I realize that the car keeps slipping out of gear when I have to turn from a stop light or downshift in general.  Ummmm k. . . . .  then we stop to pick some stuff up and notice a noise from the engine. . .sounds like a belt whine. . . <br />
We finish the 45 minute drive hoping there was nothing big wrong.  My brother takes a look since the other guy wasnt there.  He says &quot;you got SCREWED.&quot;  He says the timing chain is about to just GO.  ACK!  So we get the car back to the dealership 45 minutes the other way.  It KEEPs deteriorating as we drive untill I nearly smash up at an intersection due to NO gear movement at all.  I park it shaking I'm so mad.  We go in, find the salesman with some other people and say &quot; We have to talk about that Piece of **** you just sold us!!&quot;  *vindictive chuckle* the customers left hehe.  They do an inspection, while we wait a former classmate of mine shows up.  She was the mechanic who had orriginaly assesed the car prior to sale, SHE had told them NOt to sell it!  It was dangerus!  It had the main oil seal cracked up, timing chain about GONE ect ect. . .(insert mechanical stuff for BAD here)  So we go talk to the manager, he says he will give us a car a relative of his had traded in, it was in good condition ect ect and was worth far more than the car we had bought.  (well no kidding lol)  It was a Mercury tracer, about an '88 or so I believe.  We take it (should have held out for the corvette hehehe)<br />
Several months too late for more angry confrontations we have to replace the radiator.<br />
Then I totaled it rofl ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I follow the credo of never trusting any salesperson who is selling something used.  Here's my basic rules:<br />
1)If you aren't a mechanic or knowledgeable about automobiles always get a neutral third party to access the vehicle before even thinking about purchasing it.  If you don't know someone who can help you out with this frequently you can take it to a service station and have it looked over (sometimes free, sometimes for like $50.)<br />
2)Always get it in writing.  If it isn't in writing weaseling may occur.  Verbal deals for automobiles are notoriously sketchy at car dealerships.<br />
<br />
I've never actually bought a vehicle from a dealership because I don't trust them enough.  Too many times I've watched car dealers try to take advantage of friends of mine and their lack of mechanical knowledge.  I find my cars via the local newspaper or Auto Trader.  Sure it may take a month to find the right deal but you usually get a much better idea of the history of the car since you are actually talking to the owner rather than a greasy salesman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Car sales are a sleazy business.  It's how I got started into being a mechanic.   I just can't stand dealing with people in that respect, or ever felt comfortable enough about a car to sell to somone under certain circumstances.<br />
<br />
It takes a &quot;special&quot; kind of person to sell cars.  I'm not one of them, or ever care to be.  I try to stay away from people that do sell them for a living.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately for consumers, the laws are changing drasticaly and the penalties are severe for misleading consumer in a multitude of ways.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you had a badd experience.  There really are some nice decent dealerships out there.  Word of mouth is probably your best bet on finding one.</div></div><hr />

Every other car-buying experience I've had was enough to leave me literally vomiting in the bathroom afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was 20, having just walked out of college and gotten a killer job, and goin to every single ford dealer in San Diego County looking for the one specific truck I wanted.  (A 1999+ ranger 4x4 with a manual transmission).  NO dealers had it.  They said that trucks fitting that description were incredibly popular and sold instantly.<br />
<br />
Finally, I find a dealership with one in stock.  As I get there, someone is closing the deal on it.  A nice salesman offers to try and BEAT the other party in filing closing papers, but I decline and leave the lot discouraged.<br />
<br />
The next morning I get a call from the salesman saying the sale had fallen through because the buyer was buying it for his son, who didn't have a driver's license yet.  <br />
<br />
I drive down there again.  I take the truck for a test drive.  It was PERFECT.   Had a whole 14000 miles on it.  Had every single feature a ranger can have, minus running boards and the automatic transmission, neither of which I wanted.  I said I wanted it, and we sat down to work out a loan.<br />
<br />
I had no pay stub yet.  I had no proof I was employed.  My sole resource was being able to put down a $5000 deposit.  It took them several phone calls to several banks, but they managed to find me a car loan.  It was at a pretty high interest rate, 12%, and over six years, but it worked -- I used that loan to establish AAA credit and refinanced after 6 months to a much lower rate.<br />
<br />
Just writing that not all used car salesmen are evil, although my story is a bit scary, that a 19 year old with $5000 to his name and no proof of employment can get a $22000 car loan.  Still, a damned good experience for a first-time car buyer.  I was pretty lucky.<br />

That is one HOT car that would be nice for anyone to own. Just get an estimate on the insurance first.. heh<br />
And be prepared to drop some cash on gas each week. With a car like that you WILL get a heavy foot =)<br />
