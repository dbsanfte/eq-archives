<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I was looking at Allakhazam's Beastiary for Iceclad Ocean and came across this little tidbit. I just love it when people make statements like this about Shaman....gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside.<br />

Quote:<br />
&quot;Well I do not have a shaman but my wife does and I have noticed that a shaman is not the strongest solo charater, their kiting skill are lame until 30's and they can not tank much better than pure castors. <br />
<br />
Shaman are unique that they can be a good secondary melee with good armour but if they want to be a good castor they have to settle for poor or worse armour until they get ubber.   <br />
<br />
I have grouped with a shaman for most of my 35 lvls and real do not see much difference between them and a druid except that shaman have better exp and armour and being a porting class the only thing a druid has that a shaman does not is wolf form. <br />
<br />
If anything a druid is more of a challenge to play over a shaman because of all their shortcommings.&quot;<br />
<br />
This poor misinformed soul, wouldn't you just love to show him the pointy end of your spear ?<br />
What do all of you think ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Apparently his wife isnt 34th level yet.<br />
<br />
Yeah, when she hits 34 she'll get new DoTs and be much better at kiting :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but I wanna be a good secondary melee !!!<br />
<br />
but how does my armor stop me from casting?  shoot, I actually use my jb armor to cast with, it doesn't stop me .... is he saying it casts to slow?<br />
<br />
I give up, cannot make sense of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Proving once again that a shaman isn't as good a druid as a druid. Why this surprises anyone is a mystery to me.<br />
<br />
Some people are clueless. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I admit it, I'll be the first to stand up and say<br />
&quot;Hi my name is Stormrazor, an Iksar Shaman and I completely suck at being a druid !&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Views like this are fine by me. If a good number of folks think the Shaman is just a gimped Druid (roflmao!) we won't have 1/2 a server playing Shaman PCs. If folks like this knew how dang cool Shamans were, I'm sure there would be Shamans everywhere....and that would just suck!<br />
<br />
The few...the proud...Shamans!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And yet dr00ds have about as much stamina in a group as a cheap non alkaline battery, while I am the energizer bunny.<br />
<br />
15 mins into face paced xp grinding...<br />
<br />
<br />
dr00d01 tells the group &quot;oom&quot;<br />
Karelan tells the group &quot;med through a few I got it&quot;<br />
<br />
all the while healing and hasting and root parking and canning and meleeing. And keeping regrowth on me and the main tank.<br />
<br />
20 minutes later someone looks up and says..<br />
<br />
soandso tells the group &quot;when did *inserd dr00d name here* leave?<br />
Karelan tells the group &quot;bout 20 minutes ago&quot;<br />
soandso tells the group &quot;lol didnt even notice&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I recently started a monk alt.  I have a RL friend that plays a druid around the same level as me, with his main being a monk.  When our mains play together, the only time I take a med break is when someone goes afk.  You know us shammys, we're fine at 20m =).  Anyways, I'm used to that pace for the xp grind.  So when I group up with his druid and I'm a monk, I've come to expect the same kind of pace.  It's poopy that we have to rest for a few minutes every 10-15 minutes.  I feel like I should come over with my shammy and show him what efficient means.  I am no clr00cl!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think what they guy meant about good armor restricting our casting ability is that in the level range he is obviously dealing with (mid 30s), you pretty much have to chose between good armor (AC/HP) or high wisdom - unless you are playing a twink of course. That of course means he doesn't really understand the power of Canny...</div></div><hr />
