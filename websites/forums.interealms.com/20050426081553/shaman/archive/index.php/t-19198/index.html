The problem with WW is adds, and also some are difficult to solo. Try Yeldema in her spot after watching adds, or bring her over cliff to a beach. Also, you need your better dps spells imho. A dog in your pocket is nice, too.</div></div><hr />

CR is a snap.  Bind at the SG ent to WW and use a spirit stone to get to your home city, should put you close to a PoK book for easy access to get to raids and whatnot.  The EXP hit on an unressed death isn't so bad and if you're ally with CoV it's trivial to get to your corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeldema, Bratavar, Hechaeva and Makala (beautiful purple dragon).<br />
<br />
Hardest part about the dragons I've found is the dispell attacks.  Usually end the fight with no buffs left.  <br />
<br />
And both my deaths were due to the same dragon - Mraaka.  I swear he/she warped on top of me when I was fighting near Yeldema's nest and quickly killed me (both times).<br />
<br />
Start with Yeldema, then for a real fight pick a dragon with a fire or cold dispell attack.  Avoid the ones with the gravity flux.</div></div><hr />

Dragons in WW have become so trivial they're not even fun to solo anymore, and an add is the only real danger.  I have only died once there, and it was because I was doing Vraptin and didn't wait to make sure Harla Dar wasn't nearby... Harla added near the end of the fight right after I'd done a Canni 5 and didn't take long for me to bite it.</div></div><hr />

Here is a handy guide to the WW dragons.  This will give you a better idea of what you can handle and what will hand your ass to you on a plate.  <br />

The dragons in WW dont drop anything good unless you kill Sontalak or something.  The best item the others drop is some talisman with +7 resists to all.  Btw, dont try to solo the one that silences ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, bratavar is easy and allegedly drops that matchless dragonwing mantle which isn't terrible, since shoulders can be hard to upgrade.  However, the Heavy Dragonwing mantle is the best he's ever dropped for me.  There really are better places to farm for twink armor now.  Still worth doing for fun, esp since all that time I spent getting max ally to CoV seems pointless now, so might as well blow it killing dragons!<br />
<br />
And yeah, that silencing dragon - Esorpa, I think - will mess you up bad.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I must've gotten lucky when I (my cleric) got one on my second Klandi kill (with guild).</div></div><hr />
