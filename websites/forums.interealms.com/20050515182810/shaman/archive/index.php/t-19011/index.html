<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinkin it would be cool to get some other classes innate skills, all at a low lvl of course. By now I don't think any of these really would make us unbalanced keep all the skills at a max of like 25 or so enough for us to use them but still be very infieror(sp?) to classes that have them, almost all of these skills are almost trivial.<br />
<br />
Sneak<br />
Track- Ok track is pushing the envelope, even know I hear many people say how overated it is, so maybe a extremly low max skill of 1-5<br />
Forage- Ok we all want this, expecially with some of our potions needing foraged items.<br />
safe fall Handy to have when runnin through those steep terain.<br />
<br />
I think that' about it.. what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only because, everyone wants every class to be the uber class.  Some accuse the shaman class of this, but what most of us really wants, is a *niche*, like a majority of the classes have.  If you were to pimp out sneak to anyone with the aa points, then so much for rogues, rangers and monks being exclusive to this.  Along with track, cept rangers, druids, and bards.  And safefall, bards, rogues, and monks.  Etc etc, so on and so on.  <br />
<br />
I dont want to blur the lines anymore then they are, but taking some other classes abilities.  Every class should have thier own niche, or core abilities, that others can not access.  Its what makes the classes different, instead of everyone playing the same Warrior/ Cleric/ Wizard combo for max power.</div></div><hr />

A  limited forage-like ability for only alchemy components would make a lot of sense; call it 'collect' or something.  It should cap at 100, but only return alchemy stuff, not regular foraged bits.  Of course, that would mean that some zones would have nothing to collect at all, but that would be fine.<br />
<br />
Vah shir already have racial sneak and safe fall, and that is obviously not imbalancing, but I can't think of a good reason why shammies as a class should get these abilities.  However, I do think you could develop a good argument in favor of giving safe fall to all classes as an AA, similar to enhanced regen, etc.  Either way, it doesn't matter much; its mostly a useless skill.<br />
<br />
Tracking would be quite imbalancing, IMO, and there is no good argument for giving that to shammies that I can think of.<br />
<br />
I would much prefer Dev time to be spent on fixing our broken DoTs, our limited healing, and our obvious need for a better slow spell (and, of course, an improved rabid bear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thumbs down.<br />
<br />
Sneak only usefull for a few quests here and there.<br />
<br />
Track with a 1-5 skill would be pointless and almost useless. But I will admit if I could add one skill to shm it would be tracking.<br />
<br />
Forage LOL well Iksar Shaman do get forage 50 skill max at lv1. And it is beyond useless. Even when I did the crudgel quests that required forageing items. I would simply log on my old range and forage the items with him. Probbly saved myself 12 hours of quest work that way.</div></div><hr />

I'm an addict, hit it every time it comes up.  Handy for tradeskills and a few Iksar quests require it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Volfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive been bashing for 1 forever with no skill just give me an aa that allows me to watch a cleric and figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sneak and track are too powerful (for shaman as additional toy) and step massively on the toes of other classes, so no.<br />
<br />
I would settle for a limited forage (or stop using foraged items for alchemy recipes, you $%%&amp;$ grr) and an improved bash (actually we slam to be more precise), usable with bear form. Seems fitting for a sorta primitive battle healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm sorry I should have been more clear, I didn't mean just for shaman, I meant for all classes.<br />
I figured since most classes has the ability to sneak, forage, safe fall(if they pick the right race) It would be to have a AA to do that. Again very low skill.<br />
I did mention as well that track was really pushing it, a extremly skill max would be nice still, but I'd be happy with the others. :)</div></div><hr />
