Welp there you have it. Straight from a person who talks to the dev's mouth.<br />
<br />
It is not a bug. So it must be a feature.<br />

KY is just there to do a job on the forum, she has no way to get in contact with anyone in the developement team, SHE IS A FORUM MODERATOR, that is all, the fact shes posting BS about nothing she can get info about is hilarious.<br />
 <br />
the only person we can even rely on is Brenlo, and thats slightly, because after all, he works for Sony and has thier best interests in mind, not that of the customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is anyone really surprised by this?  They admitted that Dot agro was broken or was it just poison dots either way has it been fixed?  The worst part is my 6-year-old niece could figure this out in a night or two of playing.  I would like to think that they are professionals and that they understood there game but, if they can’t even tell us our class description after months do you really think they can figure this one out with or without parses?</div></div><hr />

This is your time to get to work and start producing that Dot agro is ****ed up. Put the logs showing you casting a dot and getting agro instantly from it.<br />
Dont bitch..get to work and lets prove them wrong.<br />
This is also an issue on the necro boards.<br />
