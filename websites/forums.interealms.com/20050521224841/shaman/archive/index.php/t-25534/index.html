<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that there are other threads dealing with titles but after doing a search through them I could not find any feedback dealing with my question; which is, Why can we not have the title of 'Expert' when we have maxed Alchemy? If it is because Alchemy is not considered a 'tradeskill' then why offer us apprentice alchemist or journeyman alchemist? It appears to me that the 'Expert' title was made to fit with all tradeskills (to include fishing, alchemy, tinkering) and that you get the title journeyman at 200 skill, and expert at 250. Since tinkering goes up to 250, there is no problems from the Gnomes point of view.  Why cant it be adjusted for alchemy and fishing? seems a resonable request to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We get shafted on the title, but we actually come out ahead on the skill, since, as has been pointed out, at 200, the 15% mod gets you to 230; at 250, a 15% mod would get you to the hardcap of 252 or some such.</div></div><hr />

Answer from the devs reported to me today ..<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;From Dev...<br />
 <br />
<br />
There are no plans to change the hierarchy of the tradeskill titles -- You obtain the titles at various skill levels, which are the same for all skills, regardless of their cap (fishing has the same cap).<br />
<br />
In the future, if we increase the cap, alchemists will most certainly get the appropriate titles.<br />
