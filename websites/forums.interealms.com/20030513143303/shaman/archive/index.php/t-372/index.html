<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... from WIS-focused to HP/AC focused life.  Now looking for things to solo to get my defensive skill up while my puppy nibbles on them.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for a 44 shaman?  I'd like to melee with a minimum of offensive casting (dot,  slow, cripple, tank).  Important thing for me is that it actually tries to HIT me so my Defense will improve, so I can go back to soloing tougher things again.<br />
<br />
Current defense is a sad 161.  Offense is just shy of 200 now, tho, and piercing's getting there.<br />
<br />
1hb is lagging :(  and 2hb is practically nonexistant, FYI. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, don't quite remember when I did it, you may be a little high, but I tanked unslowed Yeti's in dreadlands, along thewall to the left just as you exit the tunnel from the hidden valley.  They hit fast, but don't do much damage, built up about 30 defense there.  Just pulled em, and let the puppy bite em.  I think I may have poisoned or diseased them, not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a suggestion, and this may not be possible at Level 44 (I did this pre-40), but if you can survive without slowing MOBs, do it, as your Defense will go up much faster. Try casting Incapacitate on them, buffing yourself up as much as possible (it doesn't matter whether or not they actually hit you), and tanking for your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unslowed Yeti sounds good.  They're simple enough that I can always finish 'em off the easy way if/when it starts to get out of hand.  <br />
<br />
Con color will affect it, right?  Zilch from greens, not much from lt blus, d blus give more, clear up to the red=dead ones?  Standing back and letting a mammoth have its way with me wouldn't work, would it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ulthork in EW is another good option.  Good loots also.<br />
<br />
Just slowed it, pet, dot like normal xp solo, just remember to tank.<br />
Some still blue to me at 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Ulthorks in EW to max my offense and defence.<br />
<br />
I gained most of my offense off of the blues that turned to run.  If you do not use a very high damage weapon, you can follow along behind these big old critters whacking them for skill gains for quite awhile before they finally drop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is easy to do at almost any level.  At 44 I would find a group and ask if you can buff their whole group for the trade of letting you attack their mobs MELEE (you wont do enough damage to them to steal the exp) and they will get free shammy buffs.  I did this for a couple of days and built up my attack and defense skills.  Especially if they dont mind you beating on the fresh mobs (from multiple pulling groups) when the main mob is at about 40 health.  That way you get beat on pretty good and your attack will stink bad enough that it is easy to have the tank pull the mob off you.<br />
<br />
Also Giants in Rathe are great for building up defense.  I do the following without my pet:<br />
<br />
Slow<br />
Root<br />
Dot -  I prefer disease for this<br />
Tank untill dead<br />
(rinse and repeat)<br />
<br />
Note keep all AC buffs and HP buffs up.  Also Chloro...Lastly dont forget to have trained in channeling...too many young shammy forget to train in this for some reason and well....how do you plan to re-root or dot them when they are beating on you.<br />
<br />
Also, Keep a good DD memmed in case you get hammered on and I also always keep my gate up for this event.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A nice place I've been hunting to up my defense is Echo Caverns on Luclin. I hunt the underbulks in the hallways since it is easy to single pull them. I slow them and incapacitate and then just go to it. Fully buff yourself of course, but other than that, things should go smoothly. My defense went from 160ish to 190 (currently) in roughly a level of experience. The underbulks do hit hard and decently fast, so I recommend slowing them. Incapacitate helps out tremendously. I only nuke if the critter runs down the hallway and gets too close to the guard. She'll kill it and 'bye-bye' experience. :\ Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail!<br />
<br />
I was stuck at 191 for what seemed the longest time.<br />
On the old (corrupted) boards, I too sought out methods.<br />
<br />
Here's what I tried:<br />
1)  Ping Fuzzlecutter in WFP.  <br />
After multiple attempts before I gave up on him, I received a total of 2 points.  Each time I'd buff myself to the hilt, and incapacitate him after I was hasted.  When I was down to 2 bubs, I'd root ping, back up and self-heal.  Rinse and repeat until 10-20% mana, then root and zone.  Heal &amp; Med up, rinse and repeat again.  Rather boring, but very safe.  PS:  Don't kill him, and warn the newbies not to try to help you, because I usually had an audience each time I did this.  I also announced in /ooc what I was doing, in case any traveling gnomes wanted to use him for vending w/ good faction before I started whaling on him.  Be kind and /petition for him to be repopped once you are done with a practicing session.<br />
<br />
2) Forest Giants in FV.<br />
A GREAT camp while levelling in the mid 40's.  Without a JBB, you'll need a partner though.  I received the remainder of my defense points (hit 200 and missed the message I was having so much fun) while soloing these.  I also picked up 3 levels and 3 forest loops there... :D<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In the old world, specs work well also.  If you can get a partner, I'd recommend SF's as well as they really don't hit that hard if your ac is good (mine being 840 at 45) and they slow well and give a nice long fight.  Sure you won't be leveling quick, but I picked up about 5 points in piercing last night (my defense has been maxed since it could be maxed) in a 2 hour period, but my partner was a chanter charming Gornit and I had been garou'd a few times (either that or bear form wore off in like 5 minutes a few times...)<br />
<br />
Specs are just pesky because they have that stupid stun and drain but the upside is if you have a howler it works on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hm.  Mine's still mid-700s.  Mostly Jarsath, but slowly improving with my defensive skills.  SIGH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I've been in EW on the north shore hunting Ulthork Hunters and Warriors since level 39.  I'm about to ding 42.  <br />
<br />
My defense is now at 191 or 192.  It was around 180-185 when I started in EW.  Hopefully I can raise it a few more points before I am done with the Ulthorks.<br />
<br />
I am not using a pet at all.  Just slowing, DoT'ing, and melee.  The Warriors (lv. 34-36?) I usually root and let their health drop to 1/2 to 1/3 before melee.  The Hunters (lv. 32-34?) I melee the whole fight without a problem (and my AC is only around 780 or so, really need to upgrade a tad in the next level or two).<br />
<br />
<br />
I may try melee with the Hunters unslowed tonight or tomorrow.   In your high 30's or early 40's I would not reccommend trying unslowed melee with the Warriors though, they can hit pretty hard (70's) and when they double punch it adds up.<br />
<br />
I've been able to raise my offense to 200 here and my piercing has gone up about 20 points as well.<br />
<br />
This area is definately GREAT to raise you combat/defense skills!!!!<br />
