<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I descided to take matters into my own hands and go camp the dasterdly rascals on the wall in PoM..Huge freaking mistake..a lvl 60 shaman cant do it..of if they can it elludes me..Those mobs are only blue, but they break root faster then a fat chick snatching a twinkie from your hand..Whats up with those mobs..also foudn out the hard way that there is a bee in the woods who can see invis..that sucked as well..anywyas, any ideas would be helpfull..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">60 and under I can see it being a lot tougher since your dots have up front damage that can break root. <br />
<br />
At 65 it's a cakewalk with petrfying earth lasting up to 3 mins and dots that don't break root. Even dogdog can tank them with just a single cast of Q per battle to keep him alive. <br />
<br />
If you're having trouble at 60 try getting a tank to go with ya. I'm sure just the two of ya wouldn't have any problems with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malo will help your roots hold, if you're not already using it.  But, yeah, without the 64 and 65 DOTs you'll be breaking root a lot even without the rascals breaking it on their own.<br />
<br />
Also, all PoM named see invis (and summon.  and mitigate slow.  and have a hell of a lot of hitpoints.)  I'm guessing you ran into Bzzbuzzana, she's fairly common to find up and is quite a handful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">61 Shaman here, soloing PoM wall.<br />
<br />
My method:<br />
<br />
Summon Scooby, buff Scooby.<br />
<br />
Pull with Slow.  If you have trouble sticking Slow pull with Malo.<br />
<br />
Let Scooby get aggro and back out.  Lay on first DoT.<br />
<br />
Heal Scooby if necessary.<br />
<br />
Lay on second DoT (here comes the rascal for sure).<br />
<br />
Melee a bit then root and back off.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on Scooby, heal if necessary.  Refresh any DoT that runs.<br />
<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
No, it isn't fast.  But it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 65 it is a lot easier, I tank them up front, alpha pet, using Ultor, BoS x2 and epic dot x2, then chain JBB. I only need a Quies once or twice a fight self buffed (am at the low end of HP self buffed, ~3300). <br />
<br />
Since the level of these are 52-56ish, I give pet Gnoll hide lariats and Serrated bone dirks for the stun/snare proc. Gotta be careful too, since pet pushes them around, and if they fall off you'll get adds when they swim through the water and run up the invis ramp.<br />
<br />
Very boring camp too, like others I've spent like 30+ hours there, and only seen 2 yaeth pg. 73 right's. Enough to get me and a close friend our RGC, but boring and rare enough to want to try to farm them for cash. /sigh<br />
