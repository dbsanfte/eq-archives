I get that too, but usually I just take it with a grain of salt, give 'em a wink and say &quot;trust me.&quot;  Then when I'm main healing, slowing, pulling, and CCing, usually the doubters are the ones begging me for a group the <br />
next day.</div></div><hr />

That's a really good group for normal adventures.<br />
<br />
That paladin was braindead, and whoever said that those classes sucked as a group needs to get hit with the proverbial clue-by-four.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe the paladin didnt like the idea of using 6 peridots for symbols ;)<br />
<br />
Actually the main problem with having the shaman as healer is you do not get the symbol and you do not get the hp/ac buff either...  Means everyone has lots fewer hit points...  plus no rezzes if someone dies...  Paladin handles most of the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I hate being main healer. Just not the way I choose to play. I did an LDoN with a similar group to the one you described above. I told the Paladin I would go as the slower, and he said no problem just slow and DPS. I went out to join them and found that there was no healer. Ok, we'll see how it goes. Turns out he healed himself most of the way, I only threw on a Q now and then if we had multiple mobs and they were resisting my slows. Did 2 missions that way, him healing and tanking the whole time. Was a very impressive feat. I guess your Paladin was not of the same calibre. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Occasionally you get an assasination mission with an enchanter or shaman mob as the target, these are tough to heal for because the mobs start off hasted and often people will drop before you get slow to land.  Otherwise healing in LDoN is really not that hard and can be done by a shaman no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">plus no rezzes if someone dies...<br />

They had a necro.  Necro &gt; Cleric for normal LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The usual group I go with in my guild is me (shaman), pally, pally, mage, necro, and enchanter.  Sometimes we have a healer in place of a pally that's not on, sometimes we don't.  Either way, it usually doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
A shaman and a pally should have no trouble healing for a group in normal LDoN.<br />
<br />
Especially in ours.  When we have no C-healer, the chanter pacs for single pulls.  When we do have a C-healer, the pally just pulls everything and lets the chanter mez the adds.<br />
<br />
Call me a masochist, but I much prefer just pulling it all and sorting it out back at the group.  It makes an otherwise mind-numbingly boring LDoN exciting.  Nothing gets your blood flowing like 6 mobs charging down the hallway chasing your tank.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy, either drop Q on the main tank before you engage, or have someone kite him around a bit till slowed. I usually just drop Q on the MA, pull with Malos and slow right away, piece of cake in 99% of all cases (normal difficulty)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shamans can heal just fine in most dungeon groups. A cleric is largely unnecessary unless you want to do high risk, and if you insist on a cleric, most of the time they'll be a mediocre nuker and mediocre melee.<br />
<br />
Of course, the exception to this is if your tanks are very badly geared. I have seen 65 tanks with only around 3000 hp unbuffed, and the fewer HP they have, the less leeway you have to get stuff slowed before you need to heal.<br />
<br />
With elemental geared tanks, keep a regen on them and the occasional quiescence and you should be fine for most pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lol that's pretty funny considering they can heal plenty in that group even if you left. Necro+Pally is easily enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow.. That Pally is really narrow minded.  Just wanted to share my experience.<br />
<br />
I was invited to a LDON group the other night.  I gladly accepted and we were on our way very quickly.  Unlike other times I didn't do my usual role call before heading in to the dungeon.  It was an average group of 59-63.  Me being 62 at the time and without Malo/Torpor (yes I know I'm a poor Shaman).  Just before we entered I noticed the Regen Icon appear on my screen so I figured that we had a druid in the group to heal.  After entering I started my usual slowing of mob.  But noticed that after evey mobs death the Main tank was not being healed.  So I didn't think nothing of it until the Main tank got down to 35% about 5-6 mobs in and still hadn't received a heal.  I did a /who and noticed that it was a ranger that had regened me and we had no primary healer.  Well needless to say we had a task to kill 55 mobs.  We got down to 10 mobs left with 45 mins left before the puller pulled 4 mobs back and we had a group wipe.  We still managed to recover everything and finish successfully.  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out that you don't need Torpor/Q to make you an efficent healer.  But I'm sure they help greatly :)<br />
<br />
So to all you non belivers out there.. It is possible to Heal and Slow!!  It just means your busier :)</div></div><hr />

Even have time to throw a rain or nuke on mobs, with the occasional dot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Some people just don't understand what other class's can do.  Here are a few situations i've been in.<br />
<br />
1.  Pally, ranger, drood, wizzy, war, shaman, LF a cleric.  find one and cleric asking 100?'s  first one &quot;what you don't have a chanty?&quot; No!.. &quot;who is gonna CC?&quot;  ME... &quot;how are you gonna do that?&quot;..  then i just ask him if he want to group or continue to ask questions.... he caved and shuddup...  mission complete in 40 mins..<br />
<br />
2.  No clerics or droods LFG?   Take 2 shaman!  I've done this several times.  Put one shaman on heals/tears of saryn and the other shaman on slows/cc/Tears... No other shaman LFG, grab a BST, BST 50% slow works great for ldon.  The only thing i make sure is that we have a pally, just to make sure we have rez's covered.<br />
<br />
3. Been on a few missions when the cleric/drood LD's and people want to wait for them to return.  I'm like &quot;Pull Plz&quot;.. groups says &quot;cleric LD&quot;.. I say &quot;and?&quot;....&quot;just pull plz&quot;...  so we take down a few mobs and tank is constantly asking hows mana i reply everytime 70-80m gtg and group seems dumbfounded....  &quot;wow, I didn't know shaman could heal so well&quot;... my reply, &quot;Never grouped with me before have you&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I think alot of comes down to people NOT knowing what other classes can do..  take a day off from playing your shaman and start some alts, just to give you a taste of what other classes go through.  I find it kinda sad that a 60+ players do not know that shaman can heal, or even be the main healer in a group..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with the above posters that Pally + Necro + Shammy should be plenty of healing. As someone who plays both a shammy and a paladin, I know that if my pally has KEI he alone has enuff manna and healing powa to play cleric at 63 for many LDON groups. <br />
<br />
Not to defend that &quot;tard&quot; of a paladin, but perhaps he was not aware of the power of torpor or Q? He should at 65, but I have found more and more people who do not bother to find out the capabilities of other classes, and what they bring to the table. It used to be you learned this around 50th level, but now that it is so easy to hit 60, the learining curve is pushed later too. <br />
<br />
Perhaps, like many people playing this game now, the player wasnt looking for a challenge. There is an entitlement sickness developing more and more in EQ that time + minimum effort = reward. If I put in the time, I should get the reward, regardless of effort. Sounds like the paladin wanted the Ideal group, and in the Ideal group, there is no effort. Doesn't sound like fun to me.</div></div><hr />

Then again, I usually don't have to deal with the stereotype, since I'm rather well known on my server as a really competent player, so people are usually just going to trust me, shut up, and get to work.  <br />
Especially now, with Healing AA's maxed, Imp.HealingIV item, and all the AA's I have, healing a group is a breeze in pretty much any zone.  PoEarth is the only &quot;hard&quot; zone for me to heal in, and I have no problems if we keep pulls to one at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman with all the AA + Gear are actually the BEST healer in LDON.<br />
Better than a Druid or Cleric.<br />
3 Second Quiessence that heals 2100 to 2400 a tic, is simply better than anything a druid offers.  It's also better than the mighty CH because in practice clerics don't CH that often in normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Depends on your puller, if your getting singles or maybe doubles maybe triples sure.<br />
<br />
But screw up and get a room pull and people are going to die it's that simple. You don't have the ability no matter how l33t you are to channel mutliples heals while being hit for 350+ a pop by one or more mobs. You'll have to take the time to channel root, probably more then one root before you can even think about healing, meanwhile casters are dying, tanks are getting loh, paladin is trying to keep aggro and do your job of healing etc etc. <br />
<br />
Shaman are not the best choice for healing and I don't blame that guy for leaving at all. Sometimes you just don't want the stress having a sub par group adventure, especially if your not getting a cleric out of hubris. If your groups sitting around waiting for 30 mins for a cleric to join that's a different matter and letting people leave that don't want to rely on a 2nd rate healer is polite.</div></div><hr />

Other than not knowing what shaman could do, he really did well, always called his nukes so I could have root ready, kept DS's and arch shield refreshed, and evac'd to save our butts on a couple occasions when we got 4 or more. Some people just don't group much or not with shaman anyway.<br />

With all your spells and a bunch of AAs (I dont have any healing AAs though), being the primary healer and slower is pretty easy, though I dont like to go in without some sort of CC other than myself when Im dual boxing and only healer.<br />
<br />
With a paladin in a ldon group its stupid easy to be the primary healer as a shaman imo.  Funny, I asked a sk the other day if he wanted to join a non-cleric group, said he passed, so told him it was his loss, found a paladin lfg a few mins later and waxed the adventure.</div></div><hr />

See, this is the problem.  When I'm playing my rogue, I don't trust any shaman that I don't know.  I've run into way too many who can barely seem to handle slowing, much less healing also.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I'm having trouble with clerics and druids too.  Too many clerics think they are a melee now, and don't seem to be able to manage their mana.  Too many druids think they don't have to snare if they are main healer.</div></div><hr />

This board spoils you. The Shaman who post here (except me :)) are often in a PoElemental / PoTime guild, have been playing for quite a while, have forgotten more than a lot of &quot;casual&quot; players will ever know, have tried and discarded multiple single, raid and solo strategies, et. al.<br />
<br />
Not saying there AREN'T some good Shaman who don't read this board, but people come here to LEARN. And a person who is interested in learning is a person who is going to (hopefully) get better and smarter about their class.<br />
<br />
Shoot, I still miss reading Eduin, Tudamorf, Talamay, even ol Nixx (iirc). <br />
<br />
However, the game has changed a bit as well. When I first started playing in..summer 2000...people OFTEN DIED (shocking I know) in experience groups. <br />
<br />
Today? If someone dies not only do people get upset, but there is a reason why. (Not that there wasn't before we just often &quot;weren't sure&quot;). For example, when I am on my Enchanter, and 6 MOBS come in and I only get 4 locked before the 5th, 550 a pop one nails the Cleric - I get mad at MYSELF.<br />
<br />
But I do the same thing you do - when I am in a group and there is a 'bad' Shaman, I think of this board and ask them if they have ever been here. That can sometimes introduce tension as often the first question out of their mouth is &quot;Yeah - why?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My experience in playing often with a 65 necro is that they usually do most of the healing in LDoN groups.  I usually use AoE slow, Q anyone that really needs a heal, and thats about it.  Its no exaggeration to say that I have been in groups where I only healed maybe 3-4 times throughout the entire adventure.  Zephir's (sp?) group lifetap is that good.<br />
<br />
Add an additional pally, and your group easily had more than enough healing power at its disposal.<br />
<br />
I think these misconceptions get started because shammies do REALLY suck at healing from about level 34 up to about 51, and are still underpowered, healing-wise, until about 62.  Once we get our final fast heal, we can do ok, and with Q, its a no-brainer.  I have easily out-healed 65 clerics on high-hp/low-DPS velious mobs and have also stepped in and entirely replaced clerics that have died on the pull.<br />
<br />
The key is that shammies cannot heal as well as a cleric over a short period of time (burst DPS); as the battles lengthen out, however, shammies become equal and eventually surpass clerics in overall healing output.  And LDoN groups function exactly like one long battle against a low-DPS mob.<br />

As for the person who said &quot;not the best buffs, and no rezzer&quot; (dont feel like scrolling) what difference does that make? Grab a KEI and a Po9 around the camps, and the Pally symbols. No brainer. As for no rezz, well, both Pally and Necro can rez, and you can also just wait for the corpses to get spit out and rez them. Run back, leave an item, get it rezzed later. You have 3 hours. Hell, sit by the enterance to the dungeon and wait for a group with a cleric to come along, if you need too.</div></div><hr />

While it would appear that this Paladin in particular is an idiot he may have had his own reasons, rightfully so, for not trusting you (since he didn't know you). Or he really could have been a sheep that refused to do anything different. Either way, not an affront to Shaman everywhere by any means. <br />

I think these misconceptions get started because shammies do REALLY suck at healing from about level 34 up to about 51<br />
_____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
God, I hope not.  My regular LDoN group is shaman, pally, rogue and wizard.  So far, we are 24-1 (just finished 10 in Guk and got Shrew).  No deaths except when the rogue went &quot;scouting&quot; ;p.  The pally is good at holding aggro and has good gear, so basically I just regen and GHeal her.  The next 10 levels could get rough, but at 44 I get Stoicism and the pally gets Ethereal Cleansing.  And at 45 we can use KEI.  So it seems like it should get easier after 44.  Time will tell though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I leveled thru the 30s and 40s before the advent of the KEI market or Stoicism, so my perspective may be a bit jaded, but I distinctly recall being useless for healing until I got Superior Healing at 51.  Trying to make do with a 300 point Greater Heal while your tank is getting hit for 100+ just doesn't cut it.  Clerics, meanwhile, get Complete Heal at 39.<br />
<br />
Don't stress it though.  Every class has periods throughout their career when they are reletively underpower compared to other classes.  Though the 30s, shammies are relatively weak (just compare them to druids quadding for 2 blues every 5 mins), but the situation starts to change in the 50s, and by 60 you'll be solo'ing nameds that many classes regard as a full-group encounter. Just grin and bear it; trust me, it gets better later on. ;-)</div></div><hr />

Well, if there's an enchanter IN GROUP I won't actually go so far as to click off KEI when he casts it.<br />

Of course if the people are well geared and skilled then it shouldn't be an issue. LDoN isn't really all that hard. But in a pickup group you can't take that for granted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">HAH! The group mentioned is anything BUT fragile.  They have an amazing amount of healing potential (shaman, paladin, necro--group tap as well as ranger backup).  Most of the classes in the group have root; why does the shaman alone need to be responsible for rooting/crowd control?  They have a pretty high DPS potential.<br />
<br />
What do they lack?<br />
1. Mez--big deal.<br />
2. Pacify (unless it was the &lt;63 avg level dungeon in which the paladin would have been able to)<br />
3. Cheal (who cares?  Cheals aren't necessary in normal LDON adventures for the most part)<br />
4. Mana regen buff in group (boo-hoo, KEI lasts 2.5+ hours)<br />
5. Rez (unless whoever pulled got like 10 caster adds I don't see this as a real issue anyway AND its typically bad to rez mid-adventure anyway)<br />
<br />
Seriously, the group would have been nearly perfect, and anyone that thinks otherwise should probably be drug out back and shot.  The only exception I could allow for is they all were very poorly equipped.  As far as that goes, I am unable to determine as I wasn't there and their gear isn't mention AFAIK.</div></div><hr />

I once got invited to a group with no cleric/druid/chanter. The pally in the group was using some crazy weapon that procs 100hp+ group heal every 2 to 3 hit she landed on the mob. The bard was pulling multi, mezzing, twisting at least 5 songs at once (I think). Wiz was really really smart to take adventage of crit nuke by chain nuking a low level nuke (he told me the nuke uses 150mana) that dmg for around 1200 with the crit. Mana and hp were no problem at all. I rarely healed anyone in group.<br />
<br />
No mob last longer than 20 secs. After a few mobs I just stop slowing and nuke =)</div></div><hr />

Jeez, this group has 2 pet classes (= 2 emergency off tanks), 2 rooters and the best slowing class in it. Btw paladins get rezz, so rezz was not missing ...  ;) (together with a pack of additional heals to help, that is if the pally wouldn't be incompetent). Hopefully the original poster got his 'no group'-list up to date.<br />
<br />
Had a bit of an argument yesterday with a warrior of one of the EP guilds on my server, because our group had no cleric or druid (but a bard puller, go figure). A nice guy altogether, but he didn't want to believe that group would work well. Finished in 35 mins ... (granted, several people were elemental level). The warrior got Q maybe 15-20 times throughout the dungeon - healing done.<br />
<br />
Or is it, that there are too many 'i never heal'-shamans out there?</div></div><hr />

We started doing LDoN and I played healer OK.  Gradually I got better as I made small changes in my playstyle.  Keeping Malo(s), 2 slows (Turgurs and targars), AE slow (tigirs), AE Rain, Q, Tnargs and Cann4 all loaded I could handle almost any situation, especially once I got VP.  On triple pulls, no one died, in fact, on one Miragul 5-6 pull I kept everyone alive (BL puller said everytime he'd pull that for a cleric at least one person died, of course, I got lucky on having a BL with the 65 slow and a lucky Tigir's cast).  I've been the prime healer in a tactics kitchen group with one death, although it was amazing exp when we got a 2nd shaman and split roles.<br />
<br />
The paladin in the origional poster's story was an idiot, be thankful he didn't stay.  Some shaman don't like healing, frankly I love it.  The RNG sometimes goes on a hate on with me and I get frustrated with slows.  Heals don't get resisted and make a nice change of pace.</div></div><hr />

Also agree.  More concise words of wisdom via Jinheim.<br />
<br />
I used to be main/only healer in lower level LDoNs back when I was way more mana challenged and had less healing options.  This became less of an option at a certain point but once you get our ICH (incomplete heal) I think it's easily doable again.  I'm only 61st...at 65 and with AA I'd think it'd be very easy to be the only healer on a normal LDoN.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that I could be the only healer on a normal LDoN right now and do everything else I normally do.  I usually don't torpor dance on normal LDoNs and my clerics are usually bored to the point of doing celestials on me, meleeing, or nuking for lack of anything else to do.  That or I'm with regulars and we intentionally do continual overpulls to make things more spicy, in which case there cleric usually keeps busy.</div></div><hr />

Zevfeer is great, but meaningless as a crisis heal.<br />
<br />
I guess the paladin could use group heals to both keep the party up and focus agro on himself. I think it's fairly high agro. How many unslowed mobs on the paladin can the shaman cope with? Interesting question. Clearly the paladin had doubts.</div></div><hr />

Mind wrack is situational as the MOB needs to have mana to tap, but I suppose it would work well, and I hadn't really thought about that :)<br />
<br />
Most people don't want the 90% rez (silly, I know), and I dont think the necro would have wanted to fork over essence emeralds to rez unless he knew the people in group.  If it was me, I doubt I'd be rezzing people with a necro with the cost to me so great.<br />

<br />
A few minutes later, the druid leaves, so the group is WAR MNK MNK ENC SHM.<br />
<br />
We didn't even bother asking the Enchanter to slow.  These things are 5 levels bigger and hit twice as hard as LDoN mobs, so someone's just on something there.  I volunteered to tank in LDoN the other day, someone was getting desperate, and probably would've taken me up on it, if a Pally hadn't logged on right then.</div></div><hr />
