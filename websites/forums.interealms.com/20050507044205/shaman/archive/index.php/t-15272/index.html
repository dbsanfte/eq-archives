Jaradis might know what's up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They've had a bad hard drive on the server since last week. They initially said they would replace it on Wednesday, and that was postponed until Thursday, and then on Friday night, they said it would happen Saturday.<br />
<br />
They have also had a bug going since last weekend where changes you make to your characters are not being updated on the profile displays. Almost like they have cached all the old data, and are only sending that out.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem was more involved than they thought it was, and that they are now down until they get whatever is broken replaced.</div></div><hr />
