<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I stopped playing EQ several months ago and i was reading up on castersrealm that Torpor is now researchable!!? Is this true and if so how does one go about getting it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you need yaeths compendium 118, yaeths compendium 107, words of sapience, and words of revenant. I think there is a subject stickied in the equipment section that gives some of the drop areas, or at least areas they &quot;have&quot; dropped in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you get lucky and get those as drops don't bother buying them for high prices.  You can buy Quiescence (upgrade to Torpor) for a lot less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A lot of priest spells are researchable now. Check out Eqtraders.com to find out info on all the recipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As Jaradis stated, Quiescence might be the better way to go, for a lot less. For example, on Karana, Quiescence sells for 40K-60k, semi-common. Torpor is a rare spell, and sells for 60k-90k+ still.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, to research the spell, you need all the components that Karshak posted, then a friend to research it for you. They may get lucky and do it first time, but then again they may not. Costs per component will vary greatly too. Again, on Karana, I got Words of Sapience for about 50pp, Words of Revenant are currently selling for 8k (first time in 6 months I've seen these for sale in bazaar), Yaeth's 118 (right) is pretty rare, paid 1k or less, then Yaeth's 107 (left) has yet to be seen for sale there. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/em Kicks self for choosing 7th Hammer.<br />
<br />
Prices on 7th for 65 spells are all 150K plus, with minor exceptions, seen BoS for 65k once.  Torpor was for sale in the bazaar for 75k yesterday either went quick or seller ended trader mode.  <br />
<br />
So I started collecting the research parts.  Found Yaeth 118Right for 5k, Words of Revenant for 3k, and Words of Sapience for 100pp.  I am now looking for 107Left, but havent seen it in the bazaar or on bazaar channel.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On torv torpor is selling for 35kpp, Q is selling for 60kpp, malo 20-25kpp, malos 45kpp, pox was seen for 10kpp yesterday (I only had 3kpp or I woulda grabbed it since I never see it for sale). All the other spells seem to be 30-60kpp range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, indeed Torpor can be researched.  Obtaining the components was a lot easier than I thought, I believe the total cost was a little over 5k. Check vendors, at least one, and possible two of the components my friends found on vendors, for about 10 Plat per.  One part dropped at the Zone In to Cazic Thule, and the last piece I believe was purchased for around 5k.<br />
<br />
Here is a shout out to my friends Agoniste and Oogg, who went out of their way to keep their eyes open for these parts.  Thank you both</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone know where Yaeth's 107 (left) drops from?</div></div><hr />

Then you have luck akin to winning the lottery- on my server (A Ro) you will not see any of the drops for torpor, malo, avatar, etc... for sale as the Wall St traders buy them, research the spell, then sell it at the exact same price it sold for 3 years ago in the EC tunnel.  On the upside, a casual player can now grind to 65 and buy the better L65 spells from the multitude of uber guilds raping the elemental planes, at least whenever the ubers deign to turn in their backpacks of runes to get spells for their bazaar mules.  Only downside to this is at last check the resident uber guild had 5+ million plat banked so their need to sell runes is prolly less than their desire to keep the non-uber unable to get spells. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I take all that back, I did see Words of Revenant for sale recently for 10k, I should be rejoicing, my bad.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I researched BOTH Torpor and Malo from bazaar bought components for a total of about 5kpp.  Took a little while to find them all at resonable prices but can be done if you are dilligent.  I have also researched Acumen of Dar Khura, Tigir's Insects, Avatar, Voice of the Berserker, Levitation, Everlasting Breath and a few others that escape me at the moment.  Spell research has been incredibly good IMO.<br />
<br />
And if you can't see the increased availability in our spells and better (but still not great) prices on our spells then you aren't really paying close enough attention.<br />
<br />
I have also made tons of other spells which I have sold and have generated about 150kpp to my bank account to help with affording some of the rarer PoP spells I still need.<br />
<br />
It can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I am glad I kept the faith, I found the last part I needed for Torpor in the bazaar yesterday and was fortunate on the combine, so I now have Torpor and it cost 10,100pp for me to buy the pages needed.<br />
<br />
GL to all, and keep the faith, those pages will pop up for you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was gonna research them but ended up seeing Malo for sale for only 15k so I picked that up quick. Then for the longest time I was looking for the two Yeath pages for Torpor. Already have sapience and two words of the revenants but I NEVER saw the other pages for sale at all, even for an insane price. Just kept my eye on Torpor and saw three people selling it for a month with no takers. Eventually one guy got as low as 33k and I got it then.<br />
<br />
Now if the Words of Revenant are really worth that much I'll just sell them and put it towards my Q fund for 65. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ive made Malo 2 times now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After no luck whatsoever on spell research, suddenly in the last week I made:<br />
Primal Essence: 1/1<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura: 1/2<br />
Everlasting Breath: 1/2<br />
Avatar: 1/1<br />
<br />
This is w/ 195 research skill + geerlok on enchanter w/ 230 int.  All research drops from bazaar- I was pretty irritated failing AoDK the 2nd time, bleh.<br />
<br />
Sadly the (rare) research drops for Malo, Torpor and Pox (the big 3) I've yet to see for sale.  PE was a huge upgrade for me, I'm now _slightly_ less bitter about spell research hehe.  Would still love to see what the game is like w/ torpor/malo though, resists on Malosini/Slow in PoV really suck.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've gotten Primal Essence, Remove Greater Curse, Levitation, Everlasting Breath, group Acumen, and Pox all from spell research.<br />
<br />
It takes some diligence to find the components.  And a fair bit of watching &quot;So and so has looted...&quot; on raids.  :)<br />
<br />
It's out there, it works, some of the components are still annoyingly rare though.  <br />
<br />
It is a big help that my guild has a research component banker and members are encouraged to save all the little doohickies they pick up and give them to her.  If your guild already has a spellbank it may not be a big step to take.  :)</div></div><hr />
