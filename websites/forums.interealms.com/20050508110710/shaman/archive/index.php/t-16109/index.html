<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rgol The Greatspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like most of you I am sure your casting Torpor/Q after your can V so I though I would make a full button that would to it all in one punch.<br />
<br />
/g blah blah 2k dmg blah blah I know u have seen it<br />
/pause 30, /alt activate 47<br />
/pause 5, /target   (put your name here)<br />
/pause 3, cast 3    (this is were I put Torpor/Q)<br />
/cast 3                 (Just in Case you fizzle)<br />
<br />
I have encountered many different lag situations and the pauses set here seam to be the best. They could be a little faster in zone zones or non-raids but this is the best setup I have found that works every time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">God I love quiescence.   Saved my arse yesterday.   Was fighting a level 65 SK and I got a little distance between us getting ready for his Deathtouch and barely got a Q off on myself just as he DT'es.   Took me down to 0% health and Q heals me enough quick enough that his lifetaps afterwards don't get me.   I end up killing him. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't use a hotkey.  I will take all the healing that the healer wants to give me.  I never correct them for overhealing either. . . if they run oom from it and that is a problem .  i just take over heals in addition to my other duties. . . . things work out. <br />

Q is da bomb</div></div><hr />
