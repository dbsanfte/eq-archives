Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The rogue shaman in Warsliks spawns in the first camp of Forsaken Iksar you come to when you zone in from FoB.  I think it took an hour or two to spawn him when I did that quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jlumpkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hired a tracker...he was up in multiple spawns..just hard to pick him out.  Found him along the left side approaching the giant fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are we talking about the Rogue Shaman or the Goblin Hextracer here?  If it's the Shaman, I'll stand by what I said earlier, if it's the Hextracer, Csin and EQphreak are correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whoops, I was talking about the Hextracer my bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jlumpkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I found it after many spawns at first camp from fob. Thanks for help all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Camp near 1st camp from FoB<br />
Bring some newpaper or a good book<br />
Kill all little mob pop<br />
.. and wait ..<br />
;)<br />
<br />
he too me 2 hours at least or maibe more<br />
silly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another point to add is that the rogue shaman will pop at the location near FoB and then despawn.  He takes the place of one of the other mobs and is definitely on some independent timer.  I ran through this area quite a bit and almost always saw him up at night unless the spot was camped.<br />
<br />
It may be best to just let this spawn happen instead of trying to force it.  I spent 6 hours straight there killing and never saw the rogue shaman once.  When I left the spawn and came back in a few hours he was up and cudgel #2 was finished. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A guildy and I have spent hours mowing down everything in the north half of the Pit (from dragon skell to Kurns Tower) in FoB and havent seen a single Rogue Shaman pop.<br />
<br />
So we went and killed all of the bandits in the maurauder cave in the NW corner... Still nothing... Are there any other areas that he can pop in?<br />
<br />
From my observation, the iksar are on the same spawn table as the Badger guys... The problem is, the wolves all agro the badgers and iksars (and vice versa). So not only do you have to kill all of the iksars, you have to kill all the wolves as well (so they won't KS you)...<br />
<br />
I also have seen some iksars wandering around on the eastern side of the zone between the water and Kaesora. Can he spawn in this area as well?<br />

Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fer da Mandible guy, me's seen him a couple of times.  Him wasn't *in* da Pit, him woz on da udda side of Kurn's frum da Pit.  Clean everythin frum Kurn's ta Kaesora and him shud pop purty soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jlumpkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found the mandiible near the first camp off the road (left) toward the pit. So It is in newbee area before pit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, on the advice found here, I changed the area that I was hunting in.<br />
<br />
I moved north from Kaesora to the area about even with Kurn's Tower. I got there at about 10pm or so (game time) and started killing all of the iksar roaming in the area. <br />
<br />
At what had to be the stroke of midnight, a rogue shaman popped on the grassy area near the eastern zone wall and started walking ~SE. I swear I saw him fall outta the sky. He wasn't even SoW'd when I slowed him.<br />
<br />
I resisted his attempt to slow, then he closed to melee... Half a dozen shots to the head with my trusty club and a nuke later, the mandible is mine. <br />
<br />
After I was finished gloating over his corpse, I turned to see where I was at in relation to the Pit ramps. I was (roughly) east of the northern most ramp on the Kaesora side. (First ramp south of Kurn's Tower) When I first seen him, he was at the military crest of the high ground in the grassy area on the sand side. I didn't get a /loc due to the fact that I was giddy that I actually found him. I would say his spawn point is within a few paces of 0,0 if not exactly on it. He's much tougher to track down then the one in WW.<br />
<br />
I then made a bee line to LoIO to look for the 'cudda... Did the &quot;Sense Animal&quot; thing and started moving counter-clockwise around the lake from the Cabilis zone area. At about 12 o'clock (if the lake were a clock) he popped up. I lev'd and headded out, still sensing... When I passed over him, I did a 180, went under the water and nuked... A second later, he attacked me... Again, a few shots to the head and another nuke = dead fishy. Got my Skull with an II, a fresh fish and some fish scales.<br />
<br />
Now I have everything but the clay. So, I ate the fish for lunch, and headed to the nexus to catch the spire down to the Dreadlands. Got Sow, Lev and Invis up, and ran the top of the zone wall to Burning Woods. I stood pretty much at the zone line and foraged. I got my Mendglow Clay on my second attempt. Then I got nothing but a Hornet egg, (which I ate) and some meteor things... /shrugs<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had skilled my pottery up to 50 a while back in prep for fixing the skull... I hustled back to Cabilis and found the pottery wheel. The combine was trivial at 50. <br />
<br />
Hierophent Oxyn was quite pleased with my return of the skulls. He awarded me the Iron Cudgel of the Seer and sent me on to speak with Crusader Quarg...<br />
