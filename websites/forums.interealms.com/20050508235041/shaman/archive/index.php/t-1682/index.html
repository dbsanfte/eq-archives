<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Friends,<br />
<br />
I seem to be having a hard time finding a good solo ground at level 54. I have hunted the Seafury's until they are mainly lite blue to me. I have tried Skyfire, but to much down time between pulls since most mobs wipe you out of mana, and quite frankly, I sometimes get tired of sitting and Canabalizing hour after hour.<br />
<br />
So, I am looking for some good areas to solo from level 54 to about 56 or 57. <br />
<br />
I have all versions of EQ so traveling is not a problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Scarlet Desert, most are light blues to blues at 54, top of the Plateau should be all blues.<br />
<br />
The Grey, a but too tough for good solo exp but still possible. <br />
<br />
Skyfire, Wyverns and sperms and such, adds and mispulls can ruin your day though, plus it seems to have become crowded lately on 7th hammer.<br />
<br />
SolB, the old classic spot back by the Bats and Spiders, tends to be monopolized a lot, but fairly decent.<br />
<br />
Warning! Do not try to root and rot the snake guards just inside Ssra, they summon and hit hard, double 270ish. Heh, heh, ouchies....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Related question:  When does the entrance to the Hole become soloable?  I hear the zone gives great experience, and you might get lucky and have an IGS drop!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still plenty of blues in Burning Woods at 54.  Giant fort or SF zone are decent camp spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">u have jbb/epic/fungi ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I second the giant forts in BW. i got to lvl 56 there i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye I have to agree with Juventus and Krytog, the giant fort and for that matter BW in general.   I spent most of my time soloing 54 in BW (no JBB or epic).  Actually wasn't to bad.  First I meleed a lot to max out my skills (worth it imo) and then I did the root/rot method to speed things up.<br />
<br />
The giant fort and the entrance to Chardok are camped a lot, so a few other options exist for that zone:<br />
<br />
1) Pull to the zone edge west of the giant fort.  Lots of mobs over there.  So many sometimes that some folk have nick-named it &quot;The Zoo&quot; and/or &quot;The Highway.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Pull hornets to the road where it starts up the hill towards DL.  *Nothing* wanders overthere so no adds.  I did this and had a few gem drop and up to 6pp on a lot of horents.  Not a bad spot.  Just watch out for the hornets are social and they don't run.<br />
<br />
3) There is a small undead house just south of the giant fort.  You could pull to the cracter that the giant fort sits over.  Not bad.  An occasional mob does wander up to the rim and others do pull up there.<br />
<br />
4) Sarnak are not that bad on pulls either.  Just that fighting a shaman can be a pain if he slows you and you are meleeing him.  They also run and with their sow can be a pain.<br />
<br />
Little fyi: You can camp out down in the crater under the giant fort.  Nothing wanders down there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have not completed my epic yet as I am still missing the piece from the Hole which I seem to never be able to get enough people to go there with. Nor do I have JBB's or Fungi. But I like the idea of Burning Woods. I had hunted there a few times so I will that a shot this evening and camp there until the experience or me gives up.<br />
<br />
Thank you All<br />

<br />
Rock Golems still pretty tough. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My favorite pull spot in BW - from the giant fort's ramp, head right and down the hill to the burned area that faces the meteor crater.  (Looks like a big hill from this side).  Mobs wander into the edge of the burned area and just stop.  If you stay deeper in the burned area you are completely safe from wanderers.<br />
<br />
I can solo everything but wurms and Gullerback there easily and safely at 53.  I leave the wurms alone unless I have a melee partner - I can usually kill 'em but I have an awful lot of downtime afterwards.<br />
<br />
Epic - no, JBB - yes, Fungi - no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hunted so much in BW, I managed to make 5 Wurmslayers. That was back in the day when they were worth more than 800p.</div></div><hr />
