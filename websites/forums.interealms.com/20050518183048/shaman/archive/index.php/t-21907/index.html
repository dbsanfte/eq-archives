<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haites Nocturnal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild Emeritus is currently recruiting on Lanys T'vyl.  We are a guild that is playing using an era-progression methodology.  For instance we are starting out only utilizing only old-world and Kunark zones, and limiting equipment to old-world only as well as capping lvls at 50.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to revitalize the older content as well as have fun experiencing the progression all over again.  We will be progressing through the end-game for each era in order starting with &quot;vanilla&quot; or Classic Everquest and finally ending up with the Velious expansion.  As we progress new items, zones, and levels will be unlocked.<br />
<br />
We are looking for dedicated and talented players who are tired of playing in the never-ending ratrace that plagues the current game.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or if you think you would like the chance to go back and have a lot fun doing it all over again, come to the board and submit an application.  <br />

Hope to see you in-game!<br />

Mods Feel free to move to appropriate forum. Thanx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where do I xp for levels 50-60?  Since that was the Kunark era, I will have to xp in Kunark or older zones.  The only two exp-able places there would be Seb and HS.  I doubt I will find many people that will xp with me there.  Is my only solution for the 50s levels to group with guild mates only?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yah...and that's all there was when I did it (Karnors was actually great then, Skyfire and Chardok as well).  <br />

Lucky new kids /shakes cane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CoM is insanely good exp till about 54, where most of the mobs up front will be lt blue and you have to go to the castle or the second floor to find blues.  <br />
<br />
Droga has mobs up to level 61, so you can find pleanty of action there.  I dont know if that will qualify with your current theme, because most of the weapons and armors you will find there are post PoP quality, so this may have to be a no fly zone if you are committed to keeping everything old school.<br />
<br />
Karnors can be exp all the way to 60ish, though it will slow to a crawl post 55 or so.<br />
<br />
Skyfire can get you to 60 as well, though it will be a PITA with the chromodraks.  Guardian wurms are roughly 59-60ish, and also provide spells that you will need.<br />
<br />
Burning Woods giant fort might also be good exp till mid 50's, and then again in Chardok.<br />
<br />
You've already mentioned Seb and Charsis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dinged 60 in Chardok, pre-revamp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did ya'll miss the point the original poster was trying to make?  They start out in the old world, limited to old world items and LEVELS.  Thus you don't have to worry about 50-60 just yet.<br />
<br />
Then as new eras are opened, more levels are added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good luck with this, gonna be hard I bet retaining or even recruiting people but it sounds like fun for a few levels at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lans use to be my server! Sounds like fun, if I was still playing I would try it out. How about revamped zones like cazic thule, or zones that were added on like vexar. That is old world, I guess it depends on how you look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haites Nocturnal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really, there is plenty of zones to level in.  50-60 is pretty fast in HS if you have a good group.<br />
<br />
We are still capped at 50 for the moment, however.<br />
<br />
Retention has been the hardest part of it.  We have had more then enough applicants but some people get burnt out when they figure out that it is indeed a bit of work to level up without twinking and stuff.  Guild has been going for about a month and we have around 40 guilded people atm.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is playing super-consistent but I am going to keep trying to recruit and see what sticks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ah yer guess there wasnt any level 60 till PoP.<br />
/sarcasm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HS is out for non-iksar evils if they want to get their Overthere hammer, which is a supremely useful tool to port around.  One hour of HS will wipe out all Overthere/ Venril Sathir faction 99% of players will ever be able to get even if they try.<br />
<br />
Cool sounding idea by the way.  Bet you get a lot of cheating, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Problem is... NO ONE XPS AT THE OLD WORLD ZONES ANYMORE.  Lol.  No one got my point...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did.. so it's not no one... &lt;snicker&gt;<br />
really though, exping in places out of the ordinary is the best thing to do, even if the exp wasn't the best.. change of scenery keeps the game fun and fresh.</div></div><hr />
