<br />
I don't remember that bonus being revoked.  If It's still in place, that puts our current healing ratio shackle at 45% of a healer instead of 47%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it was removed.  Regardless, there never was a builtin class bonus overall, it was on specific spells.  So for Greater Heal, a cleric got 5% more than shaman or druid.  Once we got past the base heals (superior heal being the last), everyone got different healing spells, and this issue no longer applied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And for gods sake . . . a 2% difference?  Who really cares?<br />
<br />
Get us up to 70-75% of Cleric healing . . . its only right given that they've taken away 50% of our healing by mitigating Slow.</div></div><hr />

Ya, it's not a big deal, really just an insult to injury thing at this point, but the 5% bonus is still there.  At least it's there for a lvl 30 cleric I tested it out on for Greater Healing.  Don't have access to any higher lvl clerics, so couldn't test if it went beyond that.</div></div><hr />

Don't want the damn thing to twitch TOO much when you beat it.</div></div><hr />
