Don sounds intersting but i dont want to bother ordering a copy unless theres things to do with a duo or just soloing.  I see the lvl 61 proc spell is nice but is it attainable by just myself(lvl 65 with mediocre gear).</div></div><hr />

As far as the spell goes, no one can get it solo.  The spell is only purchaseable from the DoN Merchant who only accepts radiant/ebon crystals.  As far as I know, one can only get these crystals from the competion of group missions or raids.<br />

Soloing/duoing works nice for the first few tasks that you need to build up faction and then again for some progression tasks. <br />
<br />
Be aware though that there are no repetable solo tasks after you have reached indifferent faction. Also, as mentioned above, soloing or duoing missions is not possible. Pretty sure you even must have three people in the group.<br />
<br />
The spells are nice though and Leo is not very expensive (120 crystals?). Also the mob models and zones are much nice than the ugly GoD and OoW zones/mobs.</div></div><hr />
