<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got up to five grand that I can spend on the baddest computer one can build or buy.<br />
<br />
I want to make the most of my money so I'm shying away from the obviouschoices such as Alienware or Dell. I am considering entirely customizing a build at iBUYPOWER.com or similar site, or else just ordering piecemeal and putting it together myself.<br />
<br />
The problem is, I'm extremely forgetful and extremely busy... I don't have time to catch up and take notes on what's what at this moment in the industry, so I'm hoping for some advice on a few things.<br />
<br />
First off, which chipset is currently leading the 64-bit market, Intel or AMD? Secondly, which video card is offering the best bang at the moment, NVidia or ATI? I'm talking about buying the very best of the best, but with a mind towards upgrading video and/or sound cards when 64-bit becomes prevalent among games.<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of my machine will be gaming. I will want 2 gigs of ram, and no more at the moment because I feel like it will be overkill. Any imput is appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I had 5,000 to spend on a P.C., I would probabbly go with something like the following:<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Dual FX53 processors:<br />
(http://www.tyan.com/products/html/thunderk8w.html)<br />
<br />
Then, with the above, I could drop two GeForce FX6800 GT in a SLI configuration.  That kit would run about $800-$900 dollars, but it would allow you to run your display over two graphics cards (I believe the newest Alienwares are similarly equipped.)<br />
<br />
2 Gigs of DDR3200 is sufficient, but you have budget enough for more.<br />
<br />
Four Seagate SATA 120/7200RPM/8MB. cache in a Raid 0+1 configuration.<br />
<br />
Soundblaster Audigy Platinum<br />
<br />
A good Lite-On DVD-ROM, and some sort of DVD+/-RW.  I use a TDK, but Plextors are pretty nice as well.<br />
<br />
Powersupply would have to be 600Watt to power a beast like this.  In a nice Antec/Thermaltake case with plenty of cooling.<br />
<br />

<br />
After you get done building it, you'll have the best machine around, the envy of all your friends :)<br />
<br />
Currently, you can build a really nice machine on a budget of $2,500 and up.  That's enough to allow for top of the line CPU and Video cards.  With $5,000 you can do something like I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Dual CPU, dual video cards, multiple hard-drives, the works.<br />

Good luck, let me know what you decide on.  Talk to your local computer geek/computer store about setting it up, it's not too tough.</div></div><hr />
