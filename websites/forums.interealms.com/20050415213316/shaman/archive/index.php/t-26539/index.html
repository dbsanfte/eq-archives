<br />
On May 12 the only server that I've played on my entire 4 yrs is merging with Quellious.  I have been desperately trying to find something to make EQ fun again and the only thing that makes it somewhat interesting again is bringing my shaman out of retirement.  I posted this here to find out besides the guild's listed are any guilds that raid around 11EST that are currently flagging or backflagging for elementals recruiting on any server.  Ive been on Rodcet Nife for 4 years and I think its about time for change.  If anyone could help me out I would be most appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's no universal resource. Check the Sony server boards at http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?category.id=servers and the non-Sony boards listed at http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guides&amp;message.id=11&amp;jump=true for by-server listings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best I could suggest is to find out what message board most of the Quellious players use. Most servers have at least 1 board, though I think generally there is only 1 &quot;main&quot; board.  If you go on and introduce yourself, I'm sure that you'll find some guilds at about the level in the game who would like to talk to you.<br />
<br />
My server (Lanys) is being merged with the 7th Hammer tonight.  Already there's been a fair amount of talking back and forth as the higher guilds size each other up a bit and try to decide what this will mean for all of them. At least you have another month yet to start the process of making contacts and getting a feel for things.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't find a guild on Quellious, you have the option of going to any of the other servers due to the 1-time free transfer. It might not hurt to check out a few of the others to find out if there is a guild that meets your needs on one of them.</div></div><hr />

if yer looking for a guild that is gonna be doing the PoP progression come over to Saryrn my guild is gonna be starting back on that  stuff on the 24th  and we'd be more than happy to have ya =) besides I could useanother shammy to help me keep up with buffs and slows (and  yes even the panther line if you have one of those spells since the spell will have been &quot;updated&quot; by then) since i'm the only shaman main  in my guild that is on regularly for our raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hiya from Quellious.  I was concerned about having a server merge, but from seeing how they RN people interact I'm not feeling too bad about it.<br />
<br />
There are a few guild on Quell flagging PoP, though Vinceremo (just got elemental within the last month or two) is not really recruiting at this time.  But keep your eyes open.  There are alot of quality players on Quell, and also alot of good guilds.<br />
<br />
See ya soon :)</div></div><hr />
