<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm doing the final turn in for the &quot;Call of Flames&quot; quest and was wondering if is possible to solo &quot;Vance Bearstalker&quot;?  I'm level 55 btw.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He isn't tough, but he isn't that easy. I don't recall if he summons, if not you may be able to bow kite him. Bring lots of arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Possibly.  I did him at 50 with a couple people's help, and he barely hit me.  You have levels &amp; gear advantage over what I had at the time.  If he is snareable (can't remember), you could whittle him down a bit with ranged attack.  If you want to play it safe, I'd buy a port &amp; 10 min of druid healing assistance for 100pp if you can't find anyone to help.  One patch healer should be plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He summons, IIRC. I'd get a healer at least. Or, if you can find a friendly necro, snare-fear him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, he summons (promise).  Better to be safe than sorry.  Also, do not turn your back to him, cause it can get really nasty :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alyis Ter`Elvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lvl 60 necro guildy soloed him for me, he wanted to see if he could, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Summons.  I did him at 61 or 62 with a 2-boxed cleric, and the cleric had to cast exactly one celestial elixir on me through the entire fight, so I could have soloed him.  I had Earthcaller at the time (yes, slow procced), and about 4000 hitpoints from various buffs and gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bariax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just finished this same quest the other day ( I'm lazy I know ) at level 58 with my current equipment, he schooled me.  I was barely able to keep alive using fungi + chloro and perfectly timing my sit/stand to avoid getting pounced on when he summoned.  I had to keep things going until a druid monk enchanter team came in to help me.  I would suggest definately calling on either a fearing class to reverse kite him, or a strong healer.<br />
<br />
*edit* I also had swarmcaller proc in the first 5 seconds of fighting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did him at 55 or so with a 53 druid, both had KEI, no epic, close fight.</div></div><hr />
