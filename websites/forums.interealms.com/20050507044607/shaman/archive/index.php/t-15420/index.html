Anyone not on Test should feel somewhat relieved that /testbuff is not a standard live feature. Its brought us some real gems thats for sure. This morning I was sitting in PoK just chatting and a level 25 paladin(see level 25 is handed to you via /testbuff) comes up to be and -instantly- says &quot;Can I get a heal...I seen you casting so dont give me that afk story.&quot; These are the first words out of him.....<br />
<br />
I healed him anyway cause thats just the kind of troll I am :)<br />
<br />
But needless to say, some of the manners I see astound me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just keep a stack of brandy on you. When you get begged, tell em sure, then down the entire stack, and see how long they will sit there while you try impossibly to cast on them.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So what exactly does /testbuff do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sets you to level 25 with all spells to level and gives you a couple bags of level-appropriate gear.</div></div><hr />

In such a situation I would likely have said &quot;You are a Paladin. You have heal spells. Heal yourself.&quot; Or something to that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Some of you folks are entirely too nice lol...  if someone asks me politely and in English for buffs I have a hard time turning them down, but item/pp beggars and anyone who wants 'fre stuf n bufz plz' is fair game.. its noobie hunting season.<br />
<br />
While I used to particularly enjoy the /d trick, I'm not sure if dueling is allowed in PoK.  I generally string them along for a bit... when Level_3_noob_3,056,955 tells me, 'Hi', I generally respond 'Hi, you look like you could use some free buffs and gear, maybe some powerleveling'... this always gets 'em going lol, and after reading their responses for a quick chuckle they go right on ignore.<br />
<br />
Also funny to advertise free buffs or that you're giving away gear, '/tell beggar_01 for details'.. generally a good bet to vacate the zone after that though.</div></div><hr />

I have no problems with casting spells while drunk.<br />
They changed it so that if you are standing in one spot, you don't sway back and forth anymore when drunk.<br />
You only sway when you are moving.</div></div><hr />

He kept on nuking him but the guy kept coming back.  He didn't know the guy was bound there so he kept on seeing this duel message.  By the 9th time my wiz friend just left the area and went /anon.

 Well i come back to some newb berating me. YOU GOING TO SAY YOUR AFK TOO? EVERYONE JUST INGNORING ME WHEN ALL I WANT IS SOME SIMPLE BUFFS.  He did this for awhile too came back to quite a bit of text and he happen to be just walking away. I sent him a tell: having a rough day? <br />
<br />
   He went on about people ignoring him when he &quot;asked&quot; for buffs and cried and cried. I told him well i went afk as i zoned in. HE got mad at me Your not standing in the middle you want me to believe that? (or some such crap) So took two steps to my right gated back. Said its called a gate spell. Said no wonder your getting ignored , how about being nicer? He says to me How about some buffs? Said oh sorry I'm AFK. He flipped me off but i never heard from him again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RPnoob &quot;Hail great and powerful shamaness, I hope thee are well.  May I have some of thy wonderful buffs?<br />
<br />
I usually don't stop giggling till after I finish digging HoS and SoW out of my spellbook.<br />
<br />
As far as the raid comment goes, I don't consider guildmates to be buff beggars until they ask for crap I don't think they need.  Clerics asking for avatar (assuming they didn't just get a new weapon and want to try it out or something) any caster asking for haste, etc.  I also have a simple means of dealing with people asking for buffs before MGB on raids.  I buff them.  With focus.<br />
<br />
My version of the previous post:<br />
<br />
Guildie_032 tells you: Need shammy buffs plz <br />
/rtar<br />
/cast 5 (focus)<br />
<br />
Guildie_005 tells you: dOod Focus boar plz <br />
/rtar<br />
/cast 5 (focus)<br />
<br />
Guildie_056 tells you: I need shammy luvin! <br />
/rtar<br />
/cast 5 (focus)<br />
<br />
Guildie_021 tells you: Are we going to mgb ? I need focus/boar<br />
/rtar<br />
/cast 5 (focus)<br />
<br />
Guildie_028 tells you: Ferine avatar ! <br />
/reply: already have 4 rogues on my list.  Ask sooner next time.<br />
<br />
Guildie_002 tells you: dOod Focus n BOAR PLZ, did you miss my tell ? <br />
/reply: you got focus<br />
<br />
Mana isnt the issue at all, especially before a raid starts, have it coming out my ears.  Casting soul shuts them up and lets them get focus a little early and have it in lower buff slots than their symbol/9/virtue/VoQ.<br />
<br />
Being in a raid guild I know that the few melee who do ask for Boar are only missing a couple points of sta.  It doesn't make a huge difference to their hp, and I will pretty much cast sta only during MGB time and not before or after.  Even beastlord sta buff will max them so it isn't something I worry about much.<br />
<br />
I do keep FA up usually on raids, giving it to paladins when they are killing undead makes them so happy.  They equip the big heavy 2H weapons and get disgusting high slay undead hits.  Otherwise it goes to rogues, sometimes monks, and sometimes I toss it on myself and go whack trash for fun :)</div></div><hr />
