<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thrilled to see the new Stoicism spell untill I started to do some math.<br />
<br />
This is for the 58+ Shaman without Torpor. Before Kragg/canni 4 it is an incredible upgrade.<br />
<br />
All numbers rounded<br />
<br />
I'm at just over 2000 hp self buffed (Just switched from AC gear to HP gear). I can canni down to 500 HP and use Kragg. This will net me 400 mana<br />
<br />
I can cast Stoicism twice for 360 mana and a total of 1280 HP. This will net me less than 360 mana.<br />
<br />
So looking purely at those numbers Kragg is more efficient even if I'm not using it to its full potential (need 2600 HP for that?!)<br />
<br />
Doing 10 canni and then Kragg is costing me a lot of time.<br />
Doing Stoicism and canni while I heal would be more efficient, but I would be snared for a LONG time.<br />
<br />
To me they look te be about equal given that I gain more total with Kragg, but more efficiently with Stoicism.<br />
<br />
How would different focus items affect the above?<br />
<br />
Is the above a correct analysis? If it is, then I think I will just ignore Stoicism for now. <br />
<br />
Ofcourse, it might be a moot point since the spell can probably only be found on the same mob that carries the group shrink.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Problem is, to be useful, you HAVE to canni down quite a bit to use Kragg's.  If you use the torpor line, you can just act like you have a Celestial Heal on you and cann through it.</div></div><hr />

I used KM as a &quot;ghetto torpor&quot; quite frequently when I got it. It really added some punch to my soloing power in that it helped me decrease downtime tremendously. As mentioned above though, you have to canni down to 25percent (roughly - or the 1950hp that can be healed by this spell) to really make it useful for mana regen. That can be dangerous due to low hp aggro. If a mob jumps you while you're that low, you can be in trouble fast. Generally, I only canni'd down to about 30percent if I had to do so while fighting. I'd sic the dog on the mob, do my thing and wait until doggie'd generated sufficient aggro to keep the mob off me and then go to it. This method is only safe if the dog can actually tank the mobs you're fighting, so be warned. :) I don't mean to discourage you. Quite the contrary. If you're careful, KM can be a huge boost to your mana regen. I love that spell. If you can get stoicism, though, I'd recommend using it to regen mana during combat and KM to regen mana after the fight. I have torpor now and it is so much safer feeling. Not only is it better for efficiency purposes, but not having to canni down so low makes me feel much safer. I wish stoicism had been around earlier, but I am happy it's coming out now... unless it drops off some mob in VT. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed, the biggest problem with KM is going so low on life.  Self buffed I'm around 2250 hps, canna down to 500-ish and then KM myself.  You need KM to heal as many as possible to be at max efficiency and unless you've got Aego you're just not going to be able to do it without risking low hp agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Snare is rarely a big deal.  Most exp camps or soloing you're just standing still.  Can always strafe if you need to move around a little bit, or click it off if you're in dire straights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As many said, the problems with KM is that you have to be down either 2k hp or 75% (dangerously close to low health aggro) life to get full effectiveness from it.  In addition to that, its hard to use KM to heal yourself while soloing if you are being hit.  6 seconds is a long time to channel, but 10 seconds is much longer.  I have no use for it, but I would say that stoicism looks to be a great spell for those without torpor.</div></div><hr />
