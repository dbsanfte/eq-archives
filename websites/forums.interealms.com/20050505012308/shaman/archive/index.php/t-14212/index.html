<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK OK... I know this belongs in the Spells forum, bit I figured that I would/could get a quicker response in the general forum (and then quit bothering you fine peeps)...Anyhow, I went to the oasis to get some Divination spells that I hadn't been bothering with (I wanna try and fill up my spell book), and I got Assudous (?) Vision.  When I looked it up, one of the things that it listed was &quot;Bind Sight&quot;.  What the heck does that mean?? Thanks for taking the time to read/respond to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you cast it on an a mob you see through its eyes.<br />
<br />
One trick is that you can hop from mob to mob in this way to explore a dungeon etc , actually Im not sure you can any more with assiduous Vision (you can with the bard version still)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bind sight is a spell which enables you to see from a PC's, NPC's, or mobs point of view.  Your &quot;spirit&quot; will drift to their body.  It is actually a pretty useful scouting tool.  You can cast it while from your &quot;new&quot; perspective. It makes scouting a whole zone  safe and fairly quick. It is also fun to watch you attacking the mob from its point of view.  If I have missed something please post it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing you might not realise, is you can use the third person cameras when your sight is bound to an NPC. Just hit F9 a few times and you can then pan around and have a look/see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">39 Assiduous Vision has a longer duration than 19 Vision, otherwise they work the same. The range is zone-wide, so you can cast it on any mob in the zone -- allowing you to jump your vision from mob to mob or stay with a moving mob. It can be cast on anything targettable including PCs, NPCs, corpses.<br />
<br />
It's useful for scouting around corners in dungeons. One time from the entrance of Chardok, I cast it on a corpse in my group who was dead deep in, then was able to target someone nearby who was trapped alive down there, to get them invited for Call of the Hero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought assidious vision had a ultravision component as well. ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It does have ultravision as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is a very powerful spell if used right.   I use it in my guild as a raid leader.  I use it to actually steer my monks through a dungeon or explain pulls to em.  I use it to check mobs such as THO in the deep by hoping from mob to mob.   And I use it when soloing in dungeons to check out pulls.   I also use it on wandering mobs to know where they are and when they will be back.   The only problem with the spell is it does have a range on it.   Once you are out of range you loose the ability to hop from mob to mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one of my favorite spells<br />
<br />
vision has no range on it at all. least i've never had a problem with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vision has a 10k range on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Th eone problem I have notice with it is the farther away you are looking from yourself, the slower the refresh rates on the movement of the MOBs and players in the area you're looking at. This make Bind sight useful to trace static spawn but useless to check on roamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=580&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Range listed as 10,000. Don't know if that is their coding for infinite or if 10,000 is the actual range. I know from tests that the spell 'seems' to have a much longer range.<br />
<br />
While I agree this spell is extremely useful (I use it at least 20 times a day to find hiding people) it also has a drawback in that it bugs out when the target is behind alot of solid walls/items. This means you have to really know the terrain to guessimate where they are.<br />
<br />
Also, it does not take hold if the target has a full bufflist. Verant said they fixed this issue in a recent patch, but it is still bugged. So if you're hiding from a pvper who has vision/bind sight, make sure you have a full bufflist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wonder how the resident uberguild kills mob_031.....spy on them with this spell. They won't even know you are there.  :p <br />
<br />
It's great fun to &quot;be the mob&quot; and watch 60 people beat on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can use Bind Sight (ranger spell) from the zone-in in ToV and jump around and see just about every mob in North.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is a great spell. i solo alot in dungeons and its realy handy to check wether how many mobs there are in a room, or to see it there is that specail named mob hidding in the corner. its also handy if you get a runner and need to find out where he has gone and if he has friends .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When i try to 'follow' a PC, and he goes far away, i lag like hell, and i am lost easely. Even with trying to recast the spell on a mob, the screen is nearly frozen, and cant see a lot of things. And no, normally i never lag.<br />
<br />
Also an evil way to spy other guild's tactics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like to use it (the vision one) to spy our puller in a zone I don't know.<br />
<br />
Also helped me while camping some mobs. Just park puppy where the mob is supposed to spawn, and have a look.<br />
<br />
but the funniest time i used it was to guide a rogue on a CR in CT maze..  &quot;turn right now, go straight, turn left, look right now...&quot; the guy was wondering how i knew the exact way to go  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The best use I've gotten out of this was during Dain raids.   Nothing going on for a long time, so I leapfrogged from one monk to another, so I could watch them pulling all Dain's friends and then the big taco himself ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think I tried that like last year and seem to remember not being able to get out of the first hall.... what's the trick?<br />
<br />
Great when you have a roamer.. hence VP... but it sucks when trying to get around in places like ST(2nd door)... Any ideas on opening doors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Eye of Zomm cast into a corner will let you see a random spot in the zone.  Bards do it in Sebilis to check on Trak.  Eye of Zomm is available on Stalking probes, a bard helm and a wizzie spell.  Cast it repeatedly and you'll eventually see what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />
