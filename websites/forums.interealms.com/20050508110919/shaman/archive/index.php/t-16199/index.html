<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Absor has been seen on many of the other class boards. But nothing here.<br />
<br />
If I had a chance to question him about LDoN My questions would be as follows.<br />
<br />
Will the shamans Lack of Effective Fast damage potential Be addressed. (Looks to be so with the advent of the Bane line) But with this bane line that gives curse counters Will the monsters be getting to use the same line? And will the Aggro creation of these bane line of spells be on par with our Disease line or more in line with the please kill me now Poisen based line?<br />
<br />
Items are going to be Socketable. Will the Augments be class and or race specific or all all and only need the required Location or slot to use.<br />
<br />
Considering there is a time limit. And in some cases a very stringent one, has there been any consideration towards allowing the Druids and shaman of the world a Look at even a revive based ability or spell. (Even no xp, can get a res later) Otherwise All this will do is force groups to take a cleric or a paladin Or even a necro and only leave 5 other slots. (at least in the beginning till the quests and areas and tricks and traps become known.) Not being able to get the people back to the action without what could be a pretty time consuming run is a great disadvantage for the other Preists besides the esteemed cleric.<br />
<br />
And of course i have to throw in a wonderful Non LDoN question. Considering preist balancing has not been looked at since Clerics got the hammer boosts and bash. When are the shaman of this wonderful world going to get a good look-see. I realise that more than likely due to the number of shaman out there you might feel there is a it can't be broke so many are playing a shaman feeling, but considering most of our ability comes from Kunark and the old world We are feeling more than a little ignored and abused. (Clerics meele DPS with hammer is better than ours with our Wonderful Rabid bear AA's) A Gnome cleric can Bash better than me and I am the supposed pinnicle of the rough and ready Preist of the more hardy races.  Shaman were supposed to be the Meele based preist and we have recieved Very little attention considering all the upgrades both druids and Clerics have gottem in both meele and Other spell based and healing roles (Mostly cleric Meele based upgrades rather stick in my craw) <br />
<br />
Any other questions people can come up with just in case SoE decides that maybe we need to get stroked a little?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, I think SoEs idea of balancing shaman meant removing the worthless spell lines and adding in Talisman of Alacrity and Tiny Terror.  Then they removed the negatives from our stat potions and we were totally balanced!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, I am not absor, I am not a Sony employee, I am not a guide, and lastly I signed no NDA.  That said I will offer a couple brief answers from first hand experience.<br />
<br />
1. Bane aggro is on par with our poisen line, but it's still usefull, even very usefull (I won't qualify this).<br />
2. from my very limited experience augments were not specific to race or class, but to the nature of the augment.<br />
3. bind outside the dungeon and re-enter.  I won't address the topic of required classes in a party as my experience is very limited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From reading all the other class boards when he went there, I can tell you that the standard answer he gives is that expansions don't deal with class balance.<br />
<br />
Like the other poster said, just bind close by and run back in the dungeon.  There is no respawn of mobs in them, so you would not have to fight your way back to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 things i'd like to see...<br />
<br />
group buffs hitting pets<br />
<br />
ability to bash in Bear form (maybe maul)<br />
<br />
... and then allow archery to autoattack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget the idea that the wolf spirit that we summon might be able to run with the speed given by 'Spirit of the Wolf'.<br />
<br />
And make all our PoP buffs at least the same duration as the spells they are supposed to be upgrades of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only thing (and I really do mean the only thing) that bothers me about the shaman class is that my pet doens't automatically have spirit of the wolf.   <br />
<br />
Is he a wolf?  Check.  <br />
<br />
Is he a spirit?  Check.  <br />
<br />
That should be that then.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with most that we are pretty balanced.  So, my suggestions are divided into two groups:<br />
<br />
Convenience:  <br />
<br />
1) Group shrink outside group but within raid.  Or confirm box.  Either one.<br />
<br />
note: If I were to choose between the shrink idea above and puppy sow, I would choose shrink.  Mage, Necro, Beasty pets don't get innate sow so no reason ours should also, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Stacking on raids (when there is sufficient healing):<br />
<br />
1) Upgrade rabid bear - whether in duration, recast time or improved damage.  Whatever.<br />
<br />
There you go - we are now balanced! lol.<br />
<br />
As an aside to Sony - its time to add some new AA's to every class - peeps are leveling fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about some control over our summoned wolf<br />
pack? I forget the name of the AA right now, but<br />
the pack will just attack whatever you have <br />
targeted when you summon them. After that mob's<br />
dead, they just stand around. Considering the<br />
ability has a very long recycle time, and the fact<br />
that they only last 60 seconds, I don't think being<br />
able to re-target them (following our normal<br />
summoned pet) would be over the top for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Will the shamans Lack of Effective Fast damage potential Be addressed. (Looks to be so with the advent of the Bane line) <br />
<br />
The Bane line DOES NOT adequately address this issue.  The reason is the 24 second recast time.  24 seconds is an eternity in an intense battle with multiple mobs.  Drop the recast time (3-4 seconds) and the Bane line will be a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It just means you kill one monster at a time. Bane one. Disease the next. Then when recast is up Bane the second that is being off tanked. Or Poisen the next. Or Whatever. <br />
<br />
Hell get em close together and Torrent them. And Bane the one the tanks are not on. <br />
<br />
If you are dropping Monsters in 24 seconds or less. Bring less people. I cant even fart in 24 seconds anymore. I dunno when all the speed freaks decided to Join EQ But If you can kill 2 900+ hitting mobs in 24 seconds with 6 second cast times and 2 second recast delays  Sigh.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should just hot Box 5 Wizards and Min max the damn game to death, One warrior 15 clerics 27 wizards and hot boxes for all the buffs.. &lt;Sigh&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Overall, we're probably the most balanced class in the game.  The only things we need as a class are some very minor tweaks that are nothing compared to the melee imbalance.  Although if any SOE employee does check this thread, Malo and Torpor still do not drop in the same proportion as other level 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sure we may be balanced, but give us a frigging INVISIBILITY UPGRADE NOW DAMMIT !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Burt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Overall we are a pretty balanced class, considering how far out of whack other classes became.<br />
<br />
On that note however, there are a few things that would make EQ better overall.<br />
<br />
Improved Invis for Shaman - Someone must have just forgot to place us in the spell.<br />
<br />
Scale of the wolf / Spirit of Scale - These should be as fast as a 60th bard with drum at least. You can't cast it on anyone but your group, it drops if you sneeze or cast, and it is about 2% faster than sow. Completely useless after the nerfs.  Or have this spell speed up your mount to sow speed while it is on. Anything, throw us a bone...<br />
<br />
Faster Damage - This has been talked about.<br />
<br />
90% res for druids / shaman at 65 AA ability - Give it a appropriate timer.<br />
<br />
AOE shrink for Raid - Talked about many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rez is the LAST thing we need, tyvm. Fix DoTs, and I would be happy.</div></div><hr />

Fast leveling from the XP fountain in PoP is what broke the game into a Hack N Slash game.. To me adding more AAs isnt the answer.  I don't have a quick fix answer either. The game at this point is an interweaving interdependent ecosystem screw up... Any changes to one piece &quot;breaks&quot; something else..<br />
<br />
Now back to your regularly scheduled posting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dunno, maybe give Shaman / Druids a 8% percent or so rez planar AA ability with the same 18 hour timer that the cleric's 100% rez has. I can see it, but I could live without.<br />
<br />
Improve invis, yes please. And don't try to schnooker us with &quot;Improved invis vs. animals&quot;!<br />
<br />
Give us a line of focus buffs. If Mages can summon the things, then why can't we take up some buff slots with 'em? While we're doing buffs, give us some skill mod buffs, as well. +weapons skills or riposite or evocation... Who knows.<br />
<br />
Maybe a new pet at 65, make him a level 58, same as the 61 pet, with less HP, maybe less melee power... But make him a shaman, a full-blown caster pet. Another of those nice to see things that I can live without, though.<br />
<br />
Area effect Malos would be great, as would some sort of group heal. Group resists would be nice, as would bear form... MGB bear!<br />
<br />
Faster nukes. Not bigger ones, just faster. I swear, I try to cast my nuke when the mob is incoming and I wind up casting on its corpse.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I agree 100% that the aa exp was a bit too fast, but it is what it is.  The good thing about the fast aa is that shaman get to feel uber fairly quickly with canny5, scrm, and quick buff, etc.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned I think that the developers should add more aa's, just keep them underpowered.  Heck, just keep the progressions on ND and healing going and that will burn a lot of aa's without increasing our power very much.  Right now I could put my excess aa's into stamina - heck 1aa for 3 hps is pretty lame.  I'd rather put 6 points to get my quick heal up by 3% (39 hps).<br />

Well said, Darkpaw... I have no uberguild, and all the one's one Xev that could take me to the EPs (Or past BoT and tactics, for that matter) REQUIRE 5+ hours per day and I, by most, am asked to leave a message on the message boards if for some reason (heaven forbid...) I don't play EQ that day or for 5+ hours.<br />
<br />
*grumble grumble*<br />
<br />
It'd be better if they had really, really, really long side quests that meant a damn when progressing in the planes... I dun care if it'd take a month.<br />
<br />
Oh well, all my friends are playing Star Wars: Galaxies now, and they seem content (one even owns an internet café!)... <br />

Reduced poison aggro would be nice, group buffs hitting pets would be real nice, wolf spirits having innate SoW would be only logical, but on the whole I'm ok enough with where we stand to not want to roll those particular dice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I have the opposite view. I joined an EP guild, and my AA exp rate has plummetted. I spend most of my time raiding instead of exping now.<br />
<br />
Okay, exp in the elemental planes is good (when I can get the time), but even then, my best ever rate of experience was in PoV inner caves in a fast pulling, well balanced semi-pickup group.<br />

I don't play EQ that day or for 5+ hours.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, my guild doesn't require attendance, doesn't require posting if you can't make a raid, doesn't require a minimum time spent raiding a day or a week, nothing like that. Even if you're online you don't have to raid, though most people would want to, obviously (why join an elemental raiding guild and not raid?).<br />
<br />
Admittedly, raid attendance is taken into consideration when you're in the application process, and for loot. But raiding isn't mandatory.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's on Xev. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">only things i can think of are <br />

2. innate dual weild, im tired of carrying fs daggers.<br />
3. improved invis<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1) Shaman damage is FINE. Quit crying about it you little babies. That is NOT the only job we have in a group. Be thankful they gave you new dots in the first place. LDoN is an endurance test more than anything. You shouldn't be pissing away mana on tons of dots and nukes, because next pull you may just have 3 mobs in camp that need malo/slowed.<br />
<br />
2) The time limit on the adventures in LDoN is MORE THAN ENOUGH for almost any group combo. The majority of the mobs have hp about on par with razorfiends in PoV (maybe a bit less).<br />
<br />
3) Rez/Revive is a completely stupid idea, it's the most retarded thing to come on these boards in a LONG time. Have you forgot exactly what a shaman is?<br />
<br />
4) Pets with innate dual wield is also a stupid idea. Think logically for once... how would a pet dual wield when it naturally BITES? Does it somehow grow a second set of fangs that come out for a quick 3rd and 4th bite? I don't think so. You're lucky they don't remove the ability for our pets to use weapons.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line: Shaman are as great as ever. You newbs that want all these drastic changes need to go back and learn what it is to be a shaman.<br />

<br />
I adress a few points:<br />
Don't call all people stupid, cause they don't share your opinion. It doesn't further your argument at all.<br />
<br />
to 1. Might be the case that you need your mana for debuffs, but start thinking about the raiding shamans, who got 3+ shamans on their raids. If you number 3 shaman, you end up ... gasp .. nuking. I don't think I rolled a wizard.<br />
to 2. Can't say much here. Only thing that comes to mind that a time limit will change the dungeon crawl experience that many peeps (including me) like to a race and kill fest. Going wrong ways is one of the interesting part of dungeon crawls (especially since you won't get maps for those dungeons since they are created new each time), but ending up losing the dungeon because of this sucks. Well, wait and see how it works out, won't condemn it before I even tried.<br />
to 3. We have 3 rez classes. That is a low count. I wouldn't mind for another class to get a lower rez spell, but it doesn't need to be shaman.<br />
to 4. You try to argue with 'logic', which is pretty damn funny. I see snakes kick. What logic is that?<br />
<br />
Ok, few thoughts from me:<br />
Sow for pet on summon: We had that argument a few times, main problem is dungeons, where pets would then have sow too. I don't think it's a big issue to SoW your pet if you really need.<br />
Improved invis: Same as above, had that before. Developers told us that shamans got invis &quot;by accident&quot;, and that they dont want to take it away after all this time (phew). Thats why we wont get an upgrade. I learned to live with it.<br />
Shrink cast out of group: I so pray for this to work each patch. They could do the TL out of group with a confirmation box, I really don't see why this won't work with shrink.<br />
Stackability on raid: I so want us to stack better on raids. Yes, they helped us with dot stacking, but be honest: How often do you dot on raids? In VT maybe. But out of that dreaded place? I don't. In Xp groups I don't even try to dot with BoS, since it wont do it's damage to full after I spend 10 secs slowing mobs (Malos + Turgurs). Don't even think about disease dots. I like our mediocre nukes (they are as good as ranger nukes), we are not the class for that. So maybe give is dots to feed on mana instead of life, give us a spell line to slow casting for mobs, something like that. Give the No. 3 shaman something to do. Hell, for christs sake make rabid bear usefull.<br />
<br />

It's an attack ability. Rather than having to make a completely new ability especially for snakes (or fish, rats, etc) they can use this. Your reply doesn't really address what I posted, either.</div></div><hr />
