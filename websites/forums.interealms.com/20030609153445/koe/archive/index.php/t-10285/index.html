<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuntun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, Soriis told me the other day that KoE did a raid up in the Plane of sky a little while back with Corps, well i was told that they killed one of the Gale Callers and that someone looted what it had but didn't know what it was for. If i could find out who has that piece, if its someone from our guild that is, I would like to see if you still want it, i'd like to MQ it for the The Gale Weave quest outta Jagged Pine. The item looted is called Essence of the Gale, please let me know if anyone has it.<br />
Thanks <br />
