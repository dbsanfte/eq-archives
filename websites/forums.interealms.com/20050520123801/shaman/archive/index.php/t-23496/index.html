<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn of Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best way to set up spell message so that groups know that things are getting slowed, they are being healed, etc?<br />
<br />
Been playing EQ since launch..but never had a caster class who needed to get that info out before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Immish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while but I'm pretty sure the spell gems are numbers frrom 1-8 top to bottom.  So make a hot key as follows<br />
<br />
line 1 /cast 1 (or whatever number coresponds to the spell)<br />
line 2 /gsay Healing %T  or /gsay Slowing %T<br />
<br />
Then use those hotkeys whenever you need to cast that spell.<br />
<br />
Might be an easier way but if there is I don't know it, of couse I only know a little in regards to pure casters and this shaman is my first serious attempt at one.  Hope my info is correct and that it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have actual hotkeys made and I hit them AFTER the spell lands.<br />
<br />
This prevents messages such as <br />
<br />
/Shaman_01: /g: a Dazzling Occulus has been &lt;ROOTED&gt;<br />
<br />
Me thinking to myself: 'Erm no hit hasn't.' (Charmable MOBs in LDON aren't rootable, snareable)<br />
<br />
Or this:<br />
<br />
/Shaman_01: /g A {MOB} Has been SLOWED !<br />
(Insert cute spammy message here)<br />
<br />
5 Seconds later (<br />
<br />
/Shaman_01: /g A {MOB} has been SLOWED !<br />
(Insert cute spammy message here)<br />
<br />
Note, this isn't a slam on Shaman who link their spells and a message but to point out that you might want to relay critical information AFTER said information has actually come to pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a tip:  don't make any &quot;attempting to...&quot; hotkeys unless its a heal.  They can become very annoying quickly.  On the otherhand I havn't macroed anything cept heals in exp groups in probably 3 or 4 years unless it's on a named mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pretty much only use slow messeges in raids and on KT trials where its useful knowig when the mobs are slowed for the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On my fourth bank of hot keys in my action window I have message for debuffs, slows, rampage, ect that I click when I need too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My /g &gt; %T has been SLOWED is also my pull message. Even if slow bounces - makes the other players more confident. ;)</div></div><hr />
