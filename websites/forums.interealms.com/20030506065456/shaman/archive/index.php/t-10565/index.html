<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for info from anyone who has killed him or knows what his deal is.  <br />
Got three groups in CoD and while we were crawling we decided to try to go after Paffa.  Well we found him but he wasn't targetable so we killed the pusling spawns around him.  After maybe three respawns ( they were quick ) he became targettable but more and more puslings kept spawning.  Every time we thought we had cleared them more spawned next to Paffa and we eventually fell behind and we decided to just rush Paffa and try to contain the adds.  There were at least 8 adds at this point so we died quickly.  <br />
Can anyone who has done this event shed some light on it? Strategies? Timing? we werent exactly sure what was going on.</div></div><hr />

DISCLAIMER: This is most likely intended for folks who are in guilds that are much to powerful to even convince people to step into CoD for a quick paffa gank. The charm nerf is coming so I figured I'd let you all in on how to do this so you at least get a few shots before the nerf. <br />
<br />
What you need : <br />
<br />
1 Cleric and 2 Necro's ( You could use 2 Enchanters if you don't have Word of Terris or don't know anyone else with it ). <br />
<br />
What to do <br />
<br />
I'll use necro's in this example because thats what we've been doing it with. First of all the necro's need to charm 2 Corrupted Knights. Anything else makes a ****ty pet. Haste them and get the cleric to Divine Intervention them. <br />
<br />
Clear up to Paffa's lair with the pets. 2 pets can easily handle 3 puslings. Never have more then 3 at once. As SOON as one of them ENRAGES, run and turn it the other way ( shouldn't even break through your forceshield ). The pets will drop it instantly. <br />
<br />
Once you are setup before paffa's lair and the event is triggered, start pulling the mobs from paffa's lair with mujaki or whatever. No matter which mob you pull, you will always get 3. Something to note here, while the cleric is CHing the pets, he also needs to be ready to STUN your pet if charm breaks, making for a quick recharm. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are 3 waves and in the third wave, Paffa himself will spawn. Whoopdedoo, he's rooted.. continue pulling the room. While you are pulling make sure you do the following <br />
<br />
Once the room is clear, you are homefree, send in the pets. <br />
<br />
Paffa should go down in about 1 minute, after this promptly collect your earing ( heh yea right, more like gloves ) and continue back to your 10 minute AA's in the back of CoD.</div></div><hr />
