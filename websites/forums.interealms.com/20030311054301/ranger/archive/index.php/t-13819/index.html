<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Reading through the posts on increasing Fletching skill i became quite confused.  I'm at 156 and skill ups are coming very slow.  So i bought a bunch of +INT jewerly and such to help move it along.  Haven't had a chance to take it all out and try it out.  Now it seems that some people believe that DEX is the better stat to help the increases come around quicker.  <br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help in clearing up this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My evidence for dex is that I went from 120ish to 202 with about 15 failed combines total :)<br />
<br />
Sometimes went through stacks and stacks and stacks without a failure.....<br />
<br />
The only problem is that with low INT/WIS (I think it uses the highest value so you might have been better off with WIS gear.....I am not 100% on this tho) you don't seem to skill-up as fast.....<br />
<br />
<br />
I was lucky and with the help of a chanter m8 I had KEI and BoG (Boon of Garou - Warewolf illusion that gives 100 DEX) on the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duncynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Skill ups in Ftetching go off of WIS INT or DEX, whichever is higher.  For a Ranger, it is easier to raise DEX to max (255) than either of the other two.<br />
<br />
Go to the bazaar and select for DEX items.  I found that I could spend a reletively small amount of plat and raise my dex considerably.  The down side is that I have to dedicate a bag for my DEX gear now.  Also you can bum a shammy buff or buy DEX potions to top it off.  I noticed a BIG increase in skill ups when I fletched with 255 DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dex, all the way. 254 dex last night and my fletching session went great :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, so forget the WIS/INT and just go for DEX?  Thanks, i'll give it a try.</div></div><hr />

Whichever of the three that you can get the highest. Usually that will be DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duncynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another thought is that , if your are only looking at fletching, DEX is easiest.  If, however, you intend to work on a lot of trade skills, having a WIS gear kit might help because Wisdom is a modifier for ALL trade skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Assuming youre a ranger, id reccommend avoiding INT geaqr. Theres jsut not that much of it for rangers. We get FAR more WIS gear then INT gear.<br />
<br />
However, if youre not a die-hard tradeskiller (like me) then your best bet would prolly be DEX gear. Its not hard to get it up to 150ish and then find a nice 44+ chanter to hit you with Boon of the Garou a few times for your skillup-runs.<br />
<br />
Personally, i go with WIS gear. I can get mine nearly maxed without c3, and way over-maxed with.<br />
<br />
And another good thing about WIS gear is you can twink out a cleric/shaman/druid with it =) I have my dropable WIS gear on a gnome cleric to work up tinkering. lvl 16 with over 200 WIS. Rar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gailic PureHear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My fletching is currently 201. I got KEI and cha buff, for buying and selling, from chanter and Dex buffs for Shamy. Cant rmember exacts stats.<br />
<br />
I started at skill lvl 174 and 2270 plat. Went to 201 and ended up with 1300 plat left. I dont think that was too bad. I also had a skill modifier to increase success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye as most have already said if you just do Fletching Dex is your best choice but www.eqtraders.com has a very comprensive list of the trade skills and what is used to determine success / failure and skill ups<br />
<br />
All skills use Int or Wis which ever is higher and currently <br />
Jewelcraft and Fletching use Int Wis or Dex<br />
Smithing uses Int Wis or Str<br />
<br />
For the dedicated Tradeskiller go for Wis it affects them all if you are just doing Fletching Dex is cheaper and easier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shimmera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Raise dexterity if you have no intention of doing other tradeskills, wisdom otherwise.<br />
<br />
With stat food and drink, I can hit 255 WIS unbuffed while holding a geerlock.  It's a pretty cost-efficient set-up, you can check it out in my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronadrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">as alot stated wis goes with all trade skills. since most all top end trade skills need stuff made from various tradeskills using wis equipment means 1 set of tradeskill equipment regardless of tradeskill.<br />
(like bft requires brewing, pottery  and smithing on top of fletching for subcombines)</div></div><hr />
