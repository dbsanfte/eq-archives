<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good idea for some games. Crap idea for EQ. Equiping melee was bad enough before, now we have to equip them all in each type of weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they should have done this in the begining honestly heh not 5 expansions later  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I forsee massive amount of complaining until SOE removes this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They won't remove it.  It gives the melee classes incentive to practice up their other skills (which frankly should have been maxed already out of sheer boredom for ppl able to attempt that sort of mob).  Decent piercers just are not that hard to come by.  I found a 12 20 dagger, warrior, ranger, rogue, bard, bst, usable in a Normal LDoN mission.  Sure that ratio is crap compared to PoTime weps, but honestly, it's probably enough to slay the dragon.  Hopefully they WILL introduce more uber piercers for warriors, rangers, paladins, SKs.  That will give our melees something to spend their DKP empires on, which will make me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why does this remind me of Luclin's over-liberal &quot;requirement&quot; of bane weapons and that it'll be a nightmare in general?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's like in D&amp;D where skeletons take half damage from slashing and 0 damage from piercing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow.  For warriors, paladins, rangers, and shadowknights, this isn't that bad.  For rogues and beastlords, it's kind of annoying (beastlords have higher hth skill caps than their other melee skills.  For monks, it's terrible.  Monks get 2hb, 1hb, and hth.  Sucks to be them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They did this sort of thing during Luclin and there was a ****storm.  <br />
<br />
Like alot of things this really doesn't smell well thought out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great so now I gotta carry around specific types of weapons for dogdog. haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
When and how?  I've never heard of anything like before, unless you're refering to luclin mobs have retardedly high AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only bane weapons would work against Emperor Ssrasheazaashearahazsha.  Huge timesink involved in getting the bane weapons for your melees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, duh :(<br />
<br />
You're right, that was pretty annoying.  This would be a lot different, though.  Emp bane was just a few evenings spent AEing the mines, but if this is implemented the way it sounds like it is going to be, every melee is going to have to claim three times as many weapons as he did before.  It's really going to bite some people in the ass, too.  Like rogues who passed on a quarm hammer and missed a rare chance to have something that isn't a piercer.  Or other assorted melees that let daggers of distraction rot.  Etc...<br />
<br />
This sounds like a good idea, honestly.  If they are trying to be realistic (as realistic as you can be in EQ), they should take in to account the properties of different weapon styles rather than just damage/delay.  For example, if you were to use a rapier against something in plate armor, it would do nothing except dull the tip of the rapier.  A mace, though, would crush the plate.  Likewise, a baseball bat to the ribs would probably only crack bones, but a knife through the ribs will kill you.  However, I don't see how they could implement this at this point in the game without it being a huge clusterF =\</div></div><hr />

ps - tks negative rep for this post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont think that its a real problem....most of the melee people I know carry around a few weapons in bags, and as others have said here, there are droppable weapons that have decent ratios and are fairly easy to farm/come by if you do a bit of farming, either in the zones they drop or in bazaar.<br />
I see it as a way that SoE will make it more challangeing for upper level guilds, at least till the tricks of which weapons do better DPS is discovered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My SK just got a Goldenrod, and has been using a Grimling Crystal Ball for 28 levels in anticipation of said Goldenrod.  If this goes live, I quit.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, rogues are screwed. Anyone know how to backstab with a 1hb? Or a 1hs? Grats them losing 40% of their damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think I like it.  Have to see how it turns out but in the long run we are talking about a more complex system which is more fun.<br />
<br />
I mean if we take the other extreme why not just get rid of all the classes and have one adventurer class that only uses a sword and populate Norrath with only Goblins who take regular damage from the a slash weapon.  That would be a little boring don't you think.<br />
<br />
This just adds a deeper element to the game mechanics and matches the old D&amp;D system.  I am sure Rogues will still be able to &quot;Strike from Behind.&quot;  It will up the value of all times of weapons and give 1HB weapons a reason to be in a Warrior's war chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Could make things interesting. Most good melee I know have max skills in everything so they will need to carry a selection of weapons with them and learn what mob requires what. I can't wait for GoD now it is really starting to look cool. Bet these mobs drop some great loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Or other assorted melees that let daggers of distraction rot.<br />
<br />
Heh, got a good laugh out of this.  Daggers of Distraction drop so often that even *I* have one as a trophy on my shaman.   :D <br />
<br />
For Time level guilds I don't see this being too big of an issue.  With as many Dagger of Distractions, Ethereal Destroyers, Cudgels of Wrecking, etc that drop it won't take long to get some on every melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Only bane weapons would work against Emperor Ssrasheazaashearahazsha. Huge timesink involved in getting the bane weapons for your melees&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a worse one in Luclin: Seru<br />
<br />
Actually if you guys think about it why would Sony screw a new class they are bringing out in the same expansion: Berserkers.<br />
They can only use  2hb and 2hs and throwing weapons which for them are axes and hammers. So this makes totally no sense why they would make mobs that are resistant. I'm still trying to figure out why some of the mnk/bst 2hb's didnt get berserkers added to them it would only make sense. The class is pretty limited on weapons as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Not many people realize this but had Sony finished PoP before releasing it, Rallos Zek would have required bane weapons.  The Zek bane weapons (Black Insanity, the original Ifir) are in game and require a considerable amount of farming tier2 zones such as Torment to get.  I imagine this was also linked to Plane of War (where Tallon and Vallon were supposed to be; ever wonder why there wings in Tactics look tacked on?).  Luckily, Zek bane requirements never made it into the release.</div></div><hr />
