<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sometimes when I am grouping or duoing, I need to be the tank or for some other reason hold aggro.  Turgur's will only get me so much aggro, what else can I do?  I have found that opening with turgur's and then bane will make a mob very very pissed at me, but that also takes a ton of mana.  Any cheap spells with massive taunt that I can use for this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have heard people say insidious decay is a massive agro machine, but I haven't used it for generating agro enough to say one way or another.<br />
<br />
When I absolutely need to get and keep agro I usually cast Plague of insects then turgur right after it.  <br />
<br />
Now there's a recipie for pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Figure out what the mobs resist most often, cast that. :p<br />
<br />
If you can get root to stick, that's a surefire way to take aggro.  Root and get in the mobs face.  As long as you're the closest to the mob, it will stay on you while rooted.  Chain cast the 30 mana 'Root'.  Paralyzing Earth seems to work well for me when I want to park an add, but doesn't seem to hold any better than regular Root if someone is beating the mob, so don't waste the mana when trying to hold aggro on a mob you're beating down.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the Cripple line of debuffs seem to taunt pretty well for me, use a lower level and chain cast it perhaps.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ID + POI = mob never gets off you. Even with multiple tanks taunting, those pesky glimmers never did get off me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used to be able to get agro at will.  <br />
<br />
After removing or modifying the agro generated by disease counters, I have more trouble.  ID and POI seem much much lower agro.   Last time I used it I was in Hate with a single group and cast it about 6 times on a spite golem (5 resists).  He never even looked at me.  Kind of annoying, used to use my agro to position mobs when it was needed sometimes... now I can't seem to get agro when I try.<br />
<br />
I tend to rely on root, just like Sciek said.  Smart leezard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get better quality tanks. That very same thing used to happen to me but those overgrown dragonfly haven't even glanced in my direction in months now, even though ID and POI are going in right away.<br />
<br />
But if you don't have tanks and wanna hold the aggro... oh yeah, that's the stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not worth slowing glimmers anyway ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">any disease dot is still good agro. used to be more but verant nerfed that with the slow agro fix.<br />
<br />
that's why SKs were using lvl 9 disease cloud to hold agro in grps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nalyeni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Blinding spells are great for aggro; just be sure to stay w/in melee range, or it acts as a fear spell.  I've successfully impersonated a SK a few times, mainly with blinds.</div></div><hr />

(only works when you get down to 1 bub of hp)</div></div><hr />

Hehe .. idea is to hold agro for *awhile* .. can't do that when ya dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kodiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">when i duo with my rogue friend i usually end up tanking so he can backstab.. at first i used root aggro but they just break too much and end up being a pain.. but using slow and then bane of nife i can hold aggro almost the whole time esp if i throw in some jbb nukes =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Turgurs and Insidious Decay work wonders for aggro, if they loose interest toss in a massive DoT.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's fun to do that and see if the cleric can keep you alive :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've found turgurs+epic+bane of nife holds taunt over rogues and rangers most of the time, you can always try it yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the times I need to play tank I pull with slow, root, incapacitate, haste myself (good to have HoS and a proccing weapon), slap a hefty dot on mob and med till root breaks then puppy and I chew up mob and promptly spit it out. <br />
<br />
though in a quick sit incapacitate and cripple combined with malosi or slow have wonderfully beautiful taunt.<br />
<br />
Learned something as a ranger mobs hate their ac taken away (flame lick). Cripple and incapacitate have ac debuffs plus str and agi so they don't hit as hard or dodge as much<br />
<br />
But root and have everyone but you back off is just as good<br />
for short durations till someone out damages or debuffs you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tainted breath works decently. Not as good as the old disease spells after &quot;nerf&quot; though.<br />
<br />
Mana cost 40, with a primal rogue, 4 dots and epic works fine to keep agro throughout fight usually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Disease dots no longer aggro as much as they did before, neither does ID nor PoI. Turgur is good for a while, but you can't really out taunt anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Might as well assist-heal the tank with the same mana for what a crummy 25% slow gives you -- and heals always land.  Plus. you're not ping-ponging the mob or making a cleric heal you instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anymore, since all the changes, have found the best way to hold taunt is Cripple/Incapacitate.<br />
<br />
Although I do seem to get a LOT of attention on the back end of the epic dot... funny how that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes those final few ticks of the epic DoT are quite a powerful taunt.<br />
<br />
I find slow+cripple taunts well in most normal situations.</div></div><hr />
