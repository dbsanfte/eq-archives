<br />
At level 65 with 280 dex (no Planar Power yet) and Fury of the Ages 3 my Crit Rate was 17.5% with my bow, 25% of my damage was from crits.<br />
<br />
Anyone else do any parsing of it? And anyone remember the crit rate with 255 dex and just Combat Fury 3?</div></div><hr />

shows crit rate from cf 1/2/3 pre PoP with capped 255 dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for those that want the short summary. at 255 dex archery crit rate was approx 14.3%... so for 9 more aa you get about 3% more chance to crit. <br />
<br />
1% extra per level. Not really huge but every little extra helps I guess. Just shows that the Luclin AA provide more bang for the buck in nearly every case which I guess is to be expected.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I haven't taken the time to retest CF3 yet (Did some proc rate testing, skill work, aimless wandering, general laziness, etc. ^-^)<br />
<br />
May mean that the PoP increase is less than what was said.)</div></div><hr />

My numbers are very close to those posted in the linked thread.  I get a crit hit using melee 2.86% of the time and 12.3% using archery.  My dex is 270 during the tests.  One more AA to go for CF3...</div></div><hr />

The &quot;25% of my damage was from crits&quot; doesn't sound reliably reproducible.  Around 13-14% additional damage is more likely most of the time... based on the math.<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5440&amp;highlight=archery+crit+rate<br />
Based on Myrrh's study a ranger with just CF1 (2 points) crits with their bow 10.6% of the time.  That amounts to about 8% additional damage with bow crits.  So, with your additional 19 AA points spent on combat fury you've achieved 6% more damage...with your bow.<br />
<br />
I'll let you decide if it was worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

Damage from non crics: 100*0,825=82,5<br />
Damage from crics: 0.175*1.7*100=29,75<br />
Total damage:29,75+82,5=112,25<br />
&lt;b&gt;% damge from crics&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;I&gt;not extra damage from crics!&lt;/I&gt;): 29,75/112,25=26,5%<br />
<br />
17.5% cric chance would amout to 17.5*0.7=12,25% extra damage from criticals.<br />
<br />
I am using 1.7 multipler for damage here i think it might be a little higher. But a 17.5% cric chance where crics deals 1.7 damage should make 26,5% of your damage come from cricc.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If 17.5% crics yields 25% of total damage with crics, cric multiplier would be be 1,57.<br />
<br />
let X be avg damage<br />
let Y be cric multiplier<br />
<br />
3*(0,175*X*Y)=0,825*X (3 times cric damage = non cric damage 25% cric 75% normal)<br />
0.525Y=0,825<br />
Y=1,57<br />
<br />
This would indicate that either. <br />
a. The parsing has some faulty numers.<br />
b. cric damage multiplier is not always ~1.7 but varies. And average cric modifier is some where around ~1.57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajsy</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to remember that criticals makes a regular hit into a higher hit(1.7*regular), so if you hit 17.5% critical hits the damage that you gain from those crits is not 17.5%.<br />
<br />
The damage gained by having 17.5% crits compared to no crits at all is 17.5*0.7=12.25%</div></div><hr />

It's worth it just for the eye candy alone :) <br />
<br />
When you consider I hit for 1040 (NON CRITICAL) quite often when using true shot.. any criticals I get on those normally 1040 shots would be in the 1850 range... adding 800 plus damage just for a criitcal is not just eye candy.. it is a ton more damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
It might not be worth it to other classes but to Rangers and Rogues it is quite important to critical more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diegaron</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No doubt criticals add damage.  It's just a matter of whether or not the expenditure of points is worth the relatively diminishing returns you get from combat fury after level 1.<br />
<br />
The 10.6% figure seems right on the money to me.  I have CF1.  I do not doubt the data from Myrrh's study.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a little parsing of it tonight, and my crit rate was ~22.5%.  280 dex, 1700 atk (if that even matters), and CF3/FotA3.  Sample size was kind of small unfortunately (only 300 hits).  Its a work in progress tho, gonna try to collect about 2k hits worth of log, just was too tired tonight, heh.  But anyway, I'm a little curious about the math above.  Its been a while since college, but seems to me that:<br />
<br />
If crit rate is 22% (for the sake of argument assuming my parse is a good indicator), then dmg increase over no crits is ~15.4%.<br />
<br />
Say your average bow hit is 200 pts.  So you shoot 1000 shots with 0 crits.<br />
<br />
1000 * 200 = 200,000<br />
<br />
Then say you shoot another 1000 shots, but this time your crit rate is 22%.  So 780 of the shots are normal, and 220 of the shots are for 1.7x normal.<br />
<br />
780 * 200 = 156,000<br />
220 * 340 = 74,800<br />
<br />
156,000 + 74,800 = 230,800 dmg total with a 22% crit rate.  So...<br />
<br />
230,800 / 200,000 = 15.4% dmg increase.  I'd say doing a little over 15% more dmg with your bow is well worth the expenditure.  Ya, its not as much bang for the buck as AM3 was (100% more for 18 pts, compared to 15% more for 21 pts), but worth it for those interested in doing as much damage as possible.  Could be worse things to spend pts on.  Like entrap, heh, or headshot ;).<br />
<br />
Edit - Cuz I can't add so well when I'm tired, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If 22% of your 1000 shots are crits, that means 220 are crits and 780 are normal, not 880.  Means your damage increase is going to work out to .7 x 22% = 15.4%.  Still, that's nothing to sneeze at.</div></div><hr />

I said it's worth it for the eye candy alone, I didn't say it's just eye candy. Two very different things :)</div></div><hr />
