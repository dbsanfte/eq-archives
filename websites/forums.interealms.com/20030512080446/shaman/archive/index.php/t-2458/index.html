<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in the mines all afternoon and all night til about midnight.  Not one Overseer and not one Rockchanter.. Closest thing I saw were goblins called &quot;Stonechanters&quot;.  I wiped out the goblins in the left and right tents in the place that the Overseer is supposed to spawn.. and that didn't spawn Overseer and I killed goblins all over the place and not one Rockchanter  :(.   Grr.. plus my forage sucks. so didn't get anything foraged either heh.</div></div><hr />
