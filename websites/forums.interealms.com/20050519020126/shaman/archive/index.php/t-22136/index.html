<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>refiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
my first post, i have recently hit 65 and been playing in GoD/Hard LDoN's more espeacially the sewers.. most of the Mobs in GoD/Hard LDoN's seem to mitigate slow in some way, i get two distinctive messages<br />
<br />
&lt;mob_001&gt; has been partially slowed or,<br />
&lt;mob_002&gt; has been mostly slowed..<br />
<br />
is there a difference in the amount slowed for a different message?.. and if so has anyone collected data on the amount slowed ..<br />
<br />
I have looked and searched through the threads but again im not very good at that so i thought id just ask :-)<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any help<br />

Refiki - 65 Iksar Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mostly = 56%ish slow with turgurs<br />
Partially = 37%ish<br />
Slightly = 17%ish.<br />
<br />
Edit: So that means a mob that is &quot;partially&quot; slowable (basically every mob in PoE, deeper in PoWater/PoFire, or Yxxta) does two and a half times as much damage as if it didn't mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
yay.</div></div><hr />

Refiki - 65 Iksar Shaman<br />
<br />
Interesting thing to bring up, i really didnt think of it before.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">[QUOTE='Grizlor']Mostly = 56%ish slow with turgurs<br />

<br />
These numbers are not how it works, but are a good model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, from my understand, those are the correct numbers for sham slow. <br />
<br />
The way it actually works is this:<br />
If a mob is mostly slowable.  Slow functions at 75% effectiveness, or 75% of a 75% slow, which is 56%.<br />
<br />
The same goes for Partially- 50% effectiveness<br />
or Slightly-25% effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, there have been parses (sorry, but I lost the link) that show that yes, there is a difference within each slow message.  It's most visible in some mobs like Fennin Ro in the plane of fire.  He is slightly slowable, but honestly, the difference is like 1 or 2%.<br />
<br />
I believe the most complete parse test I remember seeing finally tracked down the determination to a formula that was something like:<br />
<br />
(100-(X)) * slow percentage = amount slowed<br />
where X is a mob specific amount, and may be coded differently per mob.<br />
<br />
The net effect is that mobs are X% unslowable, and then (for shaman) we multiply 75% times 100-X.<br />
<br />
Thus, if a mob is fully slowable, then X = 0, and we have (100-0) * .75 = 75% slowed.<br />
<br />
If a mob is coded to be 50% unslowable, then we have (100-50) * .75 = 37.5% slowable.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen specific parses per message, but I'd strongly suspect that it's a category.<br />
<br />
Fully slowable = 75%<br />
mostly slowable is probably around 50-74%<br />
partially slowable is probably around 26-49%<br />
slightly slowable is probably anything under 25%.<br />
<br />
Those are all ballpark figures of course.  It's probably easiest to assume a single target for each level--75%, 56%, 37% and 17%.  With a few exceptions, those assumptions will allow you to tailor heals as needed (if you have a real healing class, of course)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, don't think I ever heard of mobs having their own code. Interesting theory. Definately not doubting it. ;)<br />
<br />
If we use the 75% -50% - 25% as a base to what we can expect from slowed mobs and comparrison to other class slows it should be close to this..<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Full- 75%<br />
Mostly - 56.25%<br />
Partial - 37.5%<br />
Slightly - 18.75%<br />
<br />
Enchanter<br />
Full- 70%<br />
Mostly - 52.5%<br />
Partial - 35%<br />
Slightly - 17.5%<br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
Full- 65%<br />
Mostly - 48.75%<br />
Partial - 32.5%<br />
Slightly - 16.25%<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Full- 50%<br />
Mostly - 37.5%<br />
Partial - 25%<br />
Slightly - 12.5%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I did this kinda quick, but should all be right.<br />
<br />
And wow... kinda sad if that gives us even remotely an idea of how our slows compare against heavy mitigators. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't even begin to know where I read that, Zav, so I can't track it down.  However, I think that was the concensus after they did a regression analysis based on slows from different classes.<br />
