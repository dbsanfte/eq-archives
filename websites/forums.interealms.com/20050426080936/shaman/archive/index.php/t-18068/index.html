<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RPZip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone. I duo a 50 shaman and a 50 ranger with my friend, and we're looking for a good place to hunt. We did the Hole last night, which was pretty good XP and fun. We did the Constructs pit for a while, and were told by a passing mage that we couldn't get out of there... lucky for us, she CoH'd us out to the entrance, but still.<br />
<br />
Anyone mind telling us where we should hunt in the Hole then? Or another good XP spot that we could do. We're both pretty twinked out, so we can do fairly hard mobs.</div></div><hr />

You were hunting in the right place.. Before you go there, Have your ranger buddy stop by the bazaar and pick up a couple gate potions. When XPing time is over.. you both gate out and enjoy your new XP... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can get out of the Hole now without the need for a gate potion or a teleport.  After you drop down into the pit, you can now invis and just walk all the way to the top of the castle and walk across the little bridge and then just zone out the way you came in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RPZip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I'm the Ranger. =p We'd been going in by Shrink-ing ourselves and going through the chink in the rock in Paineel. I'd also heard from someone that you couldn't get out of the castle without a key or something... any truth to that? If not, I know that the constructs pit is quite good XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">see above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the advice, we went in and beat the crap out of the Constructs pit and kept it clear, as well as pulling a few elementals. I'd actually had a Gate potion on me, but next time I'll just use my Tolan's helm and run out.<br />

Speaking of which... my friend told me that he kept getting partial resists on the Golems, and I looked them up in the Slowability list and they were listed as being disease-slow only, which he doesn't have. Does the partial resist message mean that it's at, say, 50% effectiveness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Golems with partially resist the disease based line of slows too.  They just land easier since golems have high MR.<br />
