<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can someone volunteer to make a faq thread that can be stickied at top?<br />
<br />
500 thousand questions, most repeats of previous questions is spamming this section of the board to near uselessness.  TY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I too am guilty about posting questions regarding epic quest. But keep in mind there are a LOT of post on here on a daily basis. ALOT and its hard for someone to keep up who hasn’t been here for a decent period of time. <br />
<br />
I agree, a sticky post at the top of the forum for Epic Quest Questions and Information  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7737)would be very nice. Start the first part of the post with an FAQ then allow people to post other things regarding quest in reply. However, that too will become overwhelming in time. <br />
<br />
The excitement of getting your epic could cause someone to hurry through 1000000+ post and possibly do a re-post on a question that has been asked. I Know when I have questions regarding the quest I skim the first page or so then I decided if its not there its been long enough since the question has been asked and I just reask it. :)<br />
<br />
I dont read every post., I would go insane if I did and I would become a grumpy ol shaman! Skim through and use your own filter in your mind to see what you wanna read and what you dont want to read :) <br />
<br />
I have found the assistance offered here PRICESLESS most of the people on this message board are GREAT and so helpful. I have noticed that with shamans (more so then other classes) we have some type of bond that usually compels us to assist other shamans (or at least on my server that is the case) and its nice. <br />
<br />
Yes a million post a day on epics has to get frustrating. BUT please look at the post with a bit of understanding. :) I hope none of us ever get so Uber that we forget the simple joys of getting our epic or our first piece of wolfcallers. <br />
<br />
BTW: I get my epic Saturday!!!!!! yayaya got my last 2 fights! Muahaha this is Mah Game Plan (http://ogradynet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=175)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eh, looks to me like there already is one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not complaining about people being excited about their epic.<br />
<br />
But every week we get 10 posts on the epic, and about 2 on other things. With all the epic posts, the other things - such as wood elf faction quest, cudgel quest, talisman of the faulkaen, other fun quests... fall to the bottom and aren't seen due to the spam of Epic Quest questions.<br />
<br />
Plus most of the epic quest questions are the same.<br />
<br />
I just got tired of answering them. Repeating myself over and over.<br />
<br />
There are three highly annoying quests that I see almost every other day.<br />
<br />
1) Can I do the epic shortcut (and various questions on morality legality and spirituality of doing the epic shortcut)<br />
<br />
2) Can it be MQ'd by another shaman, another class, my big brother, my alien friend from mars...<br />
<br />
3) The Rak fight, how to win, use mage pets, use 49 mage pets, use higher mage pets, use mage pets with funny hats, use warrior, use rogue, use rangers, zerg with rangers...<br />
<br />
I really don't know how to stop people from not looking at the sticky or not using the search function, as all of these questions have been answered 100 times. Not to mention question #1 always ends up in a bitch fight which is depressing to read. We've all hashed over it a million times - should you or shouldn't you, I'm just tired of reading about it.<br />
<br />
Sad but true. I'd rather this forum be more like the one on the Safehouse - SOME epic questions, but more questions on other quests. There are 1000 other quests to do besides the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe 1 forum dedicated to NOTHING but EPIC QUEST questions? and then if someone post epic quest questions in this forum the modirator moves it to the appropret forum!!! Have we ever thought about that one?<br />
<br />
I dont see any reason this question should lead to a bitch fest, honeslty filtering through the epic quest topics does hinder the amount the other post are viewed and thats just logic but The Crucible  has to be the #1 place on the net all shamans turn to for their information so its bound to happen one way or the other :) <br />
<br />
HUGS to all my shaman brothern and sistahs!<br />
Much Love</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feel free to discuss it, we (I) aim to please!<br />
<br />
I'll change the title of the epic sticky in the meantime, perhaps make it a little more noticeable.</div></div><hr />
