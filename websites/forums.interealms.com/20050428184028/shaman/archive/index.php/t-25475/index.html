<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me share a experience Ive now had 5 seperate times in 5 different zones and get you guys opinions of it.<br />
<br />
Seems like everytime I get a quest that the mobs I have to kill are basically concentrated in one area, (lets use the Ruins in Stranglethorn as a example)<br />
<br />
You have to get necklaces... teeth.. kill a certain amount etc... So I come to the ruins watch the pathing of mobs and wanderers etc and proceed to break the camp. I get it done and IT NEVER FAILS someone comes running by sees the camp broken and jumps in and starts killing mobs.<br />
<br />
Its usually not to much a problem with Horde people cause we can speak and come to a agreement... but not being able to speak with Alliance and ask them to move on for 30 mins while I finish quest or ask them to take the left side of ruins while I do right.... whatever works best... is impossible...<br />
<br />
I find this more and more annoying as I go up in level....I know that there are no camps in WOW like in EQ.... but did all respect for others work in breaking a area just disappear also? <br />
<br />
Its a difficult situation for me cause I dont really like the idea of a &quot;camped&quot; area but then again if you have 7 mobs u have to kill 20 times each and some guys come by and take 5 of your mobs and u can only get to 2 before they do..... your quest just went from a hour to 5 hours long....<br />
<br />
I may just be complaining to complain but to me its a real problem in WOW for me.... I really dont know what the answer is... maybe I should just move to another quest..... but it would probally happen all over again....<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this subject are welcome<br />
<br />
Tks</div></div><hr />

this, is one example, of the good thing about a pvp server. Kill the alliance scum untill they do not return :)<br />
<br />
respawn is quick though, there are other mobs aroudn to kill for exp while you wait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get on a PvP server.  When an alliance guy tries to take over your camp, gank him.  On a PvE server ... dunno, I guess you have to make it unprofitable for them to be there by KSing all their pulls.  It sucks, but they've scrambled even emotes, so even the most basic communication is impossible (though rumour has it that leet speak isn't scrambled and bypasses the scrambling process).  That said, it isn't worth my brain cells to try and speak leet speak.  I'd likely either KS or leave on PvE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jwilearl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like it when you see a chest in a camp and you start clearing out the mobs to get to it. Of course as you are doing this someone else will think it's ok to help themselves to the loot while you are still battling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the absolute best is mining gank, only happened once, when I was much younger, but I got killed by somone ten levels above me in charred veil, when I started to mine, then the sum bitch mined it in front of me, haha.<br />
<br />
I see enemies yelling in ascii characters sometimes, there is some patterns, but I know them not at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rogue's Vanish can help, regardless of the side the inconsiderate folks are on.  Granted, it's real mean, but I've been in process of clearing to a chest or breaking a camp and had someone come waltzing in.  I just move close and poof!  no more competition.<br />
<br />
Granted there as some quests that breaking the camp is only needed to get to a landmark / item, then I don't care if people tag it while I clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah it's mostly people that have never played a MMOG similar to EQ, WoW I am guessing. There is no respect for camps at all, none. I usually try and line up a few quests so when some jerky waltzes in most times I just go to the next quest. However, I have successfully defended a camp a few times when I had no intention of leaving. It is annoying for a while, waiting on respawn, but I kept tagging asap and killing as fast as I could without overextending myself. Usually what happens is they overextend themselves, pull too much or aggro a named with a few other mobs and die. The humiliation of it usually makes em leave at that point. :)<br />
I have started to have less respect for camps myself having mine invaded so many times. All I can say is deal with the annoyance or decide if it's even worth sticking around...or join a pvp server and kill em if that's your thing. Of course you can't kill your own side and sometimes they are the most annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From what I've seen so far the respawn rates are high enough to allow you to progress ok in this situation. I think if it happens, just switch you tactics based on the fact WoW has mob tapping unlike EQ, so get a fast attack ability/spell up and make sure you tap the mobs first thus you'll get the loot/XP if they decide to carry on attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only problem I see is with named/specific mobs you have to clear a path to. Areas like ruins where the spawn rate is high enough on the trash mobs, not so much.<br />
<br />
I was clearing the way back to Tharll'Zun (sp? named Orc in Redridge) for my brother last night. Level 20 to 22 elites in the way. Had cleared all the way back to the left courtyard (approx 10 to 12 mobs) and were working on the last group on the steps to the fortress when a 46 NE Rogue with a couple of friends just waltzed by and ran right into the area where Tharl'Zun was, intending to steal him. They made the mistake of wasting time to kill one trash mob in the way. I tagged the named from across the courtyard with an Aimed Shot so he and his 3 body guards came after me and my brother. We took them out easily, but then Sonyc (guild: Band of the Hand on Garona) decided to lambast both of us because we &quot;stole his mob&quot; and decided to challenge me to a duel. <br />
<br />
What a dipsh!t.<br />
<br />
He just couldn't understand that we had cleared the path and there was no way I was gonna just stand there and let him waltz in and profit from my efforts without asking to get involved. All these nitwits have to do is ASK to join the group and we'd all get the credit. INCONSIDERATE MORONS!<br />
<br />
Thank City of Heroes for ruining the &quot;respect anothers camp&quot; aspect of MMO's. Cryptics rule sets ENCOURAGED kill stealing, playing it off as &quot;Heros helping Heros&quot;. Total crap. That's why I chose to mostly do missions with my wife instead of street sweeping (which, in most cases, was far better exp).<br />
<br />
[EDIT]Add ore veins, herb blooms, and chests to the &quot;things I clear the path to, only for some moron to rush by me and take it&quot; list. They should find a way to &quot;tap&quot; those so the person who discovered them can claim them after fighting their way in. The &quot;tap&quot; should only last a minute or two, but miners/herbalists need some way to protect their claims while they're clearing the way to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its good to see Im not the only one that has seen these kind of problems...Tho it sucks for you guys to have to deal with them if you think anything at all like I do, and from the posts alot of you do.<br />
<br />
Both my druid and my shaman are 42 now and Im just curious from the higher level people... can I except the same kind of junk when I move to higher zone?<br />
<br />
I remember in EQ when we finally made it to Sebilis.... camps were camps and violation got you reamed out by the entire zone... /those were the days!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To avoid overcrowding (with alliance, no clue on horde fasttrack zones), avoid the following zones: elwynn forest, westfall, duskwood, darkshore, stranglethorn vale.  There are tons of quests to do in alternate zones and almost no one is in these other zones.<br />
<br />
If you are in one of the &quot;fast track&quot; zones, then you get to deal with the inherent problems of overcrowding.<br />
<br />
I usually just tag MOBs when people move in on my camps.  They get to kill my mobs for me and I get to loot it.  They usually get the idea pretty quick and move on.<br />
<br />
Both my druid and my shaman are 42 now and Im just curious from the higher level people... can I [expect] the same kind of junk when I move to higher zone?<br />
<br />
Yes and no.  <br />
<br />
Yes because there will be more people in the higher level areas when you are higher level (right now the average level seems to be about 35-45 with very few above 50 - on my server, I assume its similar on other servers).  <br />
<br />
No because you will be doing mostly instances after 55 for the best loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The main thing ive noticed in WOW is ive never seen so many people who just skip talking. <br />
<br />
In other words ive never had so many invites to group without a word being said to me. Nor have i had to share so many camps without a word being said to me. <br />
<br />
People just kinda blow in and out and if you're anywhere near a quest mob....even if you arent working on that quest i get invited multiple times sometimse by people. <br />
<br />
With that all said though I stopped getting ticked by it pretty fast. Alot of the people who force me to share at least stay out of my way. Mobs dont take too long to spawn and again &quot;most&quot; seem to be able to see when your pulling and work in a unspoken tandom when clearing alot mobs in an area. <br />
<br />
I am still amazed though at the share numbers of random invites without a single word being said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I find communication in WoW more difficult than in EQ.<br />
<br />
The lack of a default channel is one problem, the lack of a /telltarget command is another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A few thoughts:<br />
<br />
The spawn rates are very fast, so it normally just slows me down by a few minutes if I'm racing someone else for pops.<br />
<br />
If a zone is too crowded I just go somewhere else.  I've got plenty of active quests in Stranglethorn, Dusk?? Swamp, Swamp of no hope, Ariatha, and a couple other zones I can't remember atm.  At 37 I have no shortage of places to go.  :D <br />
<br />
It's fun to steal mobs from the evil alliance players!  (especially pally's  ;) )  Seriously...I don't do it very often and only if I need the mob, but it is fun if you think of the other side as guards in EQ that you had to pull the mobs from before they stole your xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best time is nailing Horde types without PvP.<br />
<br />
Today in Desolace I was doing two quests -kill Undead Ravagers and collect ghost goop.<br />
<br />
Well to collect the goop you need to activate a box at a particular location. When you do Centaur Ghosts show up.  You have a couple of seconds to reacts, but they appear and quickly become hostile.<br />
<br />
There were two or three Horde types mucking around at the exact spot I needed to activate the device.  Sure enough I click it and hightail it for a corner to watch what happens.<br />
<br />
About four or five ghosts appear turn hostile and then ream the Horde types (who were busy fighting a Ravager).  They looked like LAPD doing a baton tapp dance on Rodney King's head. (Centaurs have a rearing motion attack)<br />
<br />
Good times.</div></div><hr />

I think not being able to speak to each side is pretty fun. Was a Orc shaman and myself working through some satrys in Fellwood. I got 3 and he sat watching and laughed at me. Thought i was going to die. I didnt though. Was to rewarding 5 minutes later watching him ghost wolf out because he overpulled and was getting whooped lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Faern - that's cruel, vicious, and fantastic.  ;)<br />
<br />
I find that it's not really comparable to EQ KS'ing.  You know *instantly* at the beginning of a fight whether you're going to get credit or not (as opposed to EQ's 51% of the damage rule) - so you're never... say... laying in the majority of your mana on DoTs, just to have some asstard wizard steal it by nuking at 60% health.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
Lots of factors make it a non-issue - as were mentioned above - including fast spawn time and fast health/mana regeneration.  I got pretty pissed the first couple of times, but then I made the conscious decision to NOT let it bother me.  Things move so fast in WoW, that it really isn't worth it.  <br />
<br />
I think the only reason we're really tempted to get up in arms over it is because in EQ, someone could easily waste 10-15 minutes of your (soloing) time by KS'ing, because you'd be sitting and medding back what you wasted helping them take credit for your mob.  I think it was a conscious design choice in WoW to minimize these kinds of problems as much as they could, and it's one of the things I appreciate about WoW the most.</div></div><hr />
