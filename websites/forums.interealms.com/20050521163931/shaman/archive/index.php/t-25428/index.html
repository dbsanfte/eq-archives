being mounted counts as sitting, which = medding which = regaining mana faster than standing... numbers??? /shrug<br />
<br />
as for druid forum, good point /giggle<br />
<br />
I typically just read shammy and tank forums, don't really care what the treehuggers are doing one week to the next</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe being mounted only helps with medding, NOT HP regen.  mounted != sitting.<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
if (mounted)<br />
    mana++;<br />
elseif (!(mounted) &amp;&amp; sitting)<br />
    mana++;<br />
    hp++;<br />
else<br />
    standing_regen();</div></div><hr />

<br />
and actually don't see anything about mana regen until someone else brought it up....</div></div><hr />

This *very* annoying bug is in the game now for at least 6 months. I think its was introduced when SOE switched to DX9. <br />
<br />
I think it happens especially to large races who are shrunk and sitting on a horse. Somehow this state *can* bug you (probably the Z-Axis) in a way that other PCs/NPCs which stand nearby are regarded as out of range, resulting in buffs/debuffs not hitting.<br />
Very very annoying when you just MGBed Focus and none of your raid has been hit.<br />
<br />
This problem came up over and over again on the boards, but was never fixed. I guess the devs were busy fixing some obscure door in Freeport which did open the wrong way instead of addressing this concern...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">same effect that prevents you from being ported by the LDoN mages, they don't react to hails if you're on a mount half the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Man, I was only playing along with the druid comment.<br />
<br />
Do you know that &quot;gullible&quot; is written on the ceiling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">funny thing....you do not always have medding mana regen on your mount...<br />
<br />
to have medding mana regen, you have to be sitting still...used to ride my mount to an fro LDONs thinking I was getting extra med time while moving...until I watched my mana numbers.... &gt;.&lt;;<br />
<br />
still helps for camps though...just find your spot, and plant your drog right there....<br />
<br />
but back on topic, I've experienced the same thing in WoS, usually I'll just click off my mount to group buff....not like you get the cumulative HP regen on mount like you do sitting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;I think it happens especially to large races who are shrunk and sitting on a horse.&quot;<br />
don't have to be shrunk either...happens to me all the time without useing shrink (i hate being shrunk...) i pretty much always demount to cast buffs now.<br />
<br />
&quot;to have medding mana regen, you have to be sitting still&quot;<br />
if this is true you really do learn something every day...no jest intended...i never really moved when useing mounts but good to know lol =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seems to mess up group buffs when you ride around into objects somewhat. For instance, if you ride onto a table it has a chance that it'll screw it up. It's like the game thinks you're still in a table or wall or something. /shrug<br />
<br />
Just remember to click off mounts when you want to buff/random. =)</div></div><hr />
