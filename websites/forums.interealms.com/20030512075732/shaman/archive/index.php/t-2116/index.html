<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>t0rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is my question:  I know that a Vah Shir can wear Hate Planar armor ( Rune Etched ) but what about the Plane of Growth armor??  Other shammys can wear it but all the info I can find online says Vah Shir's can't.  Either that is true or that hasn't been updated yet???  Well if they can't wear PoG armor then what is my planar upgrade??? Or am I stuck with SS/Thurg quest armor? (that is what my guild is allignied with)<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, if your guild opts to skip POG and go right to Kael/ToV raids for Thurg/SS armor, consider yourself lucky!  Shaman drops aren't all that plentiful in POG and the place is very annoying with those every 30 minute aggro on everyone KOS from anyplace in the zone POG mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All of the info you are finding about the PoG armors was compiled long before the Vah Shir existed. It doesn't really surprise me that you aren't seeing them listed as being able to use them.<br />
<br />
I don't happen to have any, so I can't confirm that they can but I would presume that they can.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin quest armors are essentially identical to the PoG armors, so I wouldn't characterize it as being 'stuck' with it. SS armors are superior to either of those.</div></div><hr />
