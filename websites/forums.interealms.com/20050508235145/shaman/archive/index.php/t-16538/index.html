<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tested this a tiny bit when I got my 2nd stun resist item and it didnt seem like it stacked.  Now Im upto 4 stun resist items and havent noticed much of a difference since I got my first, thou I havent tested it recently, just observing.  Has anyone else tested this out and can confirm or deny my observation?<br />
<br />
Seems a bit weak if it doesnt stack, from my understanding spell sheilding and shielding, the other % mods, do stack, and they are just better then stun resist, just doesnt seem right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i just got my first stun resist mod a couple days ago all tho i havent got the chance to play with it it would sound like it would stack seieng ss stacks supposedly  but who knows maby its random /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stun resist just kinda sucks for shm, ive had a stun resist item for over a month (7%mod) and its only worked twice.  Now with the amount of time i play thats too few and far between to be worth while.  Stood in gd one day for about 5 hours letting a blue con giant wack away at me, never resisted stun.<br />
<br />
im pretty sure the dodge % mods dont stack either</div></div><hr />
