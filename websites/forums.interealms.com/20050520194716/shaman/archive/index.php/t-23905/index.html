<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's been mentioned before that mob AI was beefed up, but last night I was in a Deep Guk Hard LDON:<br />
<br />
My grp:<br />
<br />
Druid / Paladin / Wizard / Rogue / Shaman / Warrior<br />
<br />
We had 5 mobs in camp, fight is close, I have all mobs malo'd and slowed and we are taking a beating when I see the following message spam across:<br />
<br />
Your Turgur's Insects has worn off.<br />
Your Turgur's Insects has worn off.<br />
Your Turgur's Insects has worn off.<br />
<br />
It all went to hell after that, lost the rogue.  <br />
<br />
2 of the mobs were clerics for sure, they kept CHing each other.  Maybe a wizard mob as well, rest were warriors.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how it happened?  I am positive all 3 mobs were 'cured' at once...but who has a AoE disease cure?  Do mobs that are in close proximity could as being in a 'group'?  It was certainly unusual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, perhaps a stealthy step-up in difficulty for groups with average level &gt; 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, been noticing the same thing in LDoN lately - mobs will cure slow pretty quickly if they can. Course, the other side to that is when they're casting cure they're not casting nukes / heals. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, anyone done 65+ ldon's since the patch? Points seem odd. 51 for a normal at 65, 49 for a normal at 66??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have not seen the mass slow wear off....but they do cast more spells it seems.<br />
<br />
Tryin to do the Droga and Chardok tasks its a bigger pain to do now as they cast way more crap.<br />
<br />
As for the LDoN points...yeah you get some weird #s now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On of the cleric mobs cast word of heal instead of a CH one time. It's a group heal with a cure disease component. I've seen them casting these for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On 9/14, many (all?) spells got an npc_usefulness attribute added to them on lucy.  I reckon spell casting mobs got smarter right about then. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: npc_category was added as well...  So I assume that spells are prioritized within their functional groupings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Setanta, as I understand it, LDoNs have levels, each of which covers a certain range of average party levels.  So which level LDoN you get is controlled by your average group level, but it's not like the game gives you an LDoN of level 37.25 if that's your average group level, it just gives you the 35-40 level LDoN (unless you pick hard in which case you get the level 40-45 LDoN, or something like that).  It's been reported that LDoNs post-65 are actually the same level LDoNs given to 65s.  Therefore, you are fighting the same LDoN you did at 65, but since your level is higher they're easier.  SOE probably figures that if you do a LDoN of a lower level than you are supposed to, you should get less points for it.  By the same principle, I'd imagine if you were exactly 6 (or 5, whatever the max is) levels away from every member of your party, and you got an LDoN of their level, you'd get less points than if you got the next level up LDoN with a group of people your level, although I've never tested this or anything.<br />
<br />
However, the real question as I see it is why aren't you getting the 66-70 level LDoN when doing normals?  SOE said they wouldn't add any new LDoNs, but the 65 hard level LDoN (which already exists) should have been the same as a 66-70 normal LDoN.  Were you in a group with a majority of 65s or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are you sure the fight just wasn't a long fight and slow just wore off?  I mean ya got 5 mobs slowed, that can make things kinda hectic... time goes by fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raknath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have also heard a chanter complain that when fighting the murkglider school leader that some of the mobs would clear mez from oher mobs.  Seems they work together with a little bit more than heal now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i'm not sure about spellcaster AI.. but i noticed something weird in befallen last night, i was past the 3rd? locked door.. and i was fighting a skellie and all of a sudden it ran off at 60% (and this couldnt have been him running at low health.. because skellies dont do that) and came back with about 10 of his friends, i figured they had beefed up AI.. and then i saw this thread /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'm not sure about spellcaster AI.. but i noticed something weird in befallen last night, i was past the 3rd? locked door.. and i was fighting a skellie and all of a sudden it ran off at 60% (and this couldnt have been him running at low health.. because skellies dont do that) and came back with about 10 of his friends, i figured they had beefed up AI.. and then i saw this thread /shrug<br />
This happened in WoS the other night as well. We pulled a Dragon Toiler from one of those camp-places, and instead of coming to the puller, it made a circle in the camp and gathered up some friends. We killed all but one, but as soon as the 2nd to last one died, the last one ran BACK to the camp and got some more friends, which promptly wiped us. I thought it was cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Taraddar is right.  One of the mobs must have been a cleric and used Word of Replenishment which will heal and cure a group of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm just curious if there making the mobs smarter are they at least giving more exp? Retired shaman, so I can't experience this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah I have seen mobs dispell to remove malos and seen them cure to remove slow. Usually cleric mobs do the cure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wonder if this new AI is related to their work on EQ2.<br />
<br />
Seems like mobs are cooperating more, acting as a group when fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The cleric mobs were doing the group heal with the cure component. I've never seen a mob cast Pure Blood, Abolish Disease, or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually I have seen them casting what appears to be like anull magic spells.<br />
<br />
My slow was also removed a couple of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I picked up the Leadership AA that ID's spells being cast. Been noticing Alot more stuns and utility spells flying than there used to be (i.e. dispell's and cure's). <br />
<br />
I do know is I love that AA. Knowing when the is casting a CH is wonderful. Having the chance to try and interrupt it and burn the bugger down is a godsend.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree, after health of target's target, spell awareness is the next best leader ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've had mobs in OOW zones start dispelling my Malosini from themselves, then cure Turgur's.  It got annoying, and the first time it happened, we had one of them charmed so I thought someone in our group had done the dispelling and curing.  Priest mobs definitely got a little smarter.  It may be for the better though, if they start curing/dispelling instead of gating or healing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wonder if caster mobs have spell gems to worry about or if they can just cast right from the spellbook :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I forgot. yeah they do annul. hraquis annul my root sometimes :(</div></div><hr />

Had something simmilar happen at OC camp in PoValor a few days ago while playing my wizard.  Had one of the razorfields gate at 60% and come tear assing back with 4 of his friends.  Id never seen a razorfiend gate before (this is the third character Ive taken through PoV), and Ive never seen a mob gate at more than 10% health.<br />
<br />
Its annoying, and really should be looked at.</div></div><hr />

Woah.  Are you sure it was gate?  I don't think they are even casters are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We had one of the Razorfiend's warp on us at 4% health, but it actually warped to the graveyard rather than back to the cave.  I don't think they are casters, so it probably wasn't gate.  It may have fallen through the world and warped back to its spawn point perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I had a shaman mob in camp in a Sro adv got 2 turgurs and a bane of nife cured by one cast of the shaman in camp.  And for that I unleashed the pound puppies of hell upon his buttocks.</div></div><hr />
