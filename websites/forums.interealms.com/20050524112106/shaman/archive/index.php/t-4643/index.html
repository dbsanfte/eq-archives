Hopefully it can be cast on other groups.<br />

Even if this was group shrink, they still missed the point. It's very inconvenient to keep switching groups to shrink people. We need a shrink that can be cast on people outside your group, whether it's a group spell or single target. Just make a single target one and have a confirm box, just like Translocate. The code already exists for this, the change would not affect game balance in any conceivable way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">donlo's dementia is the grp shrink spell, its only on an item from vex thal atm tho. it is shaman only and its grp only right now, when it first came out it was AE but not its been nerfed to grp only. the ae was stupid anyway as you would get the soandso has cast a spell on you but you are protected msg.</div></div><hr />
