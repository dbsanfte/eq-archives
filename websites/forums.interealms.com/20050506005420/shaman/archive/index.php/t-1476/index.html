<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone, just hit message board on eqshaman, and found this board for the first time, wow there is a very active community here.  I'm a lvl 55 Troll Shaman on Seventh Hammer and just got my epic a few days ago... and wow was it rocky hehe.. In the final battle rak didn't ae me, took about 40 seconds to kill me, and pushed me back into a wall and the clerics could not target the fire pets as they went into the corner of a small room.  The clerics upon trying to target the fire pets got ae'd themselves and died even before getting a heal off.. fortunately I was with a couple of very bright mages (only had 2 pets going) who re-casted a pet each time one died, and it worked!  I was at the entrance to COM freaking out during the 15 minutes it took to kill Rak.  Hehe, anyways anyone have something interesting like that happen when doing the final battle, or another point in the epic?  I've never heard of the final battle being done without clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Chain-casting fire pets has been the conventional way of taking Rak down for a long time, because of the exact problems you had :)<br />
<br />
Nothing funny has happened to me, but something good happened to a guild shaman (who i hate and is a complete idiot.  I swear he has paw of oppolla in one hand and testament of vanear in the other.  every time i see him i want to slap him)<br />
<br />
He went to go do the test of patience, but instead of going down there alone and using invis vs animals like a normal shaman, he three boxes himself (54 shaman), his 45 druid, and his friend's 60 warrior.  In the confusion of trying to play three characters at once, he get attacked by killer sharks just as his EB starts to wear off on all three characters.  All three of them drown :D</div></div><hr />
