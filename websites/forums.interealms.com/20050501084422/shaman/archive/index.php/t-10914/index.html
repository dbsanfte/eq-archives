<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Gulf of Gunthak is the only port on Broken Skull Rock. Every other place where the island meets the water is steep, rocky and exposed to the rough weather. That does not mean Gunthak is an entirely safe harbor, as the shore of the gulf is barren and rocky, and the cliffs beyond the bay are holed with caves. Most of these caves are shallow, but a few of them lead deep into the cliff and open into a rather expansive cavern system.<br />
<br />
This is the gateway to the lair of the Broken Skull Clan. It serves as the home for the newly recruited clan members and temporary housing for anyone that the clan trusts just enough not to kill outright. Anyone wishing to learn about this fierce group of Trolls should start here and, if they are lucky, find the passages into the deeper parts of Broken Skull Rock. Rumors have reached many adventurers that they may find welcome, or at least a safe landing, near the abandoned lighthouse.<br />
<br />

This kinda sounds like your new home if this hasnt already been realized. I know its not fun losing your home city , but atleast it sounds like you getting a updated home WITH water access even. Rejoice , the time of sharing space with the elves is limited i think ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just curious, is there a newbie zone nearby? I gave up on the beta.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok First let me say that I'm onboard with Trolls getting their own starter city ... PLEASE Dev's if you are reading ... give Trolls a city instead of sharing.   <br />
<br />
But I don't think what's listed of the LoY site reflects a starter city.   What it does sound like is a option for faction work or even a faction choice ... aka recruitment ... to the Broken Skull Clan.    I can see some sort of new acceptance flag into Broken Skull Clan for Trolls that then allows you access to all the functions of that zone.   <br />
<br />
IE<br />
 It serves as the home for the newly recruited clan members and temporary housing for anyone that the clan trusts just enough not to kill outright.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;newly recruited clan members&quot; would be anyone that chooses to join the clan.   Each new member would be flagged which effects faction which in turn effects vendors, priests, etc.   Something like what's currently used for Shadowhaven. <br />
<br />
What I would REALLY like to see (if all the above is true) is that Trolls receive a stand alone type of faction or membership as recruits.     Anyone other than Trolls would fall into the other group which is still faction based but only provides base level faction ... AKA &quot;temporary housing for anyone that the clan trusts just enough not to kill outright.&quot;   This should be our reward for the whole Grobb debacle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didnt take those descriptions of the new zones to infer a new troll starting city, at least not for Grobb trolls. Broken Skull Clan is not the same as Grobb Clan (or whatever the exact name may be), and a lot of you have mentioned how old troll quests gave negative Broken Skull faction.<br />
<br />
I think the Guntak thing is probably going to be just something of an outpost, where some races will be non-kos (probably dubious). Grobb trolls will probably be kos, though because they are enemies to the Broken Skull Clan.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe there will be some other zone that they didnt write about which contains some kind of settlement of Grobb Clan that chased after the Broken Skull invaders and that will be a new starting city, but I'm just speculating. It could be that all you old timer trolls will always remain 'The Banished', and all newbie trolls will be Broken Skull trolls. I guess we'll find out on the 24th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deep within the damp walls that lie beneath the swamp, a mail-clad amphibian stands within the semicircular gaze of the council. He speaks in the tongue of his people, confident and proud, yet devoid of emotion. &quot;We watched them as you requested. It is confirmed. They have sent their soldiers to the sea. The crusaders have left their home. Only a small force remains to defend it. All that you have sent us to observe has occurred. We have nothing else to report.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, most of the trolls took to the sea and only a small force remained, which if properly why they were over run. The question is where did those trolls go and where are they now?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They went chasing the Broken Skull trolls that invaded Grobb and stole the Gromzek stone. Read all the stories in the game story window.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the wun going to unify the trolls? <br />
<br />
Bah how untrollish an idea.  The only method of unification recognised amongst us trolls is to kill anyone who is out of line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They can't make the new troll city in LoY since trolls are an old world race... What happens to all the people who don't buy the expansion, they wouldn't be able to make trolls anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ya, the Grozmok is supposed to unify all the trolls and lead us to the promised land of chicken-fried gnomes.  <br />
<br />
I kind of like the idea of having 2 separate clans of trolls as long as they get us old farts out of a city we can't walk in.  It would be even more exciting if the &quot;new&quot; trolls had some sort of distinctive tattoo or birthmark that set them aside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds like trolls may have 2 starting places...trolls should have the option on creation to start in this new area making them a new recruit to broken skull...<br />
Why not leave Neriak as a secondary option for troll starting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SOE is also going to drop the name of troll as playable race. When LoY comes out, we'll be known as Palestinians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barbecue sauce plays a part, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purifyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really hope the zone designers at Sony/Verant didn't write the new expansion lore on a Friday afternoon...  If the trolls of Grobb have to share a city with the troll clan that brought about our downfall then that is a piss poor storyline to try and follow.   I would rather be kos to the Broken Skull trolls and never have a new home city than join with them... BAH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All races deserve a separate starting city.  If the trolls don't get one and have to stay in Neriak, SOE really needs to learn better business practices.  Starting with storylines, customer service, common sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think its pretty f'n weak.  Instead of creating a new zone off innothule (or off guk) they wanted to maximize profit which meant investing very little into the creative process for LoY.  Over the years I've played, I've seen EQ slowly lose the magic that we all enjoyed so much about it due to SOE's ruthless greed.  I understand that the point of a corporation is to make money, but it can be synergistic, it doesn't have to be all about screwing customers because its a better business plan on paper.  They rely on our addiction, and on features we can't live without, to keep us buying them.  Want to level to 65?  buy pop.  Want extra bank space?  Buy LoY.  Bank space doesn't seem like a strong argument to me personally, but I've lost count of how many people have said they'll buy it just for that.  Velious was the last expansion in line with the spirit of the game.  Starting with SoL, the bait and switch tactic was relied upon to force expansion purchase.  A year from now expansions will likely be a monthly thing.  For christ's sake, enchanters' solo power is greater than some full groups' but its on the backburner because class balance doesn't equal profit.  I'll be the first one to tell you I'm an addict, but it can only go so far.  I'm not buying LoY, I haven't bought PoP, and I'll never, as long as I live, buy another sony product.<br />
