<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I log my first account on, sit the toon in nexus, hit Alt-Enter to enable mouse outside of screen.<br />
<br />
Go to windows explorer, open up programs, everquest, yadda, yadda.<br />
<br />
Eventually get patched, and the second account slowly opens.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, by this time the first account's screen has gone completely black. Cannot access it, but the character in question is still in the game. (I can /who toon and see them in nexus)<br />
<br />
I use a dial up and just switched to earthlink. (HINT = DON'T). This switch was not by  choice.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? I'm running Win 98 with 733 processor and 256 MEG of RAM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only way is with EQW the unofficial version - new version available that works at www.eqwindows.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was unable to just go out to windows and look at a web page...<br />
<br />
It basicly froze my system and I had to force EQ closed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ditto here. tried it with 2 EQ's open, 2 EQWs open, 1 EQ &amp; 1 EQW, and none of them worked.<br />
<br />
All of them, I got the first window I opened became a black hole after I logged in the 2nd toon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use EQW, and have had up to 4 instances of EQ open at once.  DO NOT     ALT-TAB out of EQW.  First make sure you are running 232 EQW.  Second,  when trying to get out of EQW hit CNTRL-ALT-R, this will free your windows mouse cursur.  Then go up and minimize your window that way.  Now start your 2nd instance of EQW, once it goes through all the hoopla and 2nd toon is loaded use CNTRL-ALT-S to switch between the 2 instances of EQW.  If you have more than two going at once you'll have to CNTRL-ALT-R and minimize to choose the EQW you want to access.  If you freed your mouse this way once you get back to EQW that you did this in you'll have to CNTRL-ALT-R again to regain your EQ mouse.  I'm not running any high speed machine either. AMD 1.2 althon, a gig of SDRAM, and a G-force 4 generic video card.  Try changing windows the way I say above, and it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EQW has always worked flawlessly for me.  <br />
<br />
However, I frequently cannot go from the EQ-native-in-a-window back to fullscreen.  I try, but it goes black, and I have to camp or /q to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive found that a way to fix the blank/black screen using EQ's windowed mode is to re-full screen then re-window it. (Alt-enter twice, basically.) Annoying.<br />
<br />
I think we need some better way to differentiate between EQ Windows (the 3rd party program) and EQ's windowed mode (VI's doing) a bit better. :P</div></div><hr />
