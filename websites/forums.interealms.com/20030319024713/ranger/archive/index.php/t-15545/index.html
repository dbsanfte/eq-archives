<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">PoN trial for Terris Thule's Lair is a 3 group event, run in maze and protect the erudite (copy of gnome quest in CT)<br />
<br />
our guild is far from uberness, no ntov yet, neither luclin bosses (xcept for umbral bosses we whacked couple times ;))<br />
<br />
that was our first attempt and we had not very much infos about it, i was told that 3 enc 61+ were recquired. we had only one enc lvl 65, so i was doubtful about our chances to succeed, but anyways, it's a game, got to try !<br />
<br />
so we tried :)<br />
<br />
the first waves ran easily, after all they are only a warmup to the latest ones ;)<br />
we had some probs with the 2 last waves (7 or 8 mobs), one or two offtanks died, but we finally managed to kill'em.<br />
<br />
nightmare construct (boss of the event) was a long fight, he got plenty hp, but as he's a no-add fight, gone down flawlessly :) :)<br />
he's ugly btw... i mean really 00gly :p<br />
<br />
i'm glad there's some fun not-so-hard content for non-highend ubah guilds on PoP.<br />
<br />
just wanted to share some rejoice ;) :D :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">aye the hedge walk was a very long and drawn out event, but it was fairly easy cept for the last guy.  Wait til ya fight TT now;) now thats a fun fight hehe:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want to set this up as an event for my guild.  It seems we are very similar to yours.  How long did this take, set up til finish?<br />
<br />
And grats on your victory. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">about 3 hours, much more than required if you have good force, because we had to stop the NPC during the 2 last waves, he was going to next before we finish the fights.<br />
<br />
few hints i noticed :<br />
dazzle works on the NPC (hope no nerf is coming). this will let you have time to recover after each wave.<br />
position mobs with NPC in the back of them, or he will get ripostes on enrage, they all enrage.<br />
if you have 1 enc 61+ (which is risky) you have to have 4 tanks. last wave is a 8 pop.<br />
waves are all lvl 60 mobs, need enc 61 to mez.<br />
slow the boss, he pops for 1138 or so w/o defensive :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tinlaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh, and have a tolan bracer somewhere, just in case Feeldary feels like pin cushioning the boss ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">case Feeldary feels like pin cushioning the boss <br />
<br />
/rofl<br />
<br />
Finished this last night.  Now that was a long trial :)  Had a few cleric learn not to be standing in the middle of the spawn spots :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lemminkainen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have only tried this once. With 3 tanks and a single level 60 enchanter. Made it to the 6th round. Haven't been able to get people to commit to a retry yet.<br />
<br />
Was quite a bit of fun, after we got around the lovely &quot;lets port each group to a different copy of maze&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aanlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We tried this the other night as well.  I had tons of fun until my ISP crapped out in the middle of a wave and I was unable to log on until the following day.  Guild was unsuccessful for our first attempt.  Hope to retry again soon.  BTW, logged on finally the next moning to a nightstalker pounding me.  Didnt even bother hitting atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the minimum of the event is:<br />
<br />
2x 60+ enchanters<br />
2x 60+ clerics<br />
2x 60+ tank based chars<br />
and just fill in the rest with random classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bah you could try to root, snare, move away, invis, relog.<br />
<br />
i always do that when i need to go deeper in a dungeon where mobs see invis<br />
<br />
i did it thousand times in sebilis, and a few times in PoD/PoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've done it with one 65 enc and one ~63 tank.   Just gotta have people that are used to the event and know what to expect.<br />
<br />
Also, if you need to med, just have someone agro Thelin and memblur when everyone is FM.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the last two waves, have all melee in the center (your tanks at least) and casters on the edge of the room.  AE slow works wonders, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3 hours?  wow :)<br />
<br />
more than one enchnater is preferrable i'd say just in case one eats it when 6ish mobs pop.  but all in all, the tactics are straightforward.   just mez and assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fun event, I also got a nice bow out of it. Wish PoJ trials were fun like this too.<br />
<br />
Kind of strange.. having FUN in EQ, it's almost a foreign concept anymore.<br />
<br />
I'd do this again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rhadgast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I did the event we had 1 61 enchanter, 1 60 enchanter, 1 61 tank and 62 ranger and druid (all other classes were level 60)  and we did pretty well.  Last wave was rough.  No deaths on the Construct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(chuckles)<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I did not expect it to last so long though.  I believe we were told it was 30-45minute trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A few questions as we are gonna attempt this soon...<br />
<br />
<br />
besides listed above 2x cler 60+ 2x chan 60+ 2x tank 60+ what are other classes REALLY needed?<br />
<br />
what should be min lvl for any class going to attempt this?<br />
<br />
any other advice or suggestions would be great thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would say 60 would probably be the minimum.  Throw in 3-4 damage dealer types(its not bare-bones required but it keeps the event from lasting 3 hours).   I'd also recommend a shaman to slow every mob that spawns asap and paladins *cough* for casting Stun and peeling aggro of clerics/enchanters.<br />
<br />
/assist is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Riudi Oaknoggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We did this with two groups last night, it was a fun fight.<br />
<br />
We had:<br />
<br />
2 chanters<br />
3 clerics<br />
2 Shammys<br />
2 rangers<br />
1 SK - the MA <br />
2 rogues  <br />
<br />
All were over 60 except 2 of the clerics.  We nearly got into quite a bind around the 5th round when about a third of the force took a dirt nap (including two of the clerics!) but WS and the enchanters saved the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Erryn_On_Prexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When we tried this event every time we got near the wave with 6ish mobs (about the 4th fight I think) we got attacked by a wandering group of 5 mobs.  <br />
<br />
The first time it was right before we got to the 4th fight, it caught us from behind and took out the chanters first.  The second try we got jumped by the mystery group with 1 mob left of fight 4.  On try three, we got jumped while medding after fight 4.  In both 2 and 3, the chanters ran out of mana too quickly.<br />
<br />
Anybody else run into this problem, or know how to avoid it?<br />
<br />
We did what it sounds like everybody else was doing.  Go from fight to fight, put tanks in the middle everybody /assist MA, chanters mez everything, and mez the npc if he tried to leave before we were done medding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We had random mobs show up while wandering too.  Wasn't a surprise, because we could see a raven flying in one of the spots, but wasn't that big of a deal.  Did lead to the one death (me) when I healed the Shaman RIGHT after an AoE slow.  Ouch..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did this last night and got through for the first time after 3 failures.  We had a 65 enchanter (very important), two 61+ bards (help with crowd control), a 65 warrior and 3 60+ clerics.  Backup tanks were a paladin and a shadowknight but we never used them.  Didn't have a death all night, plus we had 2 rangers and 4 rogues so plenty of DPS, mobs died FAST.  It was pretty fun and I got a new bow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you have trouble with CC then try AE tash and AE snare + kite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gileean Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I ran my guild through this lastnight and to make sure I have a near flawless victory for it I always require this for the run:<br />
<br />
3 clerics<br />
2 enchanters<br />
1 shammy<br />
1 necro (for mana pump and emergency Mez)<br />
1 Bard<br />
2 Warriors<br />
<br />
the rest is filler...yeah those eat a lot of spaces but you can be guaranted a win with having those basics then adding to liking<br />
<br />
Lastnight we had a slight mishap when one of the chanters got hosed on 5th wave spawn...it was Thanks to the Bard for the Pre-Mez and Necro for quick Mez that saved the CC there....ALSO a Pally is great for an LoH and Root helps on CC<br />
<br />
Your bigest battle is the Crowd Control...the Boss is a wimp compared to the last wave.<br />
<br />
And to avoid roamers...get a map printed out of the run..and send 1-2 guys ahead to scout for mobs along the path..pull and kill..it eliminates any roamers...we learned that from teh first time we tried a number of weeks ago</div></div><hr />
