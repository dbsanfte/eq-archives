<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took like an hour, and a cleric helped at end who just zoned in, to melee down. <br />
Buffs- Sow, cha(don't ask), focus, Scorching skin(I bought wrong potion=p), Kei, Virtue, and Tribunal.<br />

Innate defence 5, lr5 and channeling focus helped a lot. I had tried this before with just ca3 ages back.<br />
<br />
Stayed at 60m most of fight, tactic was keep self quessed and pet(who was not equipped with weapons since thought I may fail on pull and get adds and have to zone them off). Also when cann5 popped then I would cann 5 and kraggs mending. I basically dotted with Blood of Saryn only most of time(with staff of lost rituals equipped), and if mana was going over 60 then dotted with ancient scourge of nife also. Also used spirit call when it popped. Kept it slowed every 6% and kept it crippled. (cripple helps ALOT on this mob-reduces its flurries and made most of its hits of 400 more likely hit for 115 ish) Fight was about an hour and had bad loot, but was just a bit of fun. <br />
Loot=ancient medallion of faith, bracelet of quickness, globe of endless energy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Musta been bored lol :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats, I always thought this guy would be soloable, but the excess of hp is kinda a killer, and his loot table isn't worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone quantified how much chanelling AA helps?  The description seems to imply it will reduce your interrupts/fizzles by something like 5/10/15%?<br />
<br />
As a lesser-geared (unguilded, not even a piece of scaled avatar's armor) shaman with only lr1/cs2/chanelling1, I need outside heals from my druid to do Zelnithak because I take more dmg than Q heals on average, although this is without outside KEI/cleric buffs so I have to be conservative.<br />
<br />
His HP make it a not very worthwhile fight (it's fairly risky, say you forget to refresh slow/cripple ...)  His best item is a no-stats ft2 range item that I wouldn't equip =(<br />
<br />
I'll be impressed when someone solos rumblecrush (he is slowable, but still insane DPS, most likely he could be duoed with a strong tank?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cong~  I am pretty sure someone managed this before PoP, but it's been a long time and maybe they just got close.<br />
<br />
I don't think you could duo rumblecrush.  it'd be really hard to keep a warrior up against him even slowed, but he rampages a lot, and that'd beat you down pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool, better keep it hush hush though, dont want to see the nerf bat swinging.  Kidding aside, nicely done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Impressive feat, congratulations :)  Our smaller-sized guild required 2 groups of 50-62 to take him down, so that gives a relative toughness of him.  Long fight.</div></div><hr />

I tried him once pre POP, got him to like 40%, and was running LOM, was only keeping epic dot on him and at that rate woulda taken 2 more hours so I just zoned, but it was definately doable pre-pop, I only had mid-ssra \ NTOV gear and like 1 FT.  BTW, GRATZ, very nice, that fight is so damn boring.</div></div><hr />
