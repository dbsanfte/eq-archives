<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is a Stank, you might ask?  Why, it's a Shaman tank!  One guildy tried to correct me, and tell me it's Skank, but obviously, an SK tank would be the Sk-ank, yeah?<br />
<br />
Anyhoo.. I'm mentioning this for two reasons.  One, if you have enough HP after buffs (I'd think 5k should be enough for normal adventures) it is possible to replace your normal tank with the unstoppable Stank!  <br />
<br />
And second, how to do it!  At first, I tried using slow + cripple to hold agro, but I could see my mana bar draining like crazy.  So I thought, hell, slow is slow, so I booted up my lvl 14 Walking Sleep (60 mana), and chain cast it.  I never even dropped below FM the entire adventure, and no one could rip the mob off of me (2 rangers, 1 bard, 1 wizard, 1 druid).<br />
<br />
My whole group was like, damn, you're one of the best tanks I've ever seen!  hehehehe!<br />
<br />
We cleared 53 mobs in 30 minutes.  Our dps was incredible, and it wouldn't have been as great if we had had to give up some dps in order to have seperate slower/tank.<br />
<br />
Just food for thought!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like &quot;Shank&quot; better.  <br />
<br />
So you were casting Walking Sleep and Cripple to keep aggro?  hmm...  are the lower level cripple spells (Incapacitate??) also huge aggro generators?  I would think using one of those and a decent slow (Tagars is ~50% at lvl 60 I think) would be cheap spells to keep aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i found that Tainted breathe seems to work the best for me, its hardly no mana and is a boatload of aggro. <br />
<br />
Oh and i dont like Stank either, ill take shank or what my guild calls me &quot;the shaman tank&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish we had a hate proc weapon, it would make life so much easier, hmm or maybe a tainted breathe proc weapon /wonder ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, I had a fun adventure with no tanks yesterday (65sham-me, 2x65 necro, 65 druid, 65 mage, 65 bard - bard said he couldn't keep aggro)<br />
We finished reasonably quickly, with me and a necromancer taking the tanking. Slow + tainted breath chain cast grabs aggro pretty good, and easy mana regeneration/self heals. Worked reasonably (I've had faster killing groups), though what held us up was the lazy bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bards really don't have any tools to keep aggro unless they run nothing but DoTs.... so it doesn't really mean your bard was lazy.  My bard can't take aggro even with a borrowed Blade of Carnage, and I bust my ass in groups. =P<br />
<br />
I usually chain-cast Disempower to keep aggro.  Poison dots have the downside of making a mob unmezzable if you should need to switch for some reason. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">disempower &gt; all for cheap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, I abandoned cripple altogether.  I slowed with Turgurs, then chain cast Walking sleep for agro (60m).  I'll have to look and see how much mana disempower and tainted are, maybe those would be cheaper.  But still, I never went below FM with this combo, not once.<br />
<br />
Shank is actually better, but Stank is funnier :)</div></div><hr />

nah, the lazy bard was a slow puller</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ah, I see.  Wasn't entirely clear to me from your wording, I guess.  Carry on then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I kite frogs in PoS from time to time with a wizard friend.  Turgurs + bane + disempower a few times can keep the mob off even when the wizard is pretty much chain casting strike of solusek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SHHHHH!!  Monks talked like this and the next thing they couldnt tank anymore.... The last thing I want is to have my ability to survive a few rounds when Tugurs is resisted nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beware, this also smacks of the major warrior complaint that knights are using low level stuns to maintain aggro lock...same idea, nearly no manna cost agro increaser. BEWARE THE NERF BAT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Non-damage spells and poison counters have incredibly more aggro than they should.  This is the central cause of warrior dissatisfaction.<br />
<br />
Also I would not worry too much about our tanking ability getting nerfed just because we can handle the weak hitting mobs in a normal adventure.  Anybody can tank one of these slowed.  If you can do it on Hard then there might be cause for concern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I personally have gone down the road of Shamonk. When I put together my groups, it's me, tank + 4DPS. In your group, you have a druid for healing? Me, I'm puller, slower, HEALER, and CCer. I pull, slow everything, tank/mez/root, toss Q as needed. While the 5 DPS folks are killing the last mob, I go and get the next train...I mean mob.<br />
<br />
That is maximum DPS in my book.<br />
<br />
PS. Disempower has the best aggro:mana ratio that we have, IMO. I can pull aggro off of pallies and SKs who are trying to keep aggro if I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kristis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Me as healer,slower, Necro as slower/mezer, and 4x SU3 pallies in Guk = you can finish a Slaughter mission in 15-20 minutes. <br />
4x pallies proccing SU3 for 5k a pop = insane dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I almost soloed a normal mode adventure on slaughter, got 30+ out of the 48 required mobs.  I was lazy about it though.  Had 6 ppl go in, I entered, the rest sat back at the zone in and waited.  Thats my next challenge, to solo a LDoN adventure, by root/rotting with epic on multiple pulls.  Pull about 6 mobs, slow em all, pendant, hard root and chain epic with puppy biting.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I tank in various zones. Unless i have a necro in my group I've found that<br />
the normal progression of(depending on zone say HoH humans for example) Malos + Turgurs then dots is more than enough agro.<br />
And more dps.<br />
I usually cast both of those plus BoS then maybe some spears of torment(make those ornate gloves do something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't forget that we have a lot of the same spells that Pallys and SKs use to keep aggro. I find flash of light works the best, costs hardly any mana and is fast casting. Infectious cloud is good too as long as you don't have mobs mezzed around ya of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hmm or maybe a tainted breathe proc weapon<br />
<br />
<br />
If you weren't an inferior race you would realize there is a tainted breath procing weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have one question... why use walking sleep to get agro when drowsy is 20 mana and faster casting time..... Is it less agro?<br />
Thanx for the ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm... Cos Walking Sleep was the lowest slow I saw in my spell book. I'm thinking maybe I deleted drowsy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can guarantee walking sleep causes some crazy aggro.  I'm only level 26 so it is currently my best slow, and in the last 2 adventures I have been in I have managed to take aggro away from the rogue, ranger, and enchanter for entire fights just by casting one single walking sleep.  The only problem with this is that I don't want to be getting aggro at this level.  The group I am in is only 4 people since we are having trouble finding others to join us at this level.  We are all RL friends and this is our first batch of adventures.  <br />
<br />
Another problem we are having is traps.  None of us are familiar with the traps in hallways/rooms and how to disable them or avoid them.  We have a rogue, but he hasn't had to disarm any traps before (only level 24).  So we aren't sure exactly what he is supposed to target when he is trying to disarm, or if the rogue is even the one that needs to be disarming.  We also have not gotten enough adventure points to buy the sense/disarm spells for me and the enchanter, so we have no idea how we are supposed to take care of curses, etc.  Any tips anyone can give for the newbie to LDON will be helpful :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
just load up turgur's and drowsy. Same effect. Just turgur's first to get it slowed, and chain drowsy for agro. Drowsy gives same agro as turgur's, and it's way low on mana cost. as long as ya got someone that can help heal you, you're good.</div></div><hr />
