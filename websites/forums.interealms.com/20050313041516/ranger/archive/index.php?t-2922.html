<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dynalisia</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me, a lvl 51 pathfinder, just blasted a lvl 52 Ogur warrior to smithereens today :)<br />
<br />
Weeeee \o/ :PP<br />
<br />
Ok, the background story: We were grouped and he started moaning about rangers without any apparent reason.<br />
He told me he had a lvl 54 ranger himself (sure, who doesn't?)<br />
and he stopped playing it because he was too boring (rangers are a lot of things, but boring? never!)<br />
Anyway, things escalated and I layed some smack down at the entrance of KC with a nice audience cheering at us :))<br />
<br />
Transscript of the fight:<br />
<br />
(The ogre was wearing the standard twink gear of Barbed and CC stuff, I was wearing crap that doesn't need to be mentioned :]] )<br />
<br />
Snared, Dotted (Ogur kept moaning about his ac loss), rooted, archery, damn no more arrows *bonk*, re-dot, nuke (well careless lightning isn't really a nuke, but heck), Ogur free, nuked again, whoop out swarmy, procs after about 400 dmg done, ogur slowed, ogur at 50%hp, ogur moaning about him being slowed, whoop out lammy and jagged blade, ogur starts moaning about DS, get beaten a lot, take distance, root, re-snare, heal myself up a bit, med, med , med, ogur getting really annoyed, med, stand up, engage into melee again and....meleed the last 300hp of him pretty quick......accept the applause of the surrounding crowd :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gangata</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, them DS's are nasty :).  I duelled a lvl 55 war in my guild last night while waiting for a spawn (keep in mind i'm a lvl 51 ranger), was all in fun, but with my 24 pts of DS up he didn't stand a chance while dual wielding 2 lammys :).   Thing was, i didn't tell him about the DS's, and he didn't have em turned on, rofl.  Turns out we both died on the last hit, me from his Might Strike Disc crit, and him from my thorns :).  So the zonewide message was Kludias' Corpse has defeated Gangata's Corpse in a duel to the death :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pesco</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a toe-to-toe fight with a lvl 60 warrior, self buffed only minus regen (I forgot it lol), no offensive spells or disciplines, the battle came out even. ( We stopped at one bub ) Our gear was basically comparable, and Earthcaller didnt proc so that wasnt a big deal.<br />
<br />
For a 4 level difference, I think that proves Rangers are pretty powerful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good job, on both counts!<br />
<br />
Keep making us Rangers look good. :)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, just sounds strange to me...because you know....warriors can do SO MUCH that rangers can't....suuurreee they can.</div></div><hr />
