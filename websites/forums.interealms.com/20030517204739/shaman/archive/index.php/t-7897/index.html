<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done some searching here and it seems undecided, but last night on TM, I ran into Homy a barbarian shaman on my server who had the 8th Cudgel.  I didn't think it was possible for barbarians to do the quest? <br />
<br />
Anyone got the skinny on this?</div></div><hr />

With faction caps and multiple steps, the best I can figure for a barbarian with the 8th is that he did a MQ with someone turning in the 7th while he turned in VS's skull to Rile.  With a faction boosting item, like puppet strings, this seems possible.  It might be that you only need to be non-kos to MQ Rile as well.</div></div><hr />
