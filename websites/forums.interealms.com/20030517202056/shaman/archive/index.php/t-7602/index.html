<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do you think it is worth getting the collection of the ry'gorr armor, right now  i am currently lvl 20 and i figure it should last me quite a while if i do get it. I am wondering if it is a wise investment.<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ry`gorr isn't bad at 20th,  the breastplate is especially nice if you have a low str.  Shadowscream might be a better choice if it's selling low on your server, I can't unload it at half the price of Ry`gorr.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion though would be to get to the bazaar and look around.  Don't worry about getting a matching set.  I looked like hell for many levels and only look good now by accident.  If you can afford Ry`gorr you will find too many other options to list.<br />
<br />
You definately want to fill all your slots with something though, even if only banded.  On Zebuxoruk banded is only about 5pp a piece and is FAR better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ry'Gorr is pretty decent stuff and will serve you well. Also, it's relatively cheap, so you can get the bp and legs (and more) for a fair price. :)</div></div><hr />
