<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mortimorr Dendrobatez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After the patch I tried to sign on today and I got an error message that stated &quot;Unable to initialize the EQMAIN.DLL file&quot; so I deleted the .dll file and repatched recieving the new file.  This did not correct the problem and I went to tech support library and found that I might need to upgrade direct X.  I installed the newest version, rebooted and still have the same error.  If anyone knows how to fix this I would greatly appreicate it.<br />
