<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see these threads about this level 20 that has his epic. Is the tear from the Plane of Fear the only thing that needs to be multiquested? I have a 59 Necro and I have a few friends over 50. I was wondering if I could finish the epic early too. What all does this entail. I have read the epic. Just want to know how to do all the multiquest stuff and the price of the multiquests. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Price of the tear runs about 5k on Nameless, I know in my guild, every shaman has one banked.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's cheating. Exploiting bugs or design flaws in the game is not creatively working around a problem. It's cheating.<br />
<br />
That's like saying, when you're playing monopoly, and the banker goes to the fridge for a beer, stealing cash from the bank is creatively working around a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Multiquesting isn't a bug and is an acceptable way of completing quests.<br />
<br />
Just because some designer has one specific way of doing something in mind doesn't mean it is the only way to accomplish the goal.  Finding those other ways to accomplish the goal doesn't mean there is a design flaw.<br />
<br />
Working up your faction is still a chore and can't be gotten around if you want to MQ, and the other parts you still have to complete.<br />
<br />
So if it isn't a game bug, and it isn't necessarily a design flaw, how is getting your epic at 20 cheating?  It isn't cheating even if it is an unintended consequence.<br />
<br />
Kind of like distributing all the properties in Monopoly randomly before the game starts and finding out that one person has 3 highend monopolies.  Unintended consequence but a far cry from cheating.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between disception and stealing, and finding other ways to work around problems to get what you want when you want it.</div></div><hr />

Trying to claim it isnt cheating is absurd tho.  It is blatently obvious that this was never the way the quest was intended to be done otherwise why would they have bothered writing it all.  It is like trying to claim that nuking mobs from untouchable places is just using your head.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if it isn't a game bug, and it isn't necessarily a design flaw<br />
<br />
<br />
It IS a design flaw.  You know it, I know it, everyone else knows it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I grant that getting the epic before 46 requires means not intended by the designers, but I fail to see how you can call it &quot;cheating&quot; by any definition.<br />
<br />
It isn't as intended but that hardly makes it cheating.  I would be able to grant you that it is a design flaw only if you could explain why any quest must only be done the way the designer planned for?  If as a DM in D&amp;D didn't allow for thinking and ideas counter to my own plans things would go bad quickly.<br />
<br />
Cheat:<br />
&quot;To deceive by trickery&quot;; &quot;To act dishonestly&quot;; &quot;Fraudulent acquisition of another's property&quot;; &quot;To violate rules deliberately&quot;<br />
<br />
The only one that comes close is the last one about violating rules.  But the rules don't oppose early acquisition of the epic.  So to call it actually cheating I think is wrong.  It is an unintended side effect of other in game abilities notably multiquesting.  It is unintended but hardly against the rules and hence not cheating.</div></div><hr />

So there is no reasoning with you then ehh? :)<br />
<br />
I am not justifing it.  I claim it isn't cheating.<br />
<br />
I won't say no matter how logical and obvious you make it for me I won't switch sides, but I ask that you enlighten me why this is in fact cheating.  I don't want to know that it is not a normal or unintended way of getting the epic, but why it is cheating.  Because, doing something that isn't normal or unintended, is not in and of itself a definition of cheating. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not bad.  I would almost relent if it wasn't for one word that is consistent thoughout.<br />
<br />
Deceit (or a derivation of such)<br />
<br />
When it comes to multiquesting there is no deceit.  No one or thing is being deceptive or deceitful in their attempt to acquire the epic or the parts.<br />
<br />
As in cheating with cocoa instead of chocolate, it is meant to deceive, though with the multiquest your intentions are direct and up front with no hints of dishonesty or deceit.<br />
<br />
Adding to the logic then.  Since the acquisition of the epic pre 46 is not done deceitfully, I once again assert that there is not form of cheating done to acquire it.<br />
<br />
Once again I pass the ball back to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Rak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm, if you don't go to Fear and put the child to rest, are you deceiving the Sentinel Spirit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I as a person am not cheating.<br />
<br />
As a in game character, a worshiper of Cazic-Thule have no morals against deception.<br />
<br />
Very nice try Gloriana :) but two separate instances, one not concerned with cheating because in character it isn't an issue, only as a person can you be told you are cheating the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, in truth the child was found, and the proof was received.  He doesn't specify who, just imply that you will (or will have it done).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I still have Neh's ring in my bank, tho I have my epic.  After going through all that, while talking to some shamans about the final trip to CoM -- they let me in on the fact that it's very polite to give Neh to the mages that you need to have there to kill Rak.  Since giving her the ring makes it impossible for her to drop their torch, I simply factioned up on woe and envy 6 or 7 times to get max ally, and kept my ring to myself.<br />
<br />
I don't think anybody in their right mind is gonna call that cheating - but essentially, it's &quot;working creatively to get around a problem&quot;... cept the problem here is that VI decided mages and shamans should be made to fight over Neh.  feh, I say.<br />
<br />
Other than the dot - which is handy pretty much only when soloing or duoing - our epic is nice stat/resist gear.  Compared to the power of most of the other epics, it's very gimpy - which is why it was made so easy.  I don't know if any other epic is as easily turned into something you can faction up for and then buy, but maybe there's a reason ours is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hmm...not sure if I really have that much interest in moving forward on this lol....<br />
<br />
I guess it all depends on your perspective...are you truely part of the EQ 'world' albiet a virtual one? Are you an evil character who cheats to accomplish his task....or are you a crafty player at home figuring out creative ways to cheat the system.<br />
<br />
I see it as this...VI worte a story line in a rpg..they didnt intend for you to complette this quest in the way some chose to..i.e. cheating ...they are kind of the 'gods' of this world so to say....so are you deceiving these gods...Id say so...you wouldnt, but I guess it all has to do with what perspective you are approaching the situation....but when you boil down past all the friggin B.S. ;) I think its pretty clear that 'working around' this quest, no matter how clever...is cheating <br />
<br />
thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I will agree to disagree.  Though it was fun and enlightening.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmmmm, anyone have any proof that Neh can't drop both the diary and the torch at the same time?<br />
<br />
She can definitely drop both the diary and that caster shield at the same time.<br />
<br />
The torch used to be a very very very rare drop (it is now more common).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">ROFL.<br />
<br />
If you really were a follower of Cazic Thule, I sincerely doubt that even being &quot;evil' you would give of yourself to enable someone to have something.<br />
<br />
If you really were 'evil' and roleplayed it out, you'd be more likely to agree to MQ it then when they hand in their segment you do a /rude and gate.<br />
<br />
Falling back on the roleplay thing is so lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Coming with a roleplayer reasoning is weak rhetoric at best. Your character doesnt know that he would be able to do the same thing over and over again (No spirit says &quot;Bring me Woe and Envy 20 times) just as your character doesnt have a magic realisation that his faction is maxxed. <br />
<br />
So, you are jumping out of the character to do the cheat, and into the character to justify it as being in-character evil. Its a deception the character doesnt know about and wouldnt be able to know about. So its your deception, not the deception of your character.<br />
<br />
You can agree to disagree all you like. But that are the facts. Inconsistency between character knowledge and player knowledge and justification for one with the other are a big roleplaying NO-NO.<br />
<br />
Dont care if you lie to yourself Feias, but as a roleplayer I care for your consistency faults :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: According to your logic, going into a strangers house and stealing everything is no crime because you were only circumventing his home security, and if he wouldnt like to be stolen from he would prevent that circumvention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So who was the person that tried to justify it with use of in-character reasoning?  I sure didn't.  I merely pointed out that you can't use an anti in-character positioning when I am arguing that it isn't cheating by the definitions of such.<br />
<br />
Gloriana pointed out that you might be deceiving Rak if you try to MQ the tear.  I said that didn't work anyway from my in-game perspective, but it doesn't matter because my argument was solely focused on non-incharacter reasoning.<br />
<br />
According to your logic, going into a strangers house and stealing everything is no crime because you were only circumventing his home <br />
security, and if he wouldnt like to be stolen from he would prevent that circumvention.<br />
<br />
tsk tsk.  I don't think so, you have overlooked a good portion of my reasoning.  You can't throw out parts you don't like.  Breaking into someone's house and taking something that isn't yours, goes against one of the very definitions of cheating I used.  It is deception (which I try to show using MQ isn't) and it breaks rules (societal or otherwise).<br />
<br />
It is more along the lines of my neighbor saying I can have a vase located in his house and him giving me the key to the front door.  Now the lock doesn't match the key, but it will in a week.  I choose not to wait and decide to enter through an open window and claim my vase.  I leave without disturbing or damaging anything.  I have received what was freely given to me though I didn't get it though the expected means.<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me reiterate.<br />
<br />
1. Multiquesting is an accepted method that does not break any EQ rules.<br />
2. There is no deception in completing a multiquest.<br />
3. Cheating is defined by some act of deception or breaking of rules.<br />
<br />
Therefore: Using MQ to gain the epic is not cheating.<br />
<br />
You can't get more logical than that.<br />
<br />
For all of those out there that don't follow precepts of logical reasoning the point is that given 1,2, and 3 are true the conclusion in this case follows.  This argument is valid.  I also believe that 1,2, and 3 ARE true not just given as such and therefore the argument is sound.  If there is any argument it has to show me why one of my premises is false.<br />
<br />
Extra information if it doesn't hurt one of the above 3 premises is useless information because it is outside of my argument and isn't permissable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I guess that's logical to you, it's still cheating to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Edit: I had a nice post all written up but I was wrong...so I had to rewrite it.<br />
<br />
<br />
QuestMoB says:  You give me a, b, and c and I will give you z.<br />
<br />
not<br />
<br />
QuestMoB says:  When I receive a, b and c, from anyone in any order, I'll give the last person z.<br />
<br />
If we are looking at if from a strictly logical point of view...QuestMoB is cheating with you (the game is cheating itself! ;) ).<br />
<br />
2. There is no deception in completing a multiquest.<br />
I believe that premise 2 is incorrect.  The deception is based on the difference between the two previous statements.  <br />
The player and the NPC are failing to fufill the verbal contract that was agreed on.  Too bad we can't argue with the NPCs and make counter offers.  &quot;How about I bring a couple items and a few friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
So I think your argument is valid but not sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
regarding your friend's vase: your analogy doesn't state *why* you were given a key that won't work for a week.  Couple of possibilities:<br />
a) Your friend is testing you by seeing if you can be patient and wait a week. <br />
b) Your friend is testing you by seeing if you can figure out a way around the locked front door.<br />
<br />
I think 'A' is more likely - and if I was your friend I'd feel cheated as well when I throw a 'going away party' for my vase in 6 days and it's missing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Final points:  <br />
MQing is a very active part of the server economy, and with out it many people would never get Velious Armor or JBoots.  I don't even think it needs to be 'fixed' or removed or changed.  I know that in early 2001 there was a big debate about MQing, and at the time Absor stated:<br />
&quot; Obviously my personal opinion (again, personal, meaning just me) is that multi-questing is one of those things that, in general, cheapens the game. It allows people to basically split quests up so that the guy getting the reward isn't even doing most of the questing. But that's just my personal opinion. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Since MQing is still in the game I guess it's ok...a form of approved cheating.  They still don't officially support it.  If you lose an item by MQing (to an NPC or another player) you are out of luck, etc. <br />
<br />
My personal opinion:<br />
<br />
1) You only MQ items that are No Drop.  <br />
2) The game developers made them No Drop to prevent you from giving them to someone else.<br />
3) If a quest developer didn't want *you* to do all the parts of the quest, he wouldn't have incorporated the No Drop items.<br />
<br />
So MQing goes against the spirit of the game.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I admit Gloriana there is a difference between rules and morals.<br />
<br />
What is true to the letter can be wholly different from what should be done given understood intent.<br />
<br />
I admit it wasn't intended to be done with a MQ.<br />
<br />
But following logical reasoning which I did above the validity of my argument can't be argued with.<br />
<br />
I will give all those opposed to this the benefit of the doubt.  Doing so I see the problem is with semantics and moral/intent issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes Feias, its something different if you ignore the intent.<br />
<br />
When somebody ignores the intent and knows that he ignores the intent, then point 2 of your 3 point logic doesnt apply for me. Its willingly doing something that wasnt intended, to dupe somebody (the quest npc) to think you did something somebody else did.<br />
<br />
Trick somebody to think something different than the truth - isnt that a deception?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">jesus, this has been beat into the ground.  <br />
<br />
this is NOT how the quest was intended.  its akin to killing gnoll pups until level 60 (if greens gave xp).  thats NOT what the game was designed as.  the quest is NOT designed to have parts skipped.  <br />
<br />
so dont try to say you're creative, cause well, its not creative.  it's taking advantage of an inability to code instances in the game that can only be done once per person (and if you say cloak of truth ill fwap you, you LOSE faction in that quest so you can only do it ONCE).  just because they cannot or will not code this is NOT a license to do it wrong.  thanks!</div></div><hr />

That's like saying, when you're playing monopoly, and the banker goes to the fridge for a beer, stealing cash from the bank is creatively working around a problem. <br />
<br />
Nah, creatively working around a problem would be making sure that all the beer is in the basement fridge so the banker is gone longer and you can grab the money without being caught.<br />
<br />
The differences are<br />
<br />
A) Monopoly is a zero-sum game and Everquest is not.  Zero-sum games have a winner and a loser.  EQ only has a 'dilution effect' which is much smaller and more subtle than a win-vs-lose deal.  <br />
<br />
B) EQ's 'banker' is always present - it's the game system.  If the banker in Monopoly stated that the rules were being modified so that you got $500 every time you passed GO, it would not be cheating to accept the $500.<br />
<br />
I did my epic the long way, despite knowing about this method, because I wanted the full intended experience.  However, I'm in a reasonably strong guild and could get a Kirn raid up with no trouble.  In difference circumstances, I might well have been tempted to skip that step.<br />
<br />
IMO Verant should plug this loophole, but until they do, I can't condemn those who choose to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">There are two different arguments.  One based on Game Mechanics, and another on Roleplaying.<br />
<br />
I have already stated I am not arguing about the roleplaying aspect.  I am not touching it.  And these arguments are not intertwined.  As such arguing against me with roleplaying problems doesn't phase me because you are talking past me.<br />
<br />
Deception of the in game NPC is part of a roleplaying argument.  I won't talk about wether or not I am deceiving him.  I don't care.  I am talking strictly from a game mechanics point of view.  From the game mechanics point of view there is no deception.<br />

Once again, I am not arguing that this is an intended consequence.  It is not the intended way to do the epic.  Intent isn't the issue though, cheating is, and cheating has nothing to do with intent unless it includes deception.  I still say there is no deception inherent in multiquesting an item as it is an accpeted method of item acquisition. But in the same sense if greens did give exp even if very minimal, soloing to 60 on greens isn't wrong.  In this case there is a reason that they stopped allowing creatures to give experience at a certain point.  If they hadn't done it then leveling to 60 on greens would be fine.<br />
<br />
Another example of an unintended (originally) side effect of game mechanics is with the Cabilis quests.  Being able to (though this is still problematic for shaman it isn't for other classes) raise you faction with cabilis and many of the necessary other factions within the city in order to do the starting Iksar class quests.  SK's can do this, Warriors can do this, Monks can do this, Shaman can do some of this, Necros can do this.  It wasn't intended for non-Iksars to do these quests, but people worked hard to circumvent the obvious limitations.  I would put leveling to 60 off of greens on the same level as managing to get your faction with the Iksar up to amiable.  Intent or not, without violating any rules laid out by Verant, it becomes a method of acquiring what you desire by a different (non-intended) means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">feias:  I agree with you on the fact that we are discussing two different situations:  Cheating in Roleplaying and Cheating in Game Mechanics.  But that wasn't apparent until halfway down the thread.<br />
<br />
re: Game Mechanics<br />
I agree with your statement that there is no deception. And so I also agree that MQing is not cheating. <br />
<br />
re: Role Playing<br />
You've stated you aren't interested in discussing this argument.  That's fine.  However, in an MMORPG many people will give more weight to Role Playing over Game Mechanics.  And from a Role Playing perspective, MQing is cheating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Until Gloriana made the 18th post in this thread, no one distinguished between the two.  Glori was the first person to swing the discussion in one direction (towards Role Playing by mentioning the quest NPC's text.)<br />
<br />
So we're both right. <br />
<br />
Mojokyn: It's a dead horse, but interesting discussion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">*jumps on top of the rotting horse carcass*<br />
I hate them anyway, destroyed the market for sow potions.<br />
Really, tho, I love a good debate.  I'm going to avoid the RP part of the discussion, myself.  <br />
<br />
How far do you go with the principle, though?  Taking for example, the Kirn kill in the Hole.  Many ways to get through this part of our epic.<br />
<br />
1) faction up (skip it)<br />
2) take 18 or so 55+ folks and fight your way to him, as VI intended (looking forward to doing this next week, actually)<br />
3) get a ball of golem clay, find a mage virgin to the Hole, and CoH a group in to wax Kirn with the greatest of ease (what I did, had zero chance at the time of using method #2) - course, I don't think golem clay drops anymore....<br />
4) have a brell cleric DA, toss him into the hole, toss in a mage, cleric drags mage away from Yael, CoH folks in, etc.<br />
... probly a few more methods <br />
<br />
In any case, only method #2 is &quot;legitimate&quot;.  The rest of them are workarounds to avoid hacking your way through 2/3 of the mobs in the zone.  Of course, that's the entire idea behind CoH, and it could be argued that any zone you can CoH in is a zone where VI decided the content wasn't that vital.  <br />
<br />
Isn't the difference between getting around having to kill dozens of mobs and getting around having to enter the zone at all... really just a matter of degree?  I don't think it's cheating simply because someone took the easier route.  <br />
<br />
Roleplaying justification?   take your pick...<br />
Glaron keeps rising from the dead, and it pleasees TrueSpirit SO MUCH that I keep sending him back to his grave that the tasks formerly set before me have been delegated to shamans with less determination....<br />
<br />
Tho EQ is for some of us, a chat room &amp; mud with purty pictures.  Roleplaying is folks sitting around a table, not glued to a screen.  :)<br />
<br />
Mind you, I did my epic the long way because I wanted to be able to say &quot;Kirn?  he's a punk.&quot;  I didnt' want to cheat myself outta that notch in my belt.  But cheating at EQ?   Nooooo no no.  If for some reason I got another shaman up, I'd gimp my way to the second epic in a heartbeat.  <br />
<br />
I think lots of people who would look down on MQ'ing shaman epic don't see anything wrong with handing in 200 bone chips in cabilis, or 200 bandaids in rivervale - tho it's essentially the same thing (game mechanics wise, obviously not RP-wise).</div></div><hr />

<br />
  just as a point of interest, laughingwoman's post is a little misleading.  Only really takes one group to battle all the way through Hole - had a group of 60s, and we did it in about 2 hours.  Since a lot of people play shaman's as secondary characters I felt it necessary to point out that it doesn't really take 18 people to get to kirn.<br />
<br />
  Also, as for Kirn himself - did him 3-boxing, he is a wuss.  If you battle all the way up there, you don't really need to keep 12 people there or whatever waiting 4 hours for him to respawn because some tard left his pet up.<br />
<br />
  Doesn't directly apply to the rest of this post, heck if you want to be a lvl 20shm with epic I sure aint gonna lose any sleep over it - but I had fun with it doing most parts, and looking forward to exploring CoM for the last two steps.  If you just want some good wis/resist gear MQing it to yourself is a quick way to get it =)  <br />
<br />
  Just get tired of seeing posts saying &quot;it takes 24 people to do this&quot; or whatever - not just here, all over the place.  Use a little strategy, some decent pulling, and stop dragging entire guilds to the Hole for an encounter you and a couple friends could do one afternoon =)<br />
<br />
  take care, thanks for all the info, pretty helpful msg board =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Im still standing by my point...you can spin it anyway you want...coat it with as much B.S. as needed to argue your case...and you know as well as I, that faction skipping is a cheat.<br />
<br />
If thats how VI wanted you to do it(RP 'gods' or not..they set the rules and you follow them..period...well in less you find some clever work around to cheat/bend those rules)...hell if VI wanted you to MQ they'd have gotten rid of the no-drop tag on quest items along time ago<br />
<br />
....fact of the matter is, just cause mommy hasnt the time to slap your hands about every time she catches them in the cookie jar...dose not mean that you are not going against her will...you know...I know it...everyone who comes here to justify their means knows it.....<br />
<br />
Ive said this many times before...theres really no need to justify your actions on these boards...hell, Id get a kick out of one time reading a post that stated...&quot;I got around VIs lack of resource by cheating...Im the man!!&quot; Now that kind of honesty I can respect....spin doctoring something that is blatantly not true is well...pointless.<br />
<br />
wow, I sounded serious there...I just can not understand how it dosent sink in...sink past the b.s. that everyone comes up with...you are gaining through shadey means...you cant see it as 'deceptive' and thats the -only- argument Ive seen...that one single word(and the apparent interpretation of its meaning in this case) that MQing must magicaly fall under....VI wont ban you you say?...oh, must not be against the rules then and therefore not deceptive...come on give me a break.....please all of you 'support the cheating' theorist please...for one time...just call it for what it is!! lol<br />
<br />
ok, got that out of my system...back to work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your telling me.<br />
<br />
I put forth a valid argument stripped of everything but the necessary points.  BS has been removed.  It is a simple as it gets.  There is no spinning involved but solid logic.<br />
<br />
You point out no flaws in my argument other than just plain refuting it and expect me to throw my hands up in defeat?<br />
<br />
I have to take the position now that you are spinning the issue trying to buy votes for the false belief it is cheating :) (tease)<br />
<br />
But note, I am not using B.S., I am not spining my point, but making straight foward arguments that are fully valid.  Strike at the premises if you so choose, but argue the facts as being valid in and of themselves and not just swipe it off the table please.<br />
<br />
To Snapdragon:  Correct.  It was obvious to me, but I should have been more obvious.  The problem I see with roleplay is that you can often justify and argue for anything at anytime in anyway.  From a game mechanics point of view I think it is very cut and dry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">So your telling me that since VI dose not punish anyone for MQ-ing..then its -not- a cheat? I searched for the rule guide lines and sadly could not find any info directly supporting my point. I stated this already...just because they havent the time to correct the ability to MQ(or in the case of our epic 'faction farming') and or punish anyone from doing so...is it still ok? They fixed the Fungi Staff stacking bug(this topic was brought back up in general)...was it not a sploit for the year it was possible? cause hell...they let us do it...must not be a cheat<br />
<br />
answer me this...<br />
Did VI put the no-drop tag on items to insure that the person that actually has the item in their possesion did the quest?<br />
<br />
And if your answer is no...then why make quest items no-drop at all? In fact, why write a story line and a progression of steps at all if they did not set it as a 'rule' of course?<br />
<br />
It may not be directly punishable to MQ...or faction skip the Hole...but are you decieving the steps that were set forth to you by VI?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grezaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Just curious, granted I did not read every post, after a few the messages all seemed to be the same. Anyway I am wondering about all who consider it cheating to look at themselves. I'm wondering if any of the posters here have higher level characters or friends and have been on the receiving end of: being handed an item for little or no cost that in no way shape or form could obtain for themselves, having a rather nice sized amount of platinum handed to them for doing little or nothing, been powerleveled ??? Wouldn't any of the above be considered &quot;cheating&quot;. If any of you who claim the epic early is cheating and answer &quot;NO&quot; to this question... then maybe your arguments are stemmed more from envy than playing by the rules.<br />
I for one do not care for full blown twinks but it is all part of the game. Much like in real life when you finally get your driver's license... you slave at cutting grass, cleaning gutters, walking dogs..whatever you can do to scrape together enough to buy that 1976 Dodge Aspen with 110,000 miles on it when at the other end of town Biff gets keys handed to him for a brand new Mustang GT that mysteriously appeared in the driveway while he was slepping.<br />
I for one do not think it is cheating, actually quite the opposite..it's all part of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The difference from my roleplayers perspective is that twinking with platinum and dropable items can easily have in-game explanations and reasons (99% of the times they dont have, but they dont break game fiction in a blantant way). While carrying Jaundiced Armor suggests that you either killed the mobs yourself, got it as a gift or bought it, carrying the Spear of Fate suggest you did the quest in the right way (as the game fiction indicates).<br />
<br />
The one is supported in-game and from the mechanics, the other is a circumvention of the mechanics (and therefore a cheat). Thats the difference for me.<br />
<br />
And why envy when you enjoyed the Epic quest and the overwhelming joy when you finally had it? My epic was the first entirely made by our guildmembers back then, it was a symbol for what we could accomplish together and what would follow in the future. And it was a personal acomplishment for me, doing my epic form the endthirties (first step) till I finished it at my beginning 50s. If I would associate a feeling with those taking the shortcut it would be more like pity for them. But this isnt about feelings, its about cheating or not cheating! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ok....one way to look at it is this:<br />
<br />
Stacking items we know shouldnt stack is 'cheating'.  We know this for a fact, how can I state this? because I guarantee that people who do this check each message hoping it hasnt been fixed.  I know I have for the horse bug.<br />
<br />
This is the same for the epic.  People using the faction bug are gonna be checking patch messages hoping that VI doesnt fix.  If you did the 'max faction' route, got the tear MQ'd and the quest failed, would you petition, tell the guide exactly what happened and how you got where you were (multi turning in the woe &amp; envy etc) and seriously expect them to help?  I sure as heck wouldnt.  If there was a patch message saying it was fixed would you /feedback and /bugreport and honestly expect them to change it back?  I think not.<br />
<br />
I use the horse stacking bug.  It is cheating.  I know this and admit it.  I took advantage of the Explorer Knife thing where they put the same knives on a trader in Rathe that were used to get Cabilis Faction up.  That was cheating and when the GM's starting insta-killing the hand in NPC I was not surprised and could not viably complain. I used HoS stacking with Str and Dex.  I knew that was a bug.  It was cheating and I admit it, if it wasnt I would have /petitioned and bug reported when they fixed it but I (as did everyone else) knew that it would be fixed.  As stated before, I have no problem with people 'cheating' their way through the epic (I didn't personally as I really enjoyed doing the quest).  What I have a problem with is people trying to claim it isnt cheating and is a valid route through the quest.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we shouldn't worry about it. Does it affect you or your characters?? We should feel sorry for them. They won't know the sense of accomplishment, they won't build that bond with friends or other guild members. They will probably have a hard time grouping in some places... Having the spear means you have true spirit faction which can lead to instant agro by some mobs ( some of which he/she won't be able to handle alone ). <br />
<br />
*sigh* Granted the early epic owner benifts from the stats.. so now when fighting mobs his level should be fighting, he survives long enough to see his party drop dead and he either is always forced to run away or become the last stop for the train heading his  way..... what fun is that.<br />

I recently started my epic quest and I still went to RM to kill the brothers ( 1- I wanted to see if I could, 2- Faction ) I wouldn't have been to happy to get to the end to find out my faction is a couple points too low to complete it.<br />
<br />
I do not know enough about all epics for all classes... but if a level 20 cleric can use a rez stick then I can see where this can be a problem. I for one wouldn't be a bit surprised if epics are nerfed to make sure someone under level 49? or so could even equip them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">For me, the only problem I ran across getting the spear early was the Tear.  I have done everything up to the tear point, received the faction, enjoyed the experience.  Since there is no faction hit with the tear turn in after that is done you can continue as if you had turned it in.  There was no problem because I did my epic, though I never got the tear personally (well personally on this character of mine.  Nice to multiquest with yourself).<br />
<br />
Really the origianal point was how to get it early.  You can do everything yourself except the tear do to the 46 restriction on the planes.  With the tear you can then complete the rest yourself.  And yes stats are very nice on a sub 30 character.<br />
<br />
I decided I wanted to do my epic myself, but I wanted it pre 30.  And aside from the tear I did the entire epic.  I used groups when necessary, did what I could solo, and got in on raids heading down to the Hole.  It was very enjoyable and made it even more exciting doing it at 27.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Multiquesting is both cheating the game mechanics (the program) and the roleplaying perspective<br />
<br />
Faction is based on performing a service to a MoB, in this specific case, it is intended that you do a certain set of actions in a particular order to get the right faction to do the quest.  This is evident in merely how the MoBs respond at different levels of faction.  The belief of a program (which you are deceiving) is that you have done all of these certain actions in order to bring about a better understanding to the Heyokah about the transgressions of these people you have killed, and because of that he will award you with the Spear of Fate.  Thus, because you found a way to trick the program into thinking that you have done all said parts (and the program is incapable of seeing otherwise) it will reward you thusly.  You can't be given the text to do the quests unless you do all the parts, so merely handing this creature the item with the right faction level, is Deceiving the prgram into believing that you have completed all sections of the epic.  MULTIquesting the tear may not be &quot;cheating&quot; from a role playing stand point as you ARE indeed bringing proof of the child demise (which is what is being asked of you) But artificially raising faction to skip parts of the quest is indeed cheating (as you have so delicatly put it, the necessity is the deciet)  Because the program believes you to have completed these sections.  Multi-questing, while not a role playing cheat IS a game play cheat.  Its using a bug in the game (therefore an exploit) that a MoB cannot distinguish between items handed to him from different characters.  now, doing that unintentionally (aka someone gave the truespirit guy woe but not envy, and you handed him envy and Marrs promise, and not woe, but he gives you the faction for the shield anyway) isn't cheating, you didn't intend to deceive the program, but purposefully having someone else turn in an item, so that you can turn in a piece and trigger the reward, is cheating how the game works by decieving the program (also cheating)  Because the computer has not method to reason, if you are aware of the way the system works (which you are) then you are intending to decieve the system.<br />
From a role-playing standpoint, though, if you just kill some guy over and over again, they wouldn't give you thier most prixed posession, if you complete the Woe envy portion, or the books portion, over and over again, they wouldn't give you the spear,  the spear is only giving as a reward to those who have solved the larger problem of the Heyokah, the ultimate reward for finding the ultimate truth.  Having not found that ultimate truth by skipping any part of that quest, (in this case, specifically, the books in CoM entrance, the books of Ghiosk and anything thereafter - the first parts is proving yourself to them, which faction repeating is fine for &lt;though unecessary&gt;).  Thus you are decieving the program as well as the roleplaying into believing you have done all of that.  If you were a lower level, and did the Woe Envy Marr quest over and over again to help out the truespirit guys, then went to EJ, and the EJ spirit said get the tear, and kill Rak... and had no prior knowledge of how the quest worked.... then you wouldn't be decieving any part of the quest, see as how you didn't know better... BUT you do know better therefore you are intending to decieve.<br />
<br />
NOW as for role-playing deciet.  those of you who choose Cazic as a God (I am an Iksar in a Cazic worshiping only RP only guild, on a PvP server (which is more RP than most Carebear servers-) you CANNOT use the excuse that you decieve because you are &quot;evil&quot;  NO ONE thinks they are evil.  In reality, and in role-playing you don't consider yourself evil, you consider yourself in the right for your actions, others consider you evil based on wether or not your actions conflit with their moral and/or ethical views.  BEYOND that, Cazic himself can not abide lying.  That's why no cazic worshiper can be a thief.  Cazic is the God of Fear. (/rp on)<br />
Cazic, teaches us that we can use fear as a tool to exploit the weakness of our enemies.  An enemy who is in fear becomes weaker in spirit, becomes weaker in battle, and becomes weaker in faith.  This will make is will leave him, his body leave him, and his god leave him.  Those who are too small to overcome their fear will fall to the might of Lord Cazic.  Who needs to lie, who needs to steal? Not a cazicite.  The weakminded fools who worship the lesser gods will merely give us what we want because they will tremble at our might.  Our mere pressence will cause them to bend to our will.<br />
(/rp off)<br />
Nothing about Cazic Thule promotes cheating to get a spear when you have not earned it.  If you are &quot;roleplaying&quot; that you are &quot;evil&quot; to get a spear, then as a worshiper of Cazic you would merely make the wolf too afraid to refuse you the request for the item, not trick him into giving it to you.<br />
<br />
I'm all about clever workarounds... but I'm not all about exploiting a game system that cheats the role-playing experiece, as well as preys upon game programers who aren't perfect.  They excuse that one should do it because no one is stopping them, shows just how weak willed a person you are.  But I guess, mostly, in the end you're really just cheating yourself...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Bumbi, I play on Tunare.  But will try to hook up with you on serverwide chat sometime.<br />
<br />
To address Porgy, I have one decent problem with your account.  Using a MQ could be considered an exploit though it is condoned by Verant.  As such it isn't an exploit.<br />
<br />
Also it is not possible to &quot;deceive&quot; an inanimate being.  You admit that the program is incapable of reasoning.  As such without the capability of reasoning it can not be deceived, only its weaknesses exploited.<br />
<br />
But going back to the Verant and its condoning MQing, it isn't an exploit.<br />
<br />
The only defense I see needed for this is, why an inanimate can not be deceived.<br />
<br />
For deception to take place something or someone has to be tricked.  Trickery implies (and requires) the ability to reason or think.  I won't debate AI, but I think it can be said that the EQ program isn't capable of reasoning or thinking independently.<br />
<br />
Trickery and deception tie into the ability to comprehend and be able to lie.  A computer's ability to determine the truth of a statement is not the same as comprehending a lie.  The computer is totally logical and can't be fooled by false reasoning or lying.  It will strictly take what is necessary to determine an outcome and then say whether or not the outcome will happen.  No one is deceiving the program by doing things out of order, or steps multiple times, in fact they are really playing the strict game the program is set to check.  The only deception would be of a fake &quot;roleplaying&quot; NPC the computer is animating for our convenience and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
You might say I am tricking or deceiving it into &quot;thinking&quot; I have done all the quest.  No.  I have not made it think anything, the person who uses the work around has only completed the faction prerequisite that the computer uses to determine whether or not you qualify for the reward.<br />
<br />
Simply put the quest is a quest of faction.  All the talk and info is just a shroud over the basic quest of faction.  It could be more easily said that the computer is doing what it can to deceive me (a thinking individual) into believing that I have to follow a set course of action dictated by it in order for myself or anyone to receive the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
The thought of the computer deceiving me is ludicrous though.  Why?  Because it is wrong to think a computer would try to deceive me.  To both deceive and be deceived requires the ability to reason and think (once again the ability to comprehend and choose to lie).  It can't deceive me anymore than I can deceive it because it lacks the function of reason and thought.<br />
<br />
So without it being possible to deceive the computer, once again, I state that there is no cheating because no deception is caused.  In this specific case the program is used literally.  Some  (as I did) may actually play by the computers made up story all the way though till the tear (which since pre 46) requires the MQ.<br />
<br />
Still, really, don't want to touch the RP aspect, but then again as I did the quest all the way though till the tear, I could say I was going to kill the child when a friend came down from Hate with the tear in hand saying the child was slain.  Not my fault I was a bit slow.  The child was still slain and I will be close at hand when the tear is turned in to prove the deed has been done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">You certainly can trick something that doesn't reason.  Hacking is merely tricking a security protocol into think you have access, ie decieving it into believing that you are an authorized user at a certain access level.  Computer programs work on conditions and responses, in this case you are making the computer believe that your input is sufficient for the computers appropriated output.  That's deception, causing something to believe falsely to benefit you (I think that's one of the 30 definitions someone put up there)<br />
<br />
The best way to determine if you are exploiting the system (and when I use this word, its not the same definition you were trying to nail me on, I'm not saying its illegal, just that you are using a flaw in the system to your advantage.  Technically, FD pulling is an exploit, although it is condoned by verant.) Is if a human were playing the roll of the NPC, would he/she/it award you with the item.  And the honest truth is, no.  I think we can all agree that part, at least, is irrefutable.  If a Verant employee were acting as the wolf in EJ, they wouldn't give you the spear if you merely faction quested, had a rogue had in the tear, and you looted the scale.  Because the computer program is incapable of making that distinction, you are doing actions that you know are against the intent of the designers, and therefore you are &quot;cheating&quot; the program because it can't distinguish between the two.<br />
<br />
Of course were just talking technicalities and stuff here, I enjoy the fight ;-) and no personal attack is meant.  I said before, that on a RP standpoint at a minimum having someone turn in the tear is perfectly acceptable.  Its hard to argue MQ on a roleplaying standpoint, faction questing... especially with the epics, on a RP standpoint is wrong.  From a gameplay standpoint its wrong too... finding a way around the system by definition is deciet.<br />
<br />
In order to trick someone, you have to make an asumption about their suposed reaction toward something, find a way to incur that reaction with something that normally wouldn't cause that reaction, and then attempt to create that reaction with the other.  With a computer its much easier, because there's no true random aspect of it.  A human can discover your ruse through intellect and intutition.  A computer has to be designed to figure out that ruse.  In this case, you are saying &quot;when I do these actions, my character with have a certain faction level, at that faction level when I turn in the scale, I will get my spear... in order to make this faster... I can repeat a certain step of the process and artificially inflate my faction level... That will allow me to have the computers required faction level and still get my desired result, with out performing all of the conditions its looking for&quot;  That's definatly tricking the computer.  OR decieving the computer.  I don't think the ability to reason has anything to do with deciet (try calling you dog in a nice voice and say you're gonna kill it, then try calling your dog in a mean voice saying you're gonna give it a treat, see how the dog reacts... dogs don't have a particular ability to reason, they are merely instinctual.  Then say the word treat (if you give your dog treats) in a normal voice (or outside, or walk... ect.) as the control for the experiment, and to prove it understands some human lanugage) I'm not sure how you can argue that point, but I'd love to be proven wong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I believe this is another case of semantics.  Because I can not agree with either of these following statements and therefore the rest of your argument sir.<br />
<br />
Hacking is merely tricking a security protocol into think you have access<br />
<br />
in this case you are making the computer believe that your input is sufficient for the computers appropriated output.<br />
<br />
This is why.  There is no tricking a security protocol into thinking anything.  You do have access.  There is no trick; you received access given the required parameters.  I am not making the computer believe my input is sufficient because my input IS sufficient.  The computer simply looks for this input.  The input is what is required, thus it is sufficient.  This goes back to not being able to deceive a non-reasoning being.<br />
<br />
What you did (ie the hacking) may not be accepted (hence an exploit) and as such you would be violating a rule or breaking a law; however there is no deception.  You aren't making the computer think you belong; by all accounts you do belong.  You have used the system requirements to gain access.  Though in your example it was done in an illegal way, it is not though deceiving the computer program, but by entering the values that are required of any legitimate person.  The concern here is not on how you gained the information to input into the computer but the fact that you had the correct info that the computer accepts.<br />
<br />
Now in regards to how you gained that info there could easily be deceit.  Your example would be cheating because it is breaking a rule.  The rule is that no &quot;unauthorized&quot; entry is allowed.  People determine (though reason) who is deemed authorized and the computer just uses a certain set of parameters to allow access to those authorized people.  When an unauthorized person (by the human standards) is able to log on, it is because they have illegitimately received a code or other information that is permitting them access.  They are authorized in the eyes of the computer.  The deception happens before hand.  The computer is not deceived, but those people whom the code is stolen from.<br />
<br />
A computer doesn't have to find a ruse.  It isn't designed to find a ruse.  It is designed to take certain info, and given that info perform certain functions.  Whoever has that specific info is granted full rights.  It is under control before hand as to who ought to receive that specific info.  Without illicit means of obtaining that info before feeding it into the computer there is no wrongdoing or deception.  In this case you are gaining the ability to do the Shaman epic though an accepted means.  Since the means is accepted, and the reward of that means is the proper computer access, the outcome (gaining the epic) is not done though deception and is still not cheating.<br />
<br />
Regarding your comment about Feign Death Pulling being &quot;technically&quot; an exploit.  It &quot;technically isn't an exploit for exactly your reason; It is accepted by Verant.  Simple semantic distinction here is that because, it is accepted by verant it isn't an exploit.  Verant defines what an exploit is.  In this sense Verant has the full power to define what is and is not an exploit of their game simply by allowing or disallowing a methods use.  If the method is allowed it is not an exploit.<br />
<br />
Lastly, finding a way around the system is not by definition deceit.  Finding a non-sanctioned (non-allowed) way around a system is deceitful, as circumventing the system in this non-sanctioned way is deceiving the people who put together the system.  As multiquesting is an acceptable method to Verant there is no deceit.<br />
<br />
You can't trick a system into thinking you belong.  You do belong given the system parameters.  Once again, if you have access, in the computers eyes you DO belong.<br />
<br />
Back to my original argument this pertains to:<br />
<br />
1. Multiquesting is an accepted method that does not break any EQ rules. (Verant gets to set these rules.  As such they determine what is appropriate and what is not in their world)<br />
<br />
2. There is no deception in completing a multiquest. (Back to Verant's rules.  They accept it and allow it.  As such, you are not deceiving Verant by multiquesting items.  Further, only Verant can be deceived as the computer only responds to those commands and access guidelines that they allow.  If faction farming were against the rules than farming faction to gain the computers acceptance would be a form of deception, directed at Verant)<br />
<br />
3. Cheating is defined by some act of deception or breaking of rules.<br />
<br />
Therefore: Using MQ to gain the epic is not cheating.<br />
<br />
*edit* I am not sure how you wish me to respond to the dog portion.  I am not quite sure I understand what you are asking.</div></div><hr />

They have said several times that they do not condone MQ and have made several attempts to correct this &quot;game design flaw&quot;.  They have not been able to come up with a solid solution in many cases therefore it is still allowable.<br />

Verant, however, will not (I know some GM's have but my understanding is they aren't suppose to) return lost items due to MQ'ing items.  Because in their eyes, MQ'ing is &quot;cheating&quot;.<br />
