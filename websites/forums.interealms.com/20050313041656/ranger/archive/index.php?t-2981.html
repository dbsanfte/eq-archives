<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually I think it kinda sucks.....<br />
why?<br />
it is too damn slow. 24 delay will emasculate your main hand damage. So really the only choice is to offhand it but even in the offhand the extra half a second delay sucks. To make up for long delays you need to say to yourself  &quot;this is god stats and I am not really wielding it for damage&quot;........17 damage is only nice cause it means your off hand min damage is 2 not 1.. great!!! thing is a baton of flames will own that thing in DPS in the off hand because 7/10 of a second is alot in eq. <br />
<br />
drop the delay down to 20 and this will be jesus like...<br />
<br />
<br />
( honestly parse it.. I bet it does damage on par with primal)</div></div><hr />

For those saying it sucks, take a look at the stats.  ALL of them.  25 STA and 100 HP is nothing to sneer at, along with AC and other stats.  This would be a great offhand weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even then if it didn't also have an insanely low delay.. say Zero, and insane stats, say +100 to all, and insane saves, say +100 to all, and AC, say +1000, and hitpoints, again say, +1000 and mana... it would still suck.  And someone would complain even with all that because it was no drop, or too rare, or came from too hard a mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm....  lets talk functionality here real quick...  what do you use a weapon for?  Unless you have managed to get all 27 class points into archery, the answer would be, to do damage.  Now, that being the case, what should be the first thing we look at on new weaps?  The ratio.  17/24 is fairly good, but *sucks* coming off cursed.  I mean, damn, there's 17/25 coming off Statue, which is a 4 group mob.   Or 19/25 1hb and 14/19 1hs coming off IV, which is 5 groups if you know what you're doing, and they wanna try to slide in a 17/24 on us off one of the hardest mobs in the game?  Heh, sorry.  Not going for it.  Yes, very nice stats.  I'm a big fan of AC on a weapon, as well as large amts of hp/sta.  However, I wouldn't ask for this weap simply because there are way better weapons to use for doing damage that also have good stats.  Bonechiller comes to mind for instance, off a mob that the Cursed could smack around like a little biatch.<br />
<br />
This is *not* the answer to our pleas for a good high end weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the deal.... unless you have AM3 and use archery 100% of the time, going for stats on weapons is a bad idea.  Your job is to do damage, and this weapon doesnt help.<br />
<br />
17/24 off a pretty tough mob.... lesse.   Ribcracker 19/25 off itrear is better. Tolan's longsword (even though it sucks compared to other vulak weaps) is better.  Bonechiller 14/17 is better.   Elphorn's Cleaver 13/17 is better.<br />
<br />
Remember that the 16/20 RNG weapon also drops off this encounter.   Can easily see which is better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that I care... bows &gt; any weapon you could loot. We need some phat arrows to drop as loot, as thats basically allowing us to keep Avatar procing bows while upgrading the damage on it (can't wait till the new 12 dmg arrows work right).</div></div><hr />

25sta + 100hp<br />
<br />
thats what they are intrested in, add in the proc and its going to a MT unless your in a backwards guild thats rolls on stuff or the MT simply doesnt want it, but with thos +HP's its just simply awesome<br />
<br />
As stated above, my job as a ranger is to cause as much dmg as possible and not get aggro, I get 2 mins with trueshot and however long with melee, this weapon wont allow me to cause the dmg I need to cause to being the mob down<br />
<br />
A tanks dmg is to soak up the hits whilst the rest of the guild get medievil on the mofo's ass, this thing allows him to do that to a greater extent, this in off hand with a primal in main (for proc) or willsapper or other such item is just mind boggling for the job they have to do<br />

- loth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This weapon isn't really great for anyone. If you can kill this mob, the MT is going to have a much better combo. This mob also drops a weapon called Bloodfrenzy - 16/20 125hp and Enraging Blow (Same + 750 hate proc as Hategiver and Blade of Carnage).<br />
<br />
Ideally, you want your MT weilding Bloodfrenzy off this guy in offhand  + Hategiver from the Creator in Ssra in mainhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone posted that they found Weapon_03, and it doesn't take long before the thread takes one of two directions:<br />
<br />
1) 'That's too powerful a weapon for the encounter! Nerf!'<br />
<br />
2) 'That weapon sucks for the encounter!'<br />
<br />
It's gotten to the point that I skim past certain people's posts, just to try to find what information about the weapon, where/who it can be obtained, etc, etc, instead of post after post of 1) or 2).<br />
<br />
It's just my opinion, of course, but I wish some people would stop doing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds like a pal/sk 1hs not a ranger 1hs =P<br />
<br />
I'd say stats + that ratio is really really good.<br />
<br />
But of course its all dependent on your mob, and whether or not it actually has Dis dmg, which i am inclined to believe.<br />
<br />
As for bonechiller, well one of the generally accepted truths of the game is that if the dly minus dmg stays the same and you increase both, the weapon gets better, so in theory 21/24 &gt; 14/17, however this doesnt really account for big diffs in dly, and is more suited to comparing say, 10/20 and 12/22 weaps.<br />
<br />
So someone's gotta parse it or else we'll never know =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
swiftwind will do the same damage as this thing in the offhand.. and thanks to the attack boost swiftwind will make your archery/mainhand damage better where as this thing will only give you a few more hp then swiftwind ( assuming sta is maxed)<br />
<br />
NOW.. if they dropped the delay to 20 as I said before.. THEN it would be worth using this for melee but using swiftwind while doing archery.<br />
<br />
basically, swiftwind is pretty damn godly.. and when you consider swapping primal in for proc in off hand then swapping back in swiftwind.. swiftwind=god for the most part. The effect is just too damn good on swiftwind.</div></div><hr />

Warrior and rogue weapons for example. For us rangers it is a different story. Just about the only thing that is a real upgrade for rangers in Ssra is the helm from the Arch Lich, and I solo so much I'd honestly rather have the Thought Horror Overfield Helm for the flowing thought. The earring from Blood is nice, but you can go buy a nice tradeable earring from Cazic Thule. The claw from The Cursed would be a cool weapon if it was mainhand useable, but for soloing mainly. <br />

Luclin loot is just pure ass for the most part. Velious still has the best item for almost every inventory slot, and that is just wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the blade in question is such that your current status will very much determine whether or not it has any value to you.  To some people it sucks, to others it doesn't.  Some people will say that it isn't very good for the encounter.  For us it is a /yawn encounter and the weapon seems pretty well in line with it, whereas the monk weapon of the same mob is kinda outrageous.  <br />
<br />
To say that &quot;anybody that can kill this mob will have primal and other uber weapons&quot; just isn't true.  It assumes that a guild has had all the same members since the release of velious or something.  I know we at least have added many new people.  Most of our new people are using epics and this sword will out damage an Earthcaller and has better stats and less agro.  Don't knock it just because you don't have a use for it.</div></div><hr />
