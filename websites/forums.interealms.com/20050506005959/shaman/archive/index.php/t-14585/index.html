<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 34 shammy - went to Sol A for the first time last night, because alot of people say the exp is great.<br />
<br />
Went with a BL, Druid and Necro.<br />
<br />
We were fairly close to the entrance, in the jail area.<br />
<br />
Things did not go that well, every time we tried to pull one, we usually got 4-6.<br />
<br />
Mobs at entrnace are green and still agro and correct me if wrong - seem to be able to see thru invis?<br />
<br />
Anyways to the question.<br />
<br />
Can you solo in there? Is there a place to park yourself?<br />
<br />
I would think you would need an enchanter in there for cc.<br />
<br />
Seems the risk doenst really justify 13% bonus to me. We died twice -messy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello.  I hunted in Sol A from aroun 30 something til 41 (long time).  Most stuff in there does see thru insv.  cause there are a lot of casters.  There is a room back by an enterance to sol B.  It's great to pull to and the zone is close by if needed.  Clockworks are great if you aren't worried about faction.  If you are be carefull killing them.  If you can find someone who has been there before it always helps, but if now I recommmed getting a map so you don't get lost.  It can be a scarry place when you get lost and make for some yucky cr's.  Good luck and happy hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always thought SolA was great for a PL zone where you want as many mobs to show up as possible. I could definately see that being a problem with a normal group though, sounds like hunting near some of the back zones would help the best.<br />
<br />
My other suggestion are make sure you keep the last one snared/rooted so he doesn't get friends. They can get away from you fast there. <br />
<br />
If you can, instead of pulling to one area keep moving around the castle in a circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both my characters have spent plenty of time in SolA.  So when you say Jail area, I assume you mean down by where the Goblin Torture spawns.<br />
<br />
This is a tought area to hold, but it can be done.<br />
<br />
My adivce would be to head to the King room (Solusek Goblins range in lvl from 28-31) if you want to tackle Goblins.  <br />
<br />
The thing is, that there isn't ONE room in the entire zone that has more the 4 gobs in it, and not all 4 will aggro at the same time if you work the room right.  Sounds like you were getting wanders (meaning you had to pull from too far away), you were chain aggroing (puller was pulling past a room with goblins in it he didn't clear first) or there were just repops on a pull.<br />
<br />
All Shaman Goblins will see through invis, as will any Clockwork.<br />
<br />
Since you all are really too high to make good exp on the goblins, I'd suggest you think about clockworks if you want some great exp (you can do clockworks and gnomes until lvl40).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i always found bar area to be a great splot for a small group, you can 1-3 max if you careful, at your level you might wanna think about taking your group to the clockworks, minding you dont care about faction, they are sweet exp and if your careful, not too many will come, ofcourse if your not careful you will being a castle unto you =-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I killed clockworks and gnomes in SolA for quite a bit around your level. The trick is knowing how to do it and making sure you don't pull too many at a time. If you go left at the entrance to the goblin area you'll go into some small &quot;rooms&quot; where the clockworks start, and then go over a lava bridge. Just past that bridge there will be a hallway to your left, then an enlargement of the cave where two clockworks/gnomes are, and then a room to your left. That room is a safe spot, and you can pull into it. If you're careful, the most you will get is a double pull. I would sick dogdog on one to get aggro, and then slow either the single or double while they were on dogdog. Then I'd double dot both. You need to be able to melee and tank, but it can be done. I'd pull everything around that area to include the single spawn just past the swinging axe thing. If you go deeper into the tunnel past the swinging axe, you'll pull 3-4.<br />
<br />
I did that spot solo for a couple of levels. The loot is good and the experience is great. However, there are a couple of caveats. The first is that I was able to use KEI, and I made sure I was FM before a pull. That was the only way I could handle the double pulls. The second is that occasionally a gnome conjurer (sp?) will spawn. They have pets, and are tough to kill. I could only handle them singly. If I knew I would get one with a double, then I didn't even try (because I died trying once).<br />
<br />
With a small group like you have, you shouldn't have any trouble camping this particular area. You'll learn which pulls will be double and which single, and you have a safe area to sit with no wanderers. Have fun!</div></div><hr />
