<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What spell is better at lvl 34 winters roar or shock of the tainted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Really depends on the resistances of the mobs you're fighting.<br />
<br />
Shock of the Tainted:<br />
130 mana<br />
230 damage<br />
3.9 cast time<br />
<br />
Winter's Roar<br />
150 mana<br />
263 damage<br />
4 second cast time<br />
<br />
The poison nuke casts a tiny bit faster, for a bit less damage for a little less mana.  The differences are really negligible.  But, if you had a mob that was immune to cold, the poison nuke would be your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Their pretty similiar in mana/damage ratio (I think).<br />
<br />
Personally I always used Winters roar if resist was not a factor to keep my Evocation skills up.  <br />
<br />
Its also situational, if you were fighting in Permafrost you would use Shock of the Tainted as most mobs are immuned to Ice base spells and in Skyfire you would use winters roar as most mobs fire based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah it all depends on the mobs resistances.  In Velious I'd say it's best to use poison-based dd, lots of mobs over there resistant to cold as you might have already guessed.  Mobs in kedge are mostly immune to cold too.<br />
<br />
Cold is also a nice dd to use against fire-based mobs like fire elementals in sol b, sol a, ixiblat, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use Shock of the Tainted most of the time because it casts faster and doesn't use as much mana. I don't use DD's that much anyway, but when I do I use Shock of the Tainted. Unless the mob is really Poison resistant then I use Winter's Roar, but those times are rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If the 34th lvl poison DD works the same way as the one we got at 44 (blast of poison?), don't ignore the fact that it always hits for max damage unless completely resisted. Assuming similar mana ratio and resists for cold and poison, I'd always go with the poison line.</div></div><hr />
