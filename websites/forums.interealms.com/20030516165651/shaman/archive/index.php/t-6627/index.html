<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i sat in CoM killing the spectral courier trying to get my last page for about 3 hours. The guy keeps dropping &quot;an unelligble scroll&quot; instead of the students log. I am just unlucky or I am killing the wrong mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try sticking it into the book and hit combine.  If it is correct page, then book should combine.  but I think you will have to wait for student's log.  Try it and see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The illegible scroll is for a monk quest, you need the student's log.  Sorry you're having such bad luck with the drop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep, it can be a P.I.T.A., I had to kill about 10 spec couriers before he dropped mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a further question on the Spectral Courier, does he always spawn in the Stables? And if so, where does he head after that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes he always spawns in the stables, and he's a static spawn - he won't go anywhere until you pull him. After a while I am fairly sure he despawns but I'm not 100% certain on that. Each time I killed the courier it was in the stables to the right, left hand building as you walk in, in the corner past all the other mobs in the building. I've heard others say he spawns in 2 other locations, all of which are in the stables area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Goldark, I appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I camped the Spectral courier for 12 hours straight, but just be patient, he WILL drop the log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Amuller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I feel so bad -- I got courier to drop student log on first try after bout 1 hour of cleaning stables -- BUT still searching for announcement page -- all 5 are still randon right? its just the courier one that is not?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct. The other 5 pages tend to drop all over the place, you're very unlucky not to have got them all - but then very lucky to get the student log so easily! I'm sure another hour there and you'll get the final page. ooc in the zone that you are looking for it too, they're always being left to rot - not that the zones every very busy mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All the mobs on the ground floor of CoM are static, which helped make it a nice place to solo 51-55. Wandering mobs are on the upper wall and skyway, which is hard to get to.<br />
<br />
The stables where the spectral courier spawns is the lowest level fighting area in CoM, along with the entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My other 5 dropped from that mist golem right at the gates. I soloed there for about half a level, dragging mobs to the bridge and having dog eat on them. But like clockwork, it was that mist golem who dropped my pages. Talk about wierd.<br />
<br />
I had to kill the spectral courier twice. Both times he popped in the stables - once in the western half, once in the eastern half. A bard/ranger/druid friend with track can be real useful in figuring out if he's up. We smacked him within seconds of him popping.<br />
<br />
I wish you the best of luck. Also, if a group is working on the reavers, just /shout to the zone what you are looking for, as they clear out yard trash before they begin/during etc.</div></div><hr />
