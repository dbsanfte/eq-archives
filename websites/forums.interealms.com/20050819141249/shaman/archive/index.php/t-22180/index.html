<br />
Its 60% haste, lasts 16 mins.<br />
<br />
SLTW is 60% haste, lasts 16 mins.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Why is our 68 haste the same as our 63 haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They probably just copied the spell data from sltw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They probably just copied the spell data from sltw<br />
<br />
Ic, so its just not finished.. heh <br />
<br />
That makes more sense, I certainly hope its 70% at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's safe to assume that spells that have no real name, won't be upgraded at all with Omens. Spells like Omen-Shaman-Deb or Omen-Shaman-Haste will probably just be removed a week before Omens goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm more concerned that they increase the duration than increase the percentage haste. 16 minutes is a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Id be actually somewhat suprised to see an increase over 60% for shaman.  I dont know why, but I will.<br />
<br />
Hoping for a matching group spell though, with a good 30-45 minute duration.</div></div><hr />

Well if they dont increase it, they will have to just not have it.<br />
<br />
Having the exact same effects but being a higher level spell = stupid.<br />
<br />
Then again the blood of nadox pureblood thing should teach me they screw up on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On one hand I love Lucy.  It's great to see the numbers behind changes that are listed vaguely, such as the HoT changes, before you log in, or to see the exact duration of a buff not listed on the scroll.  On the other hand I hate Lucy.  People tend to treat its statistics as law, and grind them so hard over and over that the game loses its magic... no pun intended.  Instead of &quot;My arcane evocation deals a devastating amount of fury to my victim,&quot; It's more like, &quot;my ancient nuke deals 7316.128 damage for a cost of 302.11 mana cost for an overall efficiency percentage, pre foci of course, of.....&quot;  ARG!<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's probably just still 60 percent from the placeholder they put in.  I wouldn't pay TOO much heed to lucy listings... heck, I saw our original 700/tick Blood of Obkin and was like WOOOHOOOO until they jacked it down to 400 something a week later.  After that I promised to stop checking omens Lucy spells for awhile.  Also, finding out about Ancient Chaotic Pain through Lucy just prolonged my jealous agony!<br />
<br />
Also, as far as the new haste goes, I'm sure it won't be another 10 percent upgrade, since that goes too high for SoE, sort of like us not having a snowball's chance in heck at ever being slated to receive, say, a 80 percent slow.  Knowing their view of the Shaman, they'll probably keep it at 60 percent, give it some wacky title containing a monosyllabic shaman name, and throw a plus 50 to AGI DEX and STR on it to make it an official SoE approved Shaman Buff.<br />
<br />
Personally, I just want a group version that equals the same percentage as our highest single target haste.<br />
<br />
It will kinda suck to lose the regular use of clicky SLTW, though, come the level raise and new haste.  Oh well, 10 secs is a long time anyways... I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why would you lose the right click SLTW when level increases?<br />
<br />
Most likely our new haste will be Aanya's Quickening, or something similar but with a different name, since that would be consistent with our getting SLTW at 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A % increase on the haste is redundant unless it allows you to haste over the cap.  I imagine any improvements will be on either target type (single to group) and/or duration.  24 minutes with SCRM is still a little too often, especially with so many chanter BoTs around.</div></div><hr />
