All other spelleffects are showing. Before I could test it again my ISP connection went down. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Darkness hasa  really cool spell effect right now, was changed, is dark bubbles, really neat.<br />
<br />
I miss darkness having the fear noise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gah, correction, since patch, no noise, before was noise but stupid noise like buff. You are correct and I am dumb.<br />
