<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure if this was added with this patch or not, as it's been a few weeks since I hunted there, but there are now 2 lvl 50 roaming Revanents that roam all the way to the entrance pool room in the Hole.<br />
<br />
/rude SOE for ruining an excellent solo spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">really?  Interesting.  How annoying that would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm, very strange.  I was just there on saturday with my low 50's cleric alt, and never saw one.  We stayed at the zone in for about 1 hour before moving down to the &quot;outside castle&quot; or whatever it is camp.  Never saw it.  I'm wondering if it might have been ghosting, mobs out of place, or we just got lucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive seen alot of ghosting of mobs there up front. First time i saw that i thought a golem has shown up. However i havent been to hole in a long while so be interesting with two roamers.Revenants ? those the undead that are usually deeper in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Revs are not especially hard I don't think anyway.  But I did notice one further north than I usually see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think they did add at least one revenant. I checked tonight and saw one near the entrance of the jail and I was able to follow it up the ramp until I was stopped by the drop off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i was there 15min ago.  there is at least one, and if it runs off you will get two on the way back.<br />
<br />
they just seem to wander up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I suspect (but I haven't looked myself yet) that this could be a consequence of the new pathing code. There's always been a few mobs that wander almost the entire length of the zone, maybe the new code is allowing them to pick up a path to the entrance or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you have it exactly right Grippa.<br />
<br />
There's a room just before the city that generally has a flighty fiend, a ratman, an elemental, and a couple of rock golems in it.  Pathing in that chamber in particular is extremely borked, and there are two revs that path up to one side of the room and simply seem to disappear for a few minutes, then reappear.<br />
<br />
I suspect they were originally intended to go all the way up, and they're finally able to complete that trip...<br />
<br />
I wonder if the rock golem from way down by Tzitzi the Crazed still ghosts up to the entrance, spins a few times, and disappears.  He was always good for a heart attack or two when camping the entrance.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Poked my head in for a while last night, there were indeed two revenants pathing up top.  Since they wander from deeper inside the zone, it's hard to keep track of when they're going to show up.<br />
<br />
Couple of them were the plain old regular 50-ish ghosts, one was a named that summoned, was highly MR and dropped a piece of that crappy withered leather junk.<br />
<br />
All in all I gotta say it's good, the problem with hunting the entrance has always been the shortage of mobs to kill without going off the ledge; so more mobs is a good thing IMO.</div></div><hr />
