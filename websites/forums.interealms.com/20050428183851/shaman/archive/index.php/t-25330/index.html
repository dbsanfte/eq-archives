<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bengen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
 I'm usually limited to soloing due to the amount of time I play and the time of day I play at. I have read a couple of posts about soloing in Gunthak, so I decided to take a look. I swam across the water and upon arriving at the shore I noticed the beach was swarming with mobs. Once I got ashore I was attacked by something that was invisible, then got attacked by something else, had enough of that and swam back out. I thought about it afterwards and wondered maybe if there is an empty part of the beach where I can land thats safe, or maybe I have to go in invisible. I haven't been back to check it out, so I figured I'd post here and see if I get a response first. Also, I am a 44 (almost 45) Barbarian Shammy with average equipment. Any good solo spots ? I'm currently soloing Frost Giants in the Great Divide.<br />
<br />
 Thanks for your help... Bengen</div></div><hr />

When you port down from PoK you need to do two things.<br />
<br />
1- Cast Levitate<br />
2- Cast invis<br />
<br />
Then follow the path on the right side of the beach described above. You'll reach a large cave. Follow that cave all the way to Dulak. Check your map tool to see exactly how to get there.  If you don't have a map, check www.eqtool-box.com. You should be able to download a detailed map of every zone in Broken skull.<br />
<br />
At level 44 pretty much everything on the beach will be too low to gain much exp from.  You'll be far better off in Dulak at the zone line.<br />
<br />
Remember, the only mobs that see invis in Gunthak are the undead, and a few luggalds so just stear clear of them and make the run all the way through the cave to the Dulak zone. Fight the scouts at the entrance until they go light blue, then move inward. When you hit fifty you can take the stormwave and probably the Lady Dirulia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are 2-3 undead mobs that live in a sunken ship just offshore from the center of the center of the beach..these are probably the 'invisible mobs' that were hitting you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">also the scorpions see invis.. Dulak Harbor zoneline is good spot to get used to that zone, then hug right wall and start on first boat.  Should be no problem finding a partner unless you are on Euro time.  Nothing in Dulak see's invis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Javah pretty much gave the guide :) <br />
<br />
When you hit the beach you want to be snug to the right wall; you can basically hug the right wall all the way to the town opening; run straight through there and you should see Dulak entrance on your left (past 2 troll casters)<br />
<br />
Lev will drop (soe as well) on zoning to Dulak. With invis/lev/sow you can make the run even if invis drops...pls announce train inc for benefit of ppl at zone-line ;)</div></div><hr />
