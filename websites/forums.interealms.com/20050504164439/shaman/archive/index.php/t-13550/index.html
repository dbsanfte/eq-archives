<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to get an exchange of current info going on slowing certain mobs as the topic came up in the slows chart thread. Remember the post Luclin changes a while back that adjusted the resistances on mobs - we ended up with mobs like Velketor and Tunare being reported as slowable.<br />
<br />
Now going on my own experiences with Tunare around that time I have a feeling that she was eventually re-adjusted to make her all but unslowable again, I havent revisted her as a shaman for quite some time so, how have you folks gotten on with slowing Tunare and Velketor recently?<br />
<br />
Please state your level along with your recent experiences. Other mobs that I can think of that fall into this category are ToV glimmer drakes (in terms of turgurs, that is) but shout if you can think of any others, we could include Kunark dragons in this since new debuffs and levels were introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The guild I am in recently (May 10) had the unremarkable pleasure of taking down Tunare.  After hearing rumors that she was slowable, I was bound and determined to give it a go (spam the MT please /tells be damned.)  I just alternately spammed Turgurs and Grummus after Malosinia and Malicious both stuck.<br />
<br />
Nada.<br />
Zip.<br />
Zilch.<br />
<br />
Spent the better part of my mana trying to slow her to no avail.  For purposes of your experiment, I am a Lvl 65 Iksar shaman on Rodcet.  The debuff order was: Malo, OoS, Tash, Malosinia, Malicious.<br />
<br />
If someone's slowed her recently, my hat's off to you.  I couldn't get it done.  And I lost on the earring to boot!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive blown 2 full mana bars on slow with tunare once while trying to hold agro, holding the agro part worked, slow did not land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not exactly the Velious era...but I know that for me Mith Marr is a bitch sometimes to get slowed.  I've gone able to get him slowed within the first few tries...to having me, three other shamans and three other enchanters blow their whole mana bar tryin to get him slowed.  Hell...that last time we couldn't even get malosinia to stick on him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chukara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I myself recently ran into a hard time slowing Velk.  I'm in a small guild that's not yet up to any of the larger Velious mobs (obviously, since we're currently working on Velk) and in two back-to-back attempts recently I could not land a single damn slow on him.  After a Tash, Mala, and Insidious Decay, neither Turger's nor Plague of Insects would land, even while standing so close I could look up and see his crotch.  I'm only level 58 so that might have something to do with it, but it still seems like these guys take an inordinate amount of effort to slow, if it is at all possible anymore.  Has anyone slowed them lately?</div></div><hr />
