<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schysm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">good day fellow shamans and shamaness's.<br />
<br />
I just upgraded my old AMD 500, voodoo 3, 64 DDR ram computer to a Pentium 4, Geforce 4, 512 DDR ram computer , yet i have a problem that never occurred with my other comp.<br />
<br />
i used to take 6ish minutes per zone or death or screen durring logging on... but now w/ new comp its around 3 sec heh. but when i finaly do get on , my lag bar emeditately starts splitting until it hits 100% and i disconnect. I tried somthing like 40 times last night and 10 times this morning after the patch last night and still the same thing.. log on, lag bar starts going to 100% (red) and i get disconnected.<br />
<br />
noone in the chat could help so im hoping somone here may have a solution? just spent $800 upgrading my comp and this is quite disheartening. i do still use AOL but thats until i can get the cable guy out here in a few days.<br />
<br />
the graphics and smoothness were super duper but i cant stay on for more than a min.. and durring this time no messages or spells or anything can go through. I seem to be going LD the whole time, yet can move around and zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
please brothers and sisters, if you know of a way to fix this... i would be in your debt.<br />
<br />
thank you very much,<br />

<br />
But I'm fresh outa answers =).  Honestly, this could be MANY different sources.  Did you do a basic install, or did you tweak the comrate or somesuch?<br />
<br />
I would STRONGLY suspect your ISP.  AOL is bad... its evil.  Its just plain wrong =).  It may not be the problem, but I'd change the ISP before looking other sources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you get a whole new system or did you upgrade? I had the exact same problem when I upgraded. It turned out that geforce 4 overheats FAST and I didnt have a large enough fan inside to cover it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would reserve any judgement until you get rid of that AOL connection.  AOL = bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drazile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also maybe try lowering the number in your datarate.txt file.  Set it to 4 maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have a winmodem, get rid of it.<br />
Winmodems use the CPU in order to some of their work and they just don't get along with fast video cards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schysm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">how do you change the file? where or how do i find it? that might be somthing to look into. i cant see how i ran EQ for 3 years on a processor that doesnt add up to a P1, a voodoo 3 card and only 64 DDR ram and 1.2 gig hard drive... and cant play on a P4, GeForce 4 and 30 gig/512 ram system (i have 2 fans on the shell and a big one on the board). *boggle*<br />
<br />
heres the scenario....<br />
<br />
i get to character selection, press enter world and 3 sec later im in. EMEDIATELY the number on the right of the green bar turns to 0 and the other side to 1500+ and the bar starts splitting. it goes back and forth but i cant recieve messages, can send but dont think it gets to them, cant cast (spells remain greyed out) and about a minute later i disconnect. however, durring this time im able to zone...<br />
<br />
i had hoped its all just a lag problem or world problem with the introduction of PoP. but the patch last night did nothing aparently. Im having Roadrunner installed very soon, but ive already been out of service for a week while i built this thing. <br />
<br />
thx for your help, any other info would be GREATLY appriciated.<br />
<br />
your bud,<br />
