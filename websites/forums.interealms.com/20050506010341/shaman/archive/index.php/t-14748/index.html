<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone posted earlier on the boards and excellent guide telling how to activate AAs within hotkeys... so you could /stand /g inc cann and then /?????.<br />
<br />
Being the smart real life ogre that I am, I wrote the information down on my hand with my pen.<br />
<br />
Being the sweaty real life ogre that I am, by the time that I got in game and was about to type in my new hotkeys, my hand looked remarkably like the ink blots that psychiatrist was showing me.<br />
<br />
I've spent the last 45 minutes combing the threads, trying to find it again (it was like the sixth comment on a thread)... to no avail.<br />
<br />
Could some smart person please repeat them? I've learned from my mistake this time... I have a permanent ink marker to write them on my hand with this time!<br />
