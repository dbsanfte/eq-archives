Help us Test &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />
Please help us with testing the new server rule-set for &quot;The Fallen&quot;. If you would like to help test this exciting new concept, please patch to EverQuest using Testeverquest.exe, which you can find in your Everquest directory. Once patched, select &quot;The Fallen&quot; from the server directory and you are in. Here is the proposed rule-set for this server;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Any character that is slain for any reason what so ever will be reset and placed back into newbie status. Characters will not be restored or resurrected for ANY reason what so ever. Once you're dead, you're dead.<br />
<br />
- Each account will only be allowed one character on this server. Any PvP death results in the killing player obtaining a number of points based on the levels of the characters involved. Players can only gain points from characters that are within 5 levels of them.<br />
<br />
- You may loot all tradeable items from the corpse of the character you just killed, all other equipment is destroyed with the character.<br />
<br />
- The server will make use of the Firiona Vie no drop rules (few things will be No-Drop)<br />
<br />
- The server will have the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus) plus the Legacy of Ykesha expansion , and will only allow characters to reach level 50 with no AA.<br />
<br />
- The server will have a doubled experience modifier to facilitate faster paced gameplay.<br />
<br />
- Players will not be able to turn on /anonymous or /roleplay to hide their current location.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thanks for your help and I hope you enjoy &quot;The Fallen&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only similiarity it shares with Diablo, is Diablo's Hardcore mode's perma death. Perma Death is not exactly something Diablo invented. And perma death is something people have asked for before, and is an interesting concept. Though it's a niche market, and therefore something like this, using a perma death ruleset with an existing game is a better way to gague interest in it. Of course there's many problems with implimenting it in EQ, and implimenting it with PvP.<br />
<br />
EQ is so not designed even remotely around perma death. Death Touchs, Raid mobs insane AEs, less of a problem with only old world + LoY, but still a problem, especially given lower resists and hp. Then top off all the idiots who train in general, with idiots who train just because they know you're completely screwed if you die.</div></div><hr />

Perma death is always a bad idea in a game where loss of connectivity can kill you.</div></div><hr />

I think you don't get it. This would be a server that caters to the extremely hardcore PvPer. It doesn't work without the PvP. If you're afraid of PvP, don't try it.<br />

Couple things that aren't mentioned on that page:<br />
<br />
-The server's only going to be up for roughly a month.<br />
-There's going to be an item named after the winners (up to 6)<br />
-If you win you get to transfer your character to any server you so choose for free.<br />
-After one month the server is being wiped and likely started over again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">read on the monkly-business that the server will be reset after a 30 day period, and the winner (most points) can transfer his char to any server. there will also be items named after the winner.<br />

LOL. Perhaps you'd like to petition for some uber loot once every game hour aswell?  :D <br />
<br />
my original real main character(a druid on cazic thule)<br />
<br />
A druid making a statement of 'I want mega xp with no penalty or I'm not playing'? Surely not...  :rolleyes:  :p <br />
<br />
The whole point is that you get double the xp BECAUSE you can get permakilled. You have to ask yourself how the level 30 ganker you mentioned got to level 30 without being ganked themselves - because it could be just as easy for your level 20 'victim' to be doing the ganking. It's a hardcore server for hardcore PvPers. I've never been the best at PvP and it's not for me tbh, but I know people that are slavering to get onto this server and play dog-eat-dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm.. the reset 30 day sounds ok.. that way no one gets too powerfull.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I do agree that the whole competition side of it sounds fun, especially since it's temporary.  But I couldn't help thinking if alot more fun could be had on regular servers with special gm events. :( <br />
<br />
Would be neat to try and find some secret solo leveling spots, or get together with a bunch of friends and make a bruiser crowd, that logged on at exact times and worked together well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Classes with shadowstep, sow, gate, invuln, root/snare and blind will all do ok on this server. Lack of instacast items (no one is really going to bother with tradeskills with a 30 day reset, so even spyglasses will be hard to come by) to protect see invis spell and no real see invis items  available will make anyone with invis a surviver. Even rogues will be ok.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking enchanter will be extremely powerful. Gate, invis, see invis, tash, mez, root, blind, stuns, pets and minor illusion. Cleric will be good as well.<br />
<br />
This is going to be like the early days of the Zeks with total havoc, and people banding together to survive and prey on others. A total blast. Difference is that there will be less griefing. You can't really grief if you only get one shot at it.<br />
<br />
Haven't played EQ for over 2 months, and just as I thought I'd gotten it out of my system they introduce this server... and now I sitting here considering returning. #/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Interesting idea.  I dont think Id try it; Ive never been a fan ov PVP.  I enjoy the occasional duel, but looking over my shoulder every 30 secs wondering if Im being followed isnt what I consider to be fun.<br />
<br />
I do think that casters will have the upper hand.  With the increased exp rate all characters will get levels faster.  FOr casters, more levels means more mana and spells regardless of gear.  Melee will also get new abilities with levels, but mastering weapns skills is (in my experience) slower than mastering casting skills.  Casters can up their casting skills on any corpse or green mob in the game; melee require blue con fights in order to increase their skill.  <br />
<br />
Someone already mentioned enchanters as being tough class to beat; I would put them in front of wizards but behind mages and necros in ease of survival.  A wizards spell book contains much less utility at lower levels than other INT casters tha could make life hard for them.  <br />
<br />
As far as including LoY, I thikn it was done for a few reasons.  For starters, on many servers all the LoY zones are empty.  On RN, the only zone that really sees regular traffic is Dulak's Harbor.  NAdox, Hates fury, Torrigan mines..all are usually empty or have 2 or 3 people in them.  Second, the armor, weapons, and quests in LoY are really pretty good.  Given that its oldworld +1 the items from LoY are going to be the top end items in the game.  It will hamstring players that the level cap is 50, because the only zones that are going to be feasible with only old world weponry/armor/spells are Gunthak, Most of Dulak, and parts of Torrigan.  Nadox and Hates fury would be off limits because mob levels there push into the 60's.<br />
<br />
But, I dont see many people making it into the 20's.  It was said that any death for any reason results in character reset.  How many times did you die in your newbie yard getting jumped from behind by an orc pawn while you were fighting a fire beetle?  Classes that will do well are those that can do max damage from distance and have a way to quickly escape danger.  To me, thats necros and to a lesser extent druids.  Necros have pet, snare, dots, lifetaps, and gate all availible by level 4.  Druids dont get gate till 8, but have snare, nukes and dots by level 5ish.  I wouldbe suprised to see melee get very high.  It will be interesting to watch; I hope that SOEwill post statistics ince in awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow that sounds like a lot of fun!<br />
<br />
I only wish EQ could come close to balancing classes for PvP, but that's most likely to much to ask for from a game that is PvE driven.<br />
<br />
Still that is pretty much the game that I took a year off of EQ to try to make with NWN and my own server.  It sounds pretty fun (at least if one likes hard core PvP, and can stand beeing pked)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With the 50 cap, shaman are pretty powerful with the 42~ second Ice Comet+ from a vendor. I agree with the above who said it will probably be high end = 30's, one death is one death.<br />

<br />
Hmmm - neriak ....  DE's for enc and cle, trolls fer shaman an SK and BL ...  a group would think this is a pretty good starting city for this rule set - as much as I hate being a troll refugee.<br />

A guild could just own the place, though.  If the could start, say, 30 peeps on day one ...  <br />

You've hit on the problem with all of today's MMORPG's - the treadmill.  There is very little differentiation between killing rats, bats, and skeletons in Freeport or killing spiders, gnolls, and skeletons in Everfrost or even killing lowbie stuff in any of the other copy and pasted games out there.  There is no reason to kill them other than that they are there, they give experience, and they drop really crappy loot.<br />
<br />
In a more RPG oriented game, each restart would be a truly new and different experience.  You would have unique quests given that sent you to do specific tasks that were actually fun and rewarding.<br />
<br />
Permadeath + PvP could create a better roleplaying environment...in a completely different game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't know much about PvP in EQ, but it seems to me that bards would be very difficult to kill in PvP.  And bards are the quickest levellers in the game (though perhaps not by as much on a server like this without kunark/planes outdoor areas).<br />
<br />
So they seem pretty sturdy.  Can they actually kill people though?</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of whining on this server by PKs who say that LDoN took away droppable (stealable) gear, POP and Luclin gave people &quot;blue zones&quot; to run away to, there's no more risk of losing anything, and that &quot;anti's&quot; (Like me) ruin the concept of the PVP server. It's time to put up or shut up. If they want to loot to their heart's content, if they wanted hardcore risk, if they wanted to destroy alliances and &quot;antis&quot;, if they wanted no more books to click on,  there it is &quot;THE FALLEN&quot;. As for me, I think I'm staying on a server that doesn't delete my account in 30 days. I may as well be a hacker and risk a banning if THAT's gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

With the lack of resist gear resist buffs will be the next best thing.  Granted they can be dispelled as shaman were one the better classes in that regards.  I think the first 15 levels would be the most difficualt.  Once you start getting up in levels it should with all of our utility spells become far easier.  Though I do agree those that have friends will do the best by far.  Sounds like a very fun adventure though.  Not really been one for PvP but sounds sure temping.</div></div><hr />

Hadn't thought of it, but I cant see why not.  Just think of all the folks grinding character after character just to kill them and show up on the leaderboard.  This has the potential to be the most wretched server yet :(</div></div><hr />

Then they are going to train everything in that zone on those people. The lvl 5 bard most likely will die. But they only lost 5 levels. Everyone they trained will lose 30.

I haven't verified this personally, but what I've heard is that PvP is disabled until level 6 (the way it works on all the other PvP servers). You'd have to take the time to level the character on your second account to 6 before you could kill it again. Now, if points scale based on the level of the person you killed, it would be a better idea to level up and try and kill high level players than to continously kill a level 6 newb every 30 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Something a lot of people are forgetting here is that the scores are based on points, not kills. It's not a race to see who is the highest level at the end of the 30 days, it's a race to see how many people you can kill. If you make a bard and train mobs in a zone, you don't get any kill points and so your time is completely wasted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">This is the best thing that has happened EQ since it launched all those years ago. Total havoc. This is how pvp should be. Bloody and grim. I love it!<br />
<br />
Edit: Asta, i just realised griefing can be done, just find someones bindspot where the pop at lvl 1 when they die. Smack, another corpse, smack again... etc  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I remeber when D2 came out and it was before the expansions and some of the endless loot runs. My former roommate started a hardcore character everyday and died EVERYDAY. no matter what character he died atleast once a day. Hey would play straght through and most of the time it wasnt even the pvp that killed him. It was the lag and the sudden damge inflicted that got him. After about 2 weeks of this he couldt take it anymore and ended up playing a regular character.<br />
<br />
While this seems like a great idea and i mght try it out, im sure that people will have /q qued up whenever they engage someone in pvp. As much as i tend to dislike druids i feel that they might end up ruling the pvp. I wouldnt be suprised to see a druid porting around going invis and laying in wait for some unsuspecting melee to wonder by. hmm thats a good idea, i guess it could work for anyone who could go invis and especially wizards who could endup blasting away 1/2 life before you even know they are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Im going to give this a try.  All I ever played before this was HardCore Diablo2 , so I'm pretty used to the  starting over part heh :)  I think it will be a nice change of pace for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>FinlokVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I forsee a server full of bards and shadowknights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I used to laugh my ass off at Fansy's stories, they were the best ever. Some of his replies to the people yelling at him were classic, used to have me in tears. We should roll a team out of the Crucible, have them level together and all that stuff. Imagine 6 higher level shaman PvPing together in a group...that's a crapload of buffs to have to dispell if you're on the other team :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">We should take bets on the highest level a Warrior gets.<br />
<br />
A solo warrior?<br />
<br />
5<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Another attempt at the finding the 'Holy Grail' of MMORPGs - a PvP system that actually works.  I don't see how this system discourages griefers, but I can see how it discourages anyone from initiating a fair and even fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Having a blast on this server. Went with dwarf cleric twice, got to lvl6 and lvl7 respectively and died to mobs due to stupidity. Going to retry as enchanter or shaman now.<br />
<br />
The only rule on this server is to stay alive. At all costs. Nothing else matters. Take no chances, run early. Stay safe and live another day. There is no glory in rushing headon and dying valiantly or some other roleplay nonsense.<br />
<br />
What draws alot of players to this server is the thrill and feeling of insecurity and lack of control which you last experienced when you were a true newbie to EQ. <br />
<br />
The only change I'd make to the server is to further modify the exp gain. Right now the 2x modifier is hardly noticeable (I'm actually doubting if it even works at all). 4x exp seems better. If there is a way to also boost the rate at which you gain skillups that would also come in handy.<br />
<br />
Like already mentioned in this thread, there is little point in engaging in risky quests, commiting to high end tradeskilling or other long venture plans. Levels are more important and more easily gained than equipment here. Especially if you play a caster.</div></div><hr />
