<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not meant as tongue n cheek or a troll.  I&#8217;m serious.  I&#8217;ve never played an enchanter because I always thought I would hate crowd control.  But after playing my shaman to level 61 it occurs to me that I do something very similar with my shaman.  I have to watch every mob that comes charging in and slow them.  How much different is that from watching all the mobs that come charging in and mezing the adds?  <br />
<br />
I realize there are a lot of differences between the two classes.  But if any of you have also played an enchanter, could you perhaps post some insights to the class?  I love playing my shaman but if I should decide to play an enchanter alt, would my enjoyment of the shaman class possibly transfer to the enchanter class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are similar, yet different. Yes they both slow, but shaman can have mobs pound the bajesus out of em and not explode.<br />
<br />
I play a 62.5 enchanter now, and I play al the time with a 65 shaman, when he leaves, our group suffers, if I miss a slow, I can be in trouble, he takes alot to kill. Chanters rule the CC realm of course, are loved for KEI line, and can charm to limited effect.<br />
<br />
Overall I would say a shaman is a much mroe survivable, much more offensively powerful but for a few certain circumstances, and brings a hell of alot to a group. Enchanters are fragile, bring a hell of alot to a group, and are much more control oriented as to offense and healing obviously. Shaman are simply powerhouses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Together though, we make a hell of a team, and that I think is key. Of course, my old shaman were only 51 and 55 I think, and that was like two years ago on em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't chanters have a 3k rune? me thinks 3k damage worth of unstunnablility is good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can still be stunned with a rune on.  It just sucks up damage.<br />
<br />
Really, the difference is enchanter cc and haste are better, plus mind buffs.  Oh, and Lull, which is now a pretty significant ability.<br />
<br />
Shamans get better group-oriented defensive buffs, a little better slow, a better pet, and can heal.  Plus, we're intrinsically heartier.<br />
<br />
Both have their place in a group, but there are significant holes one can fill that the other can't, and there are things both can do to varying degrees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, I think that a well played enchanter and a well played shaman are equally good.  Both bring a lot to the group. A bad chanter is more obvious though, lol.  Frankly the only major difference is that a shaman can grab 5 dps and kill stuff and a chanter can not.  <br />
<br />
Good pulling enchanters are a thing of beauty in LDON, if you have not had one in your group give it a try sometime. Pacify is a wonderful thing as is stacking up the mobs for the group to kill.<br />
<br />
In LDON I have found that groups with chanters are more controled and without them you are better served to do the &quot;zerg&quot; just kill kill kill.  Style of play is what sets the 2 classes apart when they are not in the same group.<br />
<br />
Just as an aside, I tend to disagree about the shaman pulling in LDON, there is really no need.  Especially if you have a pally/sk just time your slow to go off at exactly the same moment as the pull and you are gtg and no agro so you can immediately slow the other stuff.  And unless you are on hard there isnt any real need to root park the mobs, just slow and have someone offtank if you have no chanter/bard/necro.  Full speed ahead - the zerg is back (and fun).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have played, both, and more to the point of the posters questions: yes both play styles are very very similar.<br />
<br />
You get to buff other players so get to handle tells, etc from many people at once. Helping other players to be stronger.<br />
<br />
You get to cast alot, so need to manage your mana.<br />
<br />
When the fighting starts, you need to pay attention. You need to understand what is happening, you can't be myopic and just fixate on one mob. You need to understand all facets of the combat, the pull, the mobs, aggro control, etc.<br />
<br />
You need to understand your opponents...what spells work, which don't. Tash or no tash, Stuns, mez, levels....the spells are more restricted then shamans, so you need to understand your arsenal. Shaman's have to worry about what resists a mob has in order to damage it.<br />
<br />
Overall I think enchanters have more creative spells to play with, but shaman canni/healing is tough to live without</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't speak for the higher levels to well but I can say, with confidance, that I like shamans alot better.  I played a chanter (my friends chanter to be truthful) to level 42 and though both slows and mezes are very useful, shamans, IMHO, are alot for fun for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Chanters can't heal.<br />
     I know patching my seem insignificant at times but at 62 when ya get your hands and a fast cast 1300 point heal that CAN be effected spell haste and improved healing you become more of a valuable asset than a kinda' handy compensation for a bad cleric.  Also, being able to heal one self is INVALUABLE!  the chanter is the only caster I have played that could not heal and it drove nuking futs (pardon my french  :p )<br />
<br />
2.  Slow &gt; Mez/Stun<br />
     When it comes to mez/stun or slow, I have noticed that, with a good puller, mez is rarely needed, and even when it is, a slowed mob can be tanked by ... most any non-pure caster in the group.  I was able to tank stuff that was 58-61 when I was 54 in Droga.  SK hit 'em aura of darkness ti kill resistes and our rog and I tanked the one or two adds we had.<br />
<br />
3.  Chanter buffs last FOREVER<br />
     Enchanter buffs last SOOO long that after one casting you are good for the next few hours.  Dont get me wrong, I love a nice smooth hit of the good stuff just as much as the next mana dependant class but KEI lasts for 4+ hours when it comes from a good chanter and their haste is a 72 min haste before increased duration.  With a high end chanter casting KEI and SoV on you, you can do a few dungoen crawls before the buffs wear.  It is jsut like having in enchanter in your group for a few hours  :D <br />
<br />
4.  Better pet<br />
     I know that pets as mediocre as Shaman and Enchanter pets should not really be what you base you class decision on but the fact remains that we can control our pets and as such have a free, componentless, easy to use, mostly risk free method of adding DPS to the group.  Though not life changing, our pet is kinda handy.<br />
<br />
5.  More fun to fight with<br />
     Chanter have HELLA expensive nukes that are kinda efficient at best and one dot line.  Shamans have 3 lines of dots, not counting the eipc, a rain line, and 2 lines of nukes.  I LOVE being in a group where I get to use these and when I played my buds chanter (twinked to 255 int at level 10 and more plus mana gear than most 50's) I could only get in a few nukes before i was LoM again.  I realize that VoQ, FT 15, and the mana bonus from being 65 over 42 makes a huge differance but the same can be said for shamans.  I usualy have enough mana to nuke once or twice on every to every other pull, after buffs and still have mana laft for emergency slows, malos, and patches. (I have FT 3, 183 Wis, and about 400 mana from raw mana gear, I am level 56)<br />
<br />
6. 5% makes the differance<br />
     I know that chanters get a 70% slow and I did not think that it ours being 5% better would be that much better at all.  According to tanks of all shapes and sizes though, it makes a huge differance.  Warriors, SKs, and Palis, from no AA to ND 3, CA 3, CS 3, ID 5, and LR 5 have ALL told me that the extra 5 percent is a noticible differance.  B Lord and Enchanter slows WILL work just fine but ours are the best and according to tanks, by larger margin than the numbers suggest.<br />
<br />
*whew* ... I guess I am just rambling at this point so I will leave my opinions/observations of Canni, SoW, skills, alchemy, malo, and our disease based slows out of this shpeel.  For what it is worth though, I can tall ya that you are playing one of the more fun classes in the game though.<br />
<br />
Disclamer:  I am not about to say I hate chanters in the least, I did enjoy playing one and they are great additions to groups but IMHO the shaman is more fun on EVERY level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very well said, Viscerator (save for the last statement, which I wholly disagree with).  I think that about nails it.  Their main similarity is the important part.  Where it's nice to have everyone in the group with a handle on what's going on around them, a shaman/chanter is REQUIRED to do so.  And it pays off for us bigtime because we have so many tools at our disposal to turn an emergency into a controlled situation.<br />
<br />
Same with the enchanter, save that AE mezz is a little easier to fire off than the malx, slow, root, VP, Q combination that a shaman is going to have to instantly juggle in order to achieve a similar effect.<br />
<br />
Very similar in our primary utility (making friends more effective at what they do, and enemies less) though I would say that shamans sacrifice a little in the power of our gimmicks (no C3/mez) in order to wield a superior versatility in group function - i.e. in LDoN I can be primary healer/slower, or primary slower/CC, or just slower/DPS, or maybe DPS/CC if we're not going to slow....<br />
<br />
Less raw power in total, more versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well both are good slowers and can debuff.  Enchanters are great if you really want to crowd control.  Also charming is really fun and something you really can't do with a shaman at higher levels.  I still like the shaman over the chanter though.  I like being able to take a few hits when slowing and heals are great to have as well.  While we both fill the same slot in xp groups, we are really worlds apart!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Enchanters wear dresses. Shaman don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am both a 65 shaman and a 65 enchanter.<br />
<br />
In answer to the original question, if you enjoy playing a shaman you may also enjoy playing an enchanter.  Both classes fill a necessary role in the group, and both classes need to always be looking at the big picture instead of focusing only on the current target. <br />
<br />
There are some similarities between the roles of the two classes; both can slow, both can haste, and both can provide enhancements to players in the form of buffs (shaman get melee enhancements, enchanters get mind enhancements and some weak melee enhancements).<br />
<br />
The differences between the classes become apparent in the area of crowd control.  A shaman is able to do crowd control through root parking, and is fortunately able to take the hits required to do so.  The down side of root parking is that it is time consuming, and the mob is still perfectly capable of hitting anyone it likes if they get close enough (or, worse, summoning people to it if it gets slightly damaged by a pet or a group member).  The enchanter on the other hand is &quot;fragile&quot; at best, but can use a much more reliable method of crowd control (a mezzed mob cannot move, cannot hit, cannot summon, and cannot become un-mezzed until a fixed amount of time has passed).  <br />
<br />
If you do decide to play an enchanter, though, be prepared to die, die, and then die again.  You may even spontaneously die if a mob looks at you the wrong way.  While it is true that enchanters get runes to help them absorb damage, they are not as powerful as poeple think.  You can have:<br />
<br />
arcane rune (1500 hp) -- no component cost, mana intensive<br />
<br />
arcane rune (1500 hp) + rune of zebuxeruk (850 hp) -- 1 peridot, and VERY mana intensive<br />
<br />
eldritch rune 1/2/3 (500 hp or 1000 hp or 1500 hp) -- no component, no mana (but reuse time of 15 minutes or so)<br />
<br />
eldritch rune 1/2/3 (500 hp or 1000 hp or 1500 hp) + rune of zebuxeruk (850 hp) -- 1 peridot, mana intensive<br />
<br />
The arcane rune and eldritch rune do not stack.  A 2350 point rune seems wonderful, though, right?  Well, not exactly.  As an enchanter, every mob that hits you will pretty much hit you for full damage -- you won't be mitigating anything.  Now I imagine that the situation is a little better for &quot;uber&quot; enchanters (elemental planes flagged, for example) but my gear is pretty good in my opinion and I get absolutely pumelled when I have agro.<br />
<br />
Another difference between the enchanter and the shaman is the ability to charm.  There are two types of charm -- dire charm and straight charm.  With dire charm, a relatively weak mob becomes your pet (which still does 4 times the dps of dogdog) forever.  The charm will not break, and the pet is controllable.  With straight charm, a very strong mob becomes your pet for anywhere between 1 microsecond and 7 minutes.  This pet will put out DPS in varying amounts depending on how much risk you want; you can haste the pet, give it weapons, cast proc illusions on it, and more.  It is easily possible to make one of these pets output between 700 and 1000 DPS.  It also also a guaranteed death sentence if the mob catches you.  A powerful, but risky ability.<br />
<br />
Someone made a point earlier in the thread that a shaman can group 5 DPS and have a viable group, while an enchanter could not.  I guess that depends on the DPS classes you get.  You could just as easily say that an enchanter could grab one of any class that can snare, and have a viable group.  :)<br />
<br />
The other thing about playing an enchanter is that it is much harder than playing a shaman.  As a shaman, you have some flexibility.  If a mob resists slow and starts hitting you, you laugh and then slow it again (or malo it).  As an enchanter, you need to really be on your toes.  Up until level 60, you have some built in defense mechanisms (like the ability to stun mobs quickly and easily for virtually no mana).  In PoP, that all went away and enchanters that got agro were dead enchanters.  The LDoN expansion has a new stun spell for enchanters, supposedly good up to level 65 mobs.  That would be nice, assuming it works on all PoP mobs. <br />
<br />
Anyway, those are my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah Shiner, but you know what would happen if you said that to Myrdin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Enchanters, with mez, stun, and mana sieve, are much more effective than shamans when going up against caster MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you all for such informative responses.  It&#8217;s given me a much better insight to playing an enchanter.  After all that I&#8217;ve read I think I&#8217;ll stick with my shaman when it comes to our general role in a group.  And its not like I actually need another alt.  I have a level 51 druid, 51 ranger and 54 beastlord.  But if I should get the urge to level up another alt, maybe I&#8217;ll take another look at my level 20 necromancer.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">mana sieve is useless btw, never will be able to drain an npc mob.<br />
<br />
Something to think about as well, drunk enchanters are bad. I get drunk often, and tend to forget what the hell I am doing, where I am, whats going on.<br />
<br />
chanter 1500 point rune is self only, so dont do anything for group. Root parking is good yes, but is not as good as a nice mez. Chanty pets are very, very good dps, just need to get animation empathy so you van control the son of a bitch.Haste is no comparison, chanters get haste that adds attack, dex, etc. and is fast.<br />
<br />
Shaman just are tough bastages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;mana sieve is useless btw, never will be able to drain an npc mob.&quot;<br />
<br />
False. I can easily drain most mobs mana down to the point where they cannot CH, and in most cases, drain enough mana to prevent gating.<br />
<br />
Now, there is one &quot;bug&quot; that might lead you to believe this is not true. When mobs are OOM, they will still give you the so-and-so is casting a gate spell, however, the spell will never go off and cannot be interupted, because it is not really being casted.<br />
<br />
NPC mana pools are generally not as big as most people seem to think.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mana sieve has some very important uses. I remember leading HoT raids, some with only one enchanter. With every gating mob sieved, we'd very rarely get a gater, or the mob complete heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've had some pretty poor luck with mana sieve.  I remember casting it over and over again from start to finish during a fight and still having the mob gate (a dragon in ToV).  Drove me crazy, and I pretty much never looked at the spell again after that.  I suppose it could have been bugged at the time (remember when theft of thought drained all of YOUR mana instead of giving you some of the mobs mana -- that was fun).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, the &quot;gate&quot; scenario you are running into is this:<br />
<br />
1. You mana sieve the mob down.<br />
2. The mob regens enough mana to gate<br />
3. The mob gates<br />
<br />
Mana sieve merely drains mana, it does not prevent regen and you do not need to regen much mana to gate.  Torment of Argli is a Mana Drain DoT.  Used in tandum they will drain and keep drained a mob.<br />
<br />
The other alternative of course is you kill them too fast and have not managed to drain them to zero mana yet :)<br />
<br />
It has been awhile since I did ToV but I seem to remember Sieving 3 times drained them and Torment of Argli kept them drained.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think its more likely we're killing the mob before we can seive it down enough.  Perhaps the ToV dragons just have large mana pools.  In the example I gave, the spell was chain cast from the beginning of the fight to the end of the fight so I can't imagine it would have been a regen thing.  I'll give it another try though -- maybe I've unjustly written off a good spell.</div></div><hr />
