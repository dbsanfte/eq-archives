<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Im a fast leveling 57 shaman whos been looking at spell prices for awhile now. Knowing that tier 2 and 3 are about to open up with level restrictions means I will be able to get 65 very quickly now. My question is should I buy malo and topor for the outragous price everyone wants for it or just wait till I hit 65 and buy Quiescence and Malos since they go for about the same price or even cheaper? I dont have alot of cash so Im trying to budget it through my spells and think which will be more beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I say buy malo.  You can get away without torpor if you have stoicism.  But malo will make your leveling to 65 a lot easier.  Murphy's law states that you'll get resisted at the worst time, and there's nothing like that useless feeling of not being able to save your team with a timely slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to eqtraders.com and look up the research components for malo and torpor, and where they drop. Then, get to work!  Research is a very viable solution, and probably much cheaper.  As the previous poster said, you can get by without torpor, and but is a must-have if you plan to be slowing in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Save your money and wait till 65 for Malos/Qui.  There will be more than enough xp spots for solo/group that don't require Malo and bad luck resists will happen even after Malo + Malosinia, so its not worth blowing 40-50k for a spell that will hit page 50 in a few weeks after that. With access to the new planes you will hit 65 fast enough anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Save money for malos and quiescence. Malo isnt at all crucial in exp groups, as a matter of fact i never had malo and i managed to hit 65 and do 70-75 aa before i got malos. I exped mostly in plane of valor and bastion of thunder at the time and getting mobbs slowed there wasnt very troublesome. In most cases i got them slowed earlier then i do now due to malosinia having much shorter casting time. But worst case slow time was dramatically worse due to resists, therefore i was seldom main healer for groups before i got malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use Malosini in exp groups, and it works fine. If you have a chanter, tash is all you need to land slow ANYWHERE in PoV. I'm missing one component for Malo, Words of Retention(?), and it drops somewhere past the 9th Gate Of Hell. I'm 63, and the only 60 spell I have is Khuras. Stoicism works fine, if I ever drop below 40m in a group sitation chances are we're about to die anyway.<br />
<br />
I saw something On SolRo on Friday that made me decide to wait and buy Q and Malos. I did the usual shaman spell search in the bazaar and this is what I got:<br />
<br />
Focus Of The Seventh(7)  40k   Ghorsella<br />
Malos(12)                40k   Ghorsella<br />
&quot;Q&quot;(4)                   40k   Ghorsella<br />
Ferine Avatar(7)         40k   Ghorsella<br />
Blood Of Saryn(6)        20k   Ghorsella<br />
<br />
Now, look at that. Most people would say that's a large chunk of change...but really...that's damn cheap for a Torpor / Malo upgrade. I figure it's one of our Uber Guild Mules...but I'm not sure. Bottom line is: Eventually, runes will become decently cheap. A hardcore raid guild will rake these things in, and after they're done equipping their members with them, they'll start putting them on the open market to boost their guild funds.<br />
<br />
I'd say don't bother to flat of buy Torpor OR Malo, unless you find it dirt cheap. Look for the research componenets instead, the words of retention will cost me a bit but in total...I've probably payed MAYBE 4k for 3/4 of Malo. Do your homework, search the bazaar often, and buy research items the minute you see them if they're reasonably priced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I grouped 61-65 in Valor, without malo or torpor.  I'd malosini/a on incoming, and if it didn't stick I'd cross my fingers and try turgurs anyway.  When that didn't work (semi-often) I'd alternate sini / slow till I got it.  Wasn't nearly as good as the reliability of malos, but I wasn't about to spend 50k on the damn spell just to upgrade it in 5 levels (ended up paying 25k for malos, go figure).  It didn't get me kicked out of any groups *shrug*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Focus Of The Seventh(7)  40k   Ghorsella<br />
Malos(12)                40k   Ghorsella<br />
&quot;Q&quot;(4)                   40k   Ghorsella<br />
Ferine Avatar(7)         40k   Ghorsella<br />
Blood Of Saryn(6)        20k   Ghorsella<br />
<br />
OMG, if those were the prices on Karana, I would've picked up Fo7, Q and BoS in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The componants to use the research option are too rare I think to make it that viable.  I would keep my eyes open in the bazaar though for components.  But I think you would have better sucess camping Emp in Sebilis or killing Guardian Wurms.  Kunark Dragons can be done with a group or less in most cases now.<br />
<br />
What is said about Malo is somewhat true, if you have an enchanter in the group you can land slow on just about everything without Malo/Malos.  But without one your going to be hardpressed in some zones to land Malosinia without it being debuffed with Malo/Tash first.  Not even counting the raid benifets of having Malo.  If your going to buy spells I would save for Quiescience and Malos, unless you see Malo/Torpor for a great price.  Runes are pretty hard to get if your just an exp'er</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im kinda having the same problem. Ive been 58 for months, I cant play because RL is a pain atm (TERM END NOW!) anyway. on brell I see torpor once every few months, same with malo, and have NEVER seen Q or Malos. I must be unluky when I check the bazaar or something. what im planing on doing is just wait out until the planes open up and level fast and get rune drops (fun fun fun... from what Ive heard) mabye with the release of veskar on normal servers (if/when that happens) torpor/malo may be on the open market more often.<br />
<br />
as a side note. brell must have some issues with 58-60 spells, I guess people have just moved on. I had to shell out 10K for khuras, Ive seen pox and VoB ONCE never seen tali of the raptor at all you can get the 61-62 spells pretty easy, 63-64 there are a hand full for sale weekly in the 10-20K range, and 65... well...  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am on Brell also.  How often do you check the bazaar?  I see Torpor for sale pretty often at 35k pp.  Still the cheapest way to get it (other than it dropping for you) has to be research - I have a friend who has researched 6 copies of it for his guild shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">mostly on the weekends, probably not the best time hehe =P im kind of half-assed researching topor. Ill check for the componates when I look for it, I figure if I ever find torpor when I have the cash I could sell the componates I have at little to no loss.</div></div><hr />
