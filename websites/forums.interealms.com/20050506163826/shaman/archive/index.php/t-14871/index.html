Hi, been a while, said would never do it but since SWG is a flop, I prolly will. About 3 or 4 of us will play, possibly a couple of us duel box. I don't really want to but I realize you HAVE to to ensure you can advance if buddies not online. I was thinking, but not sure because of whatever changes went in,<br />
<br />
DE chanter/Troll(innoruk) Shammy combo.<br />
<br />
Figure will have snare/fear ability, good dots and not too horrible pet/DD, and the godly clarity and speed/slow, decent heal,SOW. Not really wanna do shammy/tank because no clarity blows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would prolly have buddies play a cleric and maybe a SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
What server(US one) is typically the lowest population/newest one? Want as new as possible and as little crowds.<br />
<br />
What do you think? Am I just too friggin set in my ways to have fun with this combo? We would be relaxed, not ever worry about being uber and getting past level 50 something, know we cannot ever get epics or anything like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelcraft still worth a crap at all?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm chanter/shammy can be great at higher lvls. At low lvls though, probally will be slow going. When your buddies are online it will be carnage though. I think FV is the lowest populated server atm beside the pvp ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bard - Shaman is so much better than Enchanter - Shaman.<br />
<br />
...If you like exploration and doing things most people wouldn't dream of doing... bards are really sturdy, and have great synergy with shamans.  Enchanters and Shamans have redundancy.<br />
<br />
Once your bard friend hits 63 (64?) and get Fading Memories, you will come here and thank me for my great advice :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do?  Dammit, why didn't anyone tell me this before?  I've been advancing anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rorgg,<br />
<br />
Seriously man, if you like making new friends and stuff thats great, I, do not. I have had too many bad experiences with EQ guilds to ever, ever stray from my good old core buddies. I will not do pick up groups, beg for buffs, kiss ass for raiding. I will probably remain in kunark/old world zones as well.99% of EQ players I have met since beta have been less than honest to say the least. The 1% I truly liked, well, they made the game fun for me, and I don't want to sift through the trouble makers again.<br />
<br />
Can you effectively solo now? I know I could as a necro last time I tried, but that was always a good class.<br />
<br />
I honestly enjoy the building process, and speed is relative, but I do like to feel as though I am making progress, and I needed clarity with my last two shaman to feel that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I am old fashioned, and anti-social, but heh, better the old friend you know then the guy you don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">playing two classes that have to micro manage might get a little tuff, but go nuts.<br />
<br />
this way when the monk screams for sow and hase, it's like you have two little whiny bitch complaints to deal with!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">only whiney bitch though would be myself, or good friends, who I could tell to shove it up their ass if they get out of hand, or too drunk!! haha.<br />
<br />
Besides, haste and slow and regen only spells I have ever used for fighter types, rest is waste of time.<br />
<br />
Have played shaman/chanty combo before and it can get tough, but sure is exciting managing the pull, slowing and healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seriously, since I came back in December, I rejoined my casual guild and had no problem leveling up.  I had no problem getting random /tells for groups, /LFGing on, or forming them when I needed to.<br />
<br />
Of course, not every group was perfect, but I never got close to a point where I felt I wasn't making progress.  Eventually I did join a raiding guild, but there are a lot of old friends/guildies there, so it's not stretching.  I dunno.  Guess it depends on your level of tolerance.<br />
<br />
Can you effectively solo now? I know I could as a necro last time I tried, but that was always a good class.<br />
<br />
God yes.  When I came back I was about half through 58, and mostly grouped up to 60, though I did do a little soloing here and there.  Once I hit 60 and flagged for tier 2, though, I'd say I got XP quite nearly as fast solo as grouped.  I happen to prefer groups, but I often would solo while hanging around waiting for one or short on time.<br />
<br />
If you're anti-social, sure, I can see the need for a 2-box, but really, most people don't NEED to to progress.  It's pretty easy to move forward nowadays.  I spent less time on 61-65 total than I did for many levels in my 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bard shaman That would be insane..... <br />
Try twisting a two box... hmmmm<br />
<br />
SK Shaman sounds fun.... clarity can be purchased I don't think that begging....<br />
<br />
Im sure my vote would be SK or BS... for fun and ease of play...</div></div><hr />

Truthfully I'd sugggest necro/shaman combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh and on a side note...<br />
<br />
The old Mil wouldn't ask... he would do it and then come back and post how correct his choice was and then make a fun game about  How much beer you could drink and still keep both chars alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Newest server is Stromm. Only been a live server for about a month now. Lowest population? Don't know, that's why the game tells you.</div></div><hr />

Might not be the best combo....but you did mention fun, and of course you throw some (alot) good quality (cheap) beer into the mix and let the good times roll!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When Stromm opened up a few months back I headed there figuring to breath a little new life into the game. At the same time a RL friend of mine started playing EQ for the first time.  She was dead set on playing an ogre shaman since she had seen how much fun I had with Tuga so I rolled up a dark elf mage to duo with her.  We have had a total blast so far, I just can't say enough about the shaman/ mage combo.  Even with good equipment scarce as hens teeth on the server, soloing and duoing is both rewarding and fun for both of us, and that's with hunting the odd, out of the way areas like the warrens and stonebrunt.  The last time I played a mage the pets were paper tanks and burnout made poor Jobober self destruct. Now the pets are monsters, even at low levels and the summoning spells are actualy something you use and others ask for. I'd give a two thumbs up for fun factor and power for for mage/shaman combo.  <br />
Oh, probably the newest, lowest population normal server would be Tholuxie now, especialy since Stromm opened. I know a bunch of us moved there. Stromm is the newest server, but it's also one of the most crowded, esp at the lower end (saw Nektulos the other night with over 100 younguns in the zone).  Good luck and good hunting Mill, welcome back to the assylum. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I personally 2 box a necro and shammy on stromm(lvl 56 atm) It is still new, not much in baz to buy. It is pretty populated, but the population is very evenly spread out through the levels. Many older servers are more top heavy thus empty as you level up, then you suddenly run into hundreds of people in the upper end zones. I highly reccomend my combo as a change of pace from the melee/healer combo. It is also pretty laid back as I dont have to worry about charm breaking, can get groups easily most of the time if I choose to, and can exp at my own pace when I want to.<br />
<br />
Another combo to look into is chanter/druid if you like charming. this combo will easily take you to 65 if you wish, will be a great addition to groups, and can help you pl your friends if you get ahead of them. The one thing that really helps benefit a charming class is snare. You are thinking that the snare neck from a shammy fills this role. It does not!! Snare neck is useful only to stop runners, and not even very good at doing that. Do not count on snare neck to add a usable snare for everyday situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks guys,<br />
<br />
Tholuxie? or Stromm? Sounds good to me. I would love to do a mage someday, but I think no matter what I will need chanter and a shaman, prolly only have two other people playing now and don't know if they can two box.<br />
<br />
You know, last time I played, I actually had a blast and got phat lewt in Befallen? Hahahaa. I wouldn't know a PoP zone if it landed on my face and started wiggling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stjarna_kvarco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My wife and I play a Bard/Shaman Duo.  The mana regen with her Canni/Chloro, and My Heal/Mana line of songs is as good as her having KEI.  When she gets KEI she can't cast fast enough to run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Bards are not enchanters, but have good CC abilities.  They are definately tougher than enchanters.<br />
<br />
The Shaman/Bard spell/song lines really compliment each other well.<br />
<br />
Playing a bard to it's full potential and dual boxing anything else is just about impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other class that works well with her shaman is a necro.  Necros again have some of the fastest mana regen in the game, and can share it with you.  They have ghetto CC abilities, and the combination of their pet/DOTs with your pet/DOTs does nasty things to mobs.<br />

<br />
Errrrm, I'm level 50 now and would easily be level 54 if I hadn't stopped to PL a few alts and friends along the way. I came back to the game in March and I solo almost exclusively. (Well, not these days as much, but only because I have guildies that I mistakenly clued in to LoY zones, so now they come join me for BD drops.  :D )<br />
<br />
With canni and a drogmor, KEI (and other mind candy) is pretty much a nice thing to have but not at all required as long as I am solo.<br />
Grouped, it becomes a little more of an issue...but only because I hate being the cause of downtime when grouped with guildies. (They, on the other hand, understand just fine. I think they are prolly amused at my mad attempts to stay active)<br />
<br />
I really, really gotta get off my butt and do the Canni II quest...since I will be frozen at 50\51 for a while till my little 2 box cleric catches up. I hadn't done it yet because I hadn't planned on spending a whole lot of time between 39 and 54...then I decided to 2 box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Stromm is the most croweded server now. zeb is not the least populated (but it almost is) at lower lvls the zones are EMPTY. And it might be ruff (pun :) )starting with no twinkage till u get dog dog<br />
But after that lvln is trivial</div></div><hr />
