<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The experience bar.....<br />
<br />
It would be so much more fun a game if tommorrow the exp bar just disappeared completely.<br />
<br />
Think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Guess we could take out all numbers while were at it.  So you have no clue what a spell does, or how much a sword hit for, until you use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
On road trips, I suspect most people actively look for highway signs to tell them how close they are.  EQ is no different.<br />
<br />
You'd have to remove every number if you wanted to do that.  Cause then, some guy would just count kills between levels. Then, if you removed levels, some guy would just note if his average melee dmg went up, and how many kills it took to ding.  Etc..  And of course, someone would catalog how many MoB X's to Ding-type Y, and you could lookup which was the easiest way to ding.<br />
<br />
There will always be people who want to play at peak efficiency.  To them, &quot;winning&quot;, or &quot;being the best&quot;, or at least &quot;being above most other players&quot; is important.  No matter what the system, those people will find a way to measure some aspect of it.<br />
<br />
In the same regard, I'm 65 with 100+ AA's right now.  I haven't looked at my exp. bar since I got two yellow into 65.  And, to be honest, it really hasn't changed the game for me.  I still play wherever I want to play, which surprisingly enough, is often where excellent exp can be found.  Higher end loot is a motiviating factor for lots of people also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just take it out... completely... you have zero idea when you will level and zero idea how long it will take and how much exp you get per kill. <br />
<br />
Mathematics is the MOST boring subject on the planet and it has taken over the entire idea of EQ. <br />
<br />
Sure you can advance... but who knows when... Imagine what you would do if tomorrow you logged in and the exp bar was gone.<br />
<br />
I think some people would be completely lost, they would be like .... OMG I didn't write down how many kills of random spawn x it would take to level! Oh god. The HORROR!!! Or perhaps they would say ... ok now where do I find it most fun to hunt?<br />
<br />
Go read the level 50 to 60 and 60 to 65 message board... the problem is right there. &quot;Go grind in Katta&quot; &quot;Forget AA get lvl 65!!!!&quot; &quot;you get 3%AA a kill so it only takes 34 kills at 4 minutes a kill so if you don't piss or eat you can have an AA in time X&quot;<br />
<br />
It really is sad. I play eq.. and look for advice, but some advice I just don't understand anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And then we would have some guy anally probing the source code to figure out exp ratios, and suddenly, rather than going by percentiles, we're counting honest to god fractals. The Katta guard gives 5.453 exp, while a Tro Jeg Initiate in SD gives a straight 5.5!<br />
<br />
(Yes, Luclin mobs. Remember that expansion? Was a cross between Earth 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog, with cats?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I like the exp bar.  I lose much more sleep with it.  5% left of lvl I am up till its done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please dont remove the Exp. Bar. I like those amusing Posts &quot; How to get a AA level in 35 Kills &quot;.<br />
But the DPS and Weapon Ratio Posts are more fun.<br />
Btw Should i get a 89.98675 DPS or  a 89.98644  DPS Weapon ?<br />
I hope we get rid off that **** in WoW.<br />
Not to mention the Penis Size Magelo Posts.<br />
I always look out for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mathematics is the MOST boring subject on the planet and it has taken over the entire idea of EQ. <br />
<br />
Mathematics is the basis of everything.. EVERYTHING. Mathematics hasn't taken over the entire idea of EQ, it's always been the entire idea BEHIND EQ... i see what you're saying though. here's an idea, for those that would like to remove &quot;mathmatics&quot;, er, the exp bar... just remove the exp bar from your UI =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not to mention the Penis Size Magelo Posts.<br />
LOL<br />
where did this anger come from.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I suppose you could create a custom UI and just leave out that bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The idea is a nice one, but then again socialism is a nice idea too.  Putting it into action is a lot more complex than simply removing the visible levels/numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah, and here I thought based on the title this was another casual vs. raider design thread.  :p</div></div><hr />
