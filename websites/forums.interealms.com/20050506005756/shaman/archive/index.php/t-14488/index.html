<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have you ever done just plain out bone headed things in game?  <br />
<br />
When I started way back in 99 or so I never played my toon at night.  I just couldn't see anything and I even had a greater light stone.  The manual said that barbarian eyesight was bad so I just assumed that it was working as intended.<br />
<br />
Someone told that I should go to options and adjust gamma and I would be able to see better at night.  I did but there wasn't any changes at all.  <br />
<br />
This was the reason I was sooooo looking foreword to getting serpent sight.  I figured hell, I see all these folks running around at night that have infravision, then finally i'll be able to do some hunting at night.  That didn't work either, I just couldn't see at all.<br />
<br />
I can distinctly remember following a wood elf from Qeynos Hills to Qeynos at night.  We zoned into Qeynos, she a little ahead of me, so she just ran on to the bank.  I gave her a tell and asked where she went and she said to just meet her at the bank.  I told her I couldn't see how to get to the town that I would just wait for sunrise.  She told me to just follow the road to which I replied I can't see the road.  Once again I was told to check my gamma but to no avial.<br />
<br />
Later on the guildy showed me where the bear for the totemic helm spawned down in the caves.  She cast ultrivision on me so I had no problem getting to the cave but once there I couldn't see inside the cave even with ultravision on.  At this point I finally learned that something was seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
Then quite by accident I bumped a button on my monitor which so happend to be the brightness button.  What I saw there truly made me want to hide in my closet for the rest of my life.  My montior brightness was at 5% out of a 100%. <br />
<br />
Needless to say I turned this up to about 55% or even 65% on occasion and could then run around naked as a barb and see perfectly fine unles in the deepest dungeons.<br />
<br />
Long drawn out story I know, but was just a straight out bone headed, clueless newb mistake I made and I was wondering if any other folks had any bone head times, be it funny crap like dieing in funny ways or what have ya.  Just post um and let us laugh at your expense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I fell in the Paineel Hole 2 times. In one day. Then there was the mad dash for the bridge in the Deep, where I promptly fell to the bottom of the cavern. Scrolling up my text window, I saw I had been told 10 times NOT to cross there, but having been &quot;oo'd and aah'd&quot;, I cost the raid about 5 min personal time :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Drajj, don't bother asking people for their mistakes, it requires being man enough to admit ever having made one, much less to speak of multiple mistakes, of which one could choose his bone-headedest&quot;. <br />

Bone Head Story #1<br />
<br />
I remember the search for phat plat.<br />
I had just started playing and a friend of mine kept telling me I had to get outta halas because everfrost was just horrid for plat and stuff like that. He said that the orcs in crush bone droped MAJOR phat plat! Like 1-2 plat a kill!!!!!<br />
<br />
I was talkin to my in game shaman sistah and told her all about this Crush Bone and that we had to go there because we could make serious cash fast! (roflmao). She said she had hoped that on our trip we could stop by East Commonlands because thats where the magical wepons were made that allow you to hit better and hit monsters that could only be hit by magical wepons!<br />
<br />
We decided to wait for SoW lvl (9 right?) and then try our trip. (NO CLUE as to what a port was and how close SFG was compaired to the rout we were going). So at sow lvl we decided to wait till we could Bind then take out and try it. <br />
<br />
One day I loged in after work and sal was in EC. OMG I was like WOW whats it like? you took the trip? did you die? whats up? =) <br />
<br />
Well we made it to crush bone! even back then, I was like &quot;WTH was he talkin about?&quot; =)<br />
<br />

Bone Head Fact #1<br />
<br />
I had reached the end of my eq days when I died by falling in the hole in blackburrow. Some people told me that you needed people close to lvl 55 to go down there and get you! There was no way I was going to make it down there to get my stuff.  :eek: <br />
I had a sweet lil 6 wisdom ring that someone had given me, at the tragic loss of all mah phat gear (yes that 1 ring was all mah phat gear) I decided I just wouldnt play this Dumb Game anymore!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not one for reading instructions. Actually, I had bought EQ about 6 months before I decided to finally put it in, had no idea at all how to play (I thought, &quot;I'm the console RPG champ, I can do this no sweat...&quot;). So without reading anything, I start to play it. Well, there is a lot of funny goofy memories. My favorite and probably most funny is how I'd bust my hump getting a few measely plat, run to the closest vendor, get that new shiny piece of cloth armor, or that cool new weapon, and cross my fingers as I attempt to auto equip it, hoping I could use it....that's right, I had no idea about the right click thing...I wasted a lot of newbie loot on stuff I couldn't even equip and had to sell back at a loss lol (which sucks as a complete newb hehe)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paying 89 k for malo right before pop rune spells became available. 3 weeks later malos at the bazaar for 70 k. <br />
<br />
Destroying Maiden's eye lucid shard to make room in the bank thinking &quot;It's not like I'll be going to Vex thal anytime soon&quot;.... 3 days of solid camping to replace it.<br />
<br />
Thinking that when Verant decided to add smithing recipies and lower fine steel trivials they would actually include a practical skilling path to replace fine steel, and therefore not skilling up smithing before the nerf.<br />
<br />
Biggest boneheaded thing I ever did ? Levelling a wizard to 55th before switching to a shaman !<br />

Remember my first character was a warrior on Prexus.  Only played him for about a month..but I remember that when I started him, I spent all night...about 10 hours total just trying to figure out where the hell the stupid warrior trainer was.  Someone had to explain to me where he was...then he had to show me how to talk to someone else and how to do /ooc shouts.  Sucked alot...then of course, just like everyone else I attacked the guild master and had to have someone else show me how to get back.  <br />
<br />
Was level like 50+ and used to use the TD pot room for quick transport.  I took the one once to Cabilis and thought that since I have Scale of Wolf I would easily be able to outrun the guards while running out into LOIO.  Let's just say that I didn't make it more than 5 steps past them before they smeared me.  <br />
<br />
My first canni5 death was super embarrasing.  Ever since me and my roommate started playing EQ and he got his brother to play, me and his brother have battled against each other..  Shaman vs. Necro.  I told him once that I would never, ever need his help for anything.  So, one day while pulling Prat Myral (with the cleric weapon) my guild decided to gate out..since we couldn't figure out how to counteract that and no one could land a spell.  Well, I decided that it would be best to make sure that everyone else got out...and well, I ended up getting that stupid can't transport message after the wizard cast the spell again.  So it was me and monk left..and I wasn't able to get gate up and off in time.  So, I had to first beg the necro to come and help my guild and summon me.  Then I got rezzed and after noticing that I had over 2100 hps..hit the canni5 button....LOADING PLEASE WAIT.  Seems that I noticed that my current MAX hps was above the required...but my current hps was not.  Was sooo embarrased cause not only did I require the necros help to summon me..but he got to watch me kill myself.<br />
<br />
Hmmm..i know that I have more stupid stories...just have to remember them.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't until about a half second after I was LOADING PLEASE WAIT that I recalled that &quot;Able to canni5 unbuffed&quot; and &quot;Able to canni5 naked&quot; are not quite the same thing.<br />
<br />
Then there was the time that AoW got pulled while I was still doing touch-up buffs, and not wanting to be a slacker, I sat down to swap some spells...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Let's see... bonehead moves...<br />
<br />
First one: I created a woodelf ranger based out of Kelethin. When it started, it was dark, and I couldn't see anything... I'd walk up a ramp and off the side. Dead. Did this for about 30 minutes, decided I'd just been ripped off and quit the game.<br />
<br />
Second one: Created a halfelf ranger based out of surefall glade 3 days later. played him for a bit. Finally made it out of the damn tunnel after a few days (I was sure it was a dead end) by following other peoples names (above their heads.) Spent my first 10 levels learning archery, because I knew that archery was important for a ranger. Of course, I'm running around in crappy leather armor that I made this whole time. Got archery up into the 90's tho...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">When I first started, I remembered the instruction manual saying to choose a server with a lower population, since you would have more space to hunt in, and I took this advice to heart.  So I logged in the one with the lowest population and made a character.  I leveled them to level 4 or 5 and logged out for the evening.  <br />
<br />
The next time I was on, that character had poofed.  I thought &quot;Oh, I guess your character has to be a certain level before the game will save it.&quot;  I remembered back to MUDs where they would wipe all characters under level 5 or 10 once a week to save memory.  It had been a few days, so I figured I just needed to get my character to 10, to make sure he was saved next time.  <br />
<br />
This character I got to 5 or 6 before I logged for the night.  I got on after work the next day and the character was gone.  I was close to cancelling at this point, when someone in /ooc asked if the game would save level 1 characters.  Not knowing how to use /ooc, I shouted that it wouldn't even save level 5 characters, which got a lot of snickers.  Eventually, after realizing I wasn't kidding, someone finally told me that I had to choose the same server every time.  <br />
<br />
I also didn't know how to see the stats of items by right clicking.  I thought I had to find an int. caster to cast identify or buy a scroll of identify for each item.  I wasted a ton of money buying leather and rawhide armor from vendors, hoping it would fit me.  I also remember spending all day getting money to buy that uber bronze longsword to replace my rusty axe.<br />

<br />
Lets see.<br />
<br />
1. Running from Qeynos (bind point) to Freeport when level 30 I think and dying in Kithicor Forest (got feared by a mob, had no idea where my body was, eventually found it). So I run back to Kith from Qeynos loot body and zone into WC, up comes Dragoon Zytil or something and seconds later, LOADING PLEASE WAIT. So back to Qeynos I go. Next time I rebound myself in every zone.<br />
<br />
2. Rooting myself instead of the Kodiak in Great Divide. Luckily he did so much damage it broke root and I managed to run away.<br />
<br />
3. Have killed myself with Cann 5 at least 3 times.<br />
<br />
4. Having just killed Neh Ashir and having book in inventory handing in the child's tear to Rak and getting it eaten. /sigh <br />
<br />
5. Joining friend in PoP zone and slowing mobs using lower level slow becuase I hadnt re-memmed big slow from when I had been hunting in greenie zone.<br />
<br />
6. Think I turned 20 Jum Jum Cakes into 10 Jum Jum cake slices.<br />
<br />
7. Too many times but 2 recently, not noticing Invis flashing and then getting killed by mobs.<br />
<br />
8. Wandering around West Karana hills at about level 10 and found the bandits, had no idea where corpse was kept wandering all over the hills mashing /corpse button.<br />
<br />
9. Loading Gate in Cann slot and gating in the middle of a fight when I hit hotkey without looking. Oops.<br />
<br />
10. Being called a &quot;Motherless Gnoll&quot; by one of the Bards in Qeynos after I hit auto attack trying to talk to him. Fixed this one, I have no auto attack key now :) Did it right in front of one of my friends so I got called a motherless gnoll for a while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Man that run from halas sucked.<br />
<br />
This reminds me of one...back when Luclin first opened, I had hit level 11 or 12 or so (This is pre-kunark), and since 2HB weapons were by far the cream of the crop for shaman weaponry at the time (with the barbarian spiritists hammer being the uber of the uber), I decided I wanted to get one. So, I went to Qeynos, and killed that Trumpy Irontoe fella for his head, and proceeded to head out to Kaladim to go get my hammer (which I forget the name of now). Well, this is before anyone on the server could port, so I ran all the way to freeport, took the boat, went to kaladim, turned in the head...and it got eaten.<br />
<br />
Not enough faction.<br />
<br />
So, I gate back to Halas, go to Qeynos again, kill Trumpy Irontoe again, head back to Freeport and take the boat to the Faydwer...this time I got spend some time in crushbone getting myself some faction. Ended up training myself and dying. Pop up back in Halas. I run back to freeport, take the boat to crushbone, loot my corpse, stand up...&quot;Oh, hello Ambassador D'vinn&quot;. Pop up back in Halas. Run to freeport, back to crushbone, loot corpse, kill orcs for a while, then finally head to kaladim and get my new hammer. Gate back to Halas.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, I probably should have gotten bound somewhere not-halas.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
All the time I have been playing, it has been my propensity to try and push my boundries for what I can and cannot solo. After trying a given encounter 3-4 times and dying or being forced to zone, I would hold off, and then try it the next level. And the next. And the next. And the next...until I finally beat it. It slowed down my leveling rate something fierce. My death rate on a per-level basis was really quite obscene.</div></div><hr />

I setup shop opposite the huts and brought up dog dog, buffed him, gave weapons, etc. then invised and went into the hut and targeted a drunk.

Hmm funny i thought....oh..ummm. Switch over and see i had fallen out while riding up. This is where it gets really boneheaded. My only excuse was it was soon after i had woken up and was just finishing the cloak of wisdom quest. <br />
<br />
    Having pally on my 2nd account i log him in and head to pok and the elevator. Wasnt going to petition for a rez since i accomplished that one myself. Get to elevator see corpse. Not letting me drag it off the elevator platform. I ride it up and same thing so i cast rez figure i'll just move off of there quick before anyone uses it. Fell right through for my 2nd death is like 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

In hurry to get to Loio and desiding to take short cut though Cabilist thinking I'll invis up soon as I zone in.  Making the last turn though the arch as pass I a skelly thinking eww lookie a skelly pet..... Made it about 3 more steps before getting Ganked at level 50.... Darn SK Harm Touches.  I would made it if there had not been two of them. LOL  Teach me for thinking Sow Greater the all.<br />

Forgetting to make sure my Jboots were in my first buff slot while pulling wyverns off the cliffs in Cobalt Scares.  That sweet feel of satifaction for resisting 80% of the Drakes AoE.  And the Agony of getting your levitate stripped off.  Get nice long thought as your making that 10k fall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 45 shaman trying to get dorf/dragon faction.  Spent 14 hours straight with a druid friend killing elites at the giant fort in GD.  It is now 2 am my time.  Decide to call it a night, so we run over to the coldain huts near Thurg.  My &quot;friendly&quot; druid told me to get my faction.<br />
<br />
So I target a dorf, hail him, and proceed to say outloud &quot;What is my faction?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
No Reponse.  Repeat ... 3 times.  I then get asked by an &quot;Afterlife&quot; warrior that happened to be sitting there ... &quot;What the hail are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lightbulb goes on, I cast shrink on my druid friend, numerous times, and camped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most embarassing moment was recently ....<br />
<br />
Level 65 shaman, in a group in CT farming FT items.  My significant other had been away for a couple of weeks on business.  To my surprize he logs on and I get a tell of &quot;Hello There !&quot;  <br />
<br />
I then proceed to tell him in very graphic, lurid detail, how our weekend is going to be spent, and (you guessed it), promptly sent it out group say.  <br />
<br />
Not a word was said.  Everything went into slow motion.  The Mt died (he was busy scrolling up to reread my faux pas), the cleric didn't heal, the SK fd'd (only one to live) .... and I died a thousand deaths on the spot.<br />
<br />
That's it !<br />

Gee, if I could count the number of times I've heard this being done in EQ, and MOST of them got promptly posted on the Forums!    :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line on this thread:  If you've never made a horribly embarrasing mistake, I don't believe you.  If you can't laugh at yourself, I feel sorry for you.  If you can't enjoy other people laughing with you while laughing at yourself, I feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
In my EQ career, I remember the first time I killed XXXXXXX.  I remember when my guild helped me get XXXXXX.  But the moments I CHERISH are when I screwed up badly, embarresingly in front of my forgiving friends or when they did it in front of me.  THAT'S one of the things I found the most entertaining.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, The Bear was a very good Shaman.  But he also didn't mind playing (or let's get real, BEING) the buffoon at times.  When I &quot;got flat&quot; or &quot;pelted,&quot; these were moments of celebration in /gu.  Whether it was blithly running by RC, sure I'd make VT or a big white body sailing through the air like a brick off the invis bridge, my deaths were moments of high amusement for my friends.  See the picture in my Magelo profile, it says it all  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Back in beta, early beta, my first char what I tried was high-elf paladin. At level 1 I was jumped by some orc pawn, which was yellow con. Was a big fight, blow was traded for a blow, hit for a hit... And just when the orc was down to 1 pixel of HP and I was down to 3 pixels (and I was happy that I am about to win such a big battle), I accidentally clicked on &quot;Lay on Hands&quot; button...<br />
<br />
You can be assured that I was not happy seeing the orcs HP go through the roof. Orc smacked my paladin, and then walked away, laughing as loud as it could. That was my first battle in EQ for that char, and also the last. Pansy elves... Deleted it and made barbarian warrior.</div></div><hr />

Lol was running through WC and got jumped...like most unsuspecting lowbies.  Well I knew how to get back to EC so I started to run as fast as I could, and was certain I would make it.  When I was 2 steps from the zone I for some reason turned right around and started to walk away from it.  I was going nuts...screaming at the computer, hammering my key board...lol everything I could.  Needless to say I didn't get a second chance at that zone lol.<br />
<br />
My roomate who had gotten me started had a pally in the mid 30's which he was playing at the time.  He heard me yelling and came down to see what way up...and just about fell over from laughing so hard when I told him the damn game was broken, and explained what happened to me.  Lol, that was the first I'd ever heard of fear.<br />

Now, I make a special point to go find Kizden and Dragoon Zytle every time I go near there lol...who's afraid now pos.</div></div><hr />
