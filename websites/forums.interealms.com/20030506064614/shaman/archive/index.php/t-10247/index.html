<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katyane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is not balanced at all. After hunting in elemental planes several weeks, the ratio of elemental armor my guild got is something like this:<br />
<br />
47% Leather<br />
25% Silk<br />
22% Plate<br />
6% Chain<br />
<br />
Out of 32 pieces. Result of pretty much the same as most other guilds.<br />
<br />
Since the models are no drop. No only do the druids in my guild are swiming in elemental armor pool, most of the new drop have actually rotted. However, there are only 2 pieces dropped for the Shamans, Rogues and Rangers to share.<br />
<br />
There are almost no BST in most guild and very few druids. Since leather classes are the least played, I wonder why SoE think their armor should drop almost 50% of the time. Do they know that there are much more rangers rogues and shamans than the leather classes?<br />
<br />
They really need to fix this asap. Plate armor should drop most often followed by chain. Only 6% chain is totally unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thx SoE insulting us more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About time for someone to post about how their guild gets all chain drops and the druids are /reporting shamans for getting too much loot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Brell:<br />
<br />
Leather - 10 drops (45%)<br />
Silk - 7 drops (32%)<br />
Plate - 4 drops (18%)<br />
Chain - 1 drops (5%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on AB:<br />
<br />
Elemental Patterns <br />
Total drops: 67 <br />
<br />
Silk: <br />
Boots 2, Gloves 3, Arms 2, Bracer 11, Head 3 = 21 <br />
<br />
Leather: <br />
Boots 3, Gloves 5, Arms 9, Bracer 5, Head 3 = 25 <br />

Plate: <br />
Boots 4, Gloves 4, Arms 8, Bracer 0, Head 2 = 18 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chain molds drop as often as other molds. Working as intended. ;)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  It's probably because clerics insist that 30+% of the player base is druids and that when the 3k gimp heal came out clerics were screaming that they no longer existed as a class and were all rerolling druids.  So taking that into account they're just matching ratios with what they're told would have been 47% of players being druids, monks and beastlords that never had time to go to Velious to get their armor so are all naked and desperatly needed cloths.<br />
 <br />
  Either that or they took the HoH drop rates and reversed them.  How many peices of skyshrine leather have you seen?  Yeah, 0.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kind of an offtopic question, but what kind of force is required to get the lesser pieces like gloves and boots?  I've heard that there's places in the Elemental planes where a single group can go to get experience and some OK drops but I'm not sure what drops off those lesser, possibly named mobs.<br />
<br />
Just wondering.  Still a couple of fights away from the Elemental planes myself.  Stupid RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So far it seems that any named that drops 2 loots has a chance of dropping patterns/molds.  I dont think any of them are doable with 1 group, none that I have seen atleast.<br />
<br />
I dont feel like digging up the numbers, weve gotton about 4 silk, 4 plate, 3 leather, and finally! the first chain drop (gloves) last night :) grats me!<br />
<br />
All of these have been from the mini bosses in PoWater/PoFire.  All have been bracers, gloves, boots, sleeves.  Assume Helms an drop too but havent seen any yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe its just luck or streaky but the ratios seem to be much better after the patch a week ago.  We have seen a lot more chain since that patch.  In the last 7 days we have gotten:<br />
<br />
9 Chain<br />
8 Leather<br />
6 Plate<br />
12 Silk (6 gloves and 5 bracers)<br />
<br />
Now if they could just change a few silk gloves into Plate items it would all be good.<br />
<br />
Total we are at:<br />
<br />
10 Chain<br />
18 Leather<br />
10 Plate<br />
19 Silk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yea seems to be getting better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lepra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DRo so far:<br />
<br />
Silk 32%<br />
Leather 18%<br />
Chain 32%<br />
Plate 18%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dragonbait</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For Leather you are forgetting Monks... Elemental Leather is the first Quest Armor that is even worth making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beelziod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Our drops are quite different<br />
<br />
Plate     31   42%<br />
Chain    14   19%<br />
Leahter 14   19%<br />
Silk        15   20%<br />
<br />
Beelziod<br />
Eternal Wrath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">even after the patch where people are saying &quot;it's fixed&quot; we're about 1 chain drop to 19 plate silk leather.  we have silk and leather rotting every run now cause no one can use the stuff yet well more than 50% of the chain wearers in the guild have yet to see their first piece</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Exact same situation on Quellious Tharkis.  We are getting tons of plate, silk and leather.  If you cross your fingers you might see one chain drop a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't have exact numbers but we have plenty of chain on Terris<br />
<br />
I have Gloves and bracer<br />
3 or 4 other shaman have arms<br />
1 set of legs<br />
1 helm<br />
2 or 3 other gloves<br />
2 or 3 other bracers<br />
<br />
Rogues have 2 boots, a couple bracers, a couple arms<br />
<br />
Thats 15-20 Pieces of chain<br />
<br />
For us, Plate is rare as hell.<br />
<br />
However leather does drop more than anything else.  We are down to forcing people to loot it.<br />
<br />
I will check logs and get actual numbers for elemental drops tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I´d say its fixed :)<br />
After patch it drops more chain for us than silk now.. :p</div></div><hr />
