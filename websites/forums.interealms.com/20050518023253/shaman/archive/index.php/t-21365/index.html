<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question..If your banned from say Ohh..The sony station eq message board.. Are you banned from game as well...Now granted I suppose if you got banned for excesive profanity or lewd behavior then you should proably get banned from the game..However if you get banned for implying that someone wasnt very bright do you get banned from the game as well?  Basically I got banned, I belive for having a long several post argument...anyways..Please, if you know, let me know...thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if you yourself got banned can't you just try to log on and see if you are or not? *shrug*<br />
<br />
Don't see why they would ban you from the game, message board is a different thing but that's just me assuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah, I cant check till i get home from work..lol..was doing some posting while at work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, they want your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was suspended from the PlanetSide message boards while I was playing that and it did in fact carry over to being suspended from playing the game as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just depends on the severity really.  I think that gangas and appry got banned from the message board in the past week, but they aren't banned from the game (at least, they were supposed to have been banned from the message board).  But, I know that a while back around GoD release time, Gurck got banned after saying something on the message board and he was suspended for a week from playing Eq.  So, it really just depends on what you say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im good..whew..close one..lol..guess the Dev guys dont have a sense of humor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">gurck? banned from something? this comes as a huge shock to me [/sarcasm]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">guess the Dev guys dont have a sense of humor<br />
<br />
I don't mind them suspending/banning rude and nasty folks nearly as much as I mind them closing and/or deleting threads that actually have a valid discussion going in.<br />

/salute Brenlo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nah, I got banned for implying that sony employed a pack of trained dyslexic monkeys to do theyre dev work..sad, but true.  As for Brenlo..He makes a good puppet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh no they only use the monkeys because the gerbils gave up. :p LOL all kidding aside, I really don't like it when threads are locked for having a few stupid/rude posts in the midst of what is actually a good discussion. Easier to simply delete those idiotic posts if they contribute nothing, eh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Exactly, Tordail.</div></div><hr />
