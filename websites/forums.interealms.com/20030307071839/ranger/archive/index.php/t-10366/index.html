<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tseramed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just read that rangers are going to get the circle of summer &amp; circle of winter spells in the Planes of Power expansion.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Verant would give rangers these two spells in lieu of something more USEFUL, such a better strength buff, or a dexterity or stamina buff, or a self-gate to the Karanas, or animal friendship, or maybe even something more unique!<br />
<br />
I don't see many instances at all when a ranger is going to be doing group resist buffs.  I can only see ever really buffing myself with resists, and Resist Fire/Cold already gives almost the same amount of resist for much less mana.<br />
<br />
Look at this:<br />
<br />
Circle of Summer:  150 mana for group +45 resist fire<br />
Resist Fire:  50 mana for self-only +40 resist fire<br />
<br />
Circle of Winter:  150 mana for group +45 resist cold<br />
Resist Cold:  50 mana for self-only +40 resist cold<br />
<br />
That said, will a ranger ever even use these new spells?  I honestly don't think so.  This really sucks, in my opinion, and is nothing short of a slap in the face to rangers, likely due to a decided lack of CREATIVITY.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The impression I've been getting so far is that a lot of PoP will be geared toward 1-2 group encounters instead of full blown raids, so chances are there won't even be a druid present to cast these resists. And besides, what's wrong with a little more versatility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, I like these spells...actually, I like all of the new spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Um...how about having these buffs available for say your Sebilis group if no druid is present?  Fast, easy buffs, good duration.  Group, so not a PITA to cast on each member.  Stuff in Sebilis nukes still, right?  300 mana for +45 CR / FR for your entire group seems pretty cool to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">These spells are welcome additions to our lineup.  For no-druid-present group or raid-prep situations.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're saying they're useless because a druid can do it better?  Why would STR DEX STA buffs be any more useful?  Can't a shaman do those better?  Are you only thinking of the soloing ranger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that the levels 61-65 were only going to be for the Planes of Power zones.  If that's the case, would you be able to case CoW or CoS in Seb?  I hope I am misinformed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is the level increase statement:<br />
<br />
<br />
The level cap will increase to 65. Those levels will have inherent benefits much like previous levels. However, they will not be exactly the same. The rate of advancement in character levels is designed to feel more natural and not take the punishing time commitment required between 51 and 60. We understand the frustration that painfully long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that experience for players. This, combined with the new bonuses for fighting higher level opponents, should make leveling seem less like something that you have to do and more like something that just happens as you play. <br />
<br />
Level advancement is closely tied to Planar Advancement. The systems compliment each other. Planar advancement includes extensions on the Alternate Advancement system, along with new abilities for all classes. Advancing your character is a combination of traditional leveling and advancement through planar abilities. Players who enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people that prefer a combination of level advancement and investment in specific abilities can do that as well. <br />
<br />
That's the basic plan for advancement in Planes of Power. We'll continue to refine and tune the specific details as we go through the remaining six weeks of beta testing. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think that you will be unable to cast spells over level 60 in previous expansion zones.  Out of curiosity, what brought you to that conclusion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Delyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Planar only or not, I like the new spells. <br />
<br />
I can't see what the problem with them could really be...to be quite honest. They seem to be pretty useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">these will actually be nice spells to have around even if they arent usueable half the time.  with the new resist changes resist fire and resist cold just dont help that much and we dont know what the mobs in pop will do.  For seb and velks its useless I agree but great in HoT when you are just doing a 1 or 2 group armor farm plus you never know in pop some good xp spots may have fire/ice casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't understand why Verant would give rangers these two spells<br />
They are upgrades to our current line up. Seems natural to me.<br />
<br />
in lieu of something more USEFUL, such a better strength buff, or a dexterity or stamina buff, or a self-gate to the Karanas, or animal friendship, or maybe even something more unique! <br />
A better STR buff would not be useful to a lot of us,  and rangers have never had dex or stam buffs, that is shaman/beastlord territory. Not sure what you mean by animal friend ship... I assume you mean some sort of charm. I can't think of any zones that have animals that would be low enough level for us to charm that would actualy be useful to experiance with later.<br />
<br />
As for the self ports, I kinda agree, but it doesn't mean that we can't get them just because we get new resist spells. If we don't get them it will because verant doesn't want rangers to have ports.<br />
That said, will a ranger ever even use these new spells? I honestly don't think so. This really sucks, in my opinion, and is nothing short of a slap in the face to rangers, likely due to a decided lack of CREATIVITY.<br />
I am pretty sure they will come in handy now and then yes, I am glad we are getting them. I don't see how getting one of our spell lines upgraded is a slap in the face to rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tseramed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With 5 gazillion druids running around, do you people honestly think we will be casting these at all?  Think about it.<br />
<br />
When soloing, you would *never* cast it.  A threefold mana increase on casting would make it inefficient for an additional five-points of resistance.  Perhaps a better resist self-buff would make more sense, or even Resist Magic would be much better and more useful.<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else, but I really don't want to see rangers become group buffers.  The last thing I want is people to be bugging me about how their buffs are down, which is why I chose a ranger to start with.  My character is a loner and likes to be left alone, like a true ranger the forest is my companion.<br />
<br />
How many HoT raids have you people been on with *no* druids?  I know someone is going to answer &quot;all the time&quot;, but you will by lying and you know it.  Druids are a dime-a-dozen.<br />
<br />
Is there a rule somewhere that says that a dexterity buff is out-of-character for a ranger?  I couldn't think of a more useful buff for a ranger to have, and it makes sense especially since so many of our own spells are proc-based.  So a ranger has the magical prowess to increase his own strength and agility, and to cast all sorts of whack dexterity-based proc-buff spells, and group buffs, but is completely unable to increase his own deftness?<br />
<br />
Flame if you will, it's my personal vision, and I hope Verant reconsiders.  Frankly, you people surprise me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Case in point:<br />
<br />
Last night, Ssra Temple, working 3rd floor key mobs.  NO DRUIDS.  We come up against the boss mob that has a 900 AoE fire spell.  I had to single target everyone and cast Resist Fire.  I sure as hell could have used that then.  Oh yeah, we had 25 people...<br />
<br />
While you are certainly entitled to your opinion, please understand that there are plenty of Rangers out there who WILL be able to use that.  Just because there are tons of druids, does not mean that a particular guild has tons of druids.  I do not think these spells are a waste for Rangers to have.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else, but I really don't want to see rangers become group buffers. The last thing I want is people to be bugging me about how their buffs are down, which is why I chose a ranger to start with. My character is a loner and likes to be left alone, like a true ranger the forest is my companion. <br />
<br />
<br />
You say you are a loner, which is perhaps why you do not see the benefit to the spells.  Certainly, if you think only of soloing, these spells would not seem useful to you.  And I HAVE been on a HoT raid with NO druid present.  I've been at Eejag killings with NO druid present (the monk epic dude you have to fight in the lava).  I've been at Ixblat killings with NO druid present (the cleric epic dude (fire elemental) in Burning Woods).  I can see Ragefire kills or Western Wastes farming happening with NO druid present.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, these spells are a good upgrade and I will use them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can see that they might change some spell scrolls already.  The fact that you have to be level +60whatever means you can't actually scribe them yet.  I probably will start picking up the ones I can find for sale in the Bazaar now before PoP, because I have a strange feeling that the price will shoot up once PoP comes out...  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.  I completely agree.  How about HoT with no druid and no chanter?  Ouch!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tierre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually i've never done HoT without a at least 4 druids. They're are like 500 lvl 51-600 druids on my server, and 1000 30-50. I don't think we need this spell especially 60+. I don't think the raids taht 60+ will do will ever be without druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tseramed, i think you have to grow up and realize that your ranger play style is not everyone's. instead of just thinking about how crappy this is for soloers, step back and realize that there are a lot of rangers that prefer to group and will use these spells quite often.  yes, a ranger is comfortable in the woods, alone with nature.  he or she does not need company.  this doesn't mean a ranger is uncomfortable being around people.  that's just a personal issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Renwin Everfool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Compared to what Rangers could be getting (new Ranger  spells), these are  crap. Just my opinion, of course. Rangers are getting more like Druids, and less like Rangers...this is bad.<br />

The Renjer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Druids may be a dime a dozen, but I know tons of Druids who have gotten sick of their Druid being unwanted and started a new character.  Most Druids I know solo most of the time and play a melee alt on raids.  In my experience Druids have been the class that raids have lacked the most.  I've been on tons of West ToV and North ToV raids without any Druids.  Casting Resist Fire and Resist Cold on every person in NToV is a pain.  I'd have been thrilled to have these spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Since these are group spells, They can be Massive Group Buff right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yup.<br />
<br />
But you can only MGB one of them, either Fire or Cold.  You'd need another Ranger with MGB to MGB the other one.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fardarter Unity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Too many people on this thread expect to get your cake and eat it too. I am very pleased with these spells, SURE some things would be NICE but lets get real here and stop complaining.</div></div><hr />

i really dont think its true ... not with archery and other skills with spell are are but not with skills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Renwin Everfool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">With archery, we are just like Druids...they can't hit anything with arrows either.  We may get a snare  skill called Entrapment. Oh yay! Remember, Druids are the Snaring class, we get it from them. Until SoL, all of our pre-50 spells were Druid spells...other than Feet Like Cat, and a few Vision trick spells. Most post-50 spells were Druid spells. With SoL they added Ranger  spells, from level 9 to level 60. I see no reason to go back to Druid hand-me-downs, ty.<br />

With our defense, if a Druid could dual-weild...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">..they still wouldn't have double attack, weapon selection, or the skill caps we do.<br />
<br />
FYI, we are getting new &quot;ranger&quot; spells in this expansion, an upgraded cop, son, coe, nukes, and proc buff line. Getting a few druid spells makes sense since they are like, one of our parent classes and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have yet to understand why folks dislike rangers getting the circle spells so much. I mean, have you looked at all the spells slated for us right now? My goodness..like 25-30 spells from 61-65. And in exp groups these are awesome spells. My regular exp cleric has to waste mana and time casting CR buffs, unless I do it, which again wastes time and mine kinda sucks anyway. A nice pair of circle buffs dropped onto the group once an hour or so is wonderful. And the chanter casts grm and we are all set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shadowmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think these are great additions...especially with the tuning of the endure/resist line to be lower.  Just seems like an appropriate natural progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ziguld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">its very simple why we got these.  Resist Fire and Resist Cold got upgraded and these are the next upgrades.  They are useful, just not in the giant raid context.<br />
<br />
Why did we get Call of Rathe if main tanks will be using a Dain ring for the 10pt dsheild? Why get Str of Tunare if its not going to stack with our Protection of the Wilds?   Every spell has its uses, be greatful we dont get starfire on top of brushfire thats a case of redundancy</div></div><hr />
