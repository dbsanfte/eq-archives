<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been working very hard to get as many level 4 focus items as I can. Paid a butt loaded of cash for Orante Chain boots and arms for Mana Prev4 and Improved Healing 4. Ran over 200 LDoN missions to get Extended Tormant 4, Burning Affliction 4, and Spell Haste 4.<br />
<br />
I heard the next expansion will increase level cap to 70. Most likely that all these level 4 focus items will be useless for spell L66 to L70.<br />
<br />
Once I feel I have accomplished something, they put something new in the game and makes me an entire newbie all over again. I am getting very tired...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Arghh, thanks for bringing me down. <br />
<br />
Maybe they'll just re-do the lvl limits on the items and IV will go to 70. Hahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">^<br />
<br />
That has about a snowball's chance in hell of happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy schnikes.<br />
<br />
EQ (AP)<br />

And in a related story, a 70 Rogue, 70 Paladin and a 70 Cleric killed King Tormax. <br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Man if 65 trivialed some content (I was thinking NToV), think what 70 will do.  Gotta keep the monthly $12.95 coming in, so why not some more exp grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If each focus level spans 20 levels, why would you assume focus IV only covers 5 levels? Am I correct that Focus level 1 covers spell levels 1-20, Focus level 2 covers spell levels 21-40, Focus level 3 covers spell levels 41-60, and Focus level 4 covers spell levels 60-?.  We just don't know yet, why worry?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">focus 1: 1-20 (20 levels)<br />
focus 2: 21-45 (25 levels)<br />
focus 3: 46-60 (15 levels)<br />
focus 4: 61+ (? levels, maybe 5, maybe more, who knows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh, thanks for the correction.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like how some people get so taken by a rumour. It's a rumour. Someone made it up on the back of a hunch. They haven't put any levels in and neither have they hinted that they might (that I've seen). I'll worry about it when it happens. Until then, I'll enjoy what I have and work towards my next goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would be seriously shocked if they raised the bar 5 more levels.  It took them a span from Kunark to PoP to give us 5 more levels.  I wouldn't expect another level increase before EQ 2 comes out and even then probably not.<br />
BTW the limitations on focus effects can easily be reset.  Those numbers are placed just for consistency of all Effects.  If they intriduced a level 6 to Focus effects they would have to do a lot of serious revamping and retooling and SOE is not well known for going out on a limb to help it's player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To be technical, Focus I goes 1-19, Focus II goes 20-44, Focus III goes 45-60.<br />
<br />
Although of course that is misleading, since Focus III actually  goes 1-60.</div></div><hr />
