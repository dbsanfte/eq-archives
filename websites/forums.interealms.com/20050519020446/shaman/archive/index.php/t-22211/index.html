<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after the poll here that asked about GoD spells, I put a GoD trials group together.  We went to the crematory and did very well.  After we killed the 4 named, we invised and started heading to the NPC.  I was conning every mob, and none saw invis, but 3 mobs attacked myself and the druid.  ***!?!  On the way there, at the Barindu zoneline, a mob saw through the innate camo on the druid and killed him.  So my first question is, has anyone else noticed a problem with druid innate camo, or have an explanation?<br />
2nd question:  If we had succored to the zone in after killing the named,  would it have respawned (about 2 hours after we started)? Any other ideas on how to do this trial with a War/Shm/Enc/Druid/Nec/Clr?<br />
We had no problems at all with this trial.  Mostly single pulls, no trouble landing slows or dmg or mezzes.  Kinda sucks we failed (some of us are brain dead and didnt bind closer  :rolleyes: ) right there at the end.  It was the first time in that trial for any of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to play it safe and are actually trying to pass the trial for flag purposes, I'd advise against invising past anything unless you are almost out of time for some reason.  At least as I remember them, mobs in this trial aren't as hard as say, Lair, so in my opinion it's worth playing it safe and just clearing everything on the way to where you need to go.  <br />
<br />
With the group you listed, you should have no problems whatsoever beating this trial, my warrior tanked it and he is pretty weak (8khp buffed, 25AA) - although I can't give any info on the actual flag part of the trial, as I've only farmed this one for named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After killing the four ghosts you have a long way to reach the hail mob against a timer, it was 30 minutes to reach the blue crystal room then 15 minutes to hail and hand in. <br />
This seemed rather short, don't know if revamp have changed any timers since I did it, so we arranged a short cut. We first brought the last ghost with us as we had a second tank this would have worked I think but a mob fell off a ledge into water with loads of mates that summoned the party one by one.<br />
Second try we killed three ghosts then killed our SK in the ghost room rezzed him but he left an item on corpse, he then ran through the dungeon Feigning on the way and did the hail and hand in with Harmshield up. He left an item on corpse so if he failed the run a rez and summons meant he could try again.<br />
Another way is to fight to the hail mob first he shouldnt be there if you haven't killed the four ghosts corpse in that room apart from necro who stays FD at the back. The rest then go kill the ghosts, while necro watches tv or something, once last ghost dead EE rez the cleric and rez the rest of your party and wait for the wisps to spawn the hail mob.<br />
Also if you just kill the four ghosts with out rez/fd tricks an evac back to start is quicker than fighting back through the dungeon.<br />
Other ways that are supposed to work rogue hide/sneak hand in, mage CoTH or leave two in furnace room with last ghost while other four fight back and clear Blue cyrstal room then kill the last ghost</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you explain that a little more in detail please?<br />
<br />
The necro FD's in the room where the hail mob eventually spawns (is that the Blue Crystal room?), I understand that much.<br />
<br />
Then the rest of the party moves (clearing) to the room with the ghosts, and kills them all to spawn the hail mob?<br />
<br />
Then how does the necro EE the cleric?<br />
Did everyone leave a 1-item corpse back with the necro?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a link to a strat discussion on the first 4 trials?  I have VXed &amp; Tipt, but don't have any of the earlier ones completed, and Rondo isn't a prospect for me.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Probably is implying that they die wherever (in zone), necro summons all corpses and rezzes cleric, cleric rezzes the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah actually I have done this one for flag, I forgot  :o <br />
<br />
What we did was fight to the blue crystal room first, while collecting the skulls along the way, then leave our mage in a safe spot in that room.  After that we fought to the furnace room, killed the four ghosts, then the mage CoHed everyone back to blue crystal room to clear all the trash so we could turn in the skulls.  This method is pretty useful if not everyone in the group needs the flag, because once crystal room is cleared, the group members who already have flag can leave expedition and they will get punted to Barindu quickly, where they can invite whoever else needs the flag to group and expedition, then mage can coh them also before skull turnin (although it might not be necessary to CoH them to turnin room...perhaps being in the group and the expedition and in zone is enough, I haven't tried that to see if you can get flag while sitting at zi)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Either way I suppose but I think easiest/cheapest way would be to leave one item corpses in blue crystal room go and go kill ghosts leaving necro behind. When last ghost is dead EE rez cleric the cleric rezzes rest of the party and you are all waiting in the blue crystal room then.<br />
Save on coffins for summon at least.<br />
I have finished this twice both times we made the SK do the long run the other ways are just what was suggested here<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thank you Serbitar &amp; Samanna &amp; Spikehammer!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the very best and easiest way is to just have a rogue loot the skulls. i'm sorry to say &quot;bring a rogue&quot; is the answer, but it just is. you avoid having to even fight back at all, rogue just hits nimble and does turn in, runs 4 feet away and escapes. he can sos the whole way there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After killing the four ghosts you have a long way to reach the hail mob against a timer, it was 30 minutes to reach the blue crystal room then 15 minutes to hail and hand in. <br />
<br />
I think the timer is bugged.   My group killed the 4 ghosts and then ran back invis/fighting to the blue crystal room.  We got almost to the room before the last wisp got to the room and we saw the first emote.  About 10 minutes later we are staring at the named in the crystal room and started to pull.  After we killed the very first mob in the room he poofed!  We had about 15 minutes left on the timer so I think its either broken, or a GM was laughing at us.<br />
<br />
I like the mage idea might have to try that.</div></div><hr />
