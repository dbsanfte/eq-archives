<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a problem logging on yesterday?   My trader was logged on from the day before but none of our other accounts could log on yesterday from about 3 PM CST till giving up around 9:30.  My wife and I have 5 accounts between us ... so outside of our traderbot ... we could not get on any one of 3 servers.   In checking on a few other boards, some have reported the same issue.   <br />
<br />
Maybe it's a sign of the times, or just my mood in general with Sony, but in some respects I didn't care and spent the time doing non-PC stuff (gasp!) like watching TV/tooling around the house.   On the other hand, this appeared to be a planned situation by Sony so they could doing early setup for this patch.   This smells like more of their poor CS management ... at least they could have updated the server status sites.   <br />
<br />
Sigh ... I guess we are all just mindless autopay drones to this company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alot of people in my group of friends got booted last night and where unable to log back on while others where fine.  Maybe it was some sort of routing issue somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the northwest area (oregon/washington) there was a MASSIVE thunder/lightning storm last afternoon. Coincidentally I tried to log on before the storm and it worked flawlessly, but when I tried to log in later, during the storm, it couldn't connect. and it couldn't connect for the rest of the day. I think the storm might have damaged a router somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;  --- Portland.  That was the nicest thunderstorm I've been in in years.  Messed up DSL here for a while during storm, but shortly afterwards it was back up.  Didn't try connecting to EQ til around 9pm, worked fine then.<br />
<br />
I love lightning &amp; thunder storms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&lt;---Seattle..nice and overcast and 65..must've been southern Washington</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could get to the server selection screen but would get booted every time I tried to log onto a server.<br />
<br />
I took a nap and got on at about 11pm cst.  It was a good night.  Got flaged for PoV / PoS and got an aa in PoS all in about 3 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay, must have been more local than I thought... I live a little ways southeast of portland, and the windows were shaking, and it set car alarms off. Might have sounded tame in Portland and in the northern parts of washington but it was pretty mean where I was located.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was just a coincidence, but the storm started around 6 or 7pst, and by 8pst I could no longer connect to the EQ server. All of the rest of my internet functioned perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;-- Back side of Ft. Lewis. I was at McChord. I heard the thunder and, after a long pause, saw the lightnight. But other than about 10 minutes of glorious sunshine AND rain AND snow AND hail (yes ALL at the SAME time), nothing unusual happened.<br />
<br />
I'm roughly 1 hr S. of Seattle, and 2.5 hr N. or Portland. (NOT exceeding the speed limit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;--- Alaska, and you guys' storm screwed me up until about 2pm yesterday...</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a speed limit betwixt Portland and Seattle?  Judging from all the cars that zipped past me (both ways!) yesterday, that limit must be honored more in the breach than the observance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speed limit is 70mph just outside the cities I think, at least it is on I-90 ... not sure about I-5</div></div><hr />
