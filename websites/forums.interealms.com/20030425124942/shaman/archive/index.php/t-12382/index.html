<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all,<br />
<br />
I have been told that PoG is a good place to solo for a 58 shaman.  I have a buddy who wants to tag along (62 Rogue).  He only wants to go if the faction hits don't mess up his HoT faction.  I have no idea and have never been there yet.  I also have been told that the loot is better than Seb Necro.  Any comments on PoG would be great.  I think you get to it off of WW but I am not even sure of that.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoG will mess up 4 factions.  None of which affect HoT, which is in the Temple of Veeshan.  3 of the 4 factions are found in Felwithe and Kelethin.  They might be elsewhere, but not sure.  They can be raised.  The 4th is PoG only and can not be raised.<br />
<br />
I think 3 are: Clerics, Paladins and something else.  All elf related.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinvas Dragntayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A cleric in my guild is KoS to his home town now after going to PoG. Also, druids and rangers cant fight in PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoG is an excellent place for soloing for cash gems, spells, and gear. Of the 4 factions that are lowered for killinig in PoG, none are very important for a shaman unless you plan on going to felwithe or kelethin, which I don't see why you would bother with bazaar, and PoK now. <br />
<br />
I started soloing in PoG at 52 or 53, which is a bit lower than normal, but I had very twinked gear, cleric buffs, and kei. I would reccomend it for any shaman to try at least once.  With the zone-tracking pogs gone, that place is almost trivial now. When I first went there raiding with my monk that place was hell. CR's were the suck.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to your question. No, you will not harm HoT faction in anyway by killing there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as they're done with their epics it shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Exceptions are the Elven cultural smiths, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">from what some rangers/ druids have told me if you lose faction after doing some of the quests inside PoG you will loose the ability to use the item...<br />
<br />
could just be heresay, but i wouldnt doubt it.<br />
<br />
and the plat you make there is very nice, almost every mob drops a gem or plat item, if not a BD or diamond. plus the chance for armor drops.  couple hours can net you a nice chunk of change if you can kill them at a decent rate. <br />
<br />
nice part is most the mobs you'll wanna look for to get shammy gear spawn near the inzone and hardly spawn across the river where the nasty stuff starts spawnin.</div></div><hr />
