<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone replied to a post i made in the &quot;best belt&quot; thread and I didn't want to hijack that thread with my reply...<br />
<br />
hehe i guess you got 60th by exploring new areas/dungeons constantly instead of sitting in one camp and xping over and over <br />
<br />
actually thats true.  yes, i exp'ed in the same spot at times, like sebilis bridge area or karnor's entrance, but that was only when i needed something easy to do...<br />
<br />
i've always had a distaste for the regular exp-grind locations.  prekunark, i avoided solb and guk, instead choosing to hunt in kedge keep (since there really wasn't anything else...).<br />
<br />
after kunark, my regular group explored all the kunark dungeons.  we hit chardok, howling stones, and city of mist when people were doing the karnors-&gt;sebilis route.  hell, we were doing the hole when it was introduced, though not part of kunark specifically.  i was 56 when velious came out, and i'd say that 85% of my experience gained between 50 and 56 was gained in those &quot;other&quot; dungeons.  hell, i didn't even have a sebilis key until 54, and never got invited to groups there until 56-57.<br />
<br />
when velious came out, my regular group had all but quit already.  but the guild i was in explored everything.  we exped in dragon necropolis and siren's grotto.  we were doing velketor's before anyone had killed the giant himself and were frequently the only people in the zone.  so yea though i got the rest of my levels to 60 in part from the &quot;normal&quot; exp grind locations (DN, Velk) in velious, i did so quite a while before people were really going to those places.<br />
<br />
ironically, almost all my 56-58 solo exp was in solb at the stone spider :).<br />
<br />
i've always been more interested in having fun and doing things that people think are impossible... such as killing phinigel atropos with one group and no cleric or enchanter.  doing fire giants with a monk at level 55.  doing a fear breakin with 5 people - no enchanter or cleric (west wall of course).  doing dragon necropolis' paebala area with no enchanter or cleric... er wait, doing just about EVERYTHING a single group can do - without enchanter or cleric :).</div></div><hr />
