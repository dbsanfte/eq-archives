<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tiorpat Tornwing drops the sceptre for the breastplate.<br />
<br />
From discussions I've had its a rare drop and its also confirmed to drop from Velitorkin, which is a raid encounter for most.<br />
<br />
For casual players Tiorpat represents a means of gaining the sceptre with anywhere from 1 to 2 groups pre ele gear.  It is a random script at the statue in Ruined City of Dranik and when the script is live zone wide dialogue will ensue.<br />
<br />
Tiorpat's drop is confirmed as I currently have the sceptre banked...just waiting to raise faction from indifferent then I'll post stats if someone already hasn't</div></div><hr />

Spire control shards dropped from a Bazu on left wall, didn't drop anything else at the time though.  I've gotten lock of Chimeara Mane from Chimeara's in WoS, and Map of old Kuua dropped from a named in WoS (Ferran) as well on left wall.... I hope that helps some<br />

<br />
Looking at the ranger arms they have 110 hp/mana &amp; 2 focus effects...we can dream too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How do you trigger the Tiormat event? I had a group at Benches for over 8 hours with him up and we could never trigger the event. He and the sympathizers/whatever were targetable, but we could not cast on them and they did not aggro us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I've managed to get my faction from Scowling to Threatening.  Looks like I have a long ways to go :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bethiana we had it pop on top of us so still a little fuzzy on it.<br />
<br />
From what information I've gathered there are 2 different kinds of dragorns created during the script, Red and Blue, one type is kos and the other is not.<br />
<br />
The script entails Tornwing wanting to fight the muramites even if it means dying, and those that wish to aid him are the ones he will call to his side during the fight.<br />
<br />
We simply killed those that were kos and would assist him and then pulled him and killed him solo.  We didn't actually hail anything or go through a script process.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure if the event has an active timer...ie if you don't engage during a set period it wont activate, etc.<br />
<br />
I'll check in with guildies to see if anyone did anything unusual and post back when I get the info as soon as I can, as these quest represent near ele quality loot with the new foci affects on them so I'm sure alot would like the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you for the information! That spawn had us baffled. We found no strange MoBs to aid in the triggering, and the only Mobs up were the non-KoS blue Dragorns. So maybe it was bugged or someone blew the script? We noticed he had three or four dialogues. I'll try and gather more information as I'm able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think this event was 'fixed' in the alst patch...  Prior to it, you could just pull a path through the aggro ones and then kill him.  Since then, the reds, while still kos, will only engage for a short while, then run back to the named.<br />
<br />
I've heard that the blue ones that respond to Tiorpat (Patriot, get it? ;)) become KoS and you off them one by one to eventually trigger him, but I haven't had a chance since reading this to try it to confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Samanna, further down in the rangers glade thread there is another post which lists which nameds in which zones drop the rares for the first set of quests.

Oh, I thought all the question marks meant he was guessing. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From what you saw it sounds like a group was hunting there and killed the the kos dragorns to either continue to hunt or to engage him and either failed in that attempt or never even tried him.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't surprise me that once you kill the kos mobs you would be on a timer, and if you fail in killing him then the event is blown...it would be consistent with past SoE scripts.<br />
<br />
The script does depop however and then will re trigger at a later time unless they've changed it.  It might be a good idea to get a head count of the kos mobs and have that info so that a tracker can see if the event is up without bothering a group at the statue every time as well.<br />
<br />
Tonight was game 6 of the ALCS so I didn't play tonight, but I will get the info...it just might have to wait till after tomorrow night  Red Sox &gt; EQ~</div></div><hr />

This was also in the Ranger's Glade thread.  So it looks like, as with ornate, many of the effects may be the same for a particular piece in a particular class-group.<br />
<br />
Has anyone actually gotten the quest text from the quest-giver?  Do we really need the exact same materials that a ranger (or rogue) does?  I know that the pieces are different for the monk (and assuming druid and bst) quests.  I guess it would make sense to break it out into silk, chain, plate, leather again and have each group require the same pieces, I just wanted to make sure.</div></div><hr />

There are two types of quest armors apparently, a tier 1 and a tier 2. The armor listed for shaman here is tier 1 whereas the one mentioned for clerics is their tier 2 armor. Shaman tier 2 will probably have a similar effect on it.</div></div><hr />

I almost think it's in response to some of our healing woes, namely that if we can't land slow asap, we'll never catch up on the healing.

Perhaps those of you who have completed pieces could show the piece, and explain exactly what quest items were required and where you got them. Samannas list is more confusing than helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">samanna's site looks pretty clear to me. not sure how much more spoonfeeding you need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Nadanog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Is it really productive to become insulting? Spoonfeeding? I'm sure you did both epic 1.0 and 1.5 without referring to the walk-thru's that 'spoonfeed' you the quests step-by-step, right?<br />
<br />
All I am asking is that when people post &quot;I got the spritkin mittens!&quot;  you explain what drops it required, where they dropped, and who you hand them in to, and any other information that might cause a hiccup in the quest.<br />
<br />
There are numerous problems with the allakhazam walkthru's. Their answer for the location for 90% of the items is &quot;various named in The Ruined City of Dranik and the Wall of Slaughter&quot; which is woefully misleading and incomplete. The items only drop off specific named mobs in most cases, not merely random drops off any named mobs.<br />
<br />
Also Allakhazam's loads a HUGE ammount of spyware and tracking cookies which can only be removed afterward, not blocked. I try not to ever go to that site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">And you can't glean that info clearly from http://samanna.net/gear/oowquested.shtml ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just FYI but Dennman was active in solving 1.5 and is a current poster in the thread which is solving 2.0 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23946)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">you know what's insulting is calling samanna's site &quot;more confusing than helpful&quot;. <br />
<br />
all the info you need is in the link of the first post and samanna's site. it seems like everyone else could figure out what to do except you. yes it would be possible for someone to put ALL the information in one page, pics of the NPC, loc, quest text, lucy links, specially marked in-game maps, how hard the mobs hit...but that's spoonfeeding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">This inormation is probably somewhere else, but here are 4 simple collect quests to raise Dranik Loyalist faction -<br />
<br />
Thin Out the Murkgliders (NC)		<br />
<br />
Gorvoroth [+1546, -524]<br />
<br />
Bring him one Seeping Murkglider Fluid (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55835).<br />
<br />
Collect Feran Skulls (WoS)			<br />
<br />
Jarekiv [-1265, +195]<br />
<br />
Bring him A Feran Skull (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36558). NO DROP<br />
<br />
Retrieve the Insignia Crests (WoS)		<br />
<br />
Verow  [+1364,-240]<br />
<br />
Give him A Stolen Dragorn Clan Insignia (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36560). NO DROP<br />
<br />
Have a Heart (DS)				<br />
<br />
Vorskahn  [+1665, -1515]<br />
<br />
Give him one Kyv Heart (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=55801).<br />
<br />
As of Jan. 15, 2005 you can do turn in with ANY faction to recieve the quest but most of the posts on Allakhazam.com state that the faction hits are small so don't pay a lot for the droppable items.<br />
<br />
These quests were found on Alla but I gave the super simple version here.  Hope that this helps out.</div></div><hr />
