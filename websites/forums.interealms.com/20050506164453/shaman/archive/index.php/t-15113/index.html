<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was bored today and made some hotkeys.  I tried to make a hotkey that does something like this:<br />
<br />
/tt &lt;---HASTE---&gt; inc to YOU<br />
/pause 2<br />
/active my ornate bp<br />
<br />
However, I cannot figure out how (or if it is even possible) to activate an item in a hotkey.  I was thinking maybe i could put a straight link to my bp in slot nine (just click and drag) and then have a link in the slot ten hotkey that activates the slot nine hotkey.  Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to do this and no one in my guild seems to know, either.<br />
<br />
I figured out I could ghetto-rig it by assigning one button (my 0 button for example) to active both hotkeys 9 and 10 (changed under options -&gt; keyboard -&gt; macros).  This works, but I don't really want to do this because I need all 10 of my hotkeys in my first hotkey bank (the haste macro would go in like bank 4).<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to do this, or has a link to a list of all the possible hotkey commands and syntaxes, that'd be great.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
