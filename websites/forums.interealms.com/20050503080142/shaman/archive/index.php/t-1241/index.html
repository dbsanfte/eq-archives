<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been looking at other shamans equipment profiles and I have a couple of questions. Could someone please tell me where the earring of twisted leaves and the key ring comes from? I had heard they where going to put a key chain in the game but I did not think they had done it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the key ring you are referring to is a Magelo-specific tool that organizes a 'toons keys. There is no keyring in game yet - although it has been talked about quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the earring - try Alakazams (sp??) website??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Earring of twisted leaves comes from Chardok.<br />
<br />
the keyring is a magelo feature only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew Trolls where dumb but I didnt think I could have missed that entering the game:) <br />
<br />
I am at level 52 right now so Chardok is in the near future.</div></div><hr />
