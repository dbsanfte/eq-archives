<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Musicandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heres my question:<br />
<br />
Qvic arms have the effect discordant healing, a 45% increase, which according to lucy is fully effective to lvl 65.  <br />
<br />
So, if I cast Yoppa's Mending (a lvl 68 spell), what is the actual % applied to the heal?<br />
<br />
Im trying to determine whether or not I should wear qvic arms, or the chailak hide mask, which has &quot;favor of the pious&quot; a 35% heal increase with an effective lvl of 70.<br />
<br />
Id like to see some actual stats, if such an animal exists, not just opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD Focus to Level 68<br />
Discordant Healing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5108&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Mending - Level 68 - 145%<br />
Ancient: Wilslik's Mending - Level 70 - (0.45)(0.1)=0.045 per level, so 0.45-0.09=0.36 - 136%<br />
<br />
Or just use Shaman Healing (http://12.99.5.43/temp/Shaman%20Healing.asp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I believe they reduced the nerf to 5% a level, not 10%, Jkana.  If I'm right (can anyone confirm?  did they move it back up to 10%?), then it would be:<br />
<br />
Level 70- level 68 focus = 2 level spread.<br />
2 x 5% decrease = 10% decrease.<br />
45% focus x (100%-10% decrease) = .45 x .9 = 40.5% total max focus.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.--either way, it's better with the old focus for a level 70 spell.  It's definitely better to use the discordant healing focus for Yoppa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to lucy they can set the scaling per spells. So some may scale 5% per level and others may scale 10% per level.<br />
<br />
Discordant healing is still set at 10% per level. Quickening of mithaniel on the other hand shows 5% per level http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3533&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough that means that quickening of mithaniel is better than any of the new focus's even on level 70 spells. Loosing 5% per level means it's 25.5% on a level 70 spell and the best new focus is only 23%.<br />
<br />
If you actually have both you can just turn focus effect msgs back on and see which one gets activated but it should be the arms.</div></div><hr />

It works up to 68, after that it decreases by 10% per level. Simple. At 68 it still gives 45%. I don't see why people have so much issue understanding it.</div></div><hr />

True. However, Quickening of Mithaniel is a Beneficial Spell Haste effect, while Discordant Healing is an increase in direct healing potency. So what are we comparing here? <br />
You can have both effect any of our direct non-cheals (Tnarg's, Daluda's, Yoppa's, Wislik's) on the same cast...<br />
<br />
Discordant Healing... It works up to 68, after that it decreases by 10% per level. Simple. At 68 it still gives 45%. I don't see why people have so much issue understanding it.<br />
Yes. 45% max, or approx 22.5% on average (probably more like 23, with a 1 to 45 range, but I don't feel like recalculating all that crap for half of a percent variance).<br />
<br />
On Ancient Wislik's Mending (L70), this would scale down by 9%, to 36% max or 18% on average. I'll have to add that spell to my page.<br />
<br />
All of the healing focuses affecting amount healed with a direct heal scale down 10% per level over thier stated cap per Lucy as of like 30 seconds ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Calculations made, still updating the page.<br />
<br />
Here's the breakdown:<br />
<br />
On Yoppa's (L68), IH5 is better than IH4 but not as good as Marr's Gift or Blessing, or Blessed or Discordant Healing.<br />
<br />
On Wislik's (L70), IH5 is better than IH4 and Marr's Gift, but not as good as Marr's Blessing, or Blessed or Discordant Healing.<br />
<br />
As of right now, anyway. So don't throw out your Time/GoD focus gear just yet... :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Dear God, now I have to figure in Favor of the Pious, too? BAH! Am I missing any others?<br />
<br />
You know what? I'm not gonna recode all that crap. I'll just use an iframe to present (gasp) excel saved as html. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

I know what both effects are. I was only mentioning them to show the different scaling level's lucy is showing. Thats all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, the table looks reasonable (since I've seen 3 k heals with yoppa, DH and HAM2) - but: The in-game description on DH still says level cap is 65.  Odd that it is still fully effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alot of the descriptions in game are out of date, expect an emergency 12hour patch to get this corrected. &lt;G&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The description on the effect on Boots of the Wind, a VT drop is still wrong.  If you believed what you read in game, you'd get it for it's 20% beneficial preservation and feel shafted (maybe elated) that it really effects detrimental 20%.</div></div><hr />
