<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">has any shaman tried to solo veeshan's peak ?<br />
im thinking of getting a key, just to go fart around up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes I've solo'd in VP before.  I've pretty much just stuck to the entrance mobs as I've found I can kill the 2 racners' and the GW before respawn (chewing/medding in between).  Keep gate up when you engage the GW, incase it's one of the &quot;super worms&quot;.  They fear and are just downright mean.  The very first GW I killed inside dropped Pox for me, but nothing really good since.  Not bad experience.  Peaceful hunting though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have solo'd in VP before, mobs aren't all that difficult.  hit for 530 max, double attack.  Pull with Malos, slap a slow on and away you go.  Stack some dots, quies self and they are easy kills.  Once slowed they are way gimp kills. <br />
<br />
They have kunark atk speed, so once slowed you have plenty of time to sit down and mem spells between attacks.  Quiesence pretty much keep up with the damage.  GW's have 180 fire breath, but I resist most of it.  Mobs like to run when low (20%)<br />
<br />
Occasionally you get a super tough GW (regen super fast and/or hit for 1500 and/or dispels buffs with it's AoE), in which case try VP/Root it and gate out, come back after next patch or get a couple of melee buddies.  I think I could probably solo a 1500 hitter if it didn't have any other abilities - I have maxed defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can actually solo suprisingly far into VP.  everything in there is one groupable now too.</div></div><hr />
