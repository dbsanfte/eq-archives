<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any guesses as to what every spell in the game was changed from &quot; unknown 181 to # &quot; ?  <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2004-04-28%2011:05:48<br />
 <br />
at least i know how many spells there are in the game 4898 .  (thats alot of spells)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe something along the lines of player cast?<br />
<br />
Or are NPC spells in that list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It actually states &quot;Changed Unknown181 from to 2&quot;<br />

  If you notice the &quot;from&quot; comment you can infer that this is a completely new entry to all spells.  Lucy doesn't know what this particular line of information is meant to do as it just showed up.  Currently they seem to be listing it on the main page of the spell under the heading &quot;category&quot;<br />
<br />
  having shown up on all spells in game (player, non player and GM spells) I can't see too many trends.  PC spells are positive numbers, and NPC spells and GM spells are primarily -99.<br />

  I would venture that THOSE explain the number quite well.  Barring that, I also see that most numbers are allocated to a specific class (class spells have a wide range of numbers, but I haven't found any number shared across classes on spells yet).  It might be a new way to limit which spells NPCs with a class can cast (like, maybe to get the Shaman mobs in Earth to quit using Balance of Nihil all the time on my tanks).</div></div><hr />
