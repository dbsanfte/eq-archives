<br />
To bad the druids are not level 58+. Typically we do Vindi with 3 or 4 clerics in the rotation (or sub a 58+ druid). I always recommend to start the rotation quick (3sec) and end it quick (3sec). Have the highest level cleric land the first CH. Have your 57- druids spam quick heals until the chain is set.<br />
<br />
I never need to wear resist gear for Vindi. But I'm not tank'n him either. I typically see him pulled outside the arena to the nooks. Ohh btw my main is a 62 Cleric if it matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;You should have the numbers, hope the DPS is there. &quot;<br />
<br />
I would agree that DPS might be a problem.  Hopefully you can get him killed before your clerics run out of mana.  Not sure many of those low 50 chars are going to do much to Vindi.<br />
<br />
You'd probably do better with a couple 58+ monks and rogues.<br />
<br />
But hey, you'll never know where you are at unless you try.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The attempts I've been on pulled him down the ramps outside of the arena and fight him in one of those corners.  56 and 54 lvl monks are kinda low to be pulling Vindi though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">clear kallis and his friends and pull him at icewall. You will get 2 giants as adds. (Vindis pets). Put 2 tanks on them and grab them as first targets OR debuff them to your best and root park them (Tash malo etc)<br />
Best bet is to use a ranger pulling Vindi using WS as it gives your heal chain time to set up.<br />
Vindi is NOT slowable so a bard near your mt should provide some utility (hint hint :D ) <br />
<br />
Other lil thingy : Vindi is ALLERGIC to GB with a vengeance. So be careful with this spell. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your chanter can DC, you can also try to tank vindi with a named DC pet, Klaggan Iceshard for example, I think he was the one that we used once. No players went to melee at any point, giant had high hps to keep up well with cheal chain. And looks like you got somewhat nicely ranged power so its worth considering...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Easist, but least Archery friendly way to fight him is to corner him.  Do this by shrinking your warriors so that hey can back him into the corner with everyone else pushing vindi into the corner.  Normally I see the corners in the area below the ramps on the left or right side used for this.<br />
<br />
The pull will bring his 2 guards.  I'm not exactly sure how monks split this pull, mostly by warping I think.  Vindi will not stand over an FD monk waiting to be split  He and his guards will immediately run back to their spawn point.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the cheal timing is on him, but just 3 clerics isnt much room for error.  It'd be nice to have another or a 58 druid at least.<br />
<br />
Spam heal (everyone including hybrids) tank on engage, if the clerics get the cheal rotation on and stand the tank up, your gtg.  Then its just a matter of positioning and a race against cleric mana and Vindi's life.  Maximize the clerics mana of course w/ bards, mod rods, KEI, Beastlord mana buff, necros, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd probably recommend that pets not be summoned until the fight is engaged.  I've seen some very odd aggro by pets attacking vindi even before he's hit anyone.  Oh and Vindi has proximity aggro.  Everyone except the MT stands at the edge of melee range.  GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah dps mite be a problem, having only a couple of high warriors would hurt because of it, so make sure ya rangers use weaponshield.</div></div><hr />

A bit over 3 groups. Notice I removed everybody below 56, because they are not much help. Vindi is RED at 61. You *need* those levels in order to do good DPS, not cause too much aggro, have a decent mana supply and higher end spell selection. In my opinion anyone below 54 would be nothing but a burden at a raid like this.. unfortunate but probably true. The giants would keep killing them over and over, or they'd require massive heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeaenOnPovar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the tips.  Actually, a whole bunch more people showed up that did not sign up on the raid, including 2 clerics.  I think we could have taken him, but another guild beat us to it by about 20 minutes.  /wave Elwin  ;-)  I am sure we will get another shot someday, and it was good to see that kind of turnout.  The best turnout the guild has ever had in fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't worry Teaen, Vindi respawns every 8 hours or so-- plenty of him to go around.<br />
<br />
This is what we do for him, to the best of my memory:<br />
<br />
Put the raid in the corner closest to the  Arena right ramp-- but where you can't see the ramp itself.  It's just past the see-invis giants entrance, to the right.  This is so your pullers have room to work  for splitting Vindi's pets from Vindi himself.  Pull Arena Right clear, pull any mobs between you and Vindi.  Once that's done, move the raid to the icewall.  Park everyone except the main tank and lead puller on the hill to the right as you enter the icewall area. Shrink the main tank-- unless he's a runt-- and slap your best damage shield on him,  then park him in the corner made by the left entrance and the support beam.  <br />
<br />
Start the CH rotation as soon as Vindi paths near, and have the main tank tag Vindi off the lead puller.  As soon as Vindi is in melee range of the main tank, have the monks and shadow knights step in, take one swing and Vindi, then back out and wait for the main tank to call the attack; you do this to try to keep your clerics off of the rampage list.   After rampage team does their thing, debuff him.  As soon as  the main tank calls attack (generally around 10 seconds of &quot;soloing&quot; Vindi), use whatever offensive discs are appropriate for the encounter for the melees and have the casters go as full burn as they can without getting Vindi love taps.  And pray you can kill him before he kills too many of YOU!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">with C3, spiritual radiance (bst 5hp/mana regen), blessed armor of the risen / PotG (not stacking), mana should be good.<br />
<br />
just make sure your tanks build aggro fast (horrifying visage, imp illusion), to start the dps machines early.<br />
<br />
and if you have one with AE taunt, dont use him as first tank. using AE taunt will get him instant full aggro, good when u have to switch defensive tanks.<br />
<br />
once the war got nuff aggro, get your debuffers land Tash, Malo, Malosini, to make sure DD casters wont get too many resists.<br />
<br />
good luck :)</div></div><hr />
