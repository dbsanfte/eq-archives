<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snookie Pinetar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ugh. I think its 50. But i can't sure. If the NPC's will talk to you regarding the quest you should be ok. But I'm thinking its 50. However I'm probably wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hear everyone telling me that the final turn in for Swiftwind is a min level of 51, so just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't try it until I was 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Streaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want to do it now I would suggest to do a /petition prior to doing turn in and have a gm watch you. Just as a witness if it does not work. That way you can get a reimbursement if it eats it..  I did mine at 52 so that wont help you much there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jmtasu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My friend got hos at 48 a couple weeks ago, so unless its been changed since then it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far the lowest level I've seen with Swiftwind was level 45 (Sphere was MQ'd).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">k im gonna do the turn in today at 48 if it doesn't work im taking it out on you ALL!!!!  :D</div></div><hr />
