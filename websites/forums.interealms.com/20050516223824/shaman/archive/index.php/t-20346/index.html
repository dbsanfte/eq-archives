<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey everyone. i have been getting booted while trying to autoswim in PoK pond near DE vendor and also in SH. i was wondering if anyone else has been having this problem and if so could u please /bug it? or try it and see if it happens please? thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya i had the same problem on my baby berserker.  What your gonna wanna do is just get some duct tape and hold down the left or right turn button.  Swimming in circles wont kick you to server select.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">but this is a /bug that should be bugged to be fixed right? thanks for the tip btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Swim in circles, then hit enter and you should keep swimming in circles after you let go of the movement keys. hit enter again to exit the text entry thing. No duct tape needed! :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm just a few weeks ago, (2-3?) I had my SK swimming in the pool in SH with no problems and he was heading straight into a corner....went from 0 skill to 175 in a few hours of napping :D<br />
Very odd though....one thing I do to help keep the ping up on the servers is join the local trade/auction channel, that way you get a constant stream of info and your server is less likely to crash.</div></div><hr />
