<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I always wanted to post some things about shamans that I thought odd! I'm sure that they have already been discussed to death but I'm bored at work at the moment so figured why not :P.<br />
<br />
Firstly, Jaundiced Bone armour. Whats the deal here as I can never understand Verants reasoning. Shaman are a chain class and Iksars are only limited to not wearing Plate armour. Hence why are Iksars not allowed to wear Jaundiced Bone armour? If the answer is because Jaundiced Bone is plate armour then why is it any shamans can wear it at all? If the answer is just because of class balancing issues then I will not comment further.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the most common race for a shaman is a Barbarian. I cannot for the life of me understand why this is! Now I may be wrong in the following analysis but there are 3 roles for any class. The first in on raids, the second in a group and the third soloing. Lets look at the races in terms of these 3 roles for a shaman.<br />
<br />
FOR RAIDS<br />
Iksars would be the best raid shamans as they have the highest AC (if you use SS armour as a basis due to AC bonus) and innate regen.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres would be the next best with innate regen (for trolls) and the ability to not get stunned in combat (for ogres).<br />
<br />
I would rate Barbarians last as they have no abilities that are beneficial to raids.<br />
<br />
FOR GROUPING<br />
Iksars have the highest Wisdom and innate regen meaning their mana pool will generally always be higher and they will have less downtime in groups<br />
<br />
Trolls also have innate regen so would have minimal downtime.<br />
<br />
Ogres and Barbarians would have no real advantage as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
FOR SOLOING<br />
Trolls have innate regen and can use JBB making them the best soloing shaman.<br />
<br />
Ogres cannot be stunned in combat and can use JBB making them the second best soloers.<br />
<br />
Barbs can use the JBB however Iksars innate regen makes the difference here close at higher lvls.<br />
<br />
THE QUESTION<br />
Seems that Iksars are the best in 2 in out of the 3 roles, Trolls and Ogres are always good and Barbs always come last or equal last. So why is it that Barbarians are the most common Shaman race and the others are uncommon? The only answer I can find is that Barbarians have no faction problems which really aren't that much of a concern at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Well thats my 2cp worth of being a shaman and the puzzles surrounding shamanhood.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking just for myself, I'm a barb because it's the first and only character I have ever really played in EQ.  I figured I needed to start off with better faction while learning the ins and outs of the game.<br />
<br />
The concerns you list above are all very well if you are playing hardcore or starting a shaman with heavy twink, and already know where everything is and how to make faction issues irrelevant. If I was starting over, that's why I'd be a troll or iksar. But for my first ever character, barb was definitely the right choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">FOR RAIDS ... I would rate Barbarians last as they have no abilities that are beneficial to raids. <br />
- Oh I didn't notice that Focus of Spirit is not castable by barbarians. Hey wait, that's a good thing. I won't be a buffwhore anymore on raids! But wait, that's bad, we only have barbarian shamans in guild. :( We are so screwed.<br />
<br />
FOR GROUPING <br />
Iksars have the highest Wisdom and innate regen meaning their mana pool will generally always be higher and they will have less downtime in groups <br />
- Yeah, WIS plays a very crucial and essential role in a shaman's life. Everyone should ditch their AC/HP gear and go WIS all the way baby!<br />
<br />
Ogres and Barbarians would have no real advantage as far as I can see. <br />
- Barbarian shamans suck in groups. They are useless. Not to mention they can do the same exact things as other races, in some cases more (JBB). But you are right, they suck.<br />
<br />
FOR SOLOING  .... bla bla bla<br />
- Psssst, add XP penalties to your equation.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Zorlac,<br />
<br />
I had to respond to a few of your points.<br />
<br />
For Raids<br />
All shamans can cast the same buffs and I am not commenting on shamans effectiveness on a raid as a class. I am commenting on which race would be more beneficial as a shaman on a raid.<br />
<br />
For Grouping<br />
Since Iksars start with a higher Wisdom than a Barbarian (or all the other races for that matter) they can afford to wear more HP/AC gear and less Wisdom gear and still have more/equal mana available to them.<br />
<br />
Once again I am not commenting on Shaman's effectiveness as a class in a group.<br />
<br />
For Soloing<br />
EXP Penalty? Who really cares if it takes you slightly longer to get to 60? Maybe some people do but personally I don't :P<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. almost noone takes lvl 60 into consideration when creating their main character.  Anyone who looks at it as a completely technical equation is probably either a boring (or very technical) person or wont have much fun in the game.<br />
2. Who cares what someone else picked for race? if someone wants to play a barb let them, if someone wants to play an iksar let them, were all shaman.<br />
3. i believe its pretty much decided that there is NO best shaman race, if i knew i could get to lvl 60 in 1 day without lose of gear or anything, id consider different races, but only for coolness factor, not for little nit picky abilities.  Iksars start with the highest wisdom, ogres start with the highest sta, stats really dont matter that much.<br />
4. JB armor is plate cause ALL kunark clicky armor is plate, i know for example that rogue and ranger clicky are both plate.  The only question i wanna know is why our armor is named after a disease that basically means your pee is released throughout your body.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why even respond to this obvious troll?  Was there a point to this, other than to show that you haven't used the search feature?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Asyn,<br />
<br />
I agree with all your points that it really shouldn't matter which race you play as, afterall, its just a game to be enjoyed. I guess I only made this post as this was my first character (Iksar Shaman) and nearly the whole time I was growing up I would constantly get comments saying delete your character and remake it as a Barbarian as they are the best shamans.<br />
<br />
Its even the case that most players that make twink shamans make Barbarian twinks! So I guess the purpose of this post was to ask why so many people make Barbarian shamans when at higher levels it is clearly the least beneficial race for shamans.<br />
<br />
In this post I was hoping to make people question their preconceptions about Barbarin Shamans.<br />

I'm also a bit depressed that as a barb I'm not as valuable on raids or exping.  I guess my guild just takes me along to NTOV because of my good looks and great cyber?<br />
<br />
Asraguard, thank you so much for bring this valuable insight into the boards.  The shaman races are different, who would have thought it?  I guess I'll just restart my 60 barb shaman who was created when few people understood the value of regen, wis was king for shaman and iksars were just a gleam in the developer's eye.<br />

<br />
Jaundicated Bone armor.<br />
<br />
What does this tell the average person? Could it possibly be that the name of the set of armor is trying to indicated the material with which the armor was created?<br />
<br />
Had it ever occured to anyone how exactly one would make chain links with bone?<br />
<br />
Had it ever occured to anyone that it is entirely illogical for Verant to spend resources to creat a different texture just fo the JB armor set?<br />
<br />
Finaly, had it ever occured to anyone that the texture of a set of armor uses has absolutely ZERO relevence to the type of armor in game?<br />
<br />
A few more examples:<br />
<br />
Brown Chitin Protector<br />
Black Chitin Legs<br />
Golden Efreeti Boots<br />
Crystal Chitin ANYTHING<br />
<br />
Verant's &quot;reasoning&quot; was two fold. One is from a RP perspective, that large chunks of hard material would chaffe an Iksar's scales. The other is from a game balance perspective at the Kunark era, as a penalty to the Iksar race for having an innate AC bonus. <br />
<br />
The second reason has since gone out of the window, but the first remains, as well as a balancing issue with the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey Gloriana,<br />
<br />
Let me just re-iterate that this post is not commenting on the usefulness of a shaman on a raid! Only on why the vast majority of shamans in the game are barbarian shamans when the other races have more benefits.<br />
<br />
The post you referred to was interesting so lets see if the population of shamans starts to shift from Barbarians to Trolls. I still have not noticed this occurring though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had played a bard and a cleric when I decided I that I liked healing people, liked bind/gate and liked speedy travel.  Druid was out since there were just too many.  So, I decided to give shaman a whirl.  I knew nothing about shaman except that they could heal and they got SoW early.  I made my decision on race purely on the basis of looks, that's it.  I wanted to be pretty, so I picked a barb.<br />
<br />
Now, that I know so much more..innate regen, snare necklace, JBB, regen, frontal stun...ya know, I'd probably still pick barb...damn, I have a good looking avatar.<br />
<br />
Obviously, being the most powerful shaman is important to you, it's only moderately important to me.   Looking nice in full Wolf Caller's is important to me :p<br />
<br />
PS I was a lazy cann dancer too! Rarely bothered with it HA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Race.... it doesn't matter that much!<br />
<br />
All races make viable and good shamans. Each have their pros and cons. <br />
<br />
I made my lizard shaman because I wanted a iksar. That's all. When I realized that iksars had better regen and AC... I was happy. When I realized that we couldn't use the JBB which everyone else can, I was a bit disappointed, but the fact that I could not use one item would not be a big deal for me.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I didn't make a iksar shaman because I knew he would be useful on raids. Not everyone designs their character around raiding. Granted, my shaman is an alt, as opposed to a main, but when I made my main, a dwarf cleric, I made him because I wanted to be a dwarf. 51 levels later for my cleric, its working out pretty well.<br />
<br />
Why do people make barbarians? Good faction, good newbie zone, and good stats. They are strong, they have lots of stamina, and have lots of wisdom. Maybe they don't matter when you're raiding ToV, but not everyone makes there character keeping that in mind. And that's okay, becuase all races make good shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My views:<br />
<br />
Race does not matter, there is not best race for anything, a well played barbarian can outperform a bad played iksar, troll, or ogre, same goes with every class and race.<br />
<br />
The only reason to care about race is for the min maxxing people, but then again its all trivial.<br />
<br />
Which is better wis for mana or sta for hp? Well my ogre has about 150 of each of those, a lil more wis I think. I can perform just as well as any iksar or barbarian I've been around. AC bonus? doesn't do much good in comparison till the high end unless your an uber twink. Regen? Nice big hefty exp penalty you got there to go along with it, I'll wait till 24 and use the spell thanks :D <br />
<br />
Basically what I&quot;m saying is any race that can be a shaman,can make a great shaman, if they know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
As for the jaundiced Bone armor.. lots of the armors were given to lots of classes that couldn't normally wear that type of armor, until planar loot, for example druids and chain, rangers and plate, rogues and plate, shaman and plate. The plate wearers of course got plate. I think they were just following their trend of high end armors be different and unique from the average armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry to say Asraguard but you are underestimating the power of the JBB.. saying that an Iksar can solo anywhere near as well as a Barbarian without it, or that Iksar are better in groups (where often times you can get 7-8 jbb casts a fight, that's 1800+ dmg in an exp group.. no impact lol)... is completely wrong.  Thee JBB simply has that big an impact.   I originally got a JBB on loan from a friend who decided not to play the game for a while, then when he took it back the impact to my effectiveness both soloing and in groups was tremendous... but I'll agree with you that the JBB has nearly zero impact on raids.  I'm glad that Iksar's now have a &quot;poor man's JBB&quot; (even though you have to be in one of the uberest guilds to get one) in the form of Winterstorm..should help the Ikkies get the AA points alot quicker that can get their hands on one.  42 AC does not make up for being unable to use the JBB.. 142 ac wouldn't, and the extra wisdom has nearly no relevance whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I picked a barbarian because they looked awesome (it was May of '99... so no iksars or felines to choose from).  I liked Trolls, too, so I created one of those at the same time (he became my &quot;play while intoxicated&quot; character- Crab... strangely enough, he doesn't seem to level much... hehe)<br />
<br />
Not only did I not know about racial regen, xp penalties, and any other race consideration (heck, the JBB didn't exist yet) - but I didn't know what those weird &quot;Insects&quot; spells did, had no idea what cannibalize was, didn't know other races could see in the dark, and for the longest time didn't know that the entire world wasn't as sparse as Halas and Everfrost.  :)<br />
<br />
I knew I looked like a bad-ass, could bash things, could heal myself when they bashed me, and could make myself run fast.  Oh, and maybe when I got uber (my version of the end-game at the time) I could get one of those bear hats!!!  Yoo-hoo... Bigguss was born!<br />
<br />
As for why the handbags don't get JB armor... there had to be SOME disadvantage to the innate AC bonus- without that, they're basically non-butt-scratching trolls with better starting zones.  :)  The iksar innate AC bonus in exchange for armor restrictions is a neat idea; and while I believe Verant probably didn't realize that the JBB would be such an important item, it's not the end of the world for the iksars.  It's definitely a disadvantage, and I have to agree with Gazkan that a few AC doesn't make up for the JBB in effectiveness, but there are a number of advantages that bring them pretty close in relative power to the other races.  There had to be some disadvantage, though, considering that they can basically wear equivalent or better armor to other races at every other stage in their careers.<br />
<br />
If I were starting an end-game shaman now I'd choose either ogre (for the HP primarily, unstunnability from the front as a bonus) or troll (snare necklace, regen) - for the true end-game ogre seems the most logical choice.<br />
<br />
Of course, when I chose Bigguss my version of the end game was getting a bear hat!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not gonna bother reading this thread. Trolls and Ogres are the best race because they look the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You forgot PVP, Asragard. In PVP, ogres are on top, as they have slam and they have unstunnability from the front. Then trolls and barbarians are tied, as the trolls have the regen (which isn't quite as important as you might want it to be in a pitched fight, but which is better than nothing) while barbarians have no issues with their resists and more 'neutral' territory. And then finally there are the iksars, who are universally loathed, and have no ability to interrupt their opponent's casting with the slam attack, which is somewhat key when fighting primarily casters. Iksar; clearly the inferior choice.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is all just very, very stupid. I play a barbarian shaman. I've never knocked anyone else for their choice. I find it somewhat offensive that you pop on here and start asking us to explain why, oh why, anyone would bother playing a barbarian shaman. It's idiotic, man. Just let it drop.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on the matter of how much a shaman adds to a raid. It all comes down to the player, not the race. If a troll shaman isn't paying attention, his extra regen doesn't matter. If a barbarian shaman always quickly answers buff requests, he's going to be the one most often asked to buff. In my guild, shamans are known by their name, not by their race. Never has anyone said to me, &quot;We don't want you in our group; you're a barbarian and as such are less efficient!&quot; or &quot;Oh ****, we can't raid ToV today! Rokvald and Niten are our only shamans, and they're just barbarians!&quot; It's rather sad to hear that your guild is different.<br />
<br />
Of course, my guild also has a main tank lineup that includes two halfling warriors and not too long ago, we got a gnome warrior his epics rather than giving them to a troll warrior and one of the aforementioned halfling warriors a Blade of Carnage before awarding it to a barbarian warrior. We're pretty n00bish, though. We make silly, non-race-based decisions, and as such aren't quite as good as those other guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lemme put it another way;<br />
<br />
If you put two shamans together in the same gear and the same level of attentiveness and skill in the players, and one was an iksar and the other was a barbarian, their raid effectiveness would not be different. At all. The iksar has increased regeneration? The barbarian regenerates 300 HP a tic when he casts Torpor on himself, the fact that when the iksar casts it he's regenerating 310 HP a tic makes very little difference. The iksar has increased AC? When the Statue of Rallos Zek resists the iksar's Turgur's Insects and delivers four punches for 950 each (reduced from 1100) and then follows it up with a 450 point kick, in most cases that iksar is now a splat on the wall. Much the same as his barbarian companion whose Turgur's was resisted moments earlier.<br />
<br />
Neither race is capable of casting their spells faster.<br />
<br />
Neither race is capable of making their spells land with greater regularity.<br />
<br />
Neither race is capable of increasing the mana efficiency of cannibalize + torpor.<br />
<br />
Neither race casts a buff which gives more HP than the other.<br />
<br />
Race does not matter when it comes to a raiding shaman. Equipment matters. Attention span matters. Quick thinking often matters. A willingness to watch your toon die over and over and over without complaint matters.<br />
<br />
Scales and a tail don't a better shaman make.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Firstly thanks for the feedback to this post. I can see that most people have responded saying they played a Barb shaman because they look cool. This is interesting since there are so many Barb shamans around that everyone picks them mainly on looks. I would have thought that a lot of people picked them thinking that they made the best shaman race like Ogre warriors.<br />
<br />
Again this post was solely designed to try and change the perspective that Barb shamans are the best race for shamans and not to say you shouldn't play a particular race. Like I said being an Ikky Shammy I have lost count of the number of people telling me that I should have made a Barb Shaman. Further I still see people respond to the question which race should I make my shammy with Barbarian.<br />
<br />
Also its obvious that it ultimately comes down to how well you play your character regardless of race/class/equipment. I was assuming that all things equal these are the points for or against the different races.<br />
<br />
And its true that I did not consider PvP as I play on a green server. I also forgot to mention kitty shammies as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I play an Ogre shaman.<br />
<br />
When i made him back in April of last year, id been playing almost 2 years of EQ. I had a 50 troll warr on Rodcet (hi Rodcet :D) and a bunch of 30's spread across some servers.<br />
<br />
When i decided to go to Povar i thought id try a shaman. My first ever char in the game was an Ogre Shaman who i played til lvl 7, then later got him to 30. I played Ogres and Trolls only, and one ench (cause he could turn into a troll). <br />
<br />
Reason is, Ogres and Trolls , in old models, looked absolutely Spiffy! They rocked. The Trolls with their large strong bodies, beaks for noses, one of the faces even had a missing eye! The ogres. Don't get me started, these rocked even harder. They were big dopey lovable Balls of jolly goodness. The face i loved was the goofy smile with odd coloured eyes.<br />
<br />
I always thought of Shamans as a tribal priest, kind of the opposite of a Druid, an Evil druid. Back when there was only three choices for shamans, i reckoned the Ogres and Trolls were the only way to go. For my first char i thought Sta and Str made a char. For Gawgan, who i made after 2 years of the game after i become more experienced, I thought id go Ogre because they look cooler than Trolls, and i decided lower agi and a bit of regen was a good enough trade off for high sta, str and wisdom.<br />
<br />
No race is better. I love Ogres. I have my mates on Povar who are ogres. The barbies are jealous of our Seksiness and the Trolls want to win the title of best large race swamp dweller off us, But we are generally accepted for how we play.<br />
<br />
I agree, twinked shaman are always Iksar and Barbarian. That doesn't bother me. Playing my other characters the best shaman i've  ever encountered was a Ogre. Now he's in an uber guild on our server getting the Kills on all the server-wide first mobs, with his JBB.<br />
<br />
Barbies might be jealous of our looks, Iksars of our soft squishy skin, but i love Shamans and i love Ogres, its all about Personal choice. You barbies have a right to play barbies, go ahead! Im sure they're quite fun.<br />

<br />
I picked barbarian because they were the coolest looking shaman race at the time I started(Ogre, Troll, Barbarian).  They were good, didn't want to play an evil char.  And I had leveled my other char in the qeynos area.  ohh black burrow.<br />
<br />
If I had to start over and wanted to play from a powergamer perspective... I would choose iksar or troll.</div></div><hr />

Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I always wanted to post some things about shamans that I thought odd! I'm sure that they have already been discussed to death but I'm bored at work at the moment so figured why not :P.<br />
<br />
Firstly, Jaundiced Bone armour. Whats the deal here as I can never understand Verants reasoning. Shaman are a chain class and Iksars are only limited to not wearing Plate armour. Hence why are Iksars not allowed to wear Jaundiced Bone armour? If the answer is because Jaundiced Bone is plate armour then why is it any shamans can wear it at all? If the answer is just because of class balancing issues then I will not comment further.<br />
<br />
Why single out Jaundiced bone? Why not add rune etched in there, or totemic, or runed mithril bracers, or golden efreeti boots, or the list could go on and on. You can't wear it because it's plate. Thats the entire story. Verant originally didn't have unique graphics with in armor types so they way they made things look unique and special was to give the lower classes armor that looked like armor they wouldn't normally have access to. Plate armor for chain classes. Chain armor for leather classes.<br />
Notice the only one that ever comes up. Jaundiced bone. Why don't you just come out and say it. You want to be able to used the jaundiced bone bracers. It's like a kid that you told they couldn't have something. They want what they can't have even if it isn't everything they think it is.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the most common race for a shaman is a Barbarian. I cannot for the life of me understand why this is! Now I may be wrong in the following analysis but there are 3 roles for any class. The first in on raids, the second in a group and the third soloing. Lets look at the races in terms of these 3 roles for a shaman.<br />
<br />
FOR RAIDS<br />
Iksars would be the best raid shamans as they have the highest AC (if you use SS armour as a basis due to AC bonus) and innate regen.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres would be the next best with innate regen (for trolls) and the ability to not get stunned in combat (for ogres).<br />
<br />
I would rate Barbarians last as they have no abilities that are beneficial to raids.<br />
<br />
I would say that race is going to have almost no effect on a raid setting. Almost anything else is going to have more effect on a raid. The most important thing is spells and someone who know what they are doing. Sure regen wouldn't hurt but a shaman with torpor already has mana regen threw the roof. Throw c3, spiritual purity, mana song and cann v skill on top of that and you've got more mana than you know what to do with.<br />
<br />
FOR GROUPING<br />
Iksars have the highest Wisdom and innate regen meaning their mana pool will generally always be higher and they will have less downtime in groups<br />
<br />
Trolls also have innate regen so would have minimal downtime.<br />
<br />
Ogres and Barbarians would have no real advantage as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
What does wisdon have to do with being effective in a group? More mana isn't going to suddenly make you more efficient or effective at doing something. In almost any situation the shaman should be the last thing limiting the groups kill rate. It will be the cleric who's lom or the tanks that your waiting for to finish killing the mobs. Not the shaman who's regening mana faster than anyone around them.<br />
<br />
FOR SOLOING<br />
Trolls have innate regen and can use JBB making them the best soloing shaman.<br />
<br />
Ogres cannot be stunned in combat and can use JBB making them the second best soloers.<br />
<br />
Barbs can use the JBB however Iksars innate regen makes the difference here close at higher lvls.<br />
<br />
THE QUESTION<br />
Seems that Iksars are the best in 2 in out of the 3 roles, Trolls and Ogres are always good and Barbs always come last or equal last. So why is it that Barbarians are the most common Shaman race and the others are uncommon? The only answer I can find is that Barbarians have no faction problems which really aren't that much of a concern at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Well thats my 2cp worth of being a shaman and the puzzles surrounding shamanhood.<br />
<br />

Sounds to me like someone with a cause of regret. You invested alot of time in a character that and your now second guessing your choice in race and you came up here looking for someone else to say yeah your right you did pick the best race.<br />
<br />
Well if you must know I picked a barb because my roommate already had a barb warrior and I wanted to start near him since we didn't know the way to qeynos from halas at the time. I didn't know the first thing about the class or race when I picked it but I ended up being lucky and liking what i got.<br />
<br />
Why are there more barbarians than anything else? Faction is probably one of the major factors. Alot of people just don't want to deal with faction issues. Sure they may not matter much when your 60 and killing anything with phat lewts but not many people pick thier character with that in mind. I'd say looks is second. Personally I've always thought trolls looked silly and ogre's look kinda dumb (no offense to those that play em). Don't really care for the new models much better either.<br />
<br />
Odds are too that 2 of the 5 races probably weren't around when most shaman where created especially when you look at high lvl shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, Henora.  I was actually thinking about makin' a char, and sending a random tell to Glorianna as a joke, too.    .....Then I got lazy and didn't feel like logging in or finding out what server she was on.  ^_^;;<br />
<br />
I haven't logged in for 2 weeks, and intend to keep that streak going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">How about the fact that I play the game for fun, not for some STUPID statistical numbers! If I want to know about some number being bigger for someone, and some number being smaller for someone else, thus equating in some sort of - unexplainable - penalty, then I frikkin' read some newspaper's statistics column.<br />
<br />
When I started EQ, there was NO iksar race, and my &quot;start&quot; was already in the BETA. I didn't choose the troll or ogre, because I don't like to play evil races. I am not evil, though I am not good either. I am simply sometimes a bit.. benevolent. But other then that, I am a neutral person and barbarian fit very well here. Also, for personal reason, I also live in somewhat northern region of Europe, and we're here also strong, tall and good lookin' as the barbs are ;)  So, I made this char as well.<br />
<br />
And again, I play this game for fun, not for frikkin' numbers. And so far with my barb shaman I can do everything, what any other race shaman does, just as well, just as effectively. So your &quot;case&quot; here is pretty pointless.<br />
<br />
EDIT: also to add - why do all keep throwing JBB into the &quot;equation&quot;? If someone defines a shaman as someone who &quot;can use JBB&quot;, and base their whole play on that, then they have no idea about the shaman as such. I don't have JBB, never had and being a casual player, probably never will. So, does it make me less effective? Nope, I do just as well as I did before, and even better with every level. So stop throwing the JBB into &quot;equation&quot;, this is sad..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Asraguard, people picked barbarians not only for looks but also because at one time they were the only good race and had the highest wisdom. There were no such thing as iksar or vah shir when a lot of us started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">these types of racial debates always confuse me.  i've played eq for six months now, and these debates make me mad.  yes, there are some advantages and disadvantages to being a certain race, and with a shaman it's no different from any other class.  <br />
<br />
on the jbb issue, yes, i do find it frustrating that i, as an iksar shaman, cannot use a jbb.  i got one in the crypt a few weeks ago and had to sell it.  but hey, that's reality, that happens, no use in complaining about it.  verant decided to not allow iksar to use plate armor but to give them a number of distinct racial abilities (aka +ac and regen, etc.) instead.  i was aware of this when i made my iksar shaman, and that's the way it works.  it's not the end of the world.  <br />
<br />
on the barb shaman issue, yes, i do see a TON of barbarian shamans out there.  frankly that turned me off to playing a barbarian shaman.  i wanted to be unique, and it's pretty rare to see high lvl iksar shamans at least on my server tunare.  but it's pretty lame to say that barbarian shamans are &quot;the worst&quot;.  granted a lot of you uber barb shams are getting incredibly defensive over this issue, but gear and the player are really what matter.  with great gear and buffs any shaman is going to be a great use to a party.  <br />
<br />
sure the natural regen for trolls and iksar makes them SOMEWHAT better, but it's barely a noticable issue even at high levels.  sure torpor is a bit more effective, but all in all the rest of the people in your group will hardly notice the benefits of that.  every shaman no matter what the race is going to be more helpful if their gear is better and they know what they're doing.  personally if i had to do it again i'd be a troll (jbb), but i'm happy with my choice and enjoy being a somewhat unique character in eq.  <br />

I agree with all your points that it really shouldn't matter which race you play as, afterall, its just a game to be enjoyed. I guess I only made this post as this was my first character (Iksar Shaman) and nearly the whole time I was growing up I would constantly get comments saying delete your character and remake it as a Barbarian as they are the best shamans.<br />
<br />
Its even the case that most players that make twink shamans make Barbarian twinks! So I guess the purpose of this post was to ask why so many people make Barbarian shamans when at higher levels it is clearly the least beneficial race for shamans.<br />
<br />
In this post I was hoping to make people question their preconceptions about Barbarin Shamans.<br />

Well, lets see...<br />
<br />
When I started playing I didn't know what class I wanted to play, much less what race. I started playing EQ the day it was released. (With a limited amount of play time in Beta IV)<br />
<br />
I didn't have the Everquest web sites to tell me everything about every class. I picked a class that I thought I would enjoy (I liked to melee and have the ability of spells) and a race that seemed to fit the class. (What the heck is an Iksar... Pre-Kunark)<br />
<br />
If you know how to play a shaman, you cancel out the *advantages* that Iksar and Trolls have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, lets see.  If I had played an Iksar instead of a Barbarian - I'd probably be breaking 1k ac buffed now, instead of just 980 or so.  Doesnt matter that much I guess.  I'll get there one day, instead of just when I'm fully raid buffed.<br />
<br />
I'd be regenning a few more hit points per tick.  But, lets be honest, I've gone this long without a fungi.  I probably wouldnt even notice.<br />
<br />
I'd also have, what, 10 more points of wisdom?  I've had 200+ wisdom before.  The difference between my wisdom as a barbarian and my wisdom as an iksar probably wouldnt = one slow cast.<br />
<br />
But, lets face it.  The most important thing, if I'd chosen Iksar instead of Barbarian, I'd be butt ugly (HA!!) :D  <br />

My Shaman was born August 1999.  No Iskars, no Kitties.  Cani?  What's that?  Ogre females had the worst graphics - sorry, I'm female rl and have no interest in playing a male character nor a female that looks like a mutant giant baby. ;P   Plus the thought of having the GUARDS who I looked to for protection and safty kill me everywhere I went was far too taunting at that point in time.<br />
Barbs had the best starting wisdom at the time and were the easiest to get around with, so that's what I went with.<br />
<br />
With what I know now, I would make a Troll shaman, because I really do like my JBB and I know how important the regen is.  I was 'old school', full banded armor was sweet, Totemic was UBER :P.

<br />
Rationalize your race choice somewhere else if its sympathy or agreement you are looking for (I'm thinking a meeting of the minds such as Lake of Ill Omen /ooc).  <br />
<br />
All the races have pro's and cons.  Play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">1) JBB is not a balance issue. It was a mistake, and VI knows it. Hell, Iksar can wear JB BP but none of the other pieces. It is not supposed to effect our decision when choosing a race.<br />
<br />
2) Each race has it's own advantages and disadvantages, and it's part of the roleplaying that VI originally had in mind. It just happens the way the made the game, certain advantages are significantly better than the others. Regen &gt; Faction is an example of poor racial balancing. <br />
<br />
3) Everybody has thier own preference and play style. You have no basis to say you are right on all aspects of the game and that everybody else choices are bad. <br />
<br />
People choose Barb because 1) They are good looking (which doesn't matter in EQ's high end game) 2) Barb have high wisdom (which doesn't matter in EQ's high end game) 3) Barb has good faction (which doesn't matter in EQ's high end game) 4) Barb level faster (which doesn't matter in EQ's high end game).<br />
<br />
Now that so many people are level 60, they realize stupid VI's implementation of EQ's high end game totally negates their original racial advantages they sometimes have a small regret built inside them. BUT. That does not mean they cannot do shaman duties. Barb shamans are SHAMANs. And lack of racial disadvantages does not make them less of a Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The interesting thing about these silly race debates to me is that when you read one here, generally everyone stands by their race and highlights their particular strengths.  In the end the conclusion is largely that there is no &quot;BEST&quot; shaman race.  We have our whiners about how Iksar are overpowered or iksar are cirppled for lack of JBB and so on but in the end I think we generally agree that what race YOU want to play and are happiest with for whatever reason is just fine and perfectly capable as a shaman.<br />

Now compare to the monks who seem to go into an all out battle about how Iksar are overpowered and the humans have been ignored too long yadda yadda yadda...  Glad I'm a shaman. :)</div></div><hr />

I never counted the Iksar's extra AC as a bonus. It is only there to make up for the fact that Iksar plate classes cannot wear plate. It is a bonus for iksar classes that cannot wear plate such as monks or necromancers.</div></div><hr />

What you try to ratoinalize is a series of points that have no validity.  Trying to figure out which race is better on a raid is silly.  You offer the same benefits across the board no matter what race you are.  Innate regen doenst matter, AC Bonus doesnt matter, Wisdom doesnt matter, its all about what spells you have in your book, your raid tactics and your resists.  Thats it, nothing more. Rocket science it is not, young jedi. <br />
<br />
Its the same for grouping and soloing, all those pluses you merntioned don't mean jack if the guy/woman behind the character has no clue what they are doing and when to do it.  This is why we come up with things like root/park, and canni dancing.  Because generally they are overall going to make each shaman the same on any playing field.  <br />
<br />
As a barb I started out with 85 wisdom and left it there.  yes, I left it there.  does it matter? nope, in actuality those with lower mana pools tend to be better players all around because they learn how to manage their spells more so then those with larger pools.  Can I still solo Yeldema, yep.. Can I still buff a raid faster then you? prolly.  Can I still end up FM and FH ready to go at the end of the day? ya.  Do I need to depend on an enchanter to be in an exp group? nope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta laugh at this point.  If you got 5000 men and 500 women and they're gonna race, i'd have to say that the odds are that a woman is gonna win the race.  There's probably 10 times the amount of barb shaman as there is all the other races combined.  If you went and bet on any other race getting a &quot;first&quot; you'd be nuts.  <br />
<br />
It's no secret i have zero respect for barb shaman, you're no better than a druid in my book.  Dunno why but i've always thought barb shaman were cop out folks.  Too chicken of the faction and they want the easiest possible leveling speed.  Hence no respect.  Anyways...<br />
<br />
The other thing i wanted to mention is that someone brought up the whole &quot;Plate chafes the iksars scales&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Am i the only one that thought this was the dumbest reason they coulda possibly given?  I mean cmon.  Did they forget that realistically you were padding underneath plate mail?  You don't just have bare metal on skin.  And really wearing chain would have a higher liklihood of chaffing anything that would plate.  I've actually WORN authentic plate mail before and i can't imagine it chaffing squat.  Really they had no reason, this was just a limitation they wanted the iksars to have and made this up on the fly.<br />
<br />
Dunno why they couldn't have made up a decent RP excuse...Something like the beleived that a true iksar would rely on the strength of his scales and wearing false scales, ie. plate was against their religion or something.  But chaffing?  come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">&gt;&gt;) JBB is not a balance issue. It was a mistake, and VI knows it. Hell, Iksar can wear JB BP but none of the other pieces. It is not supposed to effect our decision when choosing a race. <br />
<br />
Not arguing with the logic of this statement in general, but you need to go check the wearable races on the BP again :)</div></div><hr />

But i think that is BS to say that playing a barb makes you a lesser of a person.  i mean how in anyway are you weaker? you might take 1 or 2 more kills to lvl but comeone.  us 'weak' barbarians shamans could come out and say that you choose the easy life by being an iksar,  i mean REGEN i think everyone knows how nice regen is.  It sure would make it easier, maybe i thought it would be more of a challenge to be a blind dumb barbarian with no regen which most people would agree is a defining stat of shamans.  <br />

<br />
no race is better than the other. regen doesnt mean anything to a shaman that has torpor. even before i hit 60 and got torpor i did as well as if not better than iksar and troll shaman due to fungi tunic and mana management. that's what it all comes down to. i picked barb cause they fit the roll of the shaman. they have the look and feel of being a &quot;backwards ppl&quot; that would still believe in such things, and i liked the overall look of the race. shaman in general kick ass, thats all that matters. who cares what race you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a starting difference with 15 wis is NOT a difference that matters!<br />
<br />
As for efficiency... it doesn't matter what race you start out with, nor does equipment untill the &quot;High End Game&quot; at which point if you don't have the equipment you haven't learned squat about your class and you might as well make a new character... LOL<br />
<br />
I've seen the first &quot;Tons&quot; of almost ubah twinked shamans who didn't know squat about playing one... = lethal for themselves and for their respective groups.<br />
<br />
Personally I choose Barbarian cause I like playing a good race and I am very fond of the Scandinavian Mythology (I'm danish ha ha). <br />
<br />
I always have pictured a shaman as the &quot;Medicine man&quot; of an Indian tribe or &quot;The Sage&quot; of a Viking Tribe .... hehe see my drift?<br />
<br />
But overall, the Idea of having a character that would be beneficial to any group and still being able to solo and get good exp was something which I liked.<br />
<br />
As for the JBB Hell I don't use it much hehe, Even though I went through a long camp to get it LOL, sure its good and all but I mainly use dot's and YES you can stack all our poison dots, you just need to cast them in the right order for them to stack :)<br />
<br />
In the End as some before me have said its the person WHO PLAYS the character that determines the usefullness of ANY character, NOT the race...<br />
<br />
Well enough Said, hope you all enjoy the game...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I can see this thread has gotten quite heated! Thanks for all the feedback and let me just clarify I didn't intend to condemn anyone for what race they play.<br />
<br />
I simply was puzzled with the fact that I would say three quarters of all shamans are barbarian shamans. Now if race really didn't make any difference to a shaman wouldn't you expect there to be equal numbers of races? You would think that the majority of people picked Barbarian shaman's for a reason and I just wanted to know what that reason was and why it is that if anyone recommends a race for a shaman its still a Barbarian. My analysis of shaman races at the end game was simply to highlight that all races have their advantages/disadvantages making no race the BEST (although personally I think Trolls have the edge). <br />
<br />
Also I do think that Wisdom is important for a shaman in grouping situations. When grouping I swap AC for wisdom/mana (yes shamans are casters believe it or not) as I know I won't get much agro and to keep pulls fast having more mana to slow/haste/heal/regen/buff/debuff is important.<br />
<br />
From the responses I can see that people picked Barbarians for a few reasons and several said it was because they were pre-kunark times. I respect those reasons and admit that when it comes down to it all that matters is how well you play your class. I love my Ikky shaman as I'm sure everyone who enjoys playing a shaman loves theres.<br />
<br />
Cheers and thanks for the responses again,<br />
<br />
Asraguard Arcanath<br />
<br />
P.S.: Interesting to see that in that other post 40% of peeps said they would make a Troll shaman if they could start over!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">A barb shaman was my very very very first character, back in beta 4 (he was later carried into release, on Xegony).  Back when wis was thought to really make a ****, there was really one superior race.....<br />
<br />
Back then, noone knew about ogre unstunability (well, very few people, perhaps the ones who played ogres in beta), noone knew how troll regen was gonna work out, and bad faction was really really crappy.  Remember again, this was back in the days before the OT outpost, and faction pushovers like Thurg and the moon.<br />
<br />
As to Ogrym....I feel that an ogre or troll shaman, made this very minute, would have a distinct *advantage* over a Barbarian....simply because of the advantageous placement of the OT outpost and various other locations.<br />
<br />
An Iksar has it even easier, if they dont mind NOT traveling : )<br />
<br />
As for Barbarians copping out due to faction:  I'm kos in just about every town in the game, evil or good or otherwise.  I think my safe havens now are Qeynos and Halas itself.  Very few ogres or trolls are that evil ;)<br />
<br />

- I am safe in Halas, Freeport, Katta, SH/Bazaar and Paineel. I can bank in FV but I am KoS to some NPCs. Thanks to overpopulated servers, killing guards was only route to XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Actually Wildaar is wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Faction is rarely an issue anymore (as several have pointed out).  So putting that as an advantage/disadvantage is not as easy to do as used to be.  <br />
Iksars may be the exception to this simply because EVERYONE hates them.  But even still, I see plenty of Iksars running around old world and in FV.  So I guess it's not that hard.<br />
<br />
So really, I think it boils down to -- how do you want to play EQ? <br />
If you are a min-maxxer then you'll probably choose Troll or Iksar because you feel they are &quot;the best&quot; (which is BS), as they have innate skills beneficial to our class.  If you like the more physical end of things and know you will be able to channel through interrupts, you'll probably prefer Ogre.  If you like good races and dislike the faction game (which, as I said, is pretty moot nowadays), then you'll probably go Barb or Vah'Shir.<br />
<br />
I know it's hard for some here to get through their thick skulls, but shaman races are all equally viable.  Play what and how you feel will let you enjoy the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I think what it all boils down to is personal preference... Some people choose their race based on looks and some base it on stats... Its all personal.  My first Sham was an Ogre, after which I re-rolled as a barb and finally (after verant took over a month to respond to my char transfer from accountA to accountB) an iksar...<br />
<br />
The choices were all personal and based on looks that I liked.  I don't see why everyone had to jump down the original posters throat... All it was was a question as to *why* barbs are the overwhelming majority at 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Agreed, Tehh.  That's what I've been trying to say all along.<br />
<br />
And my beef isn't with Asraguard, it was a simple question. <br />
My problem is with the clueless trollers who crawl out of their holes to chime in with their &quot;my race is best because blah blah blah&quot; BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">While it has been said it's naturally important to point out that the teeny tiny effect given by by race choice is absolutely NOTHING compared to the actual experience, mental or physical condition, level of intoxication or even the mood of the person between the keyboard and the chair.<br />
<br />
The speed at which the exp bar of the one playing the toon is moving is a million times more important as the speed of which the toons exp bar moves.<br />
<br />
This of course is obvious but it's very relevant as no regen/ac/jbb will ever make up for the time lost obsessing over them. Go learn something usefull instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">It's pretty obvious to me that Froglok shamans are the best shamans. When they aren't fighting, their regen is insane. While it'd appear they have a few less spells than other shamans, their melee puts that of even ogres to shame. Froglok shamans can double attack and bash, hitting often for up to 200! Finally, Froglok shamans look much, much cooler than any other shaman race.<br />
<br />
I've only recently noticed how cool Shissar shamans are, though. Melee that regularly smacks for around 275, powerful spells and apparently as a racial benefit, they can cast spells like the level 59 Poxx of Bertie when they themselves are only level 57! Also, Shissar shamans all seem to have Tigir's Insects, a spell that even I, at level 60, do not yet have! Shissar shamans are wicked-smart, but the disability of not being able to leave Ssra Temple due to their inability to navigate stairs does put somewhat of a damper on them.</div></div><hr />

To those of you who are bored by this sorry: the lads in the office are laughing hard: last office comment was 'is he going to offer to show you his tattoes?' <br />
<br />
No that's Wildaar's job. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Crusty<br />
<br />
Allow me to introduce myself.  I am from the Other America.  No, not South America, Canada or Mexico (nice regions and countries to be sure), but the United States.  <br />
<br />
I am from the America that most of the world remembers fondly.  I am from the America that still resembles the Andy Griffith Show in spirit.  I am from the America where cursing is used sparingly so as not to lose its effect.  I am from the America before 900 channels of mind-rotting cable.  I am from the America where Yes, Sir and No, Maam are standards.  I am from the America that is embarrassed by our racism while trying to do better.   I am from the America that is littered with tree-houses and forts full of childhood treasures.  My America may indeed be dying, but it does still exist.<br />
<br />
I am a professor and I do not curse in front of my class and I would be leery of any doctor or attorney who does so in a professional setting.  One does not have to be from Kansas or be a fundamentalist Christian to live in this Other America.  Indeed some of my most polite students are Muslims.  This America is the center of my world as it should be.  I hope that the special vision of your country is the center of yours.  I assume that it is Britain- Mum and hard man are give-aways, and it is an odd time of day for a Kiwi or an Aussi.  I would even go so far as to guess we are talking about places to the North.  I have been there and it is a wonderful place.  The landscape is routinely beautiful as all the earth can be, but it is the people who make a country, isnt it?<br />
<br />
I beg you not to judge my America harshly because of idiocy coming from That America.  I know that we should all be responsible, but I cant for the life of me figure out what is to be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely</div></div><hr />

you don't speak for America...you speak for yourself, however badly.<br />
<br />
Just because a bunch of people say a word in a specific area doesnt make that word part of the vernacular.  I live in the south, and I hear racial slurs every day.  I *hate* racial slurs.  I dont jump on the bandwagon and start using them.  I maintain my integrity.<br />
<br />
I see F*** as being the type of word that is a ignorant person's fill-in word.  If they can't think of an adjective, they use it.  If a verb escapes their tongue, they use it there too.  Nouns as well.  Sh*t also fits in there, as a filler.  Rap artists use it when they need to elongate a section of verse.<br />
<br />
Its the ability to NOT use these words in everyday speech that makes a man (or woman) bearable to converse with.<br />
<br />
And that's the ****in deal, yo.  And you can take that **** to the bank.<br />

<br />
Doctor or attorney in a professional setting, no.  I meant casually.  Just keep in mind they're normal people like anyone else.  That was in retort to bubsy's saying only &quot;lowlifes&quot; say the F word.  Of course, no one wants to go to the doctor and have him say &quot;Well, you're ****ed!  You only have two ****ing months to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
College professors, on the other hand, like much of the people in the academic world, are encouraged to express themselves however they like.<br />

Moosha, no reply for you until you come up with a more educated response that isn't brimming with generalizations.<br />

I agree.  You don't see me using every other word, do you?  I've already proved I have a decent grasp on how to speak properly in English.<br />
<br />
However, throwing a &quot;****&quot; around when you're talking with friends isn't unusual in the least, ESPECIALLY with young people.  Don't even try to refute that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Barb shaman.   In Beta 2 and 3 there were very few zones.  If you wanted zones to level up in and travel about seeing the most sights you went Barbarian.  This naturally carried over when the servers went live.<br />
  I suspect if you graphed the shaman races by birthdate you would find their creation almost equal now....   Barb creation leads early on fading down to equal or less by now.<br />
  That said in the end-game it's the ability to play your character outweighs all race choices.   I might faintly regret being stunnable from the front, but hey I have +25% channeling in AA skills and Items to make up for it!  Needless to say the only time most of this would ever show up would be in leveling up,  by the time you're 60 skill and gear is king.   I have self-buffed AC over 1300 and my wis is maxed at 255 without any enchanter buffs..... yet I'm a barbarian.....  Oh and the damn JBB takes so long to cast that the mob is usually dead by the time it goes off &lt;g&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cute.  You took the normal beaten puppy route.  &quot;OH, well you need to get yourself an education before you can disagree with my flawed and typically stupid opinion!!11!&quot;  Generalizations about what?  Your constant need to prove to everyone that you are a bad ass?  I don't need to make any kind of generalization about that.  You consistantly put yourself into those shoes with every word that spurts from your spew-covered lips.<br />
<br />
You paint a picture of American teenagers, that portrays them as mindless leechs that sit around and say **** over and over to each other.  &quot;Hey man how's it goin? ****&quot;....  &quot;Pretty good!  ****! Yourself? ****&quot;.... &quot;Pretty God Damn good! ****&quot;<br />
<br />
As much as you'd like to justify your behavior with the &quot;well everyone is doing it&quot; response, it's just not the case.  I am no angel and I definately curse.   I just don't feel the need to consistantly use that kind of language to try and fit in, nor do I think that it makes me look like someone that is not to be messed around with.  The majority of the American population feels the same as myself, and quietly thinks of you as an illiterate jackass for overuse of the same 3 or 4 four letter words.  One of a few things happens when I hear someone use profanity or racial slurs over and over:<br />
<br />
1: I lose all respect for them, because they appear to be trying to impress me, and are coming off as someone with a limited vocab.<br />
<br />
2: See number one.<br />
<br />
My response is brimming with normality, and yours is brimming with ... well... yourself.  You are of course entitled to your opinion, but saying EVERYONE does it is including me.  THAT is a generalization, and one I do not appreciate being included in.  Next time don't look to me to find acceptance for your behavior.  In all honesty, I think you will find that you are in the minority the majority of the time.<br />

<br />
Hmm. Look below my name.  Hit search.  Look at my old posts (aside from the ones in this thread used as examples), see how often I use any profanity.<br />
<br />
The rest of your retort, however caring, was nearly unreadable, and you call ME illiterate. HEH.<br />
<br />
Mmmm...I'm just gonna have to agree with Eoin's last post, okay?<br />

If you'd just sort of move to the back of the forum, that'd be greeaaat.</div></div><hr />

Barbs can travel to ALL the good cities of the game. That is why most people picked them. It's the ease of going to a good city and banking or getting supplies. But now with the Vah Shir you may start to see less and less new Barb shaman. <br />
<br />
Stat wise the Vah Shir aren't that great either but I like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">I never said that you were illiterate.  I said that &quot;overuse of the same 3 or 4 four letter words&quot; made you appear so.  I could make myself appear to be of a certain nationality by using lingo from that region, but that does not make me from that area of the planet.  Did I spell that out well enough, or was this paragraph &quot;unreadable&quot; as well?  <br />
<br />
Why is fighting for your right to use profanity so important to you, if you don't use it to begin with?  Free speech is great, but if someone is trying to take away your right to use a word that you don't ever say, then why bother?<br />
<br />
I actually had a couple of people read my post and they were able to follow along fine. =/  That was interesting how you typed out &quot;heh&quot; in all caps.  It really broke my spirit and drove your point home  (whatever it was).  I was humbled with your reply to my post and I even thought of suicide.  The &quot;HEH&quot; is what did it....</div></div><hr />

It really depends on the friends, as to what language is used.  However, more often than not my fiancee (wife in...*looks at watch*....9 days) is with me; if I throw a **** in there, she throws me a dirty look.  Hence, I avoid the use of it.  Besides, there are quite a few people that I know (friends included) that think words of that nature make one sound rather....well....not so well read : )<br />
<br />
<br />
I see your point, though.  I have a friend in rl named Aaron, and a cousin named Aaron; the way we tell them apart when speaking of them is my friend is addressed as &quot;f*ckin' Aaron&quot; because of his liberal use of the word....and we let that slide...mainly because the way he uses it is funny.<br />
<br />
But Im still pissed over the fungi staff.<br />
