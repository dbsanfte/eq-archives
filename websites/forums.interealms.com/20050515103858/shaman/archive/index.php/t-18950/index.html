<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as far as i rem all class have a damage cap of 20 till level 14, with some classes have a str bonus added. this increases at level 14 but gradualy to level 20 at which poinnt it is lifted and you get full damage as allowed by you skill with that type of weapon.</div></div><hr />

There is another cap at 30, but I don't remember what it is.  As far as I know, those are the only 2 levels where there are damage caps.<br />
<br />
Regardless, by level 30, you'll probably be doing more damage with dots than with melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No matter what level you are shaman melee damage is a joke plain and simple.  Right now at 65 with decent aa's and decent weapon (i have all types) my pet out damages me in melee.  and that is if I put up FA and all the other buffs and throw on a haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are 3 caps, 20, 30 and 50 (51?) either way Shaman melee is pretty bad, when I tanked Statue I didnt even turn attack on, one riposte would have killed me and for what? my uber 10 dps? (if that)<br />
get yourself a weapon with a nice proc and go to town. its really the best we can do.<br />
<br />
I want Double attack /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I beg to differ, but as far as I have researched and experienced with multiple characters, there are only 2 caps, at levels 10 and 20.  At levels 1-9 your weapon damage is capped at 10 hp, regardless of the actual damage it does.  At levels 10-19 it is capped at 14 hp.  Starting at level 20 there is no damage cap on the weapon.  Yes, there are other caps, such as haste caps based on your level, but I do not believe there are any other caps on weapon damage.<br />
<br />
Now, in case you are not aware, the weapon damage is bugged on weapons that have recommended levels.  Right now you will hit for max damage regardless of your level, the recommended level is not working with weapon damage.  The weapon damage caps at 10 and 20 still apply, but starting at 20 you will hit for full damage regardless of your level and the recommended level of the weapon.<br />
<br />
Enjoy until they fix the bug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">10 until 10<br />
14 until 20<br />
30 until 30<br />
uh... Where it goes from there I don't know, When my ogre Sk hits level 30 I'll slap a weighted axe on him and test it out.<br />
<br />
With my sharkspine club, Swift like the Wind, and FA I reach 45ish DPS on typical mobs, such as BoT giants or Sol Ro Tower trash. Meleeing while tanking tends to drop that by 5dps or so. I do have 41% haste though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hrm, I have a Delightful Orb, lvl 40, 1HB skill at like 70ish, do max 38, 400 some ATK. Everytime 1HB goes up, I gain round 6 ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a quick question are the damage caps the same for all classes since my Ranger once hit a decaying Skellie for 21 points for damage at level 2 with a twink weapon though</div></div><hr />
