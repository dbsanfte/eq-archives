Up until yesterday I've had velious graphics enabled wih luclin models (there's a line in the config to enable that, forget the exact wording atm). What I got was velious pants graphics showing fine, gloves and helms as well - but bracers, arms and boots seeemd naked (cloth/naked look).<br />
<br />
The bp was strangest of all - it would show a hint ot the velious bp on the shoulders, and below that it would cut off the graphic and show a naked/cloth look bp.<br />
<br />
I finally got tired of it and turned it off. Does anyone know about this bug, and is there a fix?<br />

the long and short of it.  As far as I know there are no plans to change this.<br />
<br />
Unfortunate, I liked the look of the Velious stuff.  :p<br />
