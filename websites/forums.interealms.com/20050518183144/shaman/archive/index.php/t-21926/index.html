<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i not trying to flame SOE or anything like that, but i think there is somin very starnge about this<br />

<br />
let me see 10 mana less, 1 level less, casting time 2.5 sec against 6sec  same spell at the moment?  reminds me os sow and u/g.<br />
<br />
now i know it nots finished but i think these things should be pointed out before beta! and difffinately before live. <br />
<br />
but i tell you what they can have that, if we can get a damage shield like there or a snare, or their quick heal? what yer think?<br />
admittely this and sow the only ones i can find, but it does make me wonder about what the devs are thinking?<br />
<br />
ps any other things low having sow first and no real u/g i think we should post. it little things like this that lead to the big problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most likely they are simply trying to test whether damage modifiers help and if so how much, and by putting it on several different spells they can more easily test that effect. Then they'll alter who gets it and how much mana it will cost and all that stuff.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, there is no way druids will get a good buff. I know people enjoy treating druids like sony's favorite child, but it really isn't like that at all.</div></div><hr />

um ... brenlo plays a druid. so does half the Dev team. in fact, they ARE sony's favorite.</div></div><hr />

I don't take seriously what characters they play. Look if you worked in a potato chip factory, would you want to eat potato chips in your spare time? You'd probably be sick of the sight of them. Similarly if I worked for Sony/EQ, there is no way I'd also play EQ for entertainment.  I mean sure they have these characters but take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

that could also be the reason everything has been going downhill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I work at Subway. I've worked there for 18 months now. And I still love my Salads. What they should have at Sony is someone who plays a Shaman to handle Shaman things. People who play druids will Always find flaws in Druid things, and because it &quot;Ticks them off&quot; when things don't work properly with their class, they'll fix it because they have first hand experience. It's just common sense. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have to say that i still dubious that everything &quot;will be ok&quot; and they &quot;just testing&quot; . we have had 4 expansion where these exact same problems and spell dont get changed because we sat back and said they gotto see that?! the fact is untill you point it out they general dont.</div></div><hr />

Actually many of the devs play the game for fun in the off time.  Several of them are part of high-end guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you do know they have access to all spells right ?  ;P  they can go parse  and parse and parse on any mob they wish  with any spell in the game  and ones they make up  mabyt they do test it maby they dont well see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Druids have always had a str buff line.  Str buffs OBVIOUSLY do nothing for shaman, what makes anyone think they are helpful for druids?  There is no reason both classes cannot have this spell, although it does hurt shaman desireability if druids have the same buffs but heal better and nuke better too.<br />
<br />
This is a logical spell for shaman AND druids to have, although I'm not so sure that the druid spell should be equal to the shaman spell...<br />
<br />
That said, I've never understood why druids had a str buff in the first place.</div></div><hr />
