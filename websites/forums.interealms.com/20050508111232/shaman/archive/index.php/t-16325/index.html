I also dinged 65 last week.  After a year playing on and off with my warrior and shaman, it feels good to get here.  If I wouldnt have made my warrior while bored one night, I might have gotten here sooner.  62 warrior plus 65 shaman = 137 levels :)<br />
<br />
So dont feel bad.  Its your game.  You play how you want to, when you want to, and why you want to.  <br />
<br />
Gratz again!!<br />

I'll have to double check my /played time, but I finally dinged 65 a week or so ago with 387 days played.  I took it slow (birthdate of April 16, 1999) but have had really enjoyed everything.<br />
<br />
Again, Grats on 65!</div></div><hr />
