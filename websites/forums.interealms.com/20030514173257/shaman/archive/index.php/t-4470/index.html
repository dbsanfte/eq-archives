<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's sad a guy who has been around as long as me is asking this question, but I can't seem to decide. <br />
<br />
Would you give up a Wolf Callers bracer and wear a Coldain military wristguard full time? Affliction extension is one of the few focus effects that interests me, but I'm lame in not wanting to give up the nice stats, as my gear isn't exactly top of the line. <br />
<br />
Even at 60 with all the key spells, I still find myself bracering a fair amount, as it saves me a spell slot. So don't really want to give up the JBB. Feel free to tell me I'm crazy and hurry up and do the wristguard quest, if you find the effect that useful, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I seem to recall that when tested it was found to only add 1 extra tick to the dots. So personally if thats all it add's I dont think it would be worth it. I dont have the bracer so I cant test it my self. But you might want to. <br />
<br />
On a side note I can say that putting 6 AA points into spell casting reinforcment (15% buff duration) will add 1 tick to torpor. Which is another 300hp. So it stands to reason that 30% (12 points) and 50% (8 points in class) will each add another tick. For an extra 900hp's total.</div></div><hr />
