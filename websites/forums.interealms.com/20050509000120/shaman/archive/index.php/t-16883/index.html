<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems everytime we do a Royals raid we wipe due to something stupid. Someone using an AE, falling in a pit, etc. What is the minimum a Prince/King raid could be done by you think?<br />
<br />
Our core group can crawl to Chardock B at LDoN speed, no med breaks, no CC, pulling 2 - 5 at a time. Do you think 2 groups 53 - 62 could pull it off? We are a non raid guild, so wearing Tae Ew and the likes.<br />
<br />
For example our Chard B crawl group was this.<br />
61 War (6k hp)<br />
62 Sham<br />
56 Cleric<br />
60 Beastlord<br />
55 Beastlord<br />
<br />
What do you think? I'd rather go with a cohesive strike force then a 3 group raid of folks asking why we're here and if they can use their favorite rain spells...</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I can't answer your question precisely. I think you're on the right track, in wanting to take a minimalist force, if you keep wiping due to foolish errors.  Whether two groups of 53-62 can do it, however, is going to depend HEAVILY on whether you're weighted toward the L 62 end of the scale, or L 53. That's a huge difference in capability. If you have a couple tanks, a couple clerics, a chanter or shaman (preferably both), and a couple DPS classes at the top end, you're likely ok. <br />
<br />
Hmm... the pulls to break the king room, and just to get into that area, can be tough. The king isn't all that tough, but he's not a slouch. I think two groups of 62's could do it, with your level of gear, with the right classes. If you could pick the classes and take 12 competent L 62's, I think it'd be easy.  You could do it with less, but I really am not sure how much less. A good bard/monk duo for pulling could greatly reduce the difficulty. If you don't have good pullers, it'll be much harder.  I'd feel much more comfortable with 3 groups, but you may not be improving your chances if the 3rd group is going to be all low level people who have no raid experience and tend to get bored and screw around at bad times. <br />

Prince is easier than King. I think any force that can get the king can do the prince.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how do you do it...?<br />
<br />
cheat! :D<br />
<br />
Very simple.. find a cleric that has good faction in chardok(chanter would also do). Fight your way down to the King room, being very careful not to train yourself. When you get down, the cleric with faction pacifies all the mobs in the king room, and you get a monk/sk(you never know) to pull the king out. Kill him and you're done. I've done it several times myself, without any mishaps. We did have higher levels than you, so if I was you I would bring 2 groups, just in case. at least 1 ench, 2 clerics, 1 or 2 shaman, a porter, and some melees. that outta be plenty. Remember, the hardest part about the King is his AE.. and you can hide from it, if you know what you're doing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even easier, bring a 61+ bard with the 61 lull song, doesn't matter what his/her faction is.  The bard can lull the entire room and you should get a clean pull of the King.  The Queen likes to bring an add or two when done this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There was a post from a lvl 65 shaman about douing the king with a lvl 65 bard. Both where non kos which they used to thier advantage.<br />
<br />
I'd say one group should be able to do it easily especially if you have a non kos cleric, enchanter, bard or other class that can pacify or simular. Your group listed would have a minor problem of not being able to open the locked doors along the way. Gonna need a rogue to pick locks but otherwise it looks possible altho hard to say with out knowing the gear and aa's etc of the players in question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting points here, since we have a couple people in our guild who need to do it.<br />
<br />
Before many of my guild started coming back from DAoC, my wizard got invited to a AoE group.  Warrior, wizard, cleric, mage, enchanter and druid, I think.  I was the lowest at 62, and at least half were 65.  We hit the royal area, and summoned a rogue down to open the doors. Killing all three royals took less than 15, I think, with me being the only casualty.  I'm sorry I can't give you better details, I was more along for that ride, although I had fun doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know a 65 chanter that's solo'd all 3, so if you've got a high lvl chanter friend that doesn't mind risking a death or two....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can do easily with 2 groups of 60+ peeps.  65 bard helps a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Coth the group(s) all the way in to 'safe hall' save ton of time, half the battle is getting there ;)</div></div><hr />

What he said, just did this last night in our very casual guild- non-kos mage is key, saves a ton of time.  Had roughly 3 groups of 51-65 (most 60+), was WAY overkill.  2 60+ chanters AE stunning and rest just assisting MA and mobs were dying so fast I stopped using turgur's and just AE slowed when I could.  We didn't try and pacify king room, just charged in w/ everyone on king and let chanters take care of the adds.  Once you're used to PoP mobs, it's a yawnfest when you're getting hit by kunark level mobs.<br />
<br />
About 90 min total time, which I realize is very, very slow considering we started in safe hall.  Had some people fall down trap in library (duh) and we're a little cautious, otherwise we honestly could have just &quot;LDoN'd&quot; the place and been done in 15-20 min.<br />

I love mudflation. :)</div></div><hr />
