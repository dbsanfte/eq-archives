<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I got a chance to long on early and test out the new &quot;nerfed&quot; GoD content, and I must say its not too bad.   So far as of this post I have only tested &quot;a noc havocblade&quot; in Qinimi and &quot;a mastrug warfiend&quot; in Barindu.   The noc in Qinimi was easily tankable by a shaman- dmg never went over low 200's and the mobs seem to be hitting for less and less often (avg hit was for 45).  Proc dmg is still resting at 500's and seems to be proccing as often as pre-patch, so expect a few dmg spikes.  The mastrug is now hitting for 400's max (pre-patch was 700's) and while not completely tankable- you don't have to worry about training the zone if root breaks.  Xp for each was roughly 1/3 aaxp in Qinimi and 1/2 blue in Barindu per solo kill.  Shamans should be able to main heal for both zones. (Haven't tested named yet)  All in all, it doesn't address shaman issues per say, but it should make GoD more inviting to the BoT/LDoN avg group.<br />
<br />
Edit: Resist rates also seem to be lower- landing slow w/o malos lands often enough, and VP tends to run full course.  Difficulty level seems to be just above Droga, so I expect to see the zones fill up with soloers soon enough.</div></div><hr />
