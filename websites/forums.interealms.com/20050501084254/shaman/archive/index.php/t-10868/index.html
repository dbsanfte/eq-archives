<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol - I guess you look like a tasty snack after a shrink! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL you know what, I discovered the same thing in ToV... tank asked for a shrink, I happened to cast it while a mob was inc and WHAM it was all over me!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just find the fact you have close to 6k HP or over as being impressive lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've noticed the same thing though never bothered to explore or document it.  Yesterday, I was trying to shrink a charmed frog in PoStorms and the pet's target turned on me visciously the second shrink (which didn't work) hit the froggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmmm, interesting.<br />
Imagine if, the MA uses cobalt shrink to gain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm...you have extremely high hps...but did not once dodge or get missed (unless of course you have turned off that text).  Maybe you need to work a bit on some AC items<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe..I'm just kidding of course.  But that is an interesting development.   Will look forward to trying it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AC is largely ignored by PoP mobs, specially upper tier ones.  What IS useful, however, is combat agility and lightning reflexes.  That makes stuff miss you altogether, or gives you a better shot at that happening anyway.  How useful is one missed attack?  Heh, with 800 hitters it's quite useful.  Woulda meant the difference between life and death for Wudd in all his twinked out finery.   Now imagine Mithaniel Marr attacking you.  He hits for over 1800.  A whiff from him is worth a LOT!  Unlike a whiff of Grobb under old management, peeyewww!  <br />
<br />
Personally I think Wudd's guildie warriors were AFK or something and forgot to shoot an arrow at the inc mob.  So lazy!  That is my pet peeve with warriors often, they don't pay attention on the inc and I get my ass kicked severely before they set down their beers and manage to find the autoattack button.  <br />
<br />
Which is why I'm training Combat Agility level 3 right now.  And then some Lightning Reflexes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gindan Flayers in Tactics split into 2 when killed. Probably 1 died and you were first they saw. Happens to me alot. Boy I hate that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">looks to me like you just got buff aggro.<br />
Next time you're doing anything chuck a buff on the MT just after he tags a mob with an arrow or prox and watch the fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've shrunk my group using my Swarm Orb and pulled agro off the tank.  It was the only spell I cast too  :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok I was standing behind the meat wall line of MT's<br />
They were not afk at all <br />
Brutall the MT was attacking the mobs as they were inc.<br />
My fault was to shrink a pally behind me and I saw the monk FD in front of our MT that was shooting arrows and attacking them but for some reasons THEY ALL WENT ON ME :p<br />
Those are inc flayers, they didn't split yet.<br />
I wasn't at full hp tho when they came. my max hp raid buffed is 6449 hp but I usually have a cleric that heal me when I get some unwanted aggro on raid )<br />
Problem is that he poor guy couldn't even land a spell on me as I died too fast (there was 3 flayer in that pull)<br />
<br />
And Landragoran you are right about ac / AA skill.. It doesn't seems my ac do anything when I take rampage from Rydda`Dar but if I dodge a round, it's 2k damage avoided ) <br />
But you are wrong about tank and AFK dude.. this screenshot is taken during the rallos zek &quot;ring&quot; and it's not at the begining of it.. trust me.. the raid was awake</div></div><hr />
