<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've completed the Qyenos Badge quests up to the 5th badge, which is an almost wearable 6ac + stats item.  I suspect, however, that there are more quests.<br />
<br />
There is some kind of event where npcs are spawned in Qeynos Hills.  At the entrance there are human and half elves (warriors and archers), and elsewhere in QH gnolls spawn.  Apparently, there events have something to do with gnoll couriers in Blackburrow, but I'm not sure of the connection.  At some point, one of the human npc's asks for items dropped by the courier(s) in BB.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any additional information on the quest, please post here.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I fought against the gnolls in the wave that attacked the defenders at the zone to SureFall Glade. I fought one caster type blue to 60 that hit for 170's, cast, summoned, and had maybe 15k hp. Nasty. Didnt see what it dropped cause the guards eventually joined in and KS'd me (was soloing it). <br />
<br />
I have no idea how this event was triggered. I thought it was an GM triggered event. <br />
<br />
I too talked to the npc's you mentioned and went off the BlackBurrow in search of information. <br />
<br />
I have done the badge as far as the Badge of Honor. Have not managed to get the people to help me kill the gnoll boss in Jaggedpine to get the next badge. <br />
<br />
I am curious. What makes you believe that the events in Qeynos Hills are related to the badge quests?</div></div><hr />

Seems to follow from the dialogue for the 5th badge quest.  In that quest, the NPC's talk about fighting with gnolls.<br />
<br />
At first I thought that the war was a one time GM event, but then why are gnoll couriers still running around in Blackburrow?</div></div><hr />
