<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I'm grouped with a bard and wizard in Droga.  I mem fleeting fury (cause of it's fast cast time) and try to chain cast it on the bard and wizard.  Unfortunately, I notice many times during the AE, many mobs would die and I wouldn't get the faction hit.  <br />
<br />
Is there a better way, maybe a cleaner technique to make sure when all mobs are AE'd, I would always receive a faction hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you pull instead of the bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could try our level 19 AoE dot Infectious Cloud.  <br />
<br />
It has a 2.75 second cast time and a 20 dmg AoE DD component.  It's longer than the 0.5 second casting time of fleeting fury and more mana (10 vs. 78 mana), but you should be guaranteed to hit all the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe our ae's are limited to 4 targets max because they are regular ae spells and not pbae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best bet that I've always found is use a low level group buff spell that has a fast castig time.  Don't use heals or regen though, just through exp I've seen when using those they don't hit half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always used acumen or fleeting fury, and never noticed many missed hits.  We also pulled in a pair, I got half, warrior friend got half (he used bracer of the hidden).  I'm sure there were a few missed ones, but very little from what I noticed.  Also you may want to cast after mobs are half dead.  We usually used some combo of cle/dru/wiz/enc/mage, so the mage (lower level) and the cle would fire off, then we'd cast on them, then the druid would finish.  Usually only took 1 wave each to kill mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If the wizard has Winds of Gelid, drop the bard and do the pulling yourself. One cast of Gelid will instantly drop 95% of the goblins you should be killing. (the area near and north of the Nurga entrance)<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I found almost no way to ensure a faction hit. If you didn't pull, or deal damage to each one, it's pretty irregular. Using an instaclick buff repeatedly seemed to help, as long as all the goblins were in camp to &quot;see&quot; it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pull yourself Ryse! Thats what I did when i was there with an AEer. Didnt take me long to get the faction needed then ;)</div></div><hr />
