<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know some people have commented on it, but I want to hear what more people have to say.  Whatcha think about Spiritual Channeling?  I know mana isn't close to being my problem, as I still have to do defensive oow aa's, but I'm at 7aa banked and I am not the kind that really likes to save them up.  So this is as close to 12 that I'm going to be for awhile.  There are many times when I simply just have to spam Yoppa's and that's when I think this would attractive.<br />
<br />
p.s.<br />
Oh and does wizzie spellshield affect this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spiritual Channeling simply put, rules.  I use it every day for one reason or another.  Whether it's raid buffing quickly, hitting a raid-target out of our normal raid window with min. healers and using it to spam, or MPG trials, or soloing, or or or... :)<br />
<br />
ps: I don't think Wiz SS would effect this just because how it's setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love this AA myself . Mainly i use it in one of 4 situations that come up rather often for me .<br />
1 . Raid wipe , need to Rebuff but MGB is down .<br />
2 . Boss mob on a raid but we have plenty of healers I use this and chain constant rains for extra damage .<br />
3 . Boss mob on a raid and we are light on healers I use this and perma chain spam heal the MT to provide a little extra &quot;and potentaly raid saving&quot; healing power .<br />
4 . in an EXP group and the crapola hits the fan . I use this and just chain heal everyone includeing myself preventing deaths untill the trouble is under control .<br />
<br />
Not only is it quite usefull in these situations but its just plain fun . I get lots of  &quot;oo's and ahh's&quot; from group members when I use it . I find it very  fun . It may be my favorite AA after canny5 .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounding very nice atm.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The AA Ability text should read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Activate and enjoy 5 or so minutes of free spell casting every 30 minutes just don't forget to heal yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
This AA ability simply put owns~ I pop it everytime I can. I especially love how you can activate it, be at low mana and still canni up to full by the time it drops while casting your brains out.<br />
<br />
Get it, you will love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its amazing. I read some &quot;bad&quot; reviews of it here, but the more I looked at it, the more I wanted it, and I wasnt disappointed. <br />
<br />
I am just hoping it doesnt get nerfed, honestly. Its VERY strong. Hell, its a good thing we dont have bigger nukes or heals, or it would be TOTALLY broken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cant really add much more than whats already been said.  Its essentially endless mana for up to 4 minutes.  Good stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is a great AA - one of the best - when it works !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got the new spell slot, call of the wild, and spiritual channeling in that order. I have not been disapointed at all in either cotw or sc. Get them both you will not regret it. Best oow aa's we get imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been pretty pleased with Ancestral Aid.  Did CoTW then AA3 now shooting for Spiritual Channeling.  Betting those all will be my favs.</div></div><hr />
