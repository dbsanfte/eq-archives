<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought level 1 last night, to check it out.  It kept dying before we could see it do anything but cast the spell Aura of Restoration, in the bard box.<br />
<br />
So, today I had a warrior friend run himself out of END.  Then, standing with no buffs and no END regen AA, he let it come back naturally.  From 0 END to 100% END in 9 mins 22 seconds.<br />
<br />
Then he ran himself out of END again and we fired up my Ward.<br />
<br />
This time, I also hit Canni5 and watched my HP regen rate.  I was regenning 28 hp per pulse of Aura of Restoration (my normal standing regen is 13).  His END bar filled up in 9 minutes on the mark, saving 22 seconds...<br />
<br />
Looking up Aura of Restoration on Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4795&amp;source=Live), I don't see anything about END regen.   Reading the description of Call of the Ancients in game, I don't see anything about HP regen.<br />
<br />
Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 0:30:00<br />
Requirements: Level 65, No previous ability requirements<br />
Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that increases the rate at which everyone around it gains endurance.  Increased ranks improve the rate at which endurance is regenerated.<br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly is this thing supposed to do?    :confused:</div></div><hr />

hes right, it's not up yet, but might be soon ... how much you wanna bet druids healing wards go up first ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, it's a hp regen (look at my post on the thread i just made) and at level 5 it regens approx 70hps for 5 - 6 min (i timed it 6, but /shrug, the paper say it's only 5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I bought level 1 and examined it closely.  It is 25 hp/tick regen (I was regenning 76 a tick with 26 standing regen, 25 from blessing of replen... so ward was doing 25).<br />
<br />
I will have level 2 tomorrow and can tell you what it does.  I suspect 25/50/75/100/125.<br />
<br />
125/tick ae heal would be very useful, actually.<br />
<br />
Not sure how long it lasts; wasn't paying attention.  5 mins sounds about right... maybe longer.  Was definitely gone before 9 mins, cause it was gone when I had 21 mins to next use.  <br />
<br />
I'll post tomorrow when I have level 2.<br />
<br />
Chifari</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, it's a hp regen (look at my post on the thread i just made) and at level 5 it regens approx 70hps for 5 - 6 min (i timed it 6, but /shrug, the paper say it's only 5)<br />
<br />
So 70hp's/tic for about 55 (50-60) tics.  That is about 4k hp's over 5.5 minutes.  Not bad, but since they don't stack, it isn't going to save much of your raid from 500-1k AE's:)  <br />
<br />
So 70hp's/tic is at level 5?  What is the AA cost for all 5 levels?  I'm not in game now to check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's 3 for each level, and yeah, it will and can be killed by the mobs right at this time.  so, don't expect it to last through the first AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Level 2 is 6 points.  Assuming 3/6/9/12/15.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">currently our ward is the exact same thing as druid and cleric one is. As far as the ae thing goes I think it's an occational bug rather than an always thing. I used my ward during ofossa last night (250 point a tick ae dot) and my warder lasted threw the whole fight after i summoned him. We did how ever have a druid who's ward seems to be killed by something prematurely. It's also possible is the good old pathing poofs pet type thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Could be the Ward is considered a &quot;pet&quot; and takes on the resist characteristics of it's masters. O's AE is pretty easy to resist at 500cr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was messing around with Level 1 of the ward again last night, was giving me 14-15 hps per tick.  That's it.<br />
<br />
It also requires line of sight, for you to get the effect..  Since it dies of AEs, I tried to hide it but that didn't work..people 10 feet away around a corner, did not get the effect.<br />
<br />
I can shrink it, grow it, buff it with whatever I have.  I shrunk it down until &quot;Henora's Ward&quot; text was about resting on the ground.  It also randomly craps out for 2-3 ticks.  Just stops working and then starts up again.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
oh, and mine lasts 5 minutes, 50 seconds.<br />
<br />
If it is gonna be a regen ability, I don't think it needs to be this puny.  I mean Bards can do 70hp per tick with Chorus of Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was messing around with Level 1 of the ward again last night, was giving me 14-15 hps per tick.  That's it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Send yours back?  Hehehe.  I am in game right now... just watched an entire canni5 regen, 51/tick like clockwork (I regen 26 standing), no crapping out, no missing ticks, no staggering or doubling or anything weird.  I had no other buffs on at all.  I watched it pre-ward (26/tick, like clockwork) and post-ward (51/tick, always).  With replen, it became 76/tick.<br />
<br />
Level 1 is 25/tick for me, guaranteed.<br />
<br />
The only possible reason I can see us having different numbers is if what this ward does is to double (approximately) your existing standing regen from default/items only?  (I have 10 default + 16 item, if that helps figure this out any).  In 30 mins, when it's up again, I'll take some regen items off and retry.  <br />
<br />
Any reports from other people with it?  Just do canni5, stand there and watch... and post here!<br />
<br />

<br />
Done.  10/tick, like clockwork, with no regen items on.<br />
<br />
Cast the ward, 35/tick, every time.<br />
<br />
Definitely 25 for me, all the time.<br />

LOL :)<br />
<br />
Maybe he's using your healing AA's =P<br />
I have max healing AA.<br />
<br />
it's 3 for each level<br />
Chifari is definately right about this one, it's 6 points for level 2 and I anticipate that it will follow that pattern and be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15  (Please post if you have bought some additional levels and know for sure!)<br />
<br />
<br />
I will test it out again tonight Chifari, it is not impossible that I am some kind of math retard and just didn't read my ticks right.  I am 99% certain though, the first time I tested it, I was buffless and it was slightly more than doubling my standing regen per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BTW, Level 2 only does *30/tick*.  This is seriously godawful and I don't know what they were thinking when they made this aa.  <br />
<br />
3 points to get 25/tick then you pay 6 for a whopping 5/tick increase?  Simply terrible.<br />
<br />
I had hopes for this one, but it looks like it really will only go up to 70 or something like that.  125 would have been nice.<br />
<br />
Really disappointed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just got level 1 and it has been 25 HP regen for me so far too.  It may be like a pet and take on our resists but the only times I really would want something like this would be for AE mobs and if they are easily resistable then it's pointless.  If they are tough to resist, it's pointless.  <br />
<br />
It may be a bug or more likely, &quot;it is working as intended.&quot;  <br />
<br />
This would be a nice AA if the ward wasn't easily killable by AEs.  Every time I used it tonight on the Rathe, it died first AE.  At least they could give it my HP too, haha.<br />
<br />
At least I only wasted 3 AAs on it.</div></div><hr />

At this point I regard it as a horrible waste.  It's only value will be if I want to solo something and want a minor hp regen.  Whoopy.  <br />

I can't begin to imagine anyone paying 9, 12, 15 for the next 3 ranks.  36 AA for this?  ha</div></div><hr />

The ability is supposed to affect endurance regeneration, not hp regeneration, so this is obviously a bug and will get changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No tugela, the bug was the description.

However, they didn't tell the mass public this, and indeed the description on the AA still reads Endurance.  /rude</div></div><hr />

The later ranks do seem to be way overpriced for the return, but hey - that's just a nutshell description of every GoD aa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 30 hp regen that's leashed to a specific spot that lasts 6 minutes, that can only be cast every 30 minutes and that costs 9 AA is total crap.  <br />
<br />
Let's not add in that it doesn't stack with other wards and it can be killed by AE.<br />
<br />
That higher versions cost 9, 12 and 15 AA EACH level makes the joke almost sublime.  <br />
<br />
Mudcrush is going to the first shaman to fill out this line, or someone else who has maxxed all other options.  <br />
<br />
How amazingly sloppy to leave the description wrong.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, I see, I hadn't read that particular thread. Sucks if it is true, endurance regen would have been very usefull.<br />

The clerics in my guild think that their ward is great, and it apparently has the same effect as ours. Personally I'll take their opinion before yours thank you ;). As to the effects of regen, when my warrior is not MT on large targets I can tell the difference between having regen and not having it. If you are not casting it on your groups and they are taking incidental damage, you are doing them a disservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ya.. the wards only heal 25/tick, base, and then +5 hp/tick a level. So max at a massive 50/tick, for a Ward that can easily die to AEs, doesn't stack with the other classes wards (shaman should stack when it's fixed, but doesn't now). It really needs a boost. Level 1 is ok for a few people to get, as hey..extra regen on a fight, is extra regen, but *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">it's not going to stack with anyones.  It's the same for all the classes.  When you and other's cast it, the buff goes in your bard buff box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why rely on anyone's opinion.  Can't you assess for yourself that it is crap and not worth 9AA for level 2 @ 30/tick?  Let's not get into 9, 12 and 15 AA for successive levels of 5 extra hp a tick each level.  <br />
<br />
If your clerics think it &quot;ownz&quot;, then they ain't too bright.<br />

Level 1 for 3 AA is tolerable, because 3 AA isn't much.  Anything beyond that is not well designed for the costs or effects.  <br />
<br />
I would definitely like my 9 AA back, because they'd be better used elsewhere.  A bum description on release for one of 20 AA abilities, and there's a guy who's job is strictly AA... well, that's not real impressive.</div></div><hr />

The range isn't as big as an AE heal.  I'd say it's around 100 range, though I'm not certain.  I don't know about the aggro issues either.  The only real use I've found for it is after a fight were people still have AEs on them (e.g. Babnoxis).  It gives a little extra time to heal and cure.<br />
<br />
Like others have said, don't buy more than the first level until it's fixed.<br />
<br />
They don't stack with other priests' wards, they die easily.  It's plain to see that someone didn't think this AA out.  Go with FoMM, Crit. Aff. (if you solo a lot) or the run speed one if you want to buy GoD AAs.  Those are the only decent ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Thanks Jzak =)<br />
<br />
I have Crit Affliction 3 and like it very much. I was tempted to get this for the endurance regen, but a quick poll of my guild melees revealed that none of them run OOE often enough for it to be worth spending my AAs on. I was gonna get it after the crit dot thingy, but then I found out it's a hp regen ward. Oh well, maybe in 100 or so AAs...</div></div><hr />
