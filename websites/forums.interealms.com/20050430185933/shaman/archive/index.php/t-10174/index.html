<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure some other people have this problem, but lately I can't figure out what I want to do in game anymore. Usually I duo a 62 Shaman and 59 Shadow Knight for exp, raids, etc. But lately I've just been pl'ing a bard 90% of the time.<br />
My char list are: 62 Ogre Shaman, 59 Ogre Sk, 53 Barb Rogue, 50 Barb Shaman, 45 Vah Shir Bard, 40 DE Necro, 40 Erudite Wizard<br />
<br />
. . . and now I'm contemplating an Enc as charm killing seems like the most fun you could possibly have at higher levels - they'll probably nerf it soon so I'm waiting to see what's going to happen, but it should still be good even being unable to haste pet.<br />
<br />
*What to do, what to do* Can't say I'm tired of the game but I do seem to be lacking direction lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">change is always nice, gives you something else to do without going crazy about the uber drops and endless spawn camps with mobs that never pop when you are there...<br />
<br />
personally, it really felt relaxing to PL a character in paludal, 10 levels in a hour is great peace of mind, just makes you wish leveling was that easy at 60+</div></div><hr />

MR check on COD was changed from -50 to -10. Can't haste regularly charmed pets anymore. (This one in flux I believe)<br />
<br />
Check out Castersrealm for all the sordid details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree.  Starting the ogre beastlord was the most fun I've had in a long while in EQ.  Start a beastlord, then get them up to Shar Vahl and do the quests there.  Despite what you may see posted, ALL off those BST quests are for all races now.  That series of quests has gotten us to lvl 16, and we'll probably be near 20 by the time they're done.  Good solid week of entertainment that just kicks the living HELL out of ...<br />
&quot;Lvl 61 shaman seeking trials group&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, group 2 ogre beastlords (can't say for other races) and you're PLing yourselves... we started with no outside gear.  At spell levels, you're wiping out a half dozen or so evens at a time.  It's obscene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Played my bard last night he was a blast. It's so damn hard to tell what char is best for you in the end game, when roles change so often as you level. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's personal insanity, but I feel the need to change my chars alot - even though I hate falling behind doing so. (I should be 65 and have some serious AA's by now =\).</div></div><hr />
