<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in a month when the new expansion is out.  you wont even need sow or shrew, advanced innate run speed will make them obsolete<br />
<br />
First I'd like to point out I did not type just GOD because search features wont' work..<br />
<br />
So I saw this and was thinking damn I haven't even considered what I'd buy and in which order.. So based on what you guys know now, what are you going to buy first?<br />
<br />
Advanced Innate Run3 looks REALLY good. I am sure it'll be my 2nd highest priority next to any canni effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have a link to the list of AA skills that are believed to be coming in the next expansion?  I came across a list once, but forgot to bookmark it and don't see it there now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Enhanced Rabidity<br />
Most likey part of the Rabid Bear/Hastened Rabidity set of Shaman skills, providing further &quot;Rabid&quot; benefits<br />
<br />
this is insulting and makes baby jesus cry.  unless lv one of it lower the reuse to to like 45 min, then consecutive levels even more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman (possible) useable ones from that thread:<br />
<br />
Improved Innate Run Speed<br />
We can all likely guess what this is; a Passive AA that increases run speed beyond Innate Run Speed 3 (which is already approaching SoW). Innate Run Speed, at a single point per level, is typically the very first AA most people obtain. Expect this one to cost more than 1 AA per level.<br />
<br />
Improved Innate Regen<br />
Most likely just what it says, providing 1 or more levels of higher Regeneration skills, probably at a higher cost per level than original Innate Regen, which only cost 1 AA per level.<br />
<br />
Improved Lung Capacity<br />
Innate Lung Capacity made players able to stay longer underwater. If the cost for the Improved version is much higher than 1 AA per level, odds are alot of people will skip this line as they did the original. It's simply too easy to get Enduring Breath (Worn) these days.<br />
<br />
Divine Avatar<br />
A 3-tier ability, seemingly for Shamans but listed here among likely Cleric abilities, it appears to be Activated and is, so far, slated to be a 140 point boost to STR, DEX, AGI, and ATK. Higher tiers currently show the same stats, so they will either be raised even higher, or higher skill levels will translate to shorter recast delay.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction<br />
Sony has been working toward increasing the benefit of Damage Over Time spells. Now that they've added visible messages of DoT damage, as if each tick were a nuke, this ability may represent a Passive ability to give a few percentage chance to get a Critical Tick of DoT damage. It may also go into effect as the DoT lands, providing Critical Ticks for the duration of the DoT, but this is less likely.<br />
<br />
Doppelganger<br />
Another Activated &quot;swarm of pets&quot; ability, this will send several copies of the Player himself into a battle for 10 seconds. There are currently 3 levels of this ability, each adding a higher number of clones to the party.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
This would seem to be an extension of Fury of Magic, a very disappointing Planar ability that increased the chances of casting critical DDs (which included a high AA price for very small percentage increases). If so, expect to see even more Critical Spells out there, at a time when Sony claims to be trying to bring melee up to already inflated caster damage quantities.<br />
<br />
Spirit Shield<br />
Unknown. Shield effects are typically an AC boost, Damage Shield, or Damage Absorb.<br />
<br />
Advanced Channeling Focus<br />
Channeling Focus allows spells to be interrupted less, this is likely an extension of that, providing even fewer interrupts.<br />
<br />
Spirit Speed<br />
Unknown, very likely a special form of Haste.   (comment: Possibly a shaman upgrade to SoW finally?)<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity<br />
Most likey part of the Rabid Bear/Hastened Rabidity set of Shaman skills, providing further &quot;Rabid&quot; benefits.<br />
<br />
Sturdiness<br />
Possibly an advanced form of Passive hit point increase skills.<br />
<br />
Virulent Plague<br />
Unknown. Most likely related to DoT damage. It would certainly be interesting to see a DoT that transfers from mob to mob, using AE dynamics. Certainly Sony hasn't been that creative here.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion<br />
Already in use, this ability allows a pet to be held in suspension and brought out at need, drastically reducing pet-chaining difficulties. What change was made is unknown.<br />
<br />
Wolf Pack<br />
With so many Wolf Form, Spirit of Wolf, and other related spells, it's very curious that this was added. Effect unknown, and very likely Activated.<br />
<br />
_______________<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Innate Run Speed, Divine Avatar, Critical Affliction, and Virulent Plague definately sound like potential ones to get at first.  The others I'll have to wait and see what they do first.  As with the majority of current Shaman AA I'm not entirely pleased, other classes get so many better AA's and many of ours are just fluff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just dont see it happening Penny.  Shaman are not high on SOE's list of classes that should be doing damage period.  If it actually goes live, enhanced rabidity will increase your melee damage a bit, but 'huge DPS' is NOT going to be the result.  I'd be supprised if it added 10 to 15DPS to the overall total.  If SOE was serious about trying to improve shaman melee abilitites and they chose rabid bear as a serious vehicle to work toward that imrpovement then included with the coding on rabid bear would be a 'you will not miss at all with rabid bear, or at least connect with 80% of your hits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ive maxxed out my piercing and 1hb stats (2hb still needs about 10 points) and I self buff every melee stat to max (except agi...still about 15 points from cap) and self haste to cap (41% item and SLtW).  On greens, I can connect about 60% of the time.  Light blues and blues I am able to score a hit about 40% of the time.  Even con, yellows and reds, even given a huge back to work against, I might as well be yelling at the mob for all the damage I am able to do. <br />
<br />
I have not purchased rabid bear because I think it is one of those'fun' AA's to get once you have collected about 200 of the better, usefull AA's.  But, I do not see shaman being effective with melee even with the increases that come with Rabid Bear.  5 minutes of  rabid bear every 2 hours (or every 84 minutes if you spent 12 AA points to get Hastened RAbidity to level 3) is a JOKE.  This new AA, INO, is the same thing, a joke.  Probably because someone from SOE saw someone here joking about it a year or so ago, and put it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Unless enhanced rabidity ups DPS to like 200 it will be another extension of the worthless line. <br />

watch it go to clerics lol.<br />
besides i have seen shaman using the best melee weapons available<br />
such as &quot;sharkfinspine&quot; and so forth with rabid bear ... its a joke.<br />
rabid bear is so worthless, i would much rather have the aa for decreased spell agro.<br />
<br />
on an unrelated topic, did anyone notice with taunt you can now fail ?<br />
my brothers warrior has been failing with taunt , and its maxed ...<br />
well soe said they would fix agro, so now if it works does that mean you can still hold agro ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ya I'm kinda sorry I ever purchased Rabid Bear.  But I did so way back before anyone knew how bad it really sucked for sure.  I mean, it's slightly &quot;fun&quot; but usually the timer goes by without me ever activating that skill.  I'll go days without ever thinking about it or remembering I even have the skill.  It's pretty fuggin worthless, yep. <br />
<br />
Unless the Enhanced Rabidity skill was something SIGNIFICANT in DPS upgrade, like 150DPS minimum, it will just go in the pile of skills on which nobody will ever spend points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how giving us a perm double attack aa in the form of a perm Rabid Bear like the Bards aa for double attack would be all that overpowering. Clerics will still out melee us with a summoned hammer...<br />
<br />
But over all outside of the Crit Dot AA the rest of the Shaman AA look craptacular as usual.<br />
<br />
For heavens sake if they give us a Avatar aa at least make it group not single target... :(</div></div><hr />

Hell, i love this ability.  I'm up to FoM2 right now and even after spending that many AAs on it, I'm more than pleased with the results.  When i'm criting 3x in a row once in a while it just makes it seem that i'm finally doing some form of dps.  I was one of the advocates that waited till I almost got to 200 AAs before even getting SCF1 just because I don't think that shamans were made to nuke and I wanted to get other more important AAs out of the way first, but I've been more than happy with those points now.  <br />

I totally agree here.  SCF1 and SCF2 are pretty bad though, but there is a very noticable effect when you hit SCF3 and above.  I keep only tears of saryrn memmed as my damage spell now and frequently crit twice in one cast.  This allows me to do a good amount of damage with just one spell and very low aggro, instead of using a high aggro dot or single target nuking 3-4 times per mob.<br />

well i'll take a quess that it will get screwed up and look at war/monk/rogue and throw extra 0's in the math.  we'll say, 6 ppl, war/monk/rogue/cleric/shaman/chanter, <br />

<br />
Alternate advancements:<br />
<br />
Extended Quiescience: 3 levels  each level extends Heal over Time spells by 2 ticks.<br />
<br />
Enhanced Quiescience: 3 levels, each increasing the amount healed by HoT by 15% (Q starts at 300/tic and would go to 440, that is reasonable)<br />
<br />
both of the above could have prereq's of regen 3 and advanced regen to make them end game items.<br />
<br />
Bash: we been carrying this garbage can lid around for 4 years, why not be able to use it... <br />
<br />
Forage herbs: Ability to forage alchemy components.<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
Wave of Locust: Disease based slow that can be partially resisted each tick.   So it can slow from 75% down to 25% and is recalculated with each time the mob swings.  Think how fun this will be for the clerics... :)<br />
<br />
Spirit shatter: a dog buff proc that clones the dog into two pets for 3 ticks or so.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Valhalla: Damage table buff. low duration, like swift like the winds probably... 11 minutes, maybe require a alchemy potion as a reagent... cost about the same as a peridot, self only.<br />

I would rather see HoT's increased in effectiveness than make them group because most of the time the group version will be expensive and end up wasted on the casters who take little damage.<br />
<br />
I dont think shaman will get much better on quick heals, that seems to have fallen out of the job description at SoE.  But greatly improved HoT's do seem within the scope.<br />
<br />
Not all shaman participate in melee, but it is fun to do now and then and I think SoE should give us some self buffs that actually make a difference.  Attack buffs are all fine and dandy, but our damag table is ridiculous.  Buffs that effect out dagage table, or give us some uber proc, or give a damage add to each swing would be fun, probably not terribly over balancing... I am still going to be standing in the back using Cann IV and Quiescience 99% of the time.<br />

<br />
Anyway. a few ideas...<br />
