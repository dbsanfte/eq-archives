&quot;Eqgame has caused an error in EQMAIN.DLL.&quot; <br />
&quot;Eqgmae will now close.&quot; <br />

Here is the solution: EverQuest: Error loading eqmain.dll <br />
If you are receiving the small log in box right after the patch screen, this is usually temporary, and only happens when the servers are brought down for a scheduled patch. Please disregard this box and delete the following files from your EverQuest directory (by default the EverQuest directory should be located at C:/programfiles/everquest): <br />
<br />
Repatch these files once the servers have come back up. We apologize for the inconvenience, but the patch had not been completed, and an old version of the eqmain.dll file was being downloaded. <br />

Sony retains it's perfect record of being late on patch finishes  If they were smart, they would do what Scotty always did to Capt. Kirk. Tell em you need 12 hours, knowing you can finish it in 4, and finish it in 8. Look like a hero )</div></div><hr />
