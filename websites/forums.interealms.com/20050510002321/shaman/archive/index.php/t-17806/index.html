<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaman3000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why has my reputation gone down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not Gloriana but I am going to hazard a guess based on the responses to your other posts that it is because your first 44 posts are perceived to have added zero value to the boards and therefore people are considering you to be a post troller.</div></div><hr />

3. Reputation<br />
This system is a fun feature of the board, but has little practical use. Since the question &quot;What are the green dots for&quot; seems to come up quite a bit, we will address it here. <br />
<br />
A poster's reputation is denoted by the number of small green squares next to your post count. Reputation is earned and lost based on votes given by other users.<br />
<br />
If you see a person has posted a particularly helpful or insightful reply, you can click the talking head by the REPLY button on that post and give the poster a positive reputation boost. If they have posted something inappropriate you can give them negative reputation. Just because you disagree is not a good reason to give a negative reputation bump. <br />
<br />
People with high reputations give bigger positive/negative boosts when giving reputation to others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW- excellent use of the private message system. That's bound to help your rating.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your posting random crap thats no use, post farming to get next title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can check where you got negative feedback by clicking the  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/top_profile.gif button located on the top right farthest in.<br />
<br />
I would hazard a guess and say its the post farm where you refused to edit your post and just posted 5+ times in a row with one liners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaman3000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok here is my only response to the answers I got. I do not post or create any threads that are offensive or degrading. I create threads either to gain some information in regards to Ever quest Shamans or to give people the opportunity to  have some fun and talk or quote, movies, TV and, anything else in that kind of category. I AM NOT interested in how many post or replays or threads I have. It really means nothing to me. If possible i would remove that from my profile, that and the rank that comes with it. I am here to have fun and talk with others about subjects I find interesting. So when people use terms such as &quot;post farming&quot; or &quot;post troller&quot; it is meaningless. And the &quot;value&quot; of my posts only matter to me. So I will go on talking and creating subjects that I like and if anyone does not want to contribute or feel that what I have to say is worthless then fine.  Your negative attitude will not bother me at all. This is all I will say about the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I AM NOT interested in how many post or replays or threads I have. <br />
<br />
bs. i know many of us hate to admit it, but I sure as heck think its a nifty thing them little postcount titles and reputation marks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't worry about the rep thing, Shaman3000.  You got off to a rough start here, but I agree with your sentiment above.  I like that you started the Fact thread and the Simpsons thread.  Both great threads.<br />
<br />
Consider it a bit of bad luck in how things began here for you, shrug it off, and continue on as you will.  Your rep will come back if/when you make informational, helpful, insightful, etc posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, use http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/sendpm.gif to send private messages to people on the forum.  You'll find one at the bottom of each person's posts...probably other ways to do it too.  It'll help you avoid other's responses if you're not looking for them.<br />
<br />
Take care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">. And the &quot;value&quot; of my posts only matter to me. So I will go on talking and creating subjects that I like and if anyone does not want to contribute or feel that what I have to say is worthless then fine..<br />
<br />
I read your posts; the subject matter and such of the post was fine.  The issue was instead of using edit to tack on new ideas, you created a new post below it to present a new fact and did this 3+ times in a row before someone else responded.  I think you could see how its annoying to read what essentially is one idea broken into 4 posts of one sentence on each post, no?<br />
<br />
If you want an example of the problem..look at what skot____ and all the 20 or so posts made in the grey.  This is known as spamming; spamming isnt welcome at any message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The issue was instead of using edit to tack on new ideas, you created a new post below it to present a new fact and did this 3+ times in a row before someone else responded<br />
Aye, but the response that he got was so meanspirited and childish, if anything it probably encouraged him to continue making many posts rather than consolidate them.  Sometimes some of us forget that netiquette doesn't come naturally, and that not everyone has been online the past decade ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On another note - remember to be nice to good posters and bump their rep if they make a good post; but not so much as to make it meaningless.<br />
