<br />
I have played EQ only for about 20 months and was hooked within a week of loading it. Lately the constant downtime, crashes, LDs and the uselessness ( is that a word ?? ) of my preffered class has gotten me to the stage of being ready to cancel my account. Is it corporate greed that is ruining our game or just poor people ?<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though my class is becoming more and more useless, and people are claiming to be leaving for WoW....i'm going to keep playing until a better substitute comes along.  Be it WoW, City of Heros, or EQ2.  But at the moment i'm still enjoying the mid-high end PoP content.<br />
<br />
Lately i've been taking groups of friends and guildmates into Kunark/Velious zones for a breath of fresh air...maybe some of you should try it?</div></div><hr />

No. I may not like a lot of things that have happened to the shaman class lately but I had a lot of fun playing this game. Just because I think some developers need some help thinking some of their decisions through does not mean they are utterly clueless and it certainly does not make me hate them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More and more, I seem to find frustration rather than fun in EQ!<br />
<br />
I see no indication that they will correct the steady errosion of Shaman utility and lack of any significant unique ability.<br />
<br />
It seem that bugs go months without being fixed.  Or even worse, the fix just makes thing worse.<br />
<br />
Maybe all the folks at Sony with any talent are working on EQII.  They sure don't do much for EQ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talorn_W</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I feel the need to vent.   I had spent the whole morning in the Comm2 camp of Ssra.  I went LD ofcourse.   That has to be one of the worst camps in the game.  Can't even count how many hours I wasted trying to get a drop there.  Probably more like RL days, or weeks if I could count them.  I can't get back on.  My trader mule was up on the extra comp, so my friends told me spawned right after I LD'd.  So there out of the zone now, if the camps not clear when I get back on.  I'll be looking for rez and help getting my corpse, no doubt.  I know a /petition on a Sunday for a CS rez is as pointless as it is on a weekday.  I was out of game for a few weeks over the 1017, and 1018 errors.  I've been having countless video driver and sound driver issues.  Reformatted my disk a few times recently to play Everquest, my comp had so many issues both mine and there's just to stay logged in.  So yeah, I'm tired of Evercamp, Evercrash, EverLD.<br />

On a positive note:  I liked what the did for the 5 year celebration!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buggy roll out of the DX 9... with little to no regard for the customer... if they had more regard, they would have tested it more on the test server.     Yeah... people wanted the new engine and the benifits it can bring... but I didn't see people screaming &quot;giving it to me now!&quot; ... and even if we did... they should have waited till it was ready.    I know no software is likely to be 100 percent bug free, but I also know you can do a hell of a lot better than SoE has done.<br />
<br />
After I was part of the SWG beta, and actually took part... that is testing, and playing a lot... and yet they rolled it out the door anyhow, despite several obvious (and I'm sure many not obvious) bugs... I completely lost faith in them... I'm not blind to the matters of business... making money is their bottom line... and I bet you, so far, they're rocking that bottom line... they're making tons of money from monthly fees, and box sales... while at the same time cutting down support costs.<br />
<br />
They have a captive audience... for whatever your reasons, from fun to friends to boredum to not wanting to let your char go and start over... a lot of us are addicted to this game... and as long as a lot of people are... SoE can do whatever the frick they want.... because we all come back next month, and we all buy the next expansion... and yes, I know we ALL don't... but really... 1-2 people is just a blip to the bottom line, especially for ever one who &quot;quits&quot; , you see another come back.<br />
<br />
But what pisses me off even more, is that I can't log in right now... Blizzard has 24/7 support on their friggin beta servers... where the frick is our support on a game we're paying for right now... Fan Faire or not, Weekend or not, the login servers should not be down.<br />
<br />
Oh and my alt has had a petition in for 5 days, no reply at all.   I grant you... the petition isn't of major importance... but 5 fuggin days without a REPLY... is not good customer service.<br />
<br />
I'm about to change my alts last name to fucugms or something... and then with my main, petition that she has an offensive name, and see if that gets me a faster response.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do think the shaman class is basically down for the count, and won't be coming back.  There will come a point at which I leave the game (probably when WoW comes out), but I used to think of that time as more of a voluntary thing; I feel fairly close to being pushed out, now, actually.<br />
<br />
I think it's a cornerstone of SOE's vision-thing that shamans will continue to be balanced entirely around slow -- which mobs will continue to mitigate or be immune to, and which other classes can do to within a hair's breadth of our efficiency while still bringing much, much more to the table.  I don't expect us to get better at all in either healing or DPS, nor do I expect them to make buffs matter or give us anything new or creative to do to make up for the gradual loss of the worth of shaman buffs, heals, slows, melee DPS, and spell DPS.  I think they're fairly satisified with where we are now, and that's basically where we are going to stay.<br />
<br />
So no, there's no hate there, but there is quite a lot of disappointment, and no confidence whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yes i hate them.<br />
<br />
they only 'fix' classes that threaten and whine.  shaman lay out carefull numbers and get half the fix they need.<br />
<br />
they don't fix quests (trust me, or i will lay a beat down on you with unsolved and broken quests)<br />
<br />
they are not trustworthy.  i consistently bet against them telling the full truth and consistently win.  and the intention is to stall you, not to fix anything.<br />
<br />
they don't get rid of cheaters in the game.  to the point that many think it is colusion.<br />
<br />
that is just against SoE, CS is something i have not had to deal with in a long time.</div></div><hr />

UO was around sure in 97 but it was EQ that made believers out of all those developers and publishers who are making all the games for you right now.  you can ABSOLUTELY 100 percent say that DAOC and WoW would not have been produced, based on direct comments from Mythic and Blizzard<br />
<br />
the main problem that SoE has in regards to EQ is that they don't realize what business they're in.  Ray Kroc famously stumped HBS students with the question what business is McDonald's in (answer: real estate).  what sony needs to realize is that with EQ they're not in the publishing business, they're in the SERVICE business.  sure they sell you the box but what drives revenue is your monthly fee.  and being responsive to your needs entails an entirely different structure then one offing software.<br />
<br />
I dont think customer service is worse than say 3 years ago... it's always sucked</div></div><hr />

BRING BACK VERANT!<br />
<br />
hell bring back 989 studios, anyone who actually gave a damn about this game, please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do I hate SOE? That would mean I personally identified with something they have done to me with malicious intent. <br />
<br />
SOE, with EQ, is in a cycle of generating content to make folks who have done all the current/previous content stay for more. Sadly, they are under the illusion that their primary player base are these people.<br />
<br />
It has reached the point of chasing their own tail to keep the game interesting and progressive. First, additional content based on the same premise of grind, grind, grind and beat your head against the wall a number of times until you succeed has become boring. Been done since the original game came out. Second to &quot;add diversity&quot; to the original premise the new content grinding and head-beating requires nothing unique but rather repeats the same failed attempt at making the key to success any group based around the warrior-cleric-enchanter &quot;holy trinity.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is much truth to the old adage that if you wait long enough everything comes back full circle. The irony can really be appreciated when you consider the folks who are coming up with these &quot;new ideas&quot; were not around when the last group used them ... years ago.<br />
<br />
SOE/EQ do not understand their player base. There are so many potential directions this game could go in that would add so much more for players to do and experience. There is no vision to do it nor, from what I have seen as an outsider looking in, skill in their team to implement it if the vision existed. SOE/EQ are like shaman - burnt out.<br />
<br />
So, do I hate, SOE? No ... pity comes to mind though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't miss Verant in the slightest.  They were the guys who liked to make you count out coins one by one, make nothing stack, make you have trouble opening bags in the bank -- that kind of thing. Anything and EVERY LAST POSSIBLE THING to add in mind-numbing, boring time sinks...the game was ALL about making your experience as time-consuming as possible.  The  contempt for players seemed to veer into virtual hatred, as evidenced and quoted numerous times by the execs themselves.  Verant forgot their own game as soon as possible, and adopted the most blinkered outlook possible -- make it cost time, because time pads our bank accounts.  Our customers simply don't care whether they enjoy the game or whether anybody would; they are hooked and it's time to milk them hard and dry.<br />
<br />
SOE added things like graveyards and port stones and coin sliders and more bank space and many more things being stackable.  They have done lots of things that prove their vision is at LEAST as good as Verant's when it comes to just letting people have fun and get on with it without wasting time.<br />
<br />
But...they follow in line of some of the same mistakes of Verant.  Why should the value of loot absolutely skyrocket every expansion or two?  Sure, people play for upgrades, but they do so because of human psychology.  How do you quantify the psychological need?  By adding 200 hitpoints to items in the new expansion?  100? 40? 20?  How do you quantify the focuses or augments needed to make people want to play to get them, and feel satisfied when they do?  How crazily high does it have to get?  SOE's answer has been -- pretty crazily high.  <br />
<br />
And when they make new expansions have monster loot(soloable loot better than ornate anyone? one groupable elemental level loot or better?), they fall into the same trap the game has always fallen into.  Give people drastically better upgrades and let them get it according to the same old formulas for the most part -- big fat raids, or smaller groups that are truly uber, and make it stuff so far above what anyone not uber can get that you basically count most of your customers out of the rewards of the expansion not just for the foreseeable future but pretty much forever, for most of them.  Make each expansion more or less worthless to the casual player, and exorbitantly rewarding to the hard core, making the latter woop with delight at the incredible ease they have upgrading even their most pathetic low level twinks.<br />
<br />
Each time you make loot(including spell) upgrades trivialize loot in previous expansions, you have to worry far more about messing up class balances in terms of spells and abilities, and outdating previous expansions.  Upgrading?  Fine. Trivializing?  Bad move.  It's the GIMME GIMME IT ALL NOW desire being addressed with a short sighted SURE, GIMME YOUR MONEY attitude on the part of SOE.  Combined with endless flags, it makes more relaxed players burn out on the game and never really meets the needs of the truly hard core, while all the time constantly introducing balancing issues(do shamans now need a better heal for these mobs? has the nature and value of slows changed entirely?  is it cool that wizards are tanking stuff that used to wipe tanks out?).<br />
<br />
SOE has made the game much less tedious on the one hand, and fallen into the insane loot inflation race that Verant started to get into also.  Do they really want 10k necros running around anytime soon, tanking elementals?  Well, that's what they're going for.<br />
<br />
Smaller, more modest progression would do the game a world of good.  SOE, by trying to ram the quick pay-off down the gullet of the average sucker, doesn't have the trust in the player community or the understanding of psychology needed to make more than a quick buck; they lack the ability to see what makes a game worthwhile over a long period of time.  Perhaps they don't envision the game lasting too much longer?  <br />
<br />
At any rate, looking at the game in a shallow way(probably the majority of shamans and hybrid tanks seem to feel SOE has done so during this expansion, for instance) makes SOE seem like they lack a lot of forethought.  They seem to have fallen for the holy trinity they had long since previously learned was very limiting and very trying for players, rewarding some players exorbitantly for choosing certain classes and punishing or ignoring the needs of everyone else simply to get a group reliably and PLAY.  Slow mitigation was a time bomb waiting to explode; and it finally has.  There is no instance in which I wouldn't recommend either a beastlord or an enchanter instead of a shaman at present.  It's just that it has taken until GoD to show people how weak shaman truly are to make the implicit obvious, and wise up the slow learners and encourage them to take classes who can not just slow, but slow AND.<br />
<br />
Verant was no walk in the park.  Their contempt for the customer was breathtaking.  In those terms, SOE seem like bumblers.  They don't hate the customer and want to make him waste every possible second of time humanly imaginable without consideration that the customer might not like that idea; but they don't have any real vision either.  They're assembling the future of the game like someone painting by numbers, more or less mechanically and without real understanding.  In a business of customers, you can't forget to sell the customer; SOE isn't cranking out widgets -- they have to dig in there and get their hands dirty relating to people and their needs if they want people to stay.  <br />
<br />
Because when it comes to game mechanics -- there will be other games out there very soon.  And EQ doesn't necessarily fulfill enough needs successfully enough to not lose at least some money when that happens.  They are not even close to the point at which they can consider resting on their laurels and just cranking out more or less interchangeable expansions without considering the implications of their designs.  In fact, they will have to play some very serious catch-up as things stand.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the holy trinity is about as deep as SOE's insight into the game goes, since they actually made the foolish mistake of coming BACK to it after it had previously been eliminated as a game-crippling handicap.  The extra need for flags and keys in yet another expansion hardly helps.  Slows and buffs -- dead and gone, forget it.  They're over, as issues, and will likely never be meaningfully adjusted or addressed again.  I doubt heals will either, so I would just suggest perhaps more DPS as the only likely way they'll do any further work of note on shamans at all; failing their doing so, I would suggest turning your shaman into an alt or two-box toon while you powerlevel your main, and if you can play more than one toon on  raids, using your shaman to malos and buff on raids while you concentrate on a class SOE actually has it within the scope of their talents and desire to develop and address -- healers and DPS.  Or perhaps a chanter.</div></div><hr />

The graphics engine shouldn't have been pushed out when it did. They weren't under pressure, they could've taken the extra week on the test server to fix the collision issues, the /rewind issues, the stuck behind ladders so bad you need to gate out issues.<br />

Gates expansion, a pure money maker.  Usable only at 65, they nonetheless marketted it for 50+.  It's bs.  Leadership AAs only impact you if you have the expansion FYI.   Having a certain tradeskill have cheap combines when it first comes out, and then nerfed later.   In other words... very blatant bait and switch tactics.  I'm proud to say none of my three accounts have gates enabled.<br />

I've also cancelled 2 of the three accounts.<br />

The silence on shaman balancing is just a small straw to be honest.  Enchanters and Clerics get a 1212 dmg nuke, shamans get zilch, that's just not fair, period.  In any case, though, the beserkers are even worse. Beserkers as a class should not have been implemented, they cannot get the classes right as they are... instead of beserkers, they should've come up with a new city for trolls, give them a new home instead of being stuck in Neriak.<br />
<br />
I haven't even looked at EQ2, I'm sick and tired of this blatant crap.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, gates requires &quot;tactics&quot; ? Tactics meaning a 8k+ tank, a cleric (or two), and an enchanter. That is NOT TACTICS.  Tactics is smarter AI from the NPCs. Where are rogue mobs backstabbing for 5k, the paladin mobs that are healing themselves and slaying the necromancer in lich form... where are the ranger NPCs shooting arrows at you (ala blackburrow gnolls, or dagnor's cauldron gnolls).<br />
<br />
Oh, and Why the heck is the fabled junk still active? Just to piss off the younger community? It's working...<br />

<br />
It has always been cool to hate SOE. however they earned their reputation customer service stinks. Bugs go unfixed for months or are never fixed. <br />
<br />
Hate is a strong word I dont hate them but they really need to get a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't hate.  Despise is more the word I would use.<br />
<br />
Like everyone has said, their lack of customer service has made it really hard to like them.<br />
<br />
And what really sucks, is generally the Dev's and GM's get blamed for this.  But they shouldn't.  It's the people sitting in their little offices giving out orders that are the problem.  They are the ones completely out of touch with the game.  They Dev's are just given a job that they have to present at the time they want it, regardless of if they are ready or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">but it was EQ that made believers out of all those developers and publishers who are making all the games for you right now.  you can ABSOLUTELY 100 percent say that DAOC and WoW would not have been produced, based on direct comments from Mythic and Blizzard<br />
<br />
I think the reason Mythic and Blizzard are making the same kind of game is that they realize what a huge potential customerbase exists for games like these if they dont do like Verant/SOE and focus 95% of their energy on satisfying 5% of their customers.<br />
<br />
I have atleast 10 friends that think EQ sounds cool but they arent playing &amp; paying because they dont have the time needed to do almost anything in EQ. It never seized to amaze me that SOE dont realize that they earn just as much on having me as a customer as someone that plays 4-8 hours a day.<br />
<br />
I know SOE likes to brag about how many customers they have but if Blizzards hardware can handle it and they make a more casual oriented and fun game I think they can easily double or quadruple SOE's record.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I stopped hating Verant/SOE long ago - now I just really dont care since they passed my threshold of inept customer-relations.</div></div><hr />

It's a bit of a read, I'm sure it's been on crucible before in some extent, but shows a lot of the reasoning behind why Sony works on &quot;satisfying 5%&quot;, if Sony's focus is even that large is questionable IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">No. I may not like a lot of things that have happened to the shaman class lately but I had a lot of fun playing this game. Just because I think some developers need some help thinking some of their decisions through does not mean they are utterly clueless and it certainly does not make me hate them.<br />
<br />
I 100% agree with this statement.  I love playing this game, I have lots of fun playing it.  EQ is just a chat room with a point.  If I try to log in and the servers are down...I have 1,000,000 other things I can do...(play Far Cry (kick ass game)).  Getting mad at the game defeats the purpose of playing.  I have been more pissed at some of the pinheads that play if more then I have been pissed at SOE.  I have not had any direct customer service issues tho.</div></div><hr />

I love it when people bag on Blizzard in general and Diablo 2 in particular as examples of bad games, people burn out, etc... and that WoW will end up the same.  This article is several years old from market research firm NPD:<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuting in June, 2000 Diablo II has dominated PC game charts with sales of 4 million copies worldwide according to NPD INTELECT* and key retail accounts around the world. The game has also been awarded several accolades including the prestigious Computer Game of the Year, Computer Role Playing Game of the Year and Game of the Year for 2001 by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.<br />
<br />
When the original Diablo was released in 1997, it was considered a critical success and reached number one on NPD INTELECT* during its first month in stores. The game has sold in excess of 2.5 million copies worldwide and was honored as the number-one selling computer role-playing game in 1997 as well as being named Game of the Year by Computer Gaming World.<br />
<br />
Blizzard’s track record includes six number-one selling games and multiple Game of the Year awards. The company’s free Internet gaming service Battle.net® reigns as the largest in the world with millions of active users.<br />

Yeah, I'm sure they are very few people interested in a casual-friendly MMORPG put out by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The question was: Do you all hate SOE?<br />
<br />
The answer: Absolutely not. Thanks to SOE for a highly entertaining MMORPG that I have enjoyed too much for too long. It is a shame that my selected avatar no longer has a place in SOE's vision. So long and thanks for the memories. End Billing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I just read the above link. Very interesting. Explains some of SOEs current ideology.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I wouldn't say that I hate SOE, but rather that I've had two enjoyable runs with EQ spanning over two years of serious playing time, had a lot of fun with it, and choose to not continue to play it since it's not enjoyable to me anymore.<br />
<br />
I would guess that most EQers get years of enjoyment out of EQ - and I'd say that it's pretty rare when a game can keep your attention to the point of addiction where you play for hours on end, day after day, for several years.<br />
<br />
A game that lasts as long as EQ, as evidenced by EQ's evolution, will likely change over time as it's expanded and refined.  There's no guarantee that all players will like all changes to a game like EQ over the years of it's evolution.<br />
<br />
But, if like me, you get a few years of serious enjoyment out of your EQ experiences I think you've &quot;won&quot; and had a lot of good times.  Even if you are now bored with EQ or somehow feel bitter about EQ, you should probably still be thankful for all the fun and amazing experiences you've had via EQ.<br />
<br />
Personally, rather than continue with EQ when it's really not that fun to me I'm taking a break and waiting for a new MMORPG, since I love the genre.  I think that by playing some great stand alone games and avoiding MMORPGs for a while I'll get a little bit of extra freshness and enjoyment when a worthy new MMORPG eventually releases (hopefully one or more of WoW, EQ2, or DnL will be worthy).  I've been playing some MMORPG constantly since EQ first release - either EQ, DAoC, or AC.  It feels good to take a break from the genre entirely.  However, the amount of enjoyment I can get from stand-alone games, no matter how great they are, pales to the enjoyment I get from a good MMORPG - so I hope like heck that a decent new one releases soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I enjoy eq most the time... but I have about as much love for soe itself as they have for us shamans<br />
<br />
well said. The problem is we still dont know what soe thinks of us. :)</div></div><hr />
