<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright so im 46 and i quit playing right after LOY came out. Well like everyone else every other time im back again. From what i read here stoicism is like a mini-torpor (yay) and is obtainable by a very simple quest (double yay!). So basically my question is when i get this spell is my ikky BP significantly less useful? If yes, what is a good replacement?<br />
im not in a guilld and have maybe 3k saved and might be able to strech up to 10k with some work.<br />
<br />
Zen<br />
<br />
ps. how do you get to the loy zones. that might be important.</div></div><hr />

Keep your ikky BP until you have a very nice stats BP to replace it.  That extra regen goes a long way, even with stoicism.  I didn't sell my fungi until I had both torpor and a vindi BP.<br />
<br />
LOY zones are off of stonebrunt (I think thats the zone name - its behind paineel.)  Once you get to the zone, use your in-game map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ikky bp is still a very good choice for your level of a shaman, even with Stoicism, which isn't quite as efficient as Torpor . . . actually nowhere near as efficient.  But it's still lightyears better than nothing.  <br />
Zone into Stonebrunt from The Warrens which you get to thru Paineel.  Then run East until you see the water, follow the shore to the boat, click on the door next to the dock and you zone to Gulf of Gunthak.  Levitate and run across the water to the shore (need invis after you get there), hug right side and there's a passage thru the cliffs . . . make all right turns and you get to some docks, go along docks to the wall, then take a left and take immediate right to a zoneline to Dulak Harbor.  Take your first left and you'll start seeing drunken pirates here and there.  You gotta kill those until you get an Empty Flask.  Then go back to the Gulf, bout halfway between the shore and the lighthouse, there's a spirit in this overturned sunken boat you hail and do a dialogue and just follow the instructions he gives you, which include giving him the flask at some point, then you get a log or something, give that back when you're ready to fight some stuff and two elementals spawn Flotsam and Jetsam and you kill them (easy) and then loot a piece from each and hail the ghost again and give him the two pieces for the spell as reward.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can scrap up 10k, get yourself a horse/drogma. It'll help more than any breastplate when outside.<br />
<br />
Drogma costs slightly more for the cheapest (9k), but now that you have to have models on, the lack of a head in the way is a good thing! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Land wrote it up pretty well - but you should still check the thread in the Spells section, which includes advice on killing pirates and the exact loc for the spirit (it is underwater, so a pain to just go looking for).<br />
<br />
I got Stoicism at 61 (no Torpor) and use it a lot, with my fungi even.  This spell will not eliminate the value of your regen BP.  Stoicism regens me faster than a lot of mobs (non-PoP) damage me.  But the BP regens me all the time with no mana cost.  and they stack!</div></div><hr />
