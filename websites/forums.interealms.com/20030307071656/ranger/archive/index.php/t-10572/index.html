<br />
Journeyman Boots do not make you immune to being rooted.  They're a lesser, toned down, movement increasing item.  Regardless of class, they are essential to PVP on Rallos-Zek.  Without them, and sow dispelled, you're done for.<br />
<br />
Kick doesn't interrupt casting, it has no stun effect ever for rangers (unlike warriors at higher levels).  With fast weapons, a level 20'ish caster should never continue casting anyway.<br />
<br />
This guide is geared towards fighting magicians... and one of the most useful things to know about a magician is that MAGICIANS NEVER GET A ROOT/SNARE SPELL.<br />
<br />
Their pet can root, just root it then snare it... snare the magician and beat the snot out of him, very easy to do.  Once a magician gets epic, things are a bit nastier as their pets are basically Gods with great magic resists :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vigg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">holy crap that entire &quot;guide&quot; was a joke.  next let's post some lvl 7 ranger's 15 page lecture on post-luclin ranger class balance based on his many insight-granting experiences while camping crushbone belts.  props on trying to get a library of ranger strategies up on the site but you'd be way better off if you just deleted that noob's clueless ramblings about ranger pvp and either got somebody who knows what they're talking about to write one or did without a pvp guide altogether.</div></div><hr />
