<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 65 shaman, ele flagged with some ele gear and almost 200AA.  But neverbought a horse or droga yet.  Was wondering if others find it very useful for soloing in ele areas like Pofire?  I like the horse look better but is the head/targeting a big issue?  Just shrink?  I could get the fast horse.  Just wondering what others advise in similar situation?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xersiusvz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have used both and am sticking with the drogmor (or whatever is called) at this point.  The horses head always got in my way and i have much less difficulty with the drogmor.  Shrink does help however.<br />
<br />
As for if it's useful.... I couldn't imagine soloing in fire without it.  It speeds up the killing process a ton for me using pox, bane, blood, breath, epic (yay), and occasionally anathema or ancient bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started with a horse, and when I couldn't take the head issues anymore I broke down and bought a drogma. I sold the horse back about 5 minutes later and never looked back. I recently bought the chain drogma and it's amusing to rodeo your way to a destination.<br />
<br />
It's all aesthetics really. If you want the smoother gait and annoying head go for a horse. If you want the sea-sickness inducing gait but no targetting issues go for the drogma.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On my barb,  with just one shrink, I don't see the horse head except when moving.  I used to have to shrink twice but apparently the new graphic engine has changed it.<br />
<br />
I couldn't take the drogmar, it made me motion sick! :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DROGMOR!<br />
<br />
Definitely the Drogmor all the way.  Now that they have fixed the running animation so that you're not bucking around like a rodeo clown it's all about the Drogmor.  Every time I see one the theme music for ghostbusters runs thru my head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can buy chain bridles?<br />
<br />
anyway, how much is the absolute fastest drogmor in the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can buy Chain Bridle but not ornate chain.  Ornate chain drops off of a raid mob in Seru and in SSRA.<br />
<br />
Not sure of fastest Drogmar you can buy but I think its same speed as the chain bridle, and not the ornate chain.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As an ogre, shrinking twice totally removes the head from my display. And doesn't show up when targeting things in front of me either.<br />
<br />
A bug i hope they don't fix ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit* i speel gud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I intially bought the dogmar but now that they changed the running I sold it for a horse.  I don't like the skating or fast walking lizard look.  I am riding a mount and expect some movement when at full run.  I would always switch to third person  when galloping on the lizard.  I have had no problem at all targeting on my new  horse.  Maybe they changed that when the lizard stopped running.  I did have trouble looting with the lizard.  <br />
<br />
Since it seems that  SOE may have fix the problem with both types of mounts it comes down to looks.  BTW when selling the 100K mount you lose little less than 30k in the transaction.</div></div><hr />

I absolutely love my Seru horse.  It's definitely the way to go.  I don't see the head of the horse when shrunk and the horse rides nicer and is much prettier than those icky lizards, IMHO :D  But I'm a woman and you may not be and may not care how cute your horse is! LOL</div></div><hr />
