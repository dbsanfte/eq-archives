His childish bragging and attitude is clearly all just part of an elaborate uber-guild joke, he obviously operates on a level of comic genious far beyond our comprehension.<br />

Sorry, but that's funny, and he does have a very good point when he comments on the items that drop from these encounters.  Most of it is shockingly bad when you consider the lovely &quot;Risk versus Reward&quot; comparison.</div></div><hr />

I mean people put up with Mouthy &quot;actors&quot;. All they can do is pretend to be someone else.<br />

People worship and love a guy that can put a ball into a hoop. Great Job skill there.<br />
<br />
People fall over themselves when a supermodel that eats lettuce and celery smiles thier way. <br />
<br />
People Belive that a comedians timing is more important that others dying halfway around the world.<br />
<br />
Basicly people are stupid. Individuals are smart. (Sometimes)<br />
<br />
Furor is a jerk on the boards, yet he can motivate 65 people to do things each and every day, moving in a concerted effort to accomplish goals. <br />

Just think about it a bit. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I see one problem with this, they got no more new content, so the people of Veeshan will suffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I disagree that people make fun of Furor out of jealousy cause he's the leader of a very powerful guild. Look at Tigole of Legacy of Steel. He's much funnier and more charismatic, and leads a similarly powered guild. Not many make fun of Tigole. Maybe it's because Tigole doesn't feel the need to tell everyone he has a giant penis and that everyone who isn't in his guild sucks.<br />
<br />
I acknowledge Furor's guilds accomplishments with respect. However, I still think Furor is just a pathetic person. Grats to FoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just wait till a guild kills the new Emperor(definitely harder, but more fun). When that happens VT is going to get revamped and made harder. New loot will be dropping and old loot will be upgraded, so that it will take again some time to learn the zone- The loot dropping there will be so superior that you will not want to farm other mobs.<br />
So if Veeshan will suffer, it will probably be for like a month tops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoP items, by definition, must be better than VT,otherwise why buy expansion_004?. At this point FoH people are already likely to have +100hp items and all their stats/resists where they would like them. There is a game limit of +125hp/slot, so how much better can you really make these things? (ok, besides the really mental ones that looked like Sebilis drops)<br />
<br />
I guess melee can get a whole new set of pimped caster abilities on their PoP weapons, but ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've got a ton of respect for FoH. In my mind they are without a doubt the greatest guild in EverQuest in terms of pure power, strategy and execution. They do **** that no one else has done before. Granted, Furor &amp; Co. have potty mouths, but so do I and I'm sure a lot of you out there do too. I find his posts amusing and tend to lighten my day. <br />
<br />
Fires of Heaven has been the premier uberguild in EverQuest since commercial release (and perhaps beta as well?), and they're had to put up with so much crap from people begging them for strategies, loot info, quest info and whatnot as to drive a person crazy. That's not even mentioning the fact that the people on top are often hated and subject to criticism and jealousy from those who have not achieved as much as they have. <br />
<br />
Hats off to FoH in their latest and greatest achievement. Well done.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... maybe because only 0.5 % of all players will ever see VT? And those 0.5 % will buy PoP anyway in order to kill the most, the fastest, first, again. The other 99.5 % will buy it to get new loot. The ubers will look for something big to kill and post a pic of the corpse.<br />

I bet that you will see Furor go off on a ballistic whine if the loot in PoP isnt as good as he thinks it should be. And he will also bitch about it if others can get the same loot as FoH without having spent all the time doing the timesinks needed to enter VT.<br />
<br />
But with all that said I still think they do an amazing job of &quot;winning&quot; in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">and I repeat.. it's a game.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna be all wowed and amazed because you killed something first or cleared a zone etc, in a game.<br />
<br />
To see some of the attitudes people have over virtual items trips me out sometimes.  Do something in real life that's amazing and I may give you a kudo or two.  But doing something in EQ?   Gratz and all but damn, don't act like you just conqured the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OT all (some of it anyway):<br />
<br />
All in all it doesn't matter.. By the way it all is written, it sounds as if the person is a real nerd in RL, so he spends a lot of time behind his PC and uses &quot;big and salty&quot; words to make up the missing &quot;prowess&quot; in his real life. Bah, in any case it doesn't matter, and their 'results' leave me really cold. Why to get hyped up about something, which is just a bunch of bits and bytes on some server, what you will never really own? And when one day the product (EQ in this case) would be discontinued, all these &quot;uber&quot; items and chars would end up in one big Recycle Bin like the rest of the trash and not-so-trash bits and bytes.. So who cares, the end result is still the same for them, nothing different.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that very soon, the betas - and later the games themselves - are out, new products and such ones, which will be above this EQ anyway. I personally will cancel the account and move on, and can't care less about what is going on here. The upcoming titles do not have such a flawed design anyway as EQ does, and there will be no &quot;room&quot; for EQ'ish 'uber guilds' anyway. They came with EQ, and they go down with EQ. Unless, unless EQ2 will have the same flawed design, then they can of course move on and live on there. But then again, I aint worrying about EQ2 anyway, it's something I aint getting..</div></div><hr />

I've only met a few people (most of which being my brothers) that play the game.. but none have been nerds... even the uberest of people who have had serverwide firsts are quite normal...<br />

What Valka is saying is, it will be difficult to keep Vex Thal from going the way of Veeshan's Peak.<br />

Anyway congratulations to FoH, looks like they're the first to conquer this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">i don't see the connection between a zone &quot;going the way of veeshan's peak&quot; (that's a good comparison btw ;)) and &quot;buying the next expansion&quot; ... for all we know, the people that conquered VP fast and furious (read: the uberguilds) still bought velious. those that burned down ToV, ST, PoM (uh..), Tunare, AoW, still bought Luclin. it's not all in the loot. the first tier guilds play to kill stuff, and kill it first if they can. getting loot is a side effect.<br />
They will still buy PoP, even if every single member of the guild has a full set of all the VT items they can wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Gikk, maybe I'd believe that if Furor could form a single sentence without the words &quot;cock&quot; or &quot;fag&quot; in it, or some reference to homosexuals.

<br />
Back to the subject of the original post, yes grats to FoH but also credit to all 4 guilds beta-testing this zone for us. I hope their work pays off in teh end and makes this zone worth the effort. The damn emp. key is bad enough but to actually camp the 10 luclin shards for the Vex Thal key is just mind numbing. I have my Emp key but ZERO shards so now the real test of endurance is starting. ANYways, the drops are absolutly insane i imagine PoP will require a 1600+ ac since there is a 70 ac back item posted on Afterlife's web site. I am glad that only the best of the best can enjoy this zone. It has a 2 part effect 1) frees other content for smaller guilds wanting a shot at NToV or some of the luclin mobs 2) gives an entire zone to just the insanly dedicated players where to spend countless hours. <br />
The emporer is basically unkillable now due to his 4000 point AE and some other details with it. Its gonna be a little while before another guild gets in their. Rumor has it that that is by design so VI can test VT with the current guilds raiding there. *shrug* i dont really know though just repeating rumors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note, grats to FoH on Aten. We killed her lastnight, she's no pushover. I do find it interesting that people here that have never been to VT are saying it is too easy.....let me fill you in on the zone.  Takes 4-5 days to clear out the entire zone, getting around inside is harder then in any other zone by a long shot. If you wipe in a bad spot, there is a really good chance you will have to SC and start over at the zone in....and getting back to where you wiped might take you 2-3 hours. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, I almost forgot. Aten dropped this nice shaman BP :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">taken from FoH site<br />
&quot;NOW - the next step is to find the guy that made this item, sit him down in a room, put all VT loot in front of him, lock the door to the room with him inside, and come back in 24 hours. <br />
<br />
When you open the door, you will more than likely find that 1) Your itemization woes are over and 2) He has a working cure for cancer. <br />
<br />
This is what the end game should look like. &quot;<br />

It would be cool to see more information coming out on VT.   Trion has some new updates.   First hand updates on a zone that's almost impossible to reach for normal players is bound to be interesting reading.  <br />
<br />
Maybe our brother/sister Shaman that have been there can offer a bit of prespective on our role/interaction in VT.</div></div><hr />

In a way I kinda started it with my parenthetical comment about Furor's behavior on his webpage (which I will edit out now), so for that I gotta apologize.<br />
<br />
But I just thought it was a cool development (considering, to my knowledge, that this is the first time VT has ever been cleared) that others here might be interested in.<br />
<br />
Still some awesome loot :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Mukas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I usually work with 4 shaman in the zone including myself. We are about halfway through the boss mobs I think. Names are confusing and I don't really keep track of em. They drop Phat lootz that is for sure. Eoms are nasty. Shaman can do alot in that zone besides the debuff slow routine.<br />
<br />
Before yesterday I thought the zone was too easy. We entered some new parts of the zone and believe me it is a challenge. I am hoping Magister will have a nice update this weekend with a dead Aten Ha Ra.<br />
