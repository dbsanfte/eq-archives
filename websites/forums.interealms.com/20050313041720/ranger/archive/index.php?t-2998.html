<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could some people look at this list and add/move mobs as they think they are in difficulty. Just recently (like last week) my guild got off the kick that all 70 members should have thier epic NOW (at my constant urging) and are moving onto new mobs/fights.<br />
<br />
We have about 40-45 people we can muster in guild for raids. Have a 60 monk to pull, 60 war to tank. Average on a full blown guild raid is 55ish etc.. With our strenght being melee in numbers, but caster in lvls.<br />
<br />
We have yet to set foot into ToV, never killed a kunark dragon etc.., and until last week we were happy to just kill VS when it was our turn on the rotation. Well we decided to try Lord Bob and that was cake so we did Velketor and we took him down on our first try and lost 2 tanks in the process. According to this list we went from VS to Velketor...<br />
<br />
Anyway I have this list and we're looking at what else we can do now. Any suggestions?? Thanks in advance as I'm not the guild raid leader but I'm the offical pain in the ass that is constantly griping about trying harder stuff.<br />

Innoruuk aint worth the effort, really.  Most 32k mobs I can't give an opinion on anymore because they die 5th round of combat there abouts :p<br />

geez your list is huge, there's a brief overview of the ones that stand out to me.<br />
<br />
In class so I had time to think on it, if you want my opinion on what mobs to shoot for next it would be something like: Trak, Vindicator, hell if you guys are just starting; tear through western wastes, maybe toss in a rhag 1 and possibly 2 if you are feeling spanky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one else can comment on whether or not this scale looks close? If we could get a real good refined one we could sticky it somewhere on the glade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dangrim</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I would say you should start doing HoT, gank every outdoor dragon you can, Trak if you can etc. It will give you a good way to equip your guild and get the first feel for raiding.<br />
<br />
You can also take a few groups and roam around in DN, they got some nice weapons from there. I aint to good on low/mid level raiding in SoL but I think UP might have several different targets you can practice on. Vindicator at every chance of course, his BP is a steal... Jugg raids with two groups for spells for your casters and some raiding cash to pay for dots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can do Velk/Lord Bob, you have a realistic shot at Vindicator. I know several Guilds have used him as training ground for Vindi. If you can do those mobs, go to Halls of Testing and get Skyshrine armor, farm it until everyone's eye's bleed and you are geared up.<br />
Any old kunark dragon should be doable with a bit of strategy. 32k hitpoints isn't much anymore. Gorenaire might still be a stretch, she's a cast iron wench even these days, unless you cheat with Manaburn wizards. (Ok so I'm jealous of the 4 wizard nuke team :))<br />
<br />
Any epic mob should be easily doable. I'm not sure on Luclin, haven't had a chance to play there much yet.<br />
<br />
As far as a scale goes, I'm not 100% sure any would be accurate. Some mobs take more melee then wizards. Some require certain classes/levels to make it easier etc.<br />
<br />
I know guilds that wipe doing things we consider easy and succeed on things my guild considers hard *shrug*<br />
<br />
I tend to lean towards if you can handle this mob, you can probably handle these mobs and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You shouldnt have any problems doing HoT / west wing ToV with that raid force, hell one group of level 60 could prolly do either if they had the right setup ;)<br />
<br />
One thing to remember tho is to make sure people learn the basics of raiding, thats something that can really make or break a raid (and in the long run a guild) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of those fights are really much different than other fights.  And how easy they are is effected by what classes, levels, and number of people.<br />
<br />
For example, Gorenaire's slow makes it so that melees are worthless in the fight, their just meat shields for gore to eat on while the nukers do damage.  <br />
<br />
But I agree, just take a shot at stuff.  Also, start farming HoT or ToV west with your 55+ people.  The aggregate result of gearing everyone in quest armor is quite significant.</div></div><hr />
