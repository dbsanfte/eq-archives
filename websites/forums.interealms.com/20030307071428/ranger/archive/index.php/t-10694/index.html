<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keadaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i thought mabe in eq2 you could start of with alittle money like 2 pp or so. because i thought it werid when in eq 1 you dont get any money like in every other rpg i have played. but i guess it would be becaues ppls would just keep on makeing new char<br />
just for the money o well just i thought i had to post</div></div><hr />

You could give the stuff to other people or your main toon, but you could only delete characters once a week.. personally, I prefer starting with nothing as then you have a bit more control over your characters, there's no inflation of money, and it is manageable to start out anyways in EQ.</div></div><hr />
