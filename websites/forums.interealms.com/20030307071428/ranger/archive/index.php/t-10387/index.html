<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which partner Cleric or Druid?<br />
<br />
I have a level 60 cleric and 55 druid. Each are on a separate account. I currently 2nd box my druid and play the cleric as my main. One of these priests are going into retirement so I can play a ranger. <br />
<br />
BTW, this is not a which class can PL my ranger quickest post. I am looking for some opinions on a long term 2nd box duo. I play for a few hours each night after my friends log off and the cleric/druid duo is worthless.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Renwin Everfool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Both have positives. Druid can get you around fast to many places to hunt. Cleric can allow you to hunt a higher variety of mobs. With new Druid heals, they are not as limited in supporting a Tanking Ranger as they once were. Dots &amp; Nukes are nice to help reduce the need for healing, as the mob dies faster!  Still, Cleric buffs, heals, fears, stuns, and of course REZ make them very versatile.Other than ports, Ranger covers all the same traveling limitations that a Druid does, as Clerics don't travel well.<br />
<br />
 I'd move one so they would be on the same account, and can play your Ranger with either depending on how you feel! :D <br />

The guy's a warlord though.</div></div><hr />
