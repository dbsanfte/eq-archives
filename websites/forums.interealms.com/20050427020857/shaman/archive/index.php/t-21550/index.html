<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zurack36</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got flagged for KT. Has anyone tried soloing by entrance?<br />
Are the mobs rootable??? Any info would be great thankz.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some things in KT (Kod'Taz junkilo :p) don't summon and are soloable. I've root-rotted there a few times but got bored of having to be so cautious.  The dogs are N A S T Y, and if you get something that summons it hurts. A lot. Everything else pretty much has to be avoided; snake and llama ladies have those swarm pets, the giant purple guys flurry...it's a mess!<br />
<br />
iirc Most of the Anueks (aka flying geometry disasters) and Mastruqs (reddish-purple guys with white hair) don't summon and are easily root-rotable.  Pulls can be tough there.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer the Ferubi zone in (on the Qinimi side).  The first 5-8 mobs in the place are pullable solo and nothing summons (go go root rot), and they die fast.  You can tank in teh face if you want some action, but make sure those suckers are slowed before they're anywhere near you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've soloed in KT and Yxtta (west entrance).  Hynids, nocs, cragbeasts do not summon in Yxtta. I think ukuns are rootable and don't summon also. Mastruqs are sometimes immune to root.  I think all kyvs are immune to root.  Ra'tuks summon and flurry.  The ones you can kill have about 40% less hp than doomfire guardians and give between 9-12% AAXP per kill.  Use MR-based roots as they seem less resistant to MR than to DR.  VP3 breaks early most times.  My problem is finding a steady flow of mobs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some of the random trash drops in KT are kinda nice. Its nice to see trash drop good loot in GoD. Having to best a named is not always the easiest thing =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried to solo yesterday, but had a mage at ZI to CoH a few times, because it didnt work for me...<br />
first i tried to pull a Hynid with DR debuff and tried VP got resisted then i tried pull with malos and rooted the mob, but after the first dot i got summoned so i oretty much gave up on the whole solo in KT thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At least some, and possibly all, hynids and cragbeasts in KT summon.  You choose poorly (if unknowingly).<br />
<br />
The ra'tuk in KT are safe, if you can deal with the enormous melee box and flurry.  The ukun likewise, although they have some scary burst dps when root breaks.  I've heard good thigns about soloing the aneuks, but haven't tried them myself.  Kyvs just move too fast to be a good solo target - possibly if you had a means of assured escape from combat, and gambled on the first root landing.  Ikaavs and ixt should just be avoided.  Golems are fairly easy fights when single, as many of them are shaman and will waste time casting Bane of Nife instead of hammering your skull in - but they have many more hp than typical KT mobs.<br />
<br />
I can't speak as well for Yxtta soloing.  There're a couple of druids that tend to set up shop there, so I havent' gotten much time alone with the locals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kyv and noc have a melee range attack, so still can hurt when you are out of melee range. Kyv use it often, while noc spend alot of time standing around doing nothing.<br />
Ra tuk are tough, unless you root them straight off, and ukun are just plain nasty.<br />
I never tried an aneuk, as most are clerics and i hate fighting clerics.<br />
Ikaav and Ixt summon pets, so are more trouble than they're worth.<br />
<br />
Hunting the Yxtta zone line isn't bad, i usually kill the first 2 statics and a roamer, and have a little time to spare before repops.</div></div><hr />
