<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit EQ to go play FFXI in October, the wear rate of FFXI has finally caught up with me (you start to notice the treadmill at lv10, i couldnt imagine going all the way to 75, not to mention leveling subjob to 37 for full effectivness...)<br />
I'm just wondering, what has changed in the ways of EQ, and more specifically the ways of my shamanic brothers and sisters in that six months, I know there's been another expansion, but that's about all I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you look like you retired in a mix of Velious and Ornate gear, so... nothing. Playstyle in PoP Tier I/II and LDoN is the same as when you left. Except that Q now heals more each tic. You don't need GoD. <br />
<br />
There, you're all caught up - welcome back - I think they still have your mug at the tavern, way in the back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bugs, huge friggin bugs with huge friggin crashes.  Say hello to my little friend...DX9.  Welcome back, don't mind the lock-ups and freezes in PoK.  Oh yeah, the whole GoD thing...just pretend it doesn't exist.  If you get the chance to farm Time, then you have a reason to buy GoD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sensing alot of negativity here...<br />
<br />
That's only the begining.  The negativity is about all some here seem to have left.<br />
<br />
The DX9 upgrade has seriously affected many players systems and there are graphic bugs all over.  Many have been fixed many haven't.  Some people have lock-ups and crashes, others don't. SOE is working on it but having trouble duplicating it so they are pretty much clueless so far.  I don't have crashes but have noticed warping bugs, lag issues, and MoBs half buried in the floor.<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord has alienated a huge chunk of the 65+AAs crowd.  SOE changed horses on us and went for short fights against high damage MoBs.  Almost everyone outside of the &quot;holy trinity&quot; was unable to adventure there without significant difficulty.  They retuned content yesterday but I haven't heard if the problems have been resolved satisfactorily yet or not.<br />
<br />
SOE is working on making things better but I fear that if they don't do something before WoW comes out we will be looking at a wasteland that used to be home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most of the negativity comes from really stupid decisions by SOE and their inability to fix alot of the bugs.  The game, assuming you don't have alot of bugs, is still fine.  GoD is a complete clustersmuck, just avoid it until they finish Beta testing it in live.<br />

<br />
Glad to see you are thinking of coming back. Get your butt back to WoT, they are low on shaman now me and a couple of others quit - I still read the boards, just don't have any incentive to play :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe, Kev!<br />
Heard you'd quit, shame, you only ever seem to be quit while I'm playing &amp; tother way round...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To play the devils advocate, Im actually still having fun (though this is mostly the point of view of a rogue, I consider my shaman a dual boxed alt).  It would appear though a lot have left EQ in the high end game (bugs in high end GoD that halt progression) and a bunch from my guild are taking breaks for CoH and just summer type breaks from raid burnout I guess.<br />
<br />
I havent done a whole lot in GoD except a bunch of raids in Ferubi and trials 1-4 with my rogue.  Guild broke into elementals a few months ago so we are focusing our time there and having Im having a lot of fun there.  Still do LDoN's for gear upgrades and some xps, didnt really burn myself out on it like many, 176ish wins.  I dont really do xp groups anymore between LDoN and raiding.<br />
<br />
Had to buy 2 new video cards for my PCs since the DX9 patch and like others, still have lockups now and then and sometimes mobs appear half in the ground, but both of those are fairly infrequent and I really needed new vid cards anyway.<br />
<br />
The new expansion of new levels, new spells and abilities as well as an epic v2 sound promising and exciting to me, I havent pre-ordered it yet, but I always do a week or so before it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm still having fun, but I only set foot in GoD to max out alchemy.  My guild is in the elementals and that's more fun for me right now.</div></div><hr />
