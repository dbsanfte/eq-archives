<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That you can pop Spiritual Channelling and your best HoT, and since buff timers never wear out there, and SC and HoTs are both buffs, you can buff the whole raid, group by group (saving mgb if you want), and be FH/FM when you're done? And that the SC reuse timer starts when you cast it, even if you have it up in the guild hall for an hour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That'd be nice.. if any of our raids started in the guildhall:)  I think I'd get /smacked for even asking if an Inku'ta raid can meet in the guildhall first hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why wouldn't an inktu'ta raid meet there? there's a wayfarer right outside.  You buff, send a rogue to get expedition, everyone else runs in from Qvic zone-in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whats a guild hall.. and why does that sound suspiciously exploitive :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the last expansion they added a guild hall. You can go there, and it puts all your buffs on hold and there is also a mana pool so you can quickly regenerate your mana on top of that. There is a guild banker, wayfarer there along with quite a few other perks. You can transport to certain places via port stones and summon the entire guild corpse there after a wipeout.<br />
<br />
This is just stuff I have read as I am no longer play so if I forgot or missed anything forgive me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ran Serenity on myself for at least 10 minutes in the guild hall, for the sheer fun of the HP regen and trying to canni down...can be exploitive, but it will get everyone's buff timers EXACTLY right....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, yeah - I wrote down all my buff durations, now to reconfigure the Arista timer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and summon the entire guild corpse there after a wipeout.<br />
<br />
sounds like they finally added an easy button to EQ :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Easy or convenient, it seems to be a bit of both.<br />
<br />
I don't think there are many left who would last long doing traditional CRs for horrid things like the old Vox or NToV wipes.  Besides, it lets you get to bed on time without being plagued by insomnia fueled by fears of corpse rot.  Oh wait, corpses don't rot anymore.... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;there's a wayfarer right outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crap, didn't notice that hehe.  Ok good idea then:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I sometimes go afk in the GH at night and guildies buff me as they're passing through.  With the buff timers not counting down, I'll wake up to a full set of fresh buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Noticed this when a cleric guildie cast a HoT on my Nec as i was afk and liched in the hot tub.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This isn't an exploit, this is the point. heh. Bard songs last forever too, it's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bard songs last forever... so has anyone tested to see if there is a buff limit to the short-term buffs on a person?   Be sorta funny to have every single bardsong on you at once (not that i even know how many beneficial ones they have).</div></div><hr />
