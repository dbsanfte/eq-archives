<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking of how economics go in EQ.  Does anyone have a general idea how an item has its price set?<br />
<br />
I understand the theory behind suplly and demand.  Also understand the quality of an item or its capabilites.<br />
<br />
However, seeing some of the outrages prices (some ofcourse just raising prices on their own to make a higher profit margin), it boggles me to think how some of these people think others have thousands of platinum to toss around.<br />
<br />
I understand that some people just add on extra to the price they really want to sell the item at so they will get that much for during the bargining phase.<br />
<br />
Economics were never really my forte, so could someone entighten me a bit further.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how are prices set?  <br />
<br />
Simple, charge whatever it takes to sell the item depending on how long you wanna sit in Ecom in relation to how wanted or good the item is or perceived to be.<br />
<br />
That's how prices are set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a market. People ask what they think a few others may be able to pay. Once an item sells at a certain &quot;ask&quot; price a number of times, that price begins to be perceived as the &quot;set&quot; price of that item going forward.  <br />
<br />
If an item is *really* being overpriced, then chances are a seller will be auctioning it for a very long time. Eventually, he'll either find a buyer or he'll lower his price to match the perceived value of the item by buyers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Economy?  What economy?  There wont be any real economy until they make sure the best tradeskill isn't killing stuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm pretty much convinced that I could change an item's price with enough effort, simply by creating a series of different characters and offering to buy or sell at near that price.  Perhaps having some of them chime in if somebody argues in public.<br />
<br />
The only trick is that if you're lowering it, you'd have to lie through your teeth if you didn't have any items to sell.<br />
<br />
If you managed to set the perception with enough people that the going price for, say, a FBSS is 2.5k, then it'll become 2.5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think a problem with the inflation is that you get those people out there who want  to buy everything low and sell high. Now that is a good philosophy but sometimes people get out of control. I play on Ayonae Ro and the item I really notice people being ridiculous on are the iksar regen bp. I started noticing the price in december at about 5k. Last month or so its down to around 4k until last week hit. Out of nowhere some people are coming asking for 6 and 7k. The bp is simply not worth it. The kicker is I encountered about three people looking to buy one for about 3k, then same people looking to sell the one they bought for 6k. Then all the people who dont know the price see the 6k as the price assume that is what it is worth. These people drive up the prices on everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;i&gt;If you managed to set the perception with enough people that the going price for, say, a FBSS is 2.5k, then it'll become 2.5k.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Yeah, this might work for about 10 minutes.  But then what happens?  People still want the FBSS, but there are none for sale, because at 2.5k each a lot of buyers will suddenly be ready to spend cash.  So, you have people wanting the item auctioning, &quot;wtb FBSS 2.5k&quot;.  After a couple hours of this, they try 3k, and so on.  Eventually the price creeps back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jonet &amp; da iksra bp....<br />
<br />
How do you decide if an iksar bp is worth 3k or 8k?  The price on the iksar BP jumped because the price on the fungi jumped.   I paid 8.5k for my iksar bp and it is a wonderfull item.   The supply of the iksar BP also is increasing as the higer price has motivated a lot more people to go make them drop,  and the market is starting to soften.   The price has already droped into the 6 or 7k range and should drop more.<br />
<br />
It will be a long time before I can get a fungi and the iksar chest plate is very nice.  I think that it is unlikely that I will give it up untill I get a fungi or torpor, both of which are 5 to 10 times more expensive.<br />
<br />
As for the tunnel trolls who sit in ec and buy and sell for a profit hehe....  let them.  You could not pay me to do that in real life, so I am not going to pay SOE to do it in a game. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 easy steps relating to how prices are set:<br />
<br />
1.  The seller finds out what you want.<br />
<br />
2.  They raise the price an insane amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least that's how it feels to me sometimes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's all relative.<br />
<br />
Genreally, tradeable items are priced according to two things- how they relate in power to other items, and saturation of the market.  <br />
<br />
Relative power:  A new item comes into the game- how do you determine what it's worth?  Well, how does it compare to other existing items in the game?  It's probably going to be worth more than items less powerful, and worth less than items more powerful.  Let's say a new 9 dmg/20 dly sword drops- chances are it will be worth less than a 9/19 lamentation and worth more than a 10/24 velium warsword.  Of course proc, weight, stats, etc. can change the value of an item.<br />
<br />
Saturation:  This one is simple supply and demand.  The more available an item is, the less it's going to cost.  Once an item hits the magic point of being more available than it's desired, prices plummet to commodity levels.  Perfect example- when Split Paw Hide Gloves first came out (with the Paw revamp), they were pretty much the only tradeable +WIS gloves in the game.  For those first few weeks, they sold for a lot of money (thousands of pp) since they represented an upgrade for a lot of people- and there weren't many of them.   After a few weeks, people started realizing that these were dropping like candy- and prices started falling.  Now you can't get 20 pp for them.  Black sapphire necklaces (+hp/+mana) are another great example- they said to sell for thousands (sometimes 10k+)- now they're available for 500 pp due to saturation.<br />
<br />
Saturation also drives down prices of like items.  This happens all the time with weapons.  The easy availability of Centi shortswords (12/25, with a couple stats) has driven down the cost of anything with a worse ratio.  Why?  Well, why would you pay more than 500 pp for a weapon when you could get a Centi for that price?<br />
<br />
This manifests itself through the markets- in exactly the way the above posters mentioned.  This is a discrete market, though, so an item can definitely be worth more to person X than person Y.  Many &quot;I HATE the tunnel!&quot; types will sell for less and pay more for items to avoid hanging around the commerce zones or trade channels.  So an item never really has a true &quot;market value&quot; it has a range of values that people often buy and sell for- but even that is no guarantee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice Post Bigguss :).<br />
<br />
One thing of interest is the new market channel poping up on servers...  on vaz it is /join market  and commonly has between 70 and a 120 people depending on time.<br />
<br />
In the long run I think a lot of people may just make mules and park then in the tunnel to buy and sell for them.  You just join the market channel and if you find a good transaction then you log to the mule to conduct business....  No more sitting in ec,  just go exp grind and watch for the deal you want.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this will favor the ec traders more then the general population, but I like it because I don't like sitting in ec just selling.  I used this channel to dump some HQ brute hides on a hafling tailor just last night.  After a while you can learn who the regular ec traders are and just not deal with them and that is nice also.<br />
<br />
I am kind of interested in getting a jade mace and I note the the price is varies from about 6k to 8k.    I noticed one for sale at 4.5k and it did not last long...  I think this is the kind of item that a regular ec trader will snap up to resell at a profit.  I did however get an sbs for 2.5k which is about 1kp below standard market on my server.  In the long run I think the market channels will be a net positive because more people can participate in the market and still do other things.  more people == more luquidity and more reasonable prices.</div></div><hr />
