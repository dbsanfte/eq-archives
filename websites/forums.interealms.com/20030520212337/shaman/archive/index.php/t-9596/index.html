<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">KS?  Grab him and hide him from the ebayers who monopolize his spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question.<br />
<br />
Why would you WANT a shot at him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">multiple reasons, including:<br />
<br />
chance at belt of the turtle &lt;nice&gt;<br />
<br />
lodi shell peice not only sells good but makes a nice shield that is an upgrade for some, and also sells well.<br />
<br />
spells that sell well, as well as benifit you're guild.<br />
<br />
bragging rights, and last but not least, just to say you tried it. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, I could use that shield as a back piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The unfortunate thing is that even if you do happen to spot Lodi and engage him, odds are you'll get ganked by a group before you can finish.<br />
<br />
Happened to a friend of mine who was soloing Lodi.<br />
He got ganked by some group at 70 percent I think so still he had quite a way to go.<br />
<br />
Shame that the Belt of the Great Turtle is not shaman usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">someone said he didnt jumped over spawns anymore so he shouldnt be that rare..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">that , in effect makes him rarer.. he's like 13 hr spawn now or something (don't quote me) and he is on the dot everytime, so even if you sit there and camp him for 12 hrs straight, you will know when he spawns because people will start to log in at his spawn point or port in etc.  There is no camping him anymore, after a server reset there is a brief adjustment time and the farmers lock on their alarm clocks and begin the slaying. <br />
     I have engaged him several times with guild / group and only once solo at 65, only reason I was there was to help a friend who went promptly link dead 5 min before he popped... and sure enough I malo / slow and start tanking and the gimp monk squad gank him from me.  Anyway my buddy didn't make it back from LD and I didn't need any of the loot so I didn't protest, with GM response times as they are the carcas would have been picked clean before their arrival anyway.<br />
<br />
maybe you can catch him before he surfaces if you have some form of perm eb *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lodizal drops a piece for the Lodizal shell shield, which is an awesome back piece, especially if, like me, you had a giant scalemail cloak in that slot.  It has has perm eb, so I can use that for eb and the amulet for cr.<br />
<br />
Lodizal also drops upper level Velious era spells(cann4) a piece for a quest that gives a +6 to all saves mask.<br />
<br />
Spawn time is 11 hours, 40 min, almost to the dot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Patch tomorrow...good luck on the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you engage him and he is ganked, get them banned.<br />
<br />
If they 'know' that you are fighting, and already have engaged the mob, and kill him anyway, then you can get them banned.  Ooc to the zone that you are currently engaging lodizal, so that way, if anyone tries to KS, all you have to do is petition the GMs, prove, via logs, that you notified the zone, and then get them all banned.  Sure you wont get your loot, but you will get the satisfaction of knowing that you have eliminated 6 more losers from norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I totaly agree with Xertt. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually some RL friends and I spent all of Christmas vacation campin Lodi...he spawns 2 times per day now, never skips and goes from 9-12 hrs, with the usual timer being 11 hrs....we were there for 11 of 12 spawns, engaging him all 11 times and being outright KSd 5 of the 11 times. In the 6 times we engaged and were not KSd or bothered in any way we did just fine with various combinations of classes, it was usually a level 60 shaman, level 56 paladin and a 57 Chanter, yes it was slow, yes it was lots of work, but we did it and did just fine- the 60 shaman can solo Lodi, and its a hella good fight; other times it was an additive of myself, another 55 Paladin, a 51 Druid, and a 58 Druidess.<br />
The best way to get Lodi is to log on ASAP when a server comes back up after a full patch and server shut down. Head to Lodi's spawn point just south of the ToFS on the 3rd iceberg island and watch it from a good distance....Lodi will spawn with an emote of something to do with him flapping his fins and will head out to the gnoll camps and then head east (?) down the coast...if not engaged he will despawn and respawn again in approx 10 min...if no engagement the second time he despawns and waits his full respawn time.<br />
Now comes the tricky part. You have Lodi's spawn time pegged now after the patch....approx 3-4 hrs before the next spawn you need to decide if you want to try to take him yourself (solo) or do you want to get lots of friends....my suggestion is get at least a few friends to help decrease the chance of KSing....the times we were KSd it was by the same warrior, wizard, shaman and druid combo with the warrior using a 2hs, triple attack and agressive disc...we were basically unable to keep up with manaburn, triple attacks in the 300s each and moonfires (duh like who can). The good news is that the warrior(and the shaman its a 2 boxer), wizard and druid all recieved warnings to their accounts /cheer and I am told that some of them actually lost points in the raid system from their guild /e pats himself on the back.<br />
Remember DPS is DPS with Lodi, use your pet, make the druid summon theirs, heck grab your 2 box 30th level monk to wack on it if you want, its necessary. Also I had never fought him before, but the 60 shaman that joined us reported that he seemed to be more resistant to slows/magic in general....we witnessed this fact after he Malo'd and attempted slow 7 times before it stuck and the 7th time only being after the chanter stopped chain runing the paladin and tashed. This was on the 6th kill and I dont remember the slows being that hard to stick the first times so it may just have been the RNG biting.<br />
Anyway, its a fun fight, you have the chance at some really nice drops (he always drops the map piece and at least one shell piece...we actually had him drop 2 shell pieces one time) and it will really bring a smile to your face. It was probably the most fun I have had in a long time in game(I took a 4 month Hiatus from the game due to RL problems, only to find when I returned that I was /guildremoved when I logged back in, sigh there goes my dreams of anything remotely epic related).<br />
Just to re-cap best advice I can give is DPS DPS DPS....torpor the tank at 80ish and he will stay at 80+ the entire fight and make sure you refresh slow on Lodi from time to time (heheh oops)...the bad thing about using Torpor is that it will do serious damage to your DPS, so bring pets, 2 box a wizzie, etc, whatever it takes to kill him fast to prevet or at least cut down the chance on a KS.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also Lodi spawns on the island, not under it; its not a hard island to pick out it has 3 hunters on it clubbing seals :D; also I agree with the other posts above, announce to the zone and your local trade chat channel that your about to engage Lodi and make sure you have /log on to help with this....dont take any crap from the KSers out there, its total crap that people dont have anything better to do at level 65 than KS level 58 people for stuff they are gonna twink alts with...esp when the level 58 and lower are there for upgrades /rant off.</div></div><hr />
