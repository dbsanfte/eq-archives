<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rybit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 62 shaman with 22 AAs and I was looking for a suitable character to raise and two-box. Some that were on my mind included the pet classes since they have a pet that can take hits and a beasty's SD would be nice (despite the overlap in abilities) as well as having a necro, but then there are the tank/dps classes such as the new zerker (which will evolve into the grand scheme of things as soon as SOE knows what to do with them), and pally who have their own set of buffs that compliment the sham well and rez (despite their depressing DPS). <br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards the enc,  zerker and beastlord (maybe necro, since i already have one up to 55), but i'm looking for your advice. Necros seem to have no end in abilities, and beastlords have very good DPS and SD, zerkers .. need i say anymore? ... and encs are useful with the ability to CC and KEI/VoQ.  I'm also thinking about the pally since it can rez.<br />
<br />
What I want is ability harmony, where a shaman and another class is powerful enough to take down many encounters. What do you suggest?<br />
<br />
The only issue that concerns me otherwise is the flagging issue.  Rybit is so close to EPs (only two flags required), yet it took me nearly two months to get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends hugely on what level of the game you are talking about. If you want to be effective in the higher PoP tiers you are limited to root-rotting, kiting (of some description) or a very strong tanking class. On the other hand if you're more interested in the game up to tier 2 or so, then classes such as the beastlord or mage would be very good.<br />
<br />
I'd be tempted to go for necro but check out all the similar thread first - there's plenty of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always two box things I don't want to get broken.  Like fine china or glass.    <br />
<br />
I also two box shamans with shadow knights because they offer a nice compliment to our skill set.  Plus they can pull pretty decently if you have time to split stuff!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necro all the way... Necro will fit perfectly into any root-rot and/or agro kiting situation you could find yourself in...if you wanted a pet class also.. Necro pets are 2nd only to a BST's warder.</div></div><hr />
