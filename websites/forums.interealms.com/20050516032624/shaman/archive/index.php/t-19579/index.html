<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have put off going after ND3 since I am unsure of how many Hit Points I will get.<br />
<br />
Base Sta 105 With gear on Sta 171<br />
Base Hit Points 1321 with gear on 2210<br />
<br />
I am looking at getting LDoN Incorp BP and Legs here in the near future also.<br />
<br />
I am going after LR3 first but still not sure if adding 12 AA to ND3 is worth it or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 3 of ND, you get 10% of your clothed, unbuffed HPs, so ~221hp in your case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ND3 is a great AA to have because its benefits improve as your gear improves. If you get your unbuffed hp up to, say 3000, the imrovement will raise to 300. Makes every piece of +HP and +sta gear all the more an improvement for you. Go for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe that you will also get the 10% benefit from buffed stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ND3 was a great choice for me, and I don't regret doing it so early in my so-called &quot;AA career.&quot; I did a few in General, then the MC3-Canni 5 path, then MGB (buffing raids, ugh, lol) and then ND3. I don't have the best gear in the world, by any means, so ND3 was really great. I believe it brought me up to just under 2900 HP. Right now I'm within spitting distance of 3k. :) <br />
<br />
12AA ... well, yeah, that's a lot of AA that might could be put toward something &quot;cooler&quot; I suppose ... but being that HP = mana, I say it's well worth it. Go for it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The key thing with ND3 is that it helps get you (and keep you) over the frenzy threshold when you cannibalize.  <br />
<br />
If you can't cannibalize due to low hp, then having cannibalize isn't doing you much good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never looked at it that way. I only saw it as OK 12 AA and I can take another hit maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a suggestion, you might want to make a profile on Magelo, put your gear in, and tinker with the AA' s to experiment with the effect that ND3 has for you.</div></div><hr />

I have done just that and it showed only a 10 percent increase.<br />
<br />
But my Co-worker and Friend who has a lvl65 War just told me that looking through the Steel Warriors Boards. that the 3 Ranks Stack so its not a Straight 10 percent but Stacks for a total of 17 percent HP increase?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, the 3 ranks stack, but they add 2%, 3%, 5%, for a total of 10%.  The 2%, 5%, 10% is the cumulative total.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your friend is wrong.  Its 10% increase total, it does not stack.  The way Magelo shows it is exactly how it works.<br />
<br />
Don't forget, that while unbuffed it will add an additional 221 HP, buffing STA will also earn you the extra 10%.  So just from an additional 70 Sta (Boar + PE) you'll get another 23 hp extra from ND3, and that keeps adding up all the way till 305 STA.   So for you, you'll be looking at an increase of 244 HP currently, with the potential for a lot more as you gain more gear and Sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At 2500 HP was about the first time I really got comfortable with Cann5. Even selfbuffed, it gave me enough of a buffer to use it during combat. If your Magelo is up to date, ND3 would pretty much put you at that mark. ... now think about how much in gear upgrades it would take you go get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Think about a Soulbound item that increased your pre-hitpoint buff HP score by 10%; what would that be worth?  Or a Soulbound item that gives 140HP to you while naked before a stamina buff?<br />
<br />
It is a very worthwhile AA and one that should be gotten sooner better than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you really want to know, run the change through Magelo, it's a great way to check how something like ND or other HP increasing aa's will affect your HP total.</div></div><hr />
