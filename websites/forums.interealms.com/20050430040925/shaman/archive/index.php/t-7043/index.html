<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it sure seems like newbie barbarians and cats got the best of pop and iksars got little.  or maybe it is that now barbarians will have to share their hunting zone with everyone else now.<br />
<br />
my logic: as a new shaman i remember being scared silly trying to get out of everfrost to hunt and having to brave the run to Qeynos. Now with the pop port system Level 1's can choose what newbie zone they want with thoughts only as faction and how crowded it is.  Level 1's can basically start in any zone they want. Except for iksars and evil races who have fewer choices.<br />
<br />
I always thought our barbarian newbie zone was good as it provided more money than others I used. The downside was that the number of reasonable mobs at some levels got scarce.  Now you can start and when you run out of mobs go to crushbone or rivervale. etc.<br />
<br />
i am sure someone will post on the best newbie paths now that travel time and risk is basically removed from the equation.<br />
<br />
Iksars however cant beam into as many cities with impunity.  Another example of rampant specism against iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unfortunately it is just as hard for any dark race to be accepted (DE, troll, ogre) that is one of the reasons it says on the starting char that a cirtain race/class combos are easy, or difficult.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is similar to choosing a troll shaman and not putting any points into wisdom. it can be done, but it is hard.<br />
<br />
but iksars should chin up, I played almost every race/class combo up to about lvl 10 at one point or another and the iksar, by far, have the easiest job of it. FOB is one of the best newbie zones I have ever played in.</div></div><hr />

i like to think of it as game balance.</div></div><hr />

Try Steamfont.  By the time I got to level 10 I had 200 plat banked and 2 stacks of brownie parts for future baking.  Kobold hides sell for nearly one plat and the teeth for about half a plat.  And they stack.</div></div><hr />

Cool. I just started EQ (used to do UO... don't go there)...<br />
<br />
On a lark, chose a Troll Shaman. Got to Lvl 5 in Nek Forest, did a little in Everfrost to Lvl 6, parked near the Tome beside the mob interstate, but not getting much XP there now.<br />
<br />
I'll have to check Steamfont if it is as good as reported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. The starting zones for evil races aren't necessarily bad.  In particular, the Iskar's Field of Bone is a very popular noobie zone.  If anything, many good races go there and thus have to worry about being slain by Iskar guards.  I personally love EverFrost (barbarian shaman, go figure) and always have...but there are other great noobie zones.<br />
<br />
2.  Evil races, particularly the Iskar with their innate improved regen, are compensated for the fact that evil faction is a sometimes a hassle.   PoP makes life much easier for evils than they had it in the past because they can just book everywhere without having to avoid guards in many zones like they used to have to do in ancient times.  Heck, my main in ancient times was a DE wiz and he travelled everywhere invis just to be safe and I didn't want to leave Nektulos until everything was green!<br />
<br />
As stated, it's about game balance.  Not to mention that nobody is forced to play an evil race and if you do, deal with the faction issues!<br />
<br />
I would add that although you can book around now and hunt wherever you want as a noobie...any real noobie (new player noobie) that doesn't have a friend, doesn't know how to farm tradeskill stuff for plats, etc, might be inclined to do their noobie armor quests (if they somehow figure out those quests exist without help, which is probably unlikely, I think more experienced players do those quests than true noobs as a novelty) - which make you stay around your home zone until about 10th depending on your luck with the idiotically rare drops needed to complete noobie armor.  A true noob would also be less likely to book around since they wouldn't know the system and would probably be afraid to get that far from home.<br />

I REALLY have to agree here! I have gotten a bit better through experimentation and reading all the various boards...but I still have alot to learn. I just started EQ again (previous account was a long time ago, highest char being a level 20ish gnomish necro) and didnt even know about PoK. I laughed to myself the first time I saw somone say PoK book....I thought of pocket book.<br />
I had originally started a troll shaman on Tallon Zek (hope I got that right) and did the free spell quest. I was hooked!! I couldnt get enough of the quests, and had a great time getting all my armor. This has made Everquest GREAT fun for me!<br />
I now have a froggy shaman on Bristlebane. TONS of fun! Not for his abilities, mind you, but...I am a FROG!!!!!! I cant express how much fun I think this is. I think that the quests make a huge difference in EQ and have been made more noticeable for new players. I am just rambling now, because I am overtired. Great to be here, by the way! If any of you younger shaman on Bristlebane are looking for a guild and some good company (or older shaman, for that matter) please look me up on Bristlebane. I will have a link to our Covenant of the Enlightened webpage in the near future. Thanks to everyone who has made this page available and contributed information, its great!</div></div><hr />
