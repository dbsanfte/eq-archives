<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please realize that I realize that none of the following will ever happen. Sony is too stupid. They will just continue to nerf the usefulness of tradeskills to oblivion.<br />
<br />
Sony, it really isn't that hard to make a tradeskill model which works. You are totally afraid of allowing us to create items which will sell for profit, with the only limiting factors being the speed at which you can do a series of clicks. So what's the solution? Add more limiting factors, genious.<br />
<br />
1) All tradeskill products will yield 50% to 150% of the cost required to make it. This large range varies not based on Charisma but based on which merchant you are selling it to - IE, the Freeport Bartender wants Batwing Crunchies so will give you 150% of cost for it. However, Soulbinder Mira couldn't care less about your crunchies.<br />
<br />
2) Stacking is gone. No tradeskill components are stackable. Period.<br />
<br />
3) repetitive clicking is gone. Skillups are guarenteed on successful combines - however, the failure rate is very very high, until you approach the trivial level. From there it goes up exponentially, until you have 100% chance of success.<br />
<br />
4) NPC Stocks are limited. Each tradeskill item-selling NPC will have, at most, 40-50 of each tradeskill item, 10 are added every 8 realtime hours.<br />
<br />
5) NPC Money is limited. All merchants have a limited amount of platinum on them to return. Once they are out of money, they can no longer buy from you, or anyone else. They will start with about 500pp and add 100pp per 8 realtime hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you'll notice, this makes the bottlenecks in tradeskills no longer how much clicking you can do and how much money you have - but instead, the bottlenecks are NPC item availability and money availability, as well as knowing how much each tradeskill product sells for to each vendor. A tradeskiller who skills for profit will no doubt have a daily routine: Bake 12 pies, sell them to 'X' Merchant in Halas. Forge 15 silver spoons, sell them to 'Y' merchant in Plane of tranquility. He could not simply amass silver spoons and sell them for limitless amounts of platinum - his resources would run out, and the NPC buying them would run out of money. This forces the tradeskiller to actually invest time running to merchants delivering batches of each product to where it yeilds the best profit. Popular and most profitable places would run out of resources quickly as other players used them, so tradeskillers would have to be diverse and know of other lucrative places to craft and sell, they could not have one set-in-stone routine for mega ppzorz.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that, Sony, is how you do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great.  So now, instead of just being a platinum sink, tradeskills will be a platinum sink and now a time sink as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, my personal theory is that the best way to soak plat out of the economy is to introduce item decay, and I am sure that wouldn't be well-received either.<br />
<br />
It an idea, Penny, and that a start; kudos for at least coming up with that.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) Requires reworking of the item database and the way vendors work. Not gonna happen. Currently, item prices are stores as a pair of numbers - buy price and sell price (both in # of copper for the item). Then each vendor has a simple muliplier which is applied to all items. Your proposal would require that each item would have a seperate price stored for each vendor in the game.<br />
<br />
2)Requires changing the item database, but not so drasticly as #1. There is 1 critical problem - Gems. Do you make them nonstackable because of jewelcraft, leave them stackable so as to not toally screw over casters, or remove all reagents from spells?<br />
<br />
3_*shrug*<br />
<br />
4)Limited Stocks = lots of pissed off players.<br />
<br />
5)Limited NPC money = all items in the game which are currently considered vendor fodder are worthless. Unless you place the money they have VERY high, in which case the limit might as well not exist.<br />
<br />
Summary : while your idea looks OK on paper, you have completely failed to look at how your proposal would effect the game outside of tradeskills. It isn't as easy as you think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludwiig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They tried this already, it was called UO week 1.<br />
<br />
What will happen is a bunch of tools will park mules at all the popular vendors, buy all the components, and sell them back to players at a 10x markup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That has to be one of the worst ideas I've ever seen.  How are you going to get rid of repetitive clicking by making things not stack?  Limited vendor stocks?  Limited plat?  Blah, after I'm out soloing and come back to town laden with loot, I'm supposed to sell 20 fine steel weapons and get 12 copper back because the vendor is broke?  Yeah right.  Try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PennyAntics,<br />
<br />
You should try Horizons. Or as it is known in some circles &quot;craftizons.&quot;<br />
<br />
As to some of yoru suggestions:<br />
<br />
 2) Stacking is gone. No tradeskill components are stackable. Period. <br />
<br />
Ouch. You just made TS's a huge time sink as now players must clear out their inventory for items. Much more travelling back and forth to vendors.<br />
<br />
 3) repetitive clicking is gone. Skillups are guarenteed on successful combines - however, the failure rate is very very high, until you approach the trivial level. From there it goes up exponentially, until you have 100% chance of success. <br />
<br />
Well people are still going to have to click to combine, and with a very, very high failure rate the number of clicks is going to increase unless you alter the code governing skill-up versus successful combine.  Another ouch.<br />
<br />
 4) NPC Stocks are limited. Each tradeskill item-selling NPC will have, at most, 40-50 of each tradeskill item, 10 are added every 8 realtime hours <br />
<br />
This would have merit IF there was a way to go out and get your own (now) vendor sold components. I do not know if UO does this, but Craftizons does. Another ouch.<br />
<br />
As one who tried both DAOC's and EQ's TS trees, I prefer EQ's by a huge margin. The TS system isn't broke because a hard core TS'er, frustrated power-gamer like me is working towards 1750 (250 in all TS'es), it's broke because some num nuts macroed something and is able to get money while he sleeps. <br />
<br />
Trust me - I dump enough money into the economy via TS's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tradeskills are already the biggest moneysinks in the game (especially alchemy). If they fix the recipies that return more then what the components cost then everything would be fine. Nothing should sell back for more then 50% of its component value to a vendor. <br />
<br />
Or if you just wanted to piss off everyone (especially people skilling up JC which is a joke) then make sellbacks all like alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wouldnt it be easier to add some kind of &quot;casting time&quot; for the tradeskils? <br />
The harder the tradeskill, the higher the &quot;casting time&quot;.<br />
e.g. <br />
Put item_001, item_002,item_003,item_004 in bag<br />
Click combine<br />
Combining..... 5 sec<br />
You get item_finished or you failed (fizzle :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's not a single idea in there that is a good one.<br />
<br />
That's damn near miraculous. The law of averages alone says you should have gotten at least ONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">personally I think trade skills should look like a spell book and work like the imbue or enchant spells do.<br />
<br />
for instance, I want to make sow potions, I buy the ingredients, click the sow potion gem or whatever and the potion appears on my cursor or doesnt depending on success check. the items are gone from inventory, no more friggin 100+ clicks to make a 10dose sow pot that sells for 85pp if you are lucky.<br />
this type of tradeskilling will only work for items you are trivial on, so once trivial you get a new &quot;spell&quot; in your trade skill spell book.<br />
as for the various hacks, that is a matter of proper programing, either all tradeskill items sell back for some profit or they sell back for a loss, personally I vote that they sell back for cost +5% that way you cant make a profit with macroquest but you dont take a loss from the permanent 5% fail rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just finished getting baking to 250 and I am horrified by Penny's suggestions. Non stackable items? Only 40-50 available at a time? Unscrupulous individuals would camp the vendors and buy all the inventory to re-sell.<br />
<br />
Tradeskilling is already terrible, let's not make it worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KudorWolfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Eh I have never understand why poeple hate tradeskills as much as they do. The more practice you have making an item the easier it is to make it. The more you make an item the more the skill goes up. Seems rather balanced to me. Another point is that not all the tradeskills can you just got to a merchant buy what you want and skill up. Alot of the higher up trade skills require you to farm for countless hours to get the compenents you need to do combines. Its not a bad system in my opinion, im just glad they made it so you can ctl and move one item and not have to use that damn slider bar to do combines. The tradeskills serve their purpose though a diversion when you bored and a giant money sink .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The problem with tradeskills is that it is all patched and pasted together. There is no cohesion to it. Some races/classes have a huge and unaccountable advantage over others. Components are scattered all over the place with items for recipes implemented in an expansion only available as drops or vendor purchases in that expansion.<br />
One thing they can do to get rid of the cheaters is simply make everything you craft sell back to vendors at or below cost. That ends tradeskill macroing for plat right away. Its a shame because it would be nice to make a bit of profit as you skill up, but the cheaters have ruined that as an option (at least when it comes to selling to vendors.)<br />
Another option that I hate to suggest is making all tradeskill level capped. I.E. you have to get to 65 to GM any of them. It would help keep the number of GM level tradeskillers down, helping ensure that the availability of high end player made stuff stays lower. This would also make it possible to reduce the money burden of skilling up, you could have the vendors buy back rate cover a greater portion of the cost since there will be relatively fewer people making it to GM level.<br />
The availability of components needs to be smoothed out. Everything in the game should be available as a drop or at a vendor in all appropriate zones across all the expansions. I realize they are trying to encourage the sale of their expansions by limiting stuff to that expasions zones, but we all buy them anyway. In fact, if you want to be in a high end guild, it is usually a requirement that you have all expansions enabled.<br />
Get rid of the ridiculous and wholely unfair advantage given to enchanters and those who can forage. Absolutely no point to that and its an insult to all of us who do tradeskills.<br />
Give us useful things to make, and sell to our fellow players. Tradeskill items that were once uber are now subpar. The whole system would need to be updated. (of course thats not going to happen)<br />
Components should be allowed to be put into tradeskill containers in stacks, whatever number you want the stacks to be can be argued, I'll just say stacks of 20. You put the right components into the right container and hit combine, your successes and failures are calculated and you get a partial or full stack of finished goods. This won't work with everything but it would be really nice on some of the smaller stuff. I realize that tradeskills are supposed to be a timesink and that this would defeat some of that purpose. This is a good thing. We can find other ways to occupy ourselves in game. :)<br />
Just a few ideas, there are many more. The ones suggested at the top are just not good ones in my opinion. <br />
By the way, I've done a few tradeskills in my time. Not as many as some, but a good enough amount to give me an idea of what I'm talking about. <br />

assuming you are talking about JC, I disagree, JC should be a chanter only trade skill the way Alchemy is for shaman, then they can learn another skill without having to burn aa's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dont suppose that you were around 3 years ago when EQ was in a relative infancy. So lets address your points:<br />
1) Its called &gt;faction&lt; look it up, so people do pay you more based on that to a certain items max payout; also even with maxed charisma, there are vendors that simply pay less for items.<br />
2) In the not too distant past, at the very least skins were not stackable, neither were clay, sheets of metal, metal rings, etc....trust me this made trade skills a PITA. Even my mules had mules to hold trade skill crap, and this was before there was shared banks too so you had to 2 box or have a friend help you.<br />
3). the failure rate vs skill up rate does need to be adressed, especially when it comes to Smithing, JC and Alchemy...... Brewing has some horrid chances too, but its the only trade skill that you can sit in one room in Halas and GM with next to no effort (other than a good case of carpal tunnel).<br />
4) NPC stocks on certain items (HQ ore anyone?) is limited; however this is generally seen by most tradeskillers (check out EQtraders for more on this) as an artifical way to limit what they can make or do. In the end, limited stock just causes problems and discourse, and will cause people to perma camp the vendors with mules just for this (I can see this as Yantis's new gimmick).<br />
5) If you limit NPC cash for payouts on &quot;vendor&quot; items then you must have either an influx of cash into the game via another way or make the so called vendor trash items useful in some other fashion....IE vendors will accept 4 fine steel weapons for a copy of XXXX spell, or will give you 20 Iron rations for 2 topaz etc....in the end all this would cause is bazaar prices going mad for a few weeks as people realize that only a few select people that camp the NPCs can get cash....this would ruin the concept of the bazaar as a whole.<br />
You already have to run your ass all over hell and back to collect droppable items for tradeskills, unless you can make cash faster than you can spend it and just pick them up in bazaar. Increasing the leg work that people have to do and causing artifical shortages of necessary items is not the way to do this.....a reassesment of the usefulness of tradeskills is, especially alchemy and poison making and there is also a case for Tailoring and tinkering to be looked at closely. <br />
All trade skills have their sweet spots, but JC is sweeter than all the rest, followed by smithing, baking and brewing in no particaular order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, faction has become irrelevant in many areas.  Every vendor in PoP is indifferent and has no faction.  Bazaar vendors are indifferent (unless you did the faction quest, in which case they are only slightly better).  LDoN are basically indifferent, unless you complete lots and lots of missions.  However, their approval of you does not affect prices enough to even consider it important (I think I make 1 gold or so more than someone that has done no adventures)<br />
<br />
Increases based in CHA are limmited to about 120 or so, and after that are irrelevant.  Couple that with the perma-indiff faction of PoK/PoT and pricres are going to be standardized.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KeiriV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have been playing EQ for 2 years and never really got into tradeskills other than Alchemy because it is such a click drag pain in the butt.  I decided to check out EQOA for the fun of it and the tradeskill system they have in there is awesome and they should apply that to EQ and if not hopefully they may slap it into EQII.  This is how the trade skill works:<br />
<br />
You get your ingredients to make your combine for your SoW potion (or whatever potion) and you combine.  Once your combine is successful it asks: Would you like to add this to your Recipe Book?  Once added to your recipe book all you have to do is buy your stacks of ingredients, open your recipe book, and start clicking away at your selected recipe.  It notifies you of each fail and success, automatically putting the successful item in your inventory to allow constant combine clicking.  Once you run out of ingredients to make the desired recipe it lets you know.  Naturally you will have to have your medicine bag in your inventory to do this.  <br />
<br />
I also have to agree that we need more useful potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played with tradeskills off and on during the last 4 years. I had always liked brewing and baking because I liked making funny things to hand out. At one point, I decided I wanted to get all my tradeskills over 100, so I did (with the exception of Jewel Craft). I managed to get smithing to 175 before the big nerf. I was at something like (alchemy 175, smithing 175, pottery 100, fletching 140, tailoring 150, baking 191, brewing 100) for a long time.<br />
<br />
Making wu's armor to 150 in a half hearted attempt to try for the shawl quest killed any desire I had to tradeskill and I didn't do any tradeskilling until the Aid Grimmel quest came out. I decided I wanted to have a party platter, so I decided to GM baking (I was already at 191 so it didn't seem like it would be so bad). The experience was so unpleasant (need noodles, need dressing, all those sub combines, stacking backpacks of components on mules), heartbreaking (100 combines for 2 skill ups), painful (shooting pain in my finger and a burning sensation in my arm) and costly (damn those foragers and paying 50 plat each for plant shoots) that I won't be doing any more tradeskilling.<br />

There is only one problem with it.  You cant add detrimental rules 4 years after the fact.  The only people you are punishing are those that havent done tradeskills yet.  Just like you hear people now talking about 'how much harder it was to level in the Kunark days' you would get the opposite.  'It used to be much easier to perform tradeskills in the LDON days, but with the new rules, they are impossible to perform'.  You end up with a tradeskill system that NOONE new would learn.  Which is not good for the game.  I do agree that tradeskills could be done better, but you cant punish the tradeskillers 4 years after the fact.<br />

The only thing I'd like is a vendor that sold velium / acrylia ore, limited amounts but at the around prices or 5pp cheaper than the bazaar average. 45pp each or something similar. That way if you want to run to go to katta vendor farm and sell it in the bazaar for 5pp profit or so then more power to you I'll pay 5pp extra just so I don't have to park a mule there, meanwhile I won't be stuck farming velium where level 30s go to play... everyone wins, I win more supplies, the farmers win because I'll buy all the velium in bazaar anyway, and the npc mule people win cause they get 5pp per velium for their efforts :)<br />
<br />
Also alchemy needs to be fixed just 1 of the components for group levitation is 26pp (out of like 6 components).. give me regular levitation and make it cost 20pp each to make and I'll be a very happy camper.. no one wants group levi 6 item combine 1 foraged and god knows how much for a 10 dose..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I thought I would never say this on these boards, but this is the dumbest idea of all time for a tradeskill system. Tradeskills are intended to help remove platinum from circulation-- how does having limited stock on NPCs help that? Making tradeskills profitable would inflate prices even futher. Furthermore, it would take ONE person with any reasonable amount of money to clear out a vendor. If you want to do tradeskills after that, you are screwed for an hour, after which you will be able to do a single combine with the stock the vendor has gotten back. No stackable components? Clearly you never tried blacksmithing before sheetmetal was stackable. Congratulations, you have actually ADDED clicks to tradeskilling by constant trips to vendors.<br />
Please realize that I realize that none of the following will ever happen. Sony is too stupid. Not even SOE is dumb enough to implement this.<br />
<br />
This is quite possibly the worst idea I have ever heard on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>archi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">PennyAntics, seems like you are in a wrong track, talking about making the tradeskill items non-stackable.<br />
<br />
I think you are going in backward in time.  Like someone mentioned, just make the end result, sell back price lower.<br />
<br />
I am dearly confused what you are trying to say here, screw someone from getting tradeskill level up fast enough or trying to stop someone from micro'ing plat out of the merchants.<br />
<br />
All and all, all the ideas stinks, seems like going back in time to stone-age.  Where someone is about to invent a Square Wheels.<br />

I rather see Alchemy components dropped rather than by from the vendors.  Not to rare drop though.  And let the prices of items play out it's course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wouldnt it be easier to add some kind of &quot;casting time&quot; for the tradeskils? <br />
The harder the tradeskill, the higher the &quot;casting time&quot;.<br />
e.g. <br />
Put item_001, item_002,item_003,item_004 in bag<br />
Click combine<br />
Combining..... 5 sec<br />
You get item_finished or you failed (fizzle :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
I think EQII is going to be doing something like this.  It will be interesting.  I like the sounds of the EQOA way of Tradeskilling.<br />

DAOC had the 'delay' thing. One word: annoying.<br />
<br />
DAOC TS at higher levels:<br />
<br />
1) Acquire components<br />
2) Press combine<br />
3) Get out of chair<br />
4) Go to bathroom<br />
5) Read paper<br />
6) Flush<br />
7) Sit down<br />
8) See if you are successful or not.<br />
9) Go to 1) or 2) as applicable<br />
<br />
Note that 4), and 5) are just suggestions. You could vacuum, clean the house, go jogging, do push up and sit ups (My personal favorite), or any other activity OTHER than watching the very slow bar indicating the items slowly combining.<br />
<br />
Talk about non-immersive. Talk about a time sink. Talk about a pain where you sit.</div></div><hr />

Penny's ideas would set back tradeskilling to the proverbial stone age, and you'd get people like Yantis parking mules by the supply vendors literally 24/7 to snap up every ingrediant as it becomes available, and put them into the bazaar at 5x the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I liked Camelot's method of simply clicking a recipe hotkey, and the combine being done out of items in your inventory - instead of setting each individual item into a container &amp; clicking combine.  That alone would do away with so much clicking.<br />
<br />
As for tradeskills overall, the biggest problem is that it started as a generic idea, and was continually patched &amp; repatched as time and expansions passed.<br />
<br />
Which is the same overal problem as EQ has always had - VI was a small time company that hit big.  I think if they had any idea of the number of subscribers they'd have after 2 years, they would have thought a few things out better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">1) All tradeskill products will yield 50% to 150% of the cost required to make it. This large range varies not based on Charisma but based on which merchant you are selling it to - IE, the Freeport Bartender wants Batwing Crunchies so will give you 150% of cost for it. However, Soulbinder Mira couldn't care less about your crunchies.<br />
<br />
It's how it worked on Ultima Online but you create yourself another loophole. You buy stuff at 50% in one place and resell the final product at 150% in another place.<br />
No thanks, I better like the current system. We just need that SOE check any combinable items and adjust their resell value.<br />
<br />
2) Stacking is gone. No tradeskill components are stackable. Period.<br />
<br />
Are you totally nuts ???  :confused: (no offense  ;) ). Try to combine some misty thicket picnic or Halas Pie or work your tailoring with wu... <br />
/shiver at the tought of non-stackable items... brrrrrrrrr<br />
<br />
3) repetitive clicking is gone. Skillups are guarenteed on successful combines - however, the failure rate is very very high, until you approach the trivial level. From there it goes up exponentially, until you have 100% chance of success.<br />
<br />
It could be, eventually a good idea if... some items weren't trivial above 250.<br />
The fire garnment for the aid grimel quest is ALREADY a high failure combine even for those who are 250 tailors. Not only this but you have to hunt these damn obsidianwood saps who are rare as hell or very expensive in the bazaar (20k each on Karana). 3 saps for one try.<br />
Really rare compo + high faillure rate = no good.<br />
<br />
4) NPC Stocks are limited. Each tradeskill item-selling NPC will have, at most, 40-50 of each tradeskill item, 10 are added every 8 realtime hours.<br />
<br />
Great and every 8 realtime hours you will see people running to the vendors buying all the items, reselling them for 10x the price... <br />
It was the way UO NPC worked (refill every 30 mins) and every time you, it was the rush ;).<br />
<br />
5) NPC Money is limited. All merchants have a limited amount of platinum on them to return. Once they are out of money, they can no longer buy from you, or anyone else. They will start with about 500pp and add 100pp per 8 realtime hours.<br />
<br />
First guy who come with 5 perlescent peeble formation to sell will bankrupt (sp?) the npc  :D <br />
<br />
As a tradeskiller, I can say that none of your ideas is good.<br />
I have 200 alchemy, 223 smithing and 250 in all other TS... <br />
I made it for the quests, for my fun and satisfaction, but with your suggestions, I would not even think about TS at all.<br />
<br />
What would help TS :<br />
<br />
Being able to combine stacks of items (fail/success rate, more than 20 items results should be looked at. Think about a full set of stacks for Misty Thicket Picnic that result in 200 MMP :p)<br />
<br />
Being able to BUY any components needed (well, maybe not those from Tier2+ planes), but farming greenies for some basic material is not fun.<br />
<br />
Making some items in PoP more accessible but still in the same plane (needing more than one group to collect some air arachnid silks or regrua part is NOT fun).</div></div><hr />

&quot;&quot;Get rid of the ridiculous and wholely unfair advantage given to enchanters&quot;<br />
<br />
assuming you are talking about JC, I disagree, JC should be a chanter only trade skill the way Alchemy is for shaman, then they can learn another skill without having to burn aa's.<br />
<br />
as if it doesnt make sense for chanters to be the only ones who can make magical stuff like you get with JC.&quot;<br />
<br />
_______________<br />
<br />
JC is the least of the issue--I wouldn't mind at all if JC were made an enchanter-only skill (well, I'd mind it less if alchemy was actually made a USEFUL skill at the same time).<br />
<br />
No, the big issue with enchanters is the need for mana vials for almost all high-end &quot;sellable&quot; items, at some point in the combine chain. And those that don't require them, like POP armor, almost all require an imbued diamond, so once again, you throw business to the enchanters.<br />
<br />
Take them out of those loops, and I'd be happy to give them JC instead.<br />

<br />
It's the foragers that have a huge advantage in tradeskills.  Them and the trackers.  As it happens, they often are overlapping abilities.  <br />
<br />
Tradeskills are one of the really strong points of EQ.  You may not like them, but they have pretty successfully incorporated them into the design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;-- Proud to have a combined tradeskill (except alchemy) of less than 10, damn the skill ups from spell/armor combines!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sony, it really isn't that hard to make a tradeskill model which works. <br />
<br />
But it IS hard to retrofit one into the existing game.  There are plenty of better ideas for tradeskilling in competing games - none of them would be easy or even possible to retrofit into EQ.<br />
<br />
And I can't get excited about the prospect of 1) no stacking, turning skilling up into a marathon shopping experience.  or 2) prices varying from vendor to vendor, turning skilling up into another Fedex exercize.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I found this to be pretty hilarious...trying to tweak tradeskills to allow players to reap more profit from NPC vendors, but limiting NPC vendors to 500pp every server reset and 300pp additional per day.<br />
<br />
Clicking is gone?  Yet you have a very slim chance of successfully combining to yield a skill up?  Um.... you'll just fail a lot more and click the same number of times.<br />
<br />
As others have suggested, next time actually try out the thing you have decided to preach to us about.  It's pretty obvious you don't do any tradeskills, and people don't do tradeskills due to what vendors pay them (except macrobots)--people raise tradeskills because PLAYERS pay them money to do so.<br />
<br />
Worst suggestion ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Eh I have never understand why poeple hate tradeskills as much as they do<br />

Well, for me it's the mindless, tedious, repetitive clicking.  edit: I forgot to mention the mindless, tedious, repetitive farming.  If I wanted to give myself RSI problems I could just log on my bard, it's less boring. ;)<br />
<br />
Someone wiser than me once said, &quot;I would rather punch myself in the groin repeatedly than subject myself to EQ tradeskills.&quot;</div></div><hr />
