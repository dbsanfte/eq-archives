<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">notice some change after patch.<br />
much more dog now, almost roaming everywhere, even the old safe point. <br />
roaming dragon seems changed route, they are roaming most place of zone now.<br />
some old fixed dragons are NOT fixed now, they will roam around, at least i saw Varptin, Travala doing that.<br />
seems some dragon linked together, i did add Marrka when trying Mazi, add Travala when trying Gafala, that's odd.<br />
<br />
Take care when hunting WW.</div></div><hr />

More velium hounds = more velium hound furs for you... this is one spot that sucked for us because of the druids with track.<br />
<br />
At least they added more hounds to keep up with the demand for the furs - hopefully they added more BDs to keep up with the new demand for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe thtas funny on the rangers glade theres a thread stating the opposite.That there were hardly any hounds in WstW(happy Zatriz =p) As far as Mraaka adding on Mazi Mraaka is a roaming see invis cragwurm and has always patrolled around that area plus the dragons call for help and assist ranges are huge due to their melee range boxes.The drakes I would chalk up to weird and not a patch change just yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Travala has always roamed.   He sits at the spike in front of the SG zone but then will roam around the DN scar and go back to his spike.  Then repeat.  Nothing new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's Tranala and Travala, 2 different mobs, but look the same. One always roams, and I thought the other was always near SG zone at that spire. I think both drop the huge wing for the BFG quest that hasn't worked in a year.<br />
<br />
I don't remember which one roamed and which was static.</div></div><hr />

There is a velium hound roaming there now. Not hard to kill .. except when afk.. A poor shammy of my guild found that this week end.. We were waiting for scout to pop (had it pretty well timed even with the latest patch). He was the first on the spot and went afk (he also fell asleep but that's an other problem hehe). <br />
When the killing group arrived, we found him dead (and still asleep... )<br />
We did the bene quest  3 or 4  times since the patch and always got velium hound add during the fight (not biggie tho)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Noticed they added some new pathing to WW, but I really doubt the dragon spawns are linked.  Is a really easy zone to get nasty chain aggro in and always has been so that might explain a few things.<br />
<br />
And yes, WW is VERY CT friendly with more nice pathing spots to get running animals stuck in than you can shake a stick at :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was going to solo Yeldema before the patch, got set up, and suddenly noticed a roaming dragon that was pathing right along the shoreline.  Can't remember the name, Mira.... something.  Was a red dragon, and it conned red to me.  I left my pet on the shore hoping to run away before the dragon aggro'd on me so I could come back and fight Yeld.  However, the dragon aggro'd on me despite the fact I was so far away (apparently didn't aggro on pet).  By the time I got to ToV I had another dragon plus a hound on board my train.<br />
<br />
This was about a week or more BEFORE the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That dragon would have to have been Melalafen, who is not kos to anyone unless you've killed it before I think. It's not on CoV faction, it's on GuaridiansofKerafyrm or something to do with the Sleeper. I'm really surprised it aggrod you, it's indiff to everyone in my guild, and we are on Kael faction mostly. I think it does assist CoV faction stuff though, did you have something else aggro on you?<br />
<br />
The only red con red dragon in that zone is Melalafen (not counting Sontalak of course). The only other red dragons that roam are Crial and Onava I believe, both of which are under 60 (sometimes Derasinal roams, but he's under 60, too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've had a dragon add on me during a gafala run (Pulled right down to the waterline within sight of the gnome shipwreck) before the 8th shawl once, no idea who it was though, I just noticed a second pair of chompers raining down on me and hammered gate for dear life =)<br />
<br />
Gafala's always been the safest aoer for me, ww's paths are so obscenely huge that without sitting and stareing at a dragon for an hour or 2 you just can't tell whats going to wander within that huge assist radius without just getting in there and giving it a go, its just too random (luck ranging from several uninterupted Bratavar and Pantrilla kills to a soul destroying double wipeout on Yeldema) =)</div></div><hr />
