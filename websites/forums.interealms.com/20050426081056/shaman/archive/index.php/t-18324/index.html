<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zrrak420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am half way thru 53.  I usually prefer to solo due to lots of stuff going on at home when I usually play which causes me to need to go afk at random times.  Dont want to ruin a group's fun by having to do that alot.  I do IG's in everfrost now, but the exp is kinda slow.  Anywhere that I can solo that would be faster exp?  My goal is to get to 62 asap.  Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just tossing out some ideas though you may be a lvl or so to high. I can't remember.<br />
<br />
Zone in at Karnor's Castle, Giant fort in Burning Woods, Cyclops in OOT, maybe could handle Velks at zone in, boat 1 in Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zrrak420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone know if 53 is high enuff to solo in Veksar?  Maybe near the entrance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would strongly recommend against soloing the entrance.  I have been there several times starting at about 53, but with a 54 beastlord to assist (my husband).  The mobs are plentiful, and we only had an occasional add.  However, they hit hard, stun, and the shamans DO gate and when they do, they bring back friends.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be Dulak also.  Great exp at that level and the loot can be great with gems and the like.<br />

I really enjoy that place I made decent pp there I was able to upgrade my gear pretty good. I tried veksar a bit with my monk earlier the mobs aren't too tough.. but when they gate it does suck, making a run to zone bites as well as you gotta go underwater. You might want to try KC too, exp should still be decent soloing and it's not crowded, just stay away from the entrance as alot of ppl train.</div></div><hr />
