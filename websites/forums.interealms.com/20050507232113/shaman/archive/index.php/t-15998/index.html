<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have been doing the manor house / plate cycle / whatever it's called on your server with groups of 4-5 for kicks and giggles, armor and kromiff blood for shawls. The problem is this shammie dies on the last mob everytime. The problem is he seems to be fully MR even after a dose of Malo. Without the casters being able to help he dies slowly, the room at the entrance repops, he runs out at low health and all the next room comes back with the melee. I slow, drop a few heals and die with 4 on me while trying to root the dwarf. Without that last room adding we'd be golden.<br />
<br />
Now I hate to see the answer being add more melee as Shaman are Gods/Goddesses and there should be a strat or technique to solve this. We are Kings of creative fights after all.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had luck debuffing the last (level 60) giant of the cycle? slow would be nice, but dots even nicer. Any suggestions for reducing that last walk? I'm thinking for one we can drag him back closer to the throne at the end of his health so he has further to walk, but I don't think that will enough to completely eliminate his visit to the next room. MR = no root or snare and being giant is unstunnable.<br />

It's usually 61 sham (me), 59 warrior, 58 beast and add-misc-friend x1 or x2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drag another giant in, a very low level one.  Beat the low level giant down until he starts to run.  Snare him so he can't get anywhere.  Reapply beatage as his natural regen puts him back into fight mode.<br />
<br />
Fight other giants next to your snared victim.<br />
<br />
As long as that giant's alive, the other giants should not run.</div></div><hr />

Great idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last mob is not slowable, afaik.  I don't think any spells at all will land on him, I know I never have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry to hijack, but Reapply beatage, thats priceless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I do the cycle either we pull a low lvl mob in and just slow him.  Not even necessary to fight the low lvl giants until after you kill the boss.  Their DPS is extreemly weak.  Just let him beat on the MT.  Also if/when the boss starts to run launch your Multiple pet AA skill if you have it.  Usually he wont even make it to the stairs.<br />

<br />
I was going to say the same thing. I think I'm going to visit Kael and do the manor cycle just so I can Reapply beatage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The snare the lowbie giant idea is a great one!<br />
I actually fully enjoyed this camp and thought it was a bit fun to deal out the beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 58 tried to disease debuff and slow, got those resisted also, so now I tell my guild to treat him as immune and not to even bother casting on him to avoid bounce agro</div></div><hr />
