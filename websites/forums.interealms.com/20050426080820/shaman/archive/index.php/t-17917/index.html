<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got LoY and havent been around a whole lot yet.seems hates fury is a nice high lvl zone,i was wondering if soloing here is possible/easy/etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
i saw somewhere a mob drops some tradeable 23 ac sleeves hehe,id like to get for my SK.ive heard root dont work in here,,how many mobs/pull would i get in a camp etc? anyone been hunting here much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've messed around some  in Hates. Root does work , so does VP. Mobs are a mix and match of live /undead , some live mobs see invis so make sure to con 'em all when moving thru. <br />
<br />
   Pulls depend on where you set up your camp, usually areas are a mix of single pullable, and forced multiple pulls due to mob placement, just root one and split spawn like any other camp.<br />
<br />
    Ralo the black and Uumaven the Soulless are the only two nameds I've seen thus far. Ralo took me 30 mins, lot of fun, but damn the loot was craptacular &quot; Zrathxil Splinted Cloak &quot; forget the stats. Uumaven the Soulless was a cakewalk, had the &quot;  Ebony Mail of Hatred &quot;  in retunr for my time.<br />
<br />
    All in all it's a fun little zone, never  have an company decent amount of aa for my time and some misc vendor trash / coin loot, mobs average 9 pp per kill on the troll types, luggalds have no pockets - thus no coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">great post bud,i appreciate the reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My pleasure . If you have  any other questions I'll do my best to answer  'em. <br />
<br />
    One thing  I forgot to mention tho- if you're going to explore here  I highly recommend grabbing a Virtue and burying it deep in the buff pallette. KEI is , as always , optional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just added my magelo and stuff to sig,testing if it works,lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 61, I tried the entrance. The fights are fun if you're bored, since the mobs hit like elephants and are about as easy to kill, with root breaking all over hte damn place. But as for exp? No, do not come here if you want exp solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gulu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The entrance possibly one of the worst places to solo, and might very well leave one with the impression that Hatesfury is a death trap.  Instead, try heading to the upper deck.   Easy single pulls, and not altogether horrible AA exp.  Most of my time in the zone has been spent collecting pieces to spawn Captain Jrank.  The nameds will drop some better-than-mediocre loots for your trader, although there are some laughable drops as well.  This zone is entirely deserted at any given time on my server, and I get the impression that the situation may be similar elsewhere... definitely my favorite place to explore!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went to the enterance and killed 1 mob and left. The mobs hit like girls but I couldn't get BoS or BoU to land so after the 1 mob i left. got less then 1AA % off the kill so not really worth it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">good posts,brings me to another question-are all mobs as resistant <br />
<br />
i`m trying to find some neat spots to powerlvl my friends (in their mid 50`s)  ,if these are very poi/dis resistant its not gonna be as efficient.<br />
<br />
the loot might be worth it,theres a lot of things there they`d use as upgrades yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Illia's only lists two undead mobs (&quot;reanimated&quot; suchandsuch).. the luggalds don't count as undead, do they?  Maybe just very poison/disease resistant?  Might be worth it to get bane and head back?  Very interested in this place as something new, as we've partnered droga and chardokB about to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well ive been here for 2 days now,about 10 hours total.<br />
<br />
i watched pirates of the caribbean the same day i started fighting here-it adds to the pirate mood and is a kickass movie lol,i suggest watching it b4 playing here 8p<br />
<br />
lol anyways,ive been having a lot of fun here;mobs arent very resistant although ive learned just to malos nameds to pull `em,ya cant root most of them so its a pain getting 2-3 resists.poison+disease seem to resist about 10% or so,nothing bad at all:this goes for undead or not<br />
<br />
in these 2 days ive made 1500 pp or so (not selling gems/weapons/drops from nameds) got a vengance chain tunic,a mace,a maul,a necklace,a mantle, a shield and a belt in just this time,so it seems the nameds are pretty frequent and seem to respawn 2x in a row often.<br />
<br />
it seems every room has at least 1 named that spawns in it,and with the small aggro range its not hard to move between camps (even though the mix of undead/living is strategic) ya hafta kill maybe 2 mobs between rooms and dodge see-invis mobs once inside,but this zone has been empty,just me-so i just took my time and bebopped around,crawling.<br />
<br />
very nice change from the usual,i think this zone is fun,if ya havent been there give it a shot.</div></div><hr />
