<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there are lots of threads here on how to make cash...do a search, under this forum section =p<br />
<br />
start bazing...learn the prices and buy low sell high... a lvl 1 can make millions doing it, so can you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am in a similiar situation. Casual player, gimpish gear, not much plat, and trying hard to get 65 spells and upgrades. What I have been doing is during off peak times when it's hard to get a group, is spend a few hours in Acrylia Caverns, then try to get a group in BoT hoping for drops during the more busier hours. <br />
<br />
In AC, camp the jail, there are 2 static named, and one roamer named who comes just into the entrance of the jail area. In a few hours, with 30 minute spawn time, you're likely to see 1, 2 if you're lucky. Each of the 3 three always drops something worth at least 8k (I sold earring and sword for 8k each, shield for 10k, compass for 12k). Check the thread here for more detailed info.<br />
<br />
So, in the past week or two, with about 3-4 trips to AC, I have been able to buy 2 runes (25k each on my server), which got me Malos and FA (god I wish one was Q, it's NEVER for sale on my server hehe). AC is already boring the hell out of me, but its a nice, easy, quiet spot for loot and xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga will be your best cash spot. With the double shrink method you can clear king, Jepal, Earthseer and icemaster before repops, that up to 20-30ks worth of ear if they pop in 20mins (pop one in 4/5 phs normally but can vary, often see 2 in a row)<br />
<br />
Read the Droga nameds thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Droga and Inner Acrylia are definitely good spots.<br />
<br />
For quick, easy, reliable cash there's still Sebilis. It won't make you a millionaire but if you need a quick 1k its not bad.<br />
<br />
Also consider hunting in BoT, if you stay long enough you'll get some SPs and a chance of some ornate which sells well, plus you're getting good xp.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule sewers is still a good spot, with a full group you can clear the whole place. Boots of flowing slime 70-80k, ring of flowing slime 10k, mosquito boots 50k+, mosquito leg earring 15k are all good drops. Also get some good words and runes sometimes. Solo, you can do the first room for the flowing slime items but you won't be able to reach the mosquito boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Droga will be your best cash spot. With the double shrink method you can clear king, Jepal, Earthseer and icemaster before repops<br />
<br />
I agree.  I also keep these cleared.  While i keep an eye on Broodmother in nadox ;)    Made about  200k in 4 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I had the same problem for quite sometime.  I hunted in Rathe Mountains, getting about 2000 PP for 4-6 hours play depending on how many peeps were harvesting giants, but It can get frustrating and boring at times.  Long struggle to build up enough to get the spells as most of the higher end spells can run up to 20k +.  Sometimes you can find a deal.<br />
<br />
I found a couple of alternatives however.  I found that you could harvest gems and sellable junk off the critters in the basement and hallway to basement of POJ.  Sometimes they drop Etheral Parchments that you can turn in for spells and sell for PP. Easily solo for level 65 and mobs LB, so ya get some AA.  Sometimes you get lucky and many gems drop and at times they drop rarely. Not sure why but its seems to be the luck of the draw.<br />
<br />
Things turned around for me when I started camping for the Soulstripper. Easiest camp to harvest I've ever done and only takes a few hours.  PHs pops every 20 min and occasionally you get 2 main pops back to back. Sell the Soulstripper in Bazaar for 4200pp to 5000pp and they move fairly fast. Suggest 2 boxing with a druid, so he can port to bank and drop one off, then return and get a second one, while the Shaman holds the camp.  Made over 40,000 pp so far using this method, but it still takes some work to build this amount up.  I usually have one as the sell item, then when it sells, I rush to bank to pick the one up in my shared slot.  Always sell 2 then go back to camp 2 more. (Keep in mind my Shaman has one already with a Lifetap Aug, so I can't drop it, so I have to use my Druid as the carrier.)  Considering that for just a couple of hours I have the potential to get 5000 pp, this isn't bad.<br />
Dam, I gave away my secret, now the darn camp will be camped all the time. - SHOOT - hehe<br />
<br />
Other than the other methods suggested by the others, Its just a matter of struggling to collect the cash.  I found that if you watch the bazaar prices and not rush into purchasing the spells, you will occasionally see spells sold fairly cheap at times when someone is trying to offload a spell for quick cash.<br />
<br />
The highend Items I got were from 2 sources, one, purchases at good fair prices and second, LDON drops.  Suggest you do LDONs and work toward some of the drops.  Some of those drops such as the Flesh Eater's Ring can't be beat.<br />
<br />
I know your pain.  I'm a renegade Shaman, hate raiding, prefer to be non-guilded for just this reason, so I'm not privy to the good drops, so have to make do with the junk items, but all in all, If ya have the cash, ya can buy stuff to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Tried Droga, not as easy as these peeps claim it is.  I struggled with Droga even 2 boxing.  Haven't died with shaman here, but come real close.  Guess I just don't know the layout as well, but I read that good items drop here off the named, if you can survive long enough for them to pop.  Just my persective from recent experience.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps some.<br />

Hail,<br />
<br />
It IS THAT EASY.  But if your gear and spellbook aren't very good, then don't try going after King Dronan or the other NW/SW named on your first foray into the zone.<br />
<br />
Head to the NE &amp; SE sectors of Droga and it is much easier.  Mobs hit for less (many are light blue cons at 65) and they STILL drop very nice loot.<br />
<br />
Thoroughly read the 2 Droga threads in this forum.  Read carefully ALL of the OTHER threads (especially the Beastlord's Guide) linked in those 2 threads.   Check the bazaar for prices.  See who else is farming Droga on your server.  Make a plan for what you are going to camp that is within your capabilities and stick to it.  If casters are giving you a problem, stick to the melee mobs like Whipcracker Krazzik (sp?) and the other melee mobs.  They are trivial to root/rot, but you do have to be careful.<br />
<br />
Bone Knight whatever his name and the Slinker named (very close to each other) in the upper right corner of the zone are EASY named to take out even if you don't have any 65 spells or the best gear.<br />
<br />
Plot out which you will take out, and after a day or two stretch yourself a little and go after a different one.  Find your comfort zone and stick to it.  The Copper Hammers of Striking may sell well, but if farming them involves repeated deaths (or gating) for you (w/ possibly long CR's), then go after the lesser mobs and farm them instead.<br />
<br />
Droga is a gold mine.  IA can also be, though personally it is too much of a pain to run all the way over there - which is to your advantage because many other players feel the same way.<br />
<br />
As another option, the mobs in Grieg's End are pretty easy, and they drop some okay coin.  Getting past the entrance is probably the hardest part.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frekkels is right, it really is that easy lol.<br />
<br />
It's the best cash cow for soloing i have ever found.  Though mabey higher end PoP might be better, i've never been.<br />
<br />
My gear is not off the wall, i've never really had a guild on this server, and im a casual player also.   I farm cash and xp, thats pretty much it hehe.  <br />
<br />
That said, Deffinatly read the droga thread.  Easy to clear a bunch of named at thier spawn without killing anything else.  Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you really don't mind slumming and want something that is super safe with almost the pay off these other camp sites (at least until you get the cash for the spells to farm effectively) you may consider tradeskill supplies farming.   The only prob is that you will have to leave a vendor toon up to sell your wares.<br />
<br />
Leather Padding sell for way too much 50-75pp and is needed to advance in Smithing.  Many Smiths can't stand the time it takes to farm the items themselves so you can make a killing on making these and selling them but it takes a bit of time.<br />
<br />
Stormbrunt Mountains is a great place to farm skins.  Farm spiderling silk in Everfrost.  Make the paddings yourself or sell the individual components.  Check the prices on your Bazaar and undercut folks to move your stock quickly.  <br />
<br />
Permafrost Crystals are a good sell.  Need for high end glaze.<br />
<br />
Once you get enough plat for those one or two much needed spells you can switch to Droga and IAcrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another relatively safe camp is Lower Dogs in Velks (well its called lower dogs on my server anyway), specifically Khelkar Icepaw.  The lute of the howler still sells well on my server (40-50k usually pretty fast) and the paws,scalps,bangles from the kobolds all vendor sell well (approx 23pp,18pp,8pp respectively).<br />
<br />
As a little bonus the cleric spell Celestial Healing drops fairly often and sells well at 1-2k for all those cleric bots.  Only the dispel trap in front of Khelkar's room is remotely annoying, otherwise this is a quiet place where nothing runs and you get no trains in an otherwise empty zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Frekkles,<br />
<br />
Droga is a grat place to get some nice items. At 61 I can easily split Piklo and his friends, Runri, and Kazzaik. For the caster mobs I tend to send dogdog in first to eat the HT, or if that's not possible I Torpor myself before I pull. <br />
<br />
Griegs end is very soloable and you get the chance of some nice loot there two. The trick to that place is to enter from the Scarlet Dessert side. From that side you can single pull a lot of mobs and you can activate the trap in the first courtyard. That gives you a chance to get a named. You can also get some very nice trade skill items that you can sell in the bazaar for a good amount not to mention the research pages and runes etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm researching Droga from the board, trying to get a better grip as to the routes and camps. My experience there hasn't been as easy, but perhaps I'm hitting the wrong mobs.  Mainly hitting the casters that blast me, although I've learned from that and send dog in first, thus limiting the initial damage. My magic resistance is 120 buffed, but sometimes a spell slips through.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my statement &quot;not as easy as these peeps claim it is&quot; was a bit out of place since I'm a noob to Droga, so I can't speak from experience of camping the mobs in this zone. The draw back I see with the mobs in Droga is the amount of HPs they carry, but that really shouldn't be a problem for a Shaman since we excel in the area of taking the tuffer mobs down.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on going back as soon as I get more information on many of the camps there, then I will be able to better critique the zone.  I'm reading too much information about how easy Droga is, so I'm taking the fact that I'm probably hitting the wrong mobs in the zone, since Droga seems to be divided into sections of difficulty.<br />
<br />
This thread has some good information although its not the Droga thread, It's related to the topic.<br />
<br />
I plan on spending alot of time in the zone and learn the camps, perhaps then I will be able to speak from experience.<br />
<br />
GJ guys, were getting some helpful info.  Appreciate the thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, one thing about Droga - don't sweat it if you are hurting in the first 30 seconds of the encounter.  Many of the mobs chain nuke at the start, or HT, and you can drop fast... just stick it out and torpor/quiescence and they settle right down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yea.... i almost quit my sham the other night cuz i died 5 times in a row going after earth seer gamolk..... i guess i totally under estimated this zone or my gear just inst good enough atm..... =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yep Elokl, that is why I suggested the 100% safe trade supply options.  Get one or two spells and then head back to Droga.  Sorry about your bad night shake it off we all have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok Sionnach said you might need to slum alittle bit before you move up to Droga.  Reading all these guides about Droga is fine but look at the magelos on some of these shamans soloing the king, if your gear/resist/hp/ac.... is not on par with or just under that do not try soloing there.  Look at the maps to droga and start on the far right side of droga the side you zone into fron nurga they are alot lower in level, hell try soloing lower down in Nurga.<br />
<br />
My advice where to get money in your case AC, not inner either.  There is a nice mask that drops there goes for over 9K easy but you will make easy plat on runes and acrylia.  Ok you have a spiritstone right? ok you do good bind outside AC in grimling forest.  Now to get to AC you will ahve to run through the caves in Grimling some see inviso but you should be ok.  After you bind zone in these should be green to you at 65 a few will be lt blue.  Kill the one right in front of you and then go right.  there is 2 rooms in that cave.  Oh hell check out the magicians tower in the 60-65 part of the forumn it is call the ghetto camp  something.  It explains all in great detail.  THESE run at low HP but with slow and doggie you will be fine tanking these.  Do not loot the black acrylia onl yall pieces of acrylia and break them down to small pieces to sell in bazaar.  On inny they go for 35 plat each.  Go with empty bags but for a food and water rest of room for runes and acrylia use spiritstonen drop off at bank then head back for more.  My smithing skill is at 96 and it is trivial to breakdown.  Back when i was doing this in a 3 hr night i could pull in 2-3K in runes and other vendor trash and 2-3K in acrylia, if you get a named to pop it is gravy ontop of that, your may vary of course but it is steady easy plat.  Within a week you will have enough for Q and another week you have enough for BoS and you are on your way.<br />
<br />
Like I said there is a detailed post about this in magicians tower read that get the maps.  It isnt as fast as droga for plat but it is safe.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail,<br />
<br />
If your gear and spellbook aren't very good, then don't try going after King Dronan or the other NW/SW named on your first foray into Droga.<br />
<br />
GO NE/SE.  Kill those named there.   <br />
<br />
King Dronan, Earth Seer Gamolk, Ice Master Cialin, Flame Master Japal (&amp; a few others) are not for the poorly geared or soloing novice.  Stay away from those mobs until you have more experience in the zone.<br />
READ the GUIDE!!!  The Beastlord Guide even COLOR COORDINATES the map for you.  Stay in the green zone your first few times, then try some yellow for awhile.  Slowly work your way to the red section over time.<br />
<br />
You can bootstrap your gear (&amp; spellbook) up in Droga using this method.  Selling the loot from the green area will fund your spells &amp; some upgrades so that the yellow area is doable.  Rinse &amp; Repeat for the yellow to the red area.<br />
<br />
The plethora of buffers for pp in PoK &amp; Nexus makes going into Droga with KEI &amp; Virtue (or even Pot9+Kazad if you want) very easy.  This can be your safety buffer if you aren't 3k+ hp unbuffed.  KEI of course just helps reduce your downtime.  Ensure that you put these 2 or 3 buffs (donate extra for a Druzzil if nukes are a problem because of low MR) go in the last spots on your buff bar, as in my experience those hardly ever get dispelled.<br />
<br />
Don't get discouraged.  :)  Give it another try! ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ive been marking alot of named spots down on my map in game.... its just in some of the lower level named areas the mob is surrounded by atleast 4 others....so i dont bother cause it is a long CR the only one that ive actually tried is runrin got him twice and he dropped dagger twice.....but the other camps seem like id wipe in seconds if more then one came =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Z3Ski30</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Learn bazaar!!!!  I can make around 5k a day with just quick trips to the bazaar.  Get a nice list of the research components for spells up to level 60.  Find them cheap, buy them up, get someone to combine.  I got Speed of the Brood (a 10k spell) made for me for 75p.  I sell for about 50% to get quick sales.<br />
<br />
I have had 8 combine attempts from asking random people, and 0 failures.  Just send tells around to people that don't look busy and ask them if they have max research.  The skill is a lot more common than you would think.  I also had many of my spells that I needed made for less than they would ever cost in bazaar.  <br />
<br />
This has sort of been my little secret, dunno why I'm telling you!! But, sooooo many people don't know the prices on pages and just figure they are worth squat.  Ask your LDoN groups if you can have pages since they are just going to vendor them for 2p each, they don't care.  Some of the pages alone can be worth thousands!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh, yes, I would definately agree to skip Dronan and those nearby him if your gear/spells aren't up to near-elemental levels.  I have a lot of VT gear and self-buffed HP of around 4700 (IIRC), and believe me, I have sweaty palms until Dronan is slowed.  He hits HARD with that hammer.<br />
<br />
However, Runri and Piklo and their buddies in that area are SIGNIFICANTLY easier, providing you can get them single.  I'm told you can fight Piklo in place without aggroing the other two in that room, but idunno, I always pull the left one, then the right one, then the Piklo PH and they always come single.  Those three plus the Runri camp would probably keep you busy enough.<br />
<br />
One tip: when pulling mobs that HT, pull with Spirit Call if you have it :-)  I love it every time I can get &quot;Twoflower's Pet&quot; to take the HT for me.  Gives me plenty of time to land malos and then slow, too (malos doesn't pull aggro, but slow does).  This technique works great on Runri and his PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm going to agree with those that recommend learning the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I've been soloing Droga for a while, and many of the camps do seem easy (at least the &quot;yellow&quot; and below camps) as long as you have the CC skills to get one or two at a time (root/dog park and learn which ones you can single pull with malo).  Still the cash in Droga is not flowing fast as I would like (I took a 100k loan from a guild friend, and I'd like to get it paid off quick).<br />
<br />
Watching my friend reselling things in the bazaar makes me think I've been missing the real way to make cash in this game.  With some advice I've started selling simple combine items, and am easily making more money than I ever did in Droga.  Try to find a tedious combine that people need to lvl a trade skill.  One can make five figure sums selling these skill up combines, as long as you can leave your trader up for extended periods of time.  Look for combines that one trade skill requires that involves a different trade skill (for example a common lvling combine for tailoring requires a brewing combine).  A lot of times people do not have the patience to spend time lvling a secondary skill so they can raise a different trade skill.  <br />
<br />
This is easy, safe plat.  Of course you're not getting any exp while you do this, but if you're under geared and have a hard time in Droga, Veks, AC, or other farm zones, you’re not gong to die and waste time with corps runs and rezes either.<br />
<br />
I’m not recommending reselling items, that seems to be as risky as dungeons (listening to my friend sweat over 400K worth of items that he purchased, that then started to go down in price, I know its not for me).</div></div><hr />
