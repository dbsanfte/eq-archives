<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone on Tholuxe Paells would let me do a payment kinda thing for a JBB. I am willing to farm hill giants/paineel guard/whatever until I pay it off.<br />
<br />
I got a PC of 12-14kp for jbb, then I got a PC of 25-50k later that same day(Today). So I don't really know what to believe. :confused: <br />
<br />
Send me a tell in game if you'll help me out. Need to know price and how much you want per day / stuff like that.<br />
<br />
I get the feeling it may be asking a bit much though :( <br />
<br />
Good luck to all you fellow shamans out there getting JBB's. So far it's been impossible for me to get one. /bye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you manage to find one for 12-14K, snap it up.  Prices on TP for these are pretty high and they are in big demand.  Some Kupo Flux twink offered me 30K for mine, but I wouldn't sell, check out tholuxe.com for items listings you might see one, but they're pretty rare</div></div><hr />
