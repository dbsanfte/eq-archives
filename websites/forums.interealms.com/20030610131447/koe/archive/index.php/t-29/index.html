<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I posted not too long ago about there being a possible fear raid in the near future. The time I am looking at is going to be on Saturday the 14th of April, at around 11:00 PST. This is going to be 2:00 for all of you easterners. Rizz has offered to help me lead this raid, and I am planning on taking one or 2 core groups in to maybe do some scouting, and getting us established on the west wall before we start to bring people in. You can post here your class and level but, it would be most helpful to me if you could E-Mail me at spiritbombed@yahoo.com as to your level, and class if you can make it, and I will try and get some groups thrown together before the raid day, and so that when we all arrive at 11:00 people will be ready to come on in. This raid will be following standard KoE loot policies which can be reffered to here:<br />

KoE Loot Rules (&quot;http://interealms.com/koe/lootrules&quot;)<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to a successful raid, and hoping to see a good turnout. I will continue posting to keep everyone up to speed, so check in from time-to-time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was curious as to if there is some great info out there on Fear. I have checked a few and they are ok but would like more info. I kinda know about the break and there are a few paths to go once broken. The most popular I think is head West? Last Sunday I was there and we went South, it was a pretty quite place and we were able to get some good pulls. What are your thoughts? Should we start a thread designed for maybe each of the planes? What about the mobs? I heard that there are only like 3 or 4 Gorgons? Again, on Sunday we killed 2 and FoH and friends killed at least 3 that I saw.... I looted 3 of them myself. So there has to be more now. Spawn time? Is it really 8 hours before lets say more Gorgons show up? <br />
<br />
Here is one of my goals: I want to know Fear almost inside out. I want to be able to lead the guild on a raid there one day and take out the whole zone. Yes I know, I may not be able to but hell it is worth a shot. Personally I feel our guild doesnt go to the planes enough. I think at our levels most of us should be in full planar gear. But hey, thats just me and I might be alone or get flamed on that. hehe <br />
<br />
Thats all for now =)</div></div><hr />
