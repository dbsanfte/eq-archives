<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was soloing with my pet the other day and was killing steady. This got me to wondering if a pet slows down because of lack of stamina. Does anyone know for sure if a pet class uses the stamina factor or is it not part of the equation with them? If it is part of the equation and the pet is constantly hitting should we cast acumen on them to get the max performance out of them? Also another question on pets. I have been hunting in areas where a lot of amour drops and sometimes have a full inventory so I started putting the amour on my pet for a joke, something like giving a pet a weapon :) I wonder if the AC an HP on the amour I am giving them will do anything to their stats??<br />

Maybe I just sit and look at my monitor for to long and have to many fried brain cells.<br />

<br />
Someone could easily test it with a log parser - just keep your pet attacking constantly and see if its attack rate changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Attack rate does not change on NPC's.<br />
For that matter, NPC's do not have stamina. It's not effected by stat buffs.</div></div><hr />
