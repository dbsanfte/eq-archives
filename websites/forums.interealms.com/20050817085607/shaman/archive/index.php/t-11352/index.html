<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well the tunnel that presumably leads to Broken Skull Clan Lair (and the rest of the LoY zones) is lined with hundreds of mobs (mainly green to level 55) that will all aggro... but they sure seem harder than your usual greens.<br />
<br />
Although it probably is possible to solo your way through these mobs the biggest problem is that everyone takes the shortcut, which is just to sprint your way through them, dragging mega trains along with you.<br />
<br />
So woe betide anyone foolish enough to attempt the slow but sure method as you will just get trained and trained and trained again.<br />
<br />
And invis wont help as many of them are undead and see through invis. My monk can just FD flop her way through but my poor shaman has no hope. <br />
<br />
At  the end of the tunnel the trolls con DB to me (55) and there are a few shaman guards that heal each other during the fight. If fighting these you must pull well back into the tunnel as when low on health they just sprint back in to the lair and get healed (although a root would probably work - didnt have it memmed)<br />
<br />
Maybe things will improve but I doubt it. There will always be selfish players who dont give a rats arse about the huge trains they make and the havoc they cause. It seems the only way to get through this chaos is to be level 60 ish and train everyone else (all the 40-50 ish players the extension was designed for!), or go through with a decent group.<br />
<br />
Yet again SOE screw the soloers... 2 expansions in a row now... oh well at least it is only 4 zones...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For greens they sure are tough - even managed to kill Goofy and he can normally solo LB Hill Giants for me (admittedly, the giants are slowed, but then so were these &quot;greens&quot;). <br />
<br />
Then again, I noticed in the patch message they fixed some mobs in the Karanas who had about 400 times as manay HP as they should have had (eep! - bandits anyone?). Why not throw in a bundle of v. tough greens?</div></div><hr />

Yeah that sucks... but according to our Tips from the Crucible you just need to take your death and live with it for being near the entrance to a zoneline. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I could tell if you hug the right wall as you enter the cave you can get to the second zone without any agro. Till you enter the cave.  I think you can navigate the cave without agro if you are lucky but more then likely you will create 1 hell of a train.<br />
Once you actually make it into the second zone everyone is kos except trolls.  Lev doesnt work and you have to run through lava and kill fire elementals with way to many hp.  It is an indoor zone so no sow either.<br />
<br />
The pathing in nardox (think the spelling is right) sucks and things agro through walls.  Also everything seems to be social.</div></div><hr />

Well in any other zone I could live with that since there are almost always alternative spots to camp (eg. just right or left of ZO). But in this zone it is inherent in the design of the tunnel so completely SOE's fault. I cannot think of another zone that was designed for the sole purpose of creating trains like this!<br />
<br />
Since training other groups is unacceptable by SOE's acceptable use policy, SOE should ban themselves from EQ...<br />
<br />
BTW, I thought of a good name for the tunnel... what about &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;? (after that thing where one person runs between two lines of people who beat on them with sticks and such).<br />
<br />
Bandicoot<br />
<br />
PS. I'll try the idea about sticking to the right of the tunnel with my monk... they are great for scouting new zones... if it works we just have to get everyone else to follow it!</div></div><hr />
