<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can think of one or two all/all robes off the top of my head, but it won't matter.  There's no robe graphic for barbarians.  You'd just have a tinted chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly, barbarian females can't wear any of the robe graphics.  How about a nice matched set of totemic (no helm, of course)?  With the old models, it looks really great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a smith to make tinted armour to match your groom, best idea I can come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not sure how the robe from qeynos displays on a barb but its white all/all and costs like 2pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barbs can't wear robes, she'd either have a naked chest or a tinted chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Naked chest . . . /drool<br />
I think this says it all at a wedding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go as a bear.!  <br />
<br />
A lady in a fur coat can't be matched. (Laughs) Esp if there is nothing underneath... (Evil grin)<br />
<br />
I agree with Gloriana, go in Totemic. Sharp looking, easy to aquire, and won't break the money pouch so you can afford more booze.<br />
<br />
Make sure to have a nice large hammer in hand so you can be sure to keep the groom in line.  And a nice touch is to force the groom to fight to you through retainers of your own choosing. ( Or if he is a wimpy elf sissy wigglefinger type you can fight through to him. (Grins)<br />
<br />
Then there is the Customary Halas nekkid beer induced Swimming/brawl in the lake of Halas itself. After a nice dip in there if yah man can still perform his duties you know you have one to keep and don't need to feed him to the Snow Pumas.<br />
<br />
Also make sure to have a stamina spell memorised and again if a puny wigglefinger type a strength and grow spell as well. (Grins)<br />
<br />
Try not to rage/Voice of the beserker though. A torn apart husband will not be useful to watch the brats while you go off to war...<br />
<br />
Congratulations on yah getting hitched. Hope yah have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks everyone....  i appreciate it....  hopefully i can uptain a whole suit of totomec by then...  can a lvl 35 get the suit with no help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the thing I am most proud of in EQ is getting a full suit of totemic at level 24 using only the help of a level 28 monk.  We camped for the money for deurfranite, we camped for the parts.  It was great fun, and the biggest challenge I have ever faced in game.  I imagine you can solo it at 35, but if not, the parts are pretty easy and cheap to buy in your trade zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What self respecting barb lass would be caught dead in a dress anyway?? Dresses are for their men!!<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know..<br />
<br />
<br />
Have everyone sit naked in a giant vat of PUDDING!!<br />
<br />
<br />
h00ray for pudding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey Coraz, what color are you in greater bear form?<br />
Something I always wanted to know . . .  <br />
<br />
Oh and also how do you like your sneak skill?  Do you find it very useful?  I can think of about 5 different exploits of that skill on a shaman, none of them bannable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Depending on how much you got around, you might want to mismatch some armor for a multi color effect. Grab a plaid kilt from Mr. Icebear. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They fixed the multi color bear thing like.. a year ago in a patch<br />
<br />
Im an ugly flabby brown bear, and I use a horse, so I only use bear form to torment and stick my butt in peoples' faces..<br />
<br />
I've saved soo much pp selling to vendors with sneak :P I don't use it for anything but selling.. I'm not good with sneak hehe, I don't know any of its real uses except going behind see invis mobs maybe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Try activating sneak and then casting a spell on a mob that is away from you a bit but is surrounded by mobs to high to single pull.  You should single it if the mobs aren't looking directly at you.  At least, I can do this with my monk who also has Sneak skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, sneak pulling works well. Just have to be far enough away so as to not have your sneak broken while still in aggro range of all the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">White Greater Bear Form = Dead Sexy, too bad you are lvl 35 :(</div></div><hr />
