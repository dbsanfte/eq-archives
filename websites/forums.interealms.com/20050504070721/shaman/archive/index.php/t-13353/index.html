<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a 44 SK on a second account to 2box with, although lately I've been using that account for a 24/7 bazaar mule.  I thought about it alot and asked around, and finally made the SK.. but now I'm having second thoughts.  Last night I died (three times, but let's not get into that..) and lost 65, and was thinking about how it would be nice to have a pally on that second account for a 90% res.  I tend to do alot of risky (ie. stupid) things and a pally sounds like a nice idea.  Added healing power never hurt anyone either.  Ranger's nagging at me too, however.  Tracking is a really helpful skill; my old main was a druid and although I'm a shaman for life now its something I have to admit I miss.  Rangers can also do amazing damage if not tanking, and I do occasionally group with a friend who 4boxes a pally/cleric/rog/shaman.  While a SK or pally wouldn't add much to this group, a ranger would.  I'm not into getting 500 aa points; that would involve choosing a plate tank; as we all know the only real exp now is in PoP.. although I do want some aa's.<br />
<br />
So anyhow, let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What, no monk or beastlord? Or even rogue! I duo'd with a rogue for a while, I was tanking in teh face when he backstabbed, between backstabbing we'd take it in turns to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You forgot two that have always been my faves:  Monks and Rogues.  The former because they can single pull anything, have good DPS and are fun to watch and the later because I get to tank In Teh Face while they do HUGE DPS from behind.  And since both are so well focused, our style and theirs complement each other well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sk is the best class in most occasions.    if you have high-end elemntal type gear, ranger i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I chose Ranger, as the most versatile of the listed options.  The many options available to a ranger are worth the reduced tanking efficiency IMHO.<br />
<br />
Good aggro with snare.  Healing second only to the Paladin for the choices given.  HP/AC/DS buffs.  Harm pulling.  Track varies from a minor help to a godsend, depending on the situation (Snow Griffin eggs, anyone?).  The combination of snare and root can allow good ghetto crowd control when it hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Of course, it all depends on how adept you are at two-boxing I guess.  Pallys and SKs both have some good utilities, and wouldn't be as high-maintenence to two-box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My favorite melee partner is dogdog! :)<br />
<br />
War, Pali, SK are all the same to me. They just keep the mob entertained after I slow and cripple. I prefer playing with a Shm, Nec, or Ench though, I love pet tanking. I'd put Mag and Bst but haven't duoed with em much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Paladin/Shaman duo in Tactics is really fun.  No need to go begging for a rez if things go bad, and no need to go begging for buffs or what not that most other partners always want to get before they are ready to exp.<br />
<br />
I've always preferred pallies as partner though.  A rangers track ability CAN be a wonderful thing, and their DPS can be amazing, but I want somebody wearing plate armor as my partner.  An SK's aggro abilities are really nice, but his special abilities (FD, HT, etc) aren't going to save me when things go bad -  a pally's LoH, superfast heal, and stuns have saved me many many times and taken a bad situation into one that was easy to win.<br />
<br />
ANY partner can be fun (I like duoing with a non-uber enchanter), but I feel a pally brings more to the table than the other normal partners.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My two good friends are a 65 rog and a 65 ranger, so I've got some experience 2boxing both.. rogue is great to duo with if you're not controlling it.. if you are, its either backstab or canni, not both ;)  Not a strong 2box choice.  I didn't include monk because of how SOE anally raped them just before PoP, I had a level 60 Brother and I still feel almost physically sick at what Sony did.  I didn't include beast because they can't tank whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have to agree with Nirtox (out of the list). Pally works well, but think rogue or monk should be a step above. My hunting partner is a pint-size rogue who does really well - I slow first, dot/debuff as time permits to aggro, take a couple beatings, while rogue gets at least 1-2 backstabs in. Drops the HP significantly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe I may have answered this from a different point of view.  My wife is a warrior so my &quot;favorite&quot; partner is her, or I get my ass kicked.  Don't have a whole lot of experience with duoing with any other class.</div></div><hr />

A Quiescenced bard with a fleshgrinder and troubador's mace is nice :)</div></div><hr />
