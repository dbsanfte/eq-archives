<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The more I think about it, the more outraged I become.<br />
<br />
Not only was Disinfecting Aura nerfed... not only was it replaced with a lessor version... not only do we have to farm for quest items... but we also have to buy the expansion just to get it back!  Not to mention that they also gave the spell to 2 other classes as well! (Cleric, Druid)<br />
<br />
Shaman didn't get 2 new spells in this expansion like all the other classes.  No we truly only got 1 new spell, Stoicism.<br />
<br />
Why didn't SoE simply change all of the Disinfecting Auras in spellbooks to Pure Blood, and then make Disinfecting Aura the quested spell?  I know why... because nobody would bother doing it then!  :mad:<br />
<br />
If I had just hit level 52, I wouldn't even bother scribing Disinfecting Aura in its current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/shrug<br />
<br />
What are ya gonna do? SoE wont even look at topor drop rates.  <br />
<br />
Being angry and bitching didnt work for us either.  Dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me put my feelings on these events.<br />
<br />
For a long time now shaman have been over looked and ignored , we were and are a powerful class and got stealth nerfed to hell and back. I mean there is no reasonf or shorter durations and higher mana costs , or should i say there is only ONE reason. We as a community were outraged at the events unfolding around us and tried to band together several times with truly of victory. We have collectivly canceled LoY accounts , we looked around adn said , why are other classes getting attention , what are they doing ? Looking to the druids we saw that bitchign and screaming and whining got much attention from sony so we put away our calm cool and level headed mannar and preceeded to hold our breathes for what i feel we thought would be a short time.<br />
<br />
Well time lingered on and changes never happened , but the attitude anger festered in this community changing many people including myself to a less then desirable state when we posted/played/whatever as a shaman..<br />
<br />
What has it all gotten us. Nothing. Allt he thigns we truly asked for have been ignored , nothing has been changed , there has been a few bones as of late ,b ut nothing along the true lines we need ( malo/torpor drops, healing issues, buff durations , healing ). So what is there left to do. We can scream angrily in the empty space which no one is listening to as we burn out from the gfrustrations of the game or we can accept what has transpired and just enjoy what is left before we all move on to other games , or before the true life of this game dies and instead of people that care and have fun , you just have UBER 13 year olds causing trouble left.<br />
<br />
Me , i would like to get back to how it was , im tired of bitching and whining , its not my style and it sickens me that i let it become my default behavior. Last night i played my new frog shaman and wizard and had more PPURE fun in this game in a long time , i took the time to do quests and not beg for buffs so i can power level and be uber , took the time to just enjoy the game for what it is and not complain about any of it. I sat wwith my shaman afterwards and buffed up froggies to help them on their way and again , just flat out enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
So i ask , at this point , at this hour in the game , what point is there ti bitch and whine and hold our breathe anymore . level 44 shaman got a serious spell up grade to their healing which alot of you mgiht not remember but it was NEEDED for that level. We have new parts to alchemy which no one can seriously complain about. Just think about it , we have illsusion potions that can be made for under 100 pp , you know how many tells from guildies and strangers i got last night from people asking me if i can make them some ? Or dyes ?<br />
<br />
Its not that bad a game , shaman are not that bad off , atleast in my eyes and I for 1 am goign to try to get back to how it was , when i enjoyed the game.<br />
<br />
So this issue really doesnt bug me at all.<br />
<br />
My ten cents worth a penny anyway ...<br />
<br />
peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have this feeling that the quest for the lvl 44 Stocism.. will end up being the equivilant of the spell Primal Essence.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you know what I mean when I say that.  Putting a level 44 spell in areas requiring monster drops that a group of level 44s might or might not be able to pull off.<br />
<br />
This is just my gut feeling.  Once someone finally completes the quest, I guess we'll know.<br />
<br />
The fact still remains that this was not a 2 spell expansion for us... it was a 1 spell wonder, if even that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ginkinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How many times have I pulled out disinfecting aura since I got it?  Maybe a dozen.  So what if other classes get it.  It's not a spell that breaks or makes a group.  So stop with the silly outrage posts.  I also took a gander at the 2 spells other classes got.  And you know what?  Take away Pure blood, some of the other classes got stoopid 1 spells.  <br />

<br />
You wanna be a bard that can remove poison disease and curse counters more?  LOL<br />
<br />
A druid with a lvl 44 heal of 425HP and pureblood?  lmao<br />
<br />
necro get FD spell and can give 30 HP from target to group?  when was the last time I saw a necro in a group again..?<br />
<br />
Paladins get 2 heals.../shrug<br />
<br />
wiz gets some kinda acumen and another cold dd<br />
<br />
Shamans get Stocism (mini torpo) and pureblood<br />
<br />
Sounds like shamans made pretty out dang good.  Got what we needed and got some gimp stuff like the rest of the classes.  And if your really upset about disinfecting aura, then grow up and get radiant cure.  It rocks, and is a group cure.   Now someone finish that quest and sell me mini-torpo :p</div></div><hr />

Some one dotted, tash'd, slowed, ect mem it real quick and done. Now its completely useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think we've pretty much learned complaining about stuff usually gets us no where. so far i love the new expansion. it's got fun stuff for us. i will live with having to get pure blood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DA is now functionally equivalent to Abolish Disease.... only with a slower casting time.  It removes 48 counters instead of 36.. only there's nothing that adds 48 counters atm... which means that there's nothing it can do that abolish disease can't do... which means it's DA is now useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slightly more irritated about patches?  Yes - all the patches take place when I'm playing (0600 EST).<br />
<br />
Outraged? About anything to do with a game?  Seek treatment immediately - you have lost perspective.<br />
<br />
At worst, this will require a slight modification to how you play the game.  Think of it as a challenge. :D  You still like to be challenged don't you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DA might be useful on Grummus... Grummus has 2 dots, 1 is 9 counters, other is 36... (i think)<br />
<br />

<br />
12 counters<br />
12 counters<br />
12 counters &lt;--- 36 counter dot gone<br />
12 counters &lt;--- 9 counter dot gone<br />
<br />
It doesnt, as abolish, remove all counters in one slot, so thats why i think it can cure several dots at once.... Should check it out by casting our 4 lowest disease dots on our selves, then cast DA to see if it cures them all in 1 cast...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was expecting DA to become was a group version of itself.<br />
<br />
Effectively what Sony have done is remove a spell we already had and E-Bay'd it back to us with the additional effort of multiple hours of killing greens to do the quest for a lesser version of a spell we already had.<br />
<br />
That is seriously screwed up. If someone chooses not to buy LoY they have lost out on a valuable spell. I use it all the time. It cures poison dots from shaman mobs and cures tash from chanter mobs. Now those who have chosen not to buy the expansion are nerfed and those that do had to spend our hard earned money to quest a lesser version of a spell we already had before the expansion and spend hours doing the quest.<br />
<br />
I fully EXPECT Sony to change DA into a group version of the spell it was before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Lawful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">now abolish disease is just sitting there curing disease counters too, what the hell is the logic of nerfing dis aura when we already HAVE the ultimate disease cure.  this is retarded.<br />

same as canni2.. lv 39 spell that you aren't likely to get until you're  well past it.. i mean how many under 45 do you see in KC?<br />
not to mention taking out reavers in CoM?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as far as DA/PB argument goes.. i'm not high enough to use either yet.. but 'm still kinda ticked..  i mean we get 2 new spells some of ours nerfed.. and one of the spell quests is broken?!?! FK that.. that's just a load of crap..<br />
<br />
anyway.. i suggest that everyone does a /feedback and include nothing but the URL to this thread so that SoE/Vi/whoever might  have some thoughts on what's on our minds..<br />
<br />
i really do like the idea of DA being the unnerfed group version.. that sounds pretty cool..<br />
<br />
and ya i'd love stoicism.. it'd be fun to play with if nothing else..<br />
<br />
while we're at it.. a snare.. doesn't have to last long.. like a 5 tick mebbye would do wonders.. just enough to keep a mob from agro'n other mobs when they're running away and dog is having dinner..<br />
<br />
no i'm not going overboard and asking for a lifetap and a harm touch too.. not that i would complain (voodoo spirit hehe).. but a snare would be nice for finishing off mobs.. or a root that does some weak DD like the rng/druids do.. something better than immobilize (which i'm using now) that doesn't seem to do much if anything.. if it decides to stick.. which it usually doesn't :/<br />
<br />
anyway that's my thoughts.. feedback is welcome.. flames are not ;)<br />

<br />
Wait.... NOPE. Stench of Decay *is* 36 disease counters (every 40 seconds). But plasma Decay is 9 *curse* counter, every 3 minutes. Of which you take care with Radiant Cure since it just refreshed.<br />
<br />
When did I keep Disinfecting Aura loaded? Everytime I was fighting 'chanter MOBs. Nothing like removing Slow and Tash in one cast. Now, to do the same, I will have to 'quest' Pure Blood. <br />
<br />
48 disease counter removed in 4 chunks of 12 are a lot more useless to me then DA ever was. While there isn't much 'chanters MOBs in the game, there is a lot more of them than there is of MOBs stacking 48 disease counter on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Also annoys me that Disinfecting Aura still has the same spell icon - the same one as the poison cures....</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i do pretty good imo i have beat most every class in duels even clerics and chanters..<br />
<br />
but now any priest class can cure my dots.. take druids they cure my dot i cure theres.. so then it becomes more of a nuykeing battle and thats over before it even starts :( <br />
<br />
if they changed counters of dots so that PB couldent cure it then i could care less<br />
<br />
oh and the nerf to DA was prety gimped imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just emailed sony with our concerns + the link to this thread.<br />
<br />
Every day I ask myself one of two questions:<br />
<br />
-Do they even care?<br />
<br />
-What are they thinking?<br />
<br />
Things like this make me want to quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">How many times have I pulled out disinfecting aura since I got it? Maybe a dozen. So what if other classes get it. It's not a spell that breaks or makes a group.<br />
<br />
Although I know it's a big deal on PVP servers, it doesn't bother me that druids and clerics got Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
This is what bothers me:<br />
<br />
1)  Disenfecting aura is nerfed and the &quot;remove poison counters&quot; bit is removed.  Our best cure poison spell is once again the level TWENTY NINE counteract poison.  The cure poison aspect of disenfecting aura was what MADE the spell for shaman, it put us nearly on a par for the first time with clerics in the &quot;cure&quot; department, since before Luclin, only clerics had abolish poison.<br />
<br />
2) In order to regain the power we had with disenfecting aura, we must QUEST a no drop spell, which requires the LOY expansion.<br />
<br />
3) At this time, there appears to be no purpose to the increased power of the &quot;improved&quot; disenfecting aura.  Anything DA can cure, including high powered mob dots like the Grummus dot, abolish disease can also cure.<br />
<br />
So, just to reiterate:<br />
<br />
Our spell is nerfed and &quot;improved&quot; to be no better than an existing spell.  In order to get the same ability to cure poison as before LoY, I must do some lame quest.  I am really really pissed about this.<br />
<br />
After the slow mitigation nerf, affliction focus item &quot;fix&quot; debacle and this Pure Blood insult, it's quite clear that shaman have no advocate at SOE.  There is no one speaking for us, no one saying &quot;hey, that doesn't make sense to give shaman Pure Blood when they already have disenfecting aura.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ya know, after all they've taken away lately, you'd think they'd finally honor our request to remove the str/dex spells from spectral parchment returns, just a small gesture to let us know that someone from SOE is listening and cares about shaman concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Frostbyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I agree with the peeved sentiments of the posters above this one and am not happy with those that say to go with the flow.<br />
<br />
and yes i'm from a pvp server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lefusgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't think there is someone at SoE to represent shaman either, but I do think they have been paying attention to the board. Since I started lurking on these boards I've read nothing but how great it would be to have a mini-torpor and how alchemy was broke. Well with LoY they threw in mini-torpor and some new alchemy stuff. <br />
But the thing that strikes me as the oddest is the DA change. Not even 2 weeks before LoY was released the Affliction Focus nerf happened and the thread about cancelling everyone's preorder started. It may sound a little &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; of me but I feel that they threw us mini-torpor and the alchemy stuff as a bone (sorta misdirection), but then nerfed DA and gave it back to us in Pure Blood to push more shaman to buy the expansion.</div></div><hr />
