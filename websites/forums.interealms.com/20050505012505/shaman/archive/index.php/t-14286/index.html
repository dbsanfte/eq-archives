<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I forgot about all that I read on the thread about shaman being king of AE from a while back and the search will not show it again. Since the exp change was introduced, I was thinking it might be time to head to some old dungeons with a bard and see what the exp is like now. Can anyone (and I know there are many who know) re-enlighten me on the techniques used. I don't want to start a discussion again on whether or not we are the &quot;kings&quot;, I just wanted the know-how or at least some hints like the old thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I can tell it had to do with the 4-mob limit hitting a bard and keeping the bard alive with torpor and aoe slow.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this 4-mob limit was removed a while ago, leaving your bard victim to every mob that wants to hit him.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm wrong, 'cause I'd love to play this out with a bard partner one day using the new increased blue-range.  Hello Karnor's basement!</div></div><hr />

nope, it wasn't an exploit in any way, all the mobs hit you fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That Crashem guy was soo freaking irritating with his dumb ass posts.  We da kings baby- but I can't explain why.  How hard is it to say was Csin just said in two sentences.  <br />
Anyways, is this still good.  Do only three mobs attack at once, or have they fixed that?  I have the urge to totally go in and jack up EQs world right now for their nerf on solo PoP exp.  This could be just the trick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">4 mobs can hit you at once, no matter how many are aggroed on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not true any more Lor, as Csin said, the &quot;4 mob limit&quot; was removed a while ago. Any number of mobs can hit a PC, but it works in our favour too as any number of pets can hit a mob - which (allegedly) used to not be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The whole King of AE thing was true with a bard and shaman being 60+.<br />
<br />
Basically the premise is that with continual pulls between 2 toons you get 6-8 mobs slowed and getting dotted by bard AE Dot (sometimes more depending on mob and equipment.) Keep the bard alive between pulls. One mob dies, go get another. Basically a never ending XP loop and hardly any downtime at all.<br />
<br />
I think this showed a consistant 10-20% increase in XP over standard AE group or something close to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe the way it works is this.<br />
<br />
In fungus grove the small mushrooms don't hit very hard.  You have a bard playing the 2 or 3 ae damage songs, and if they can play a regen song, then so be it.  <br />
<br />
You have the shaman cast replenishment, disease resist, and other hit point buffs on the bard.  At this point the bard should be regening hit points at a very high rate, a fungi would make it even easier.  Shaman goes out and pulls a shroom with turgurs.  Bring it back to the bard,  shaman epic dot's the shroom, and casts torpor on the bard.  Bard should be able to take agro and keep the mobs standing around him.  80% of the shrooms in fungus don't run.  If the bards disease resist is high enough, probably around 150, the shrooms spells won't land.  Shaman goes and grabs another shroom.  The number of mobs you keep in the fight, depends on the level and gear of your bard.<br />
<br />
Of course the guy that created this method is going to say this isn't exactly correct, but i'm sure it's pretty close.</div></div><hr />
