<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I recently got canny5. Its awesome (yes, i have killed myself with it, in thurg, when not hunting, of all places) and i love it to bits<br />
<br />
Thing is, now i have three more AA's saved up, and I can't make my mind up with what to do with them. Do I get better heals?, critical heals?, longer buffs?, mass group buff? WHAT?<br />
<br />
I was kinda wondering what other shaman chose after canny5, and their reasons for choosing them. Any input would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slaiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mass Group Buff if you're in a raiding guild, then spell casting mastery or quick buff would be a good choice after that or if you're not into raiding.<br />
<br />
Spell casting reinforcement is very nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there a list w/ in depth descriptions of all our aa abilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Went MGB because 1. I raid far more than I exp and 2. Guild didnt have any other shaman with it.<br />
<br />
Going for skills for either longer or faster torpors next because 1200hp heals when raid buffed to over three times that gets frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MGB is useful for a wipeout recovery buffing (or for cleric aego as it saves money) - personally I'd go for quick buff and mastery as everyone has already stated :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">has anyone trained channeling focus?<br />
<br />
i get interrupted a lot by shrooms and things when I solo (as a Barb), and am wondering if this *really* makes a difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've heard conflicting reports whether SCMR works on group buffs or not.<br />
<br />
According to Caster's Realm:<br />
<br />
Investing in this ability raises the total duration from 30% (with 3 points in SCR) to 50%. <br />
<br />
This means that a Shamans Group Focus Spell will last 2 hours 30 minutesas opposed to the normal 1 hours 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
But I think I remember a shaman on this board saying that the longer buff duration AA skill doesn't work on our group buffs.<br />
<br />
Anyone got the real story?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I went with spell casting reinforcement seeing as it had 2 benefits: longer buffs thus longer Torpor. I don't know if it works with group buffs as the on test I tried I forgot that when you use /TGB it hits yourself as well so I realized an hour later I ruined my test and haven't tried again since. Quickbuff was the other one I was considering at the time. I ended up getting MGB however because I finally got group focus then reinforcement mastery. Did QB1 but I didn't feel like saving up so many damn points again so been getting easy ones like scm 1 and channeling focus 1. Can't decide what I want next however. Should I bite the bullet and save 6 and get QB2 or spend at 4 and get SCM 2. Oh well, that's a little ways off yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCR works with group buffs.  I have level one of it which is 5% longer.  That means the 20 minute group regrowth buff lasts 21 minutes.  It wears off my group same time as it wears off of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You sir, must be jokeing.<br />
<br />
RABID BEAR (Rar!) <br />
<br />
(Laughs) Sorry. Once I get the +5% 2HB crystal and a drathor great hammer and rabid bear I will Log a cycle and show yall what a Bashy bear does when angry..<br />
<br />
Of course it won't be as much as a thief in full backstab mode. Of course it is only for 5 minutes every 2 hours. (Will Spall casting reinforcement make it longer? Mmmm)  Of course I will still only hit for 1 some of the time (Grr no main hand bonus)<br />
<br />
But the look on someones face when I tell them I do xx DPS meele on a mob will be priceless. And then let them know I also did xx number a tick from stacking dots,  Was regening 382 hp a tick from torpor a potion and regular regen, All while my mutt adds damage.<br />
<br />
Muhahaha it may not make sense but damn I am going to have fun with it once I get it.<br />
<br />
After Rabid bear I'll prolly do a point of Quick buff, then the second point of SCR, then the next point of Quickbuff, then Maybe the second point of Spell casting Fury, then Who knows. Maybe some Planes of power stuff. Or Extra Stamina or something.<br />
 Hell I might take Some more points of Dex Just for giggles. Or charisma to help with landing slows. (Snicker)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally, now that I'm done with canna 5, I'm going:<br />
<br />
MGB<br />
SCM--all 4 levels<br />
Quick buff 2<br />
Channelling focus 3<br />
Quick buff 3<br />
Rabid bear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">have Canni5, MGB, and Rabid<br />
<br />
was planning on getting Quick buff to finish 3rd tital, then all 4 points of SCM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am skiping MGB.  I can focus and sta 4 groups before having to resort to regular cann4 and torpor to hit the last couple groups. I still get full mana before the MGB cleric is ready.<br />
<br />
Quick buff 2, then SCR...been seriously thinkin about inate sta boost...could use more hp for cann5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grats on CannV.<br />
Go go Spear Bear.<br />
<br />
Personally, i have only just started to be interested in levelling again, but will aim for cannv, then probably quick buff 2, to get a faster casting torpor, as i don't have a spell haste item.<br />
<br />
I'm also keen on scm, to save mana on all spells, then i'll probably quit :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hiho,<br />
<br />
in my opinion no other class skill is worth the time invested except Canni5. We were getting screwed over with those AA class skills when you compare them to other classes. I will not go on XPing like mad for those crappy skills<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Will aa skills stack with focus items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2664&amp;highlight=quickbuff<br />
<br />
Here's the thread where we discuss:<br />
<br />
Quickbuff<br />
Spell Haste III<br />
Enhancement haste III<br />
<br />
I have an enhancement haste III earring and quickbuff 1 and they are stacking nicely.  One of the spells (can't remember which one) is casting faster than 3.0 seconds (previously it was determined that no spell could be reduced more than 50% or under 3.0 seconds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The path I followed and will follow is:<br />
<br />
1.  Can 5  (done first).<br />
2.  Quick Buff 1  (nice to have...torpor already a tad faster)<br />
3.  Mass Group Buff (no shaman really had it and I got tired of doing all those group focuses on raids and tanks bitching because buffs were taking too long).<br />
4.  Quick Buff 2 (next)<br />
5.  Quick Buff 3 (3 sec torpor, 13 sec Group Focus...wraaa)<br />
6.  Rabid Bear<br />
7.  Spell Casting Mastery 1 (I really care less how long my buffs last..I have so much mana thanks to Can series refreshing them does not bother me).<br />
<br />
I am the prime shaman these days in my guild for raids so I do a ton of work on prep time and combat so I try to balance the AAs for that.  Frankly if you are not a busy shaman on raids go nuts on AAs that you would not normally choose.   Have fun instead of sacrificing some time and AAs for something that you will not use that much.</div></div><hr />
