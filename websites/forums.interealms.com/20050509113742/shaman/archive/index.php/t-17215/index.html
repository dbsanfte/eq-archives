Wearing a bunch of wisdom gear and ignoring hp/ac; dressing up like a druid, unable to take a hit or canni very much.</div></div><hr />

Golden Booties, Jasper Rings, 255 WIS and like 1200 HPs at 60, etc...  Pretty much a shaman that focuses on WIS instead of HP/AC/STA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing specific, just a (joking) name to call someone that a poster feels is concentrating too much on wisdom gear.  Comes from the fact that most druids rely on high wisdom and kiting, where shaman rely on more ac/hp to survive when agro is gained from slowing or dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">one item that epitomizes the druman is the golden efreeti boots, if you are wearing them, take a good hard look at yourself, or at least your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol, let's not be TOO hard on shamans who do place some importance on WIS.<br />
<br />
Remember, once you pass 50, Wis starts becoming important on fizzle checks.<br />
<br />
My shaman is my main and I've only been playing for about 6 months, and when I got to around 55 or so,  I had a terrible problem with my new spells fizzling.  My magic skills were all capped, and the higher I went, the more fizzle problems I had.<br />
<br />
Then, i got some decent combined +wis/+hp gear....<br />
<br />
*poof*...fizzle problem started becoming less of an issue.<br />
<br />
I'm not leetly equipped by ANY means, and I know I have a LONG way to go upgrading my gear, but I can manage 2885hp self buffed, AND I have a 252 wis with KEI/VoQ.<br />
<br />
Wisdom isn't our PRIMARY focus, but it does play a part when you're throwing spells outside the Alteration specialization field.  At least if you don't like to see:<br />
<br />
Your spell fizzles!<br />
Your spell fizzles!<br />
Your spell fizzles!<br />
Your spell fizzles!<br />
You begin casting Bane of Nife. ;)<br />
<br />
Just a bit of personal insight from an EQ newbie.  :D</div></div><hr />

Pretty much all the 65 shaman in my guild have maxxed WIS at 280+, depending on the extent of their AA's.  Then again we all hover around the 1200ac and 6k hp barrier too.  One even breaks 7k HP raid buffed.  Wouldn't call every shaman with high WIS a druman!  Depending on your lvl of play, and getting gear with +20 wis in multiple spots it's easy to max it.  If i finished Planar Power AA's, as well as Innate Enlightenment  my WIS would be unbuffed 337, but right now i'm capped at 290.  Does this make me a druman?  I think not, since i can take a beating from mobs all the way up to tier 4 and live most times.  If you're a 60+ shaman and have a 180 wis you got problems in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you take the time to read through the posts Howie? Druman = high wisdom plus very low hp's. It would appear you have both areas sufficiently covered. Btw, would you consider me as &quot;having problems&quot; since my wis is not much more than the 180 mark?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think the key is to find a balance between HP/STA/AC and WIS/Mana. We can cann dance to regain mana, but I'd rather have mana available when I need it if possible. When stuff hits the fan, do you really want to be canning down your HP just to get enough mana for a heal?<br />
<br />
Just focus on getting well rounded gear in all pieces. You can get a pretty decent set of gear these days that will give you solid HP, AC, and Wisdom without breaking the bank. If I feel like I'm getting pounded pretty badly, I'll spend some money on upgrading a few slots so that I get more HP and AC. If I feel like I'm running out of mana too quickly, I'll look for a piece that has some good Wisdom on it.<br />

<br />
I resorted to using Cannibalize in whatever form quite a few times to get mana to throw that last slow or toss that last heal when the 'stuff hit the fan'.<br />
<br />
The reverse side of what you said is what happens when you run out of mana and you need to cast a heal? I rarely ever ran completely out of mana, but there were times when I had to balance low health aggro with cannibalize. Having mana is nice, but having the HP to be able to cannibalize without having to eyeball your hp all the time is even nicer.</div></div><hr />

Which is why I said to find a balance. If you constantly find yourself in a situation where you are getting low HP agro, you obviously need more HP. But if you find yourself always going OOM or staying LOM, you need to work on increasing your mana pool. The idea is to keep both your HP and mana at acceptable levels.<br />

What if they max innate enlightenment and planar power before getting ND3, LR5, and ID5?   :p</div></div><hr />

There was a poor chap who [sincerely] posted a gear check no to long ago and had spent AAs on innate wisdom. I'm pretty sure he got the idea after the forum flogging he got. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I very recently met a new shaman who was completely new to the game, and twinked out by her friend who is quitting.  I had to hold back when I saw the boots.  Yep, you guessed it. GEBS.  I didn't have the heart to tell her at the time.  Besides, she's too sweet to be a druman :)<br />
She means well, and I'll definetly teach her that AC and HP mean more growing up than Wis.  I'll probably have her watch me solo for a bit while I TANK IN TEH FACE!!11oneone*whack*ow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hey now i spent 1 aa in wisdom  ... it was my first but that was when i was gimp and didnt realize run speed 3 was a better way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, GEBs are okay at lower levels for the effect. Although, even at those levels, Barbed Dragonscale are good for a similar price. But some people like having decent focus effects.<br />
<br />
However, I don't agree with belittling people for their choices - especially when they have no reason to know any better. I don't like the term &quot;druman&quot; or the derogatory comments that are sometimes made when someone posts a high-wis, low-hp profile asking for gear advice.<br />
<br />
If they haven't come here and worked it out beforehand, shamans can get to their low 50s before realising that having all the wis in the world won't keep you alive after a single bounced slow in PoP, and start changing their gear focus.<br />
<br />
Anyway, high wis/mana, low HP at lower levels isn't really a problem, especially if you play like a druid, which works perfectly well at those levels. But in PoP, as a slower, it starts to hurt and if you have less than 2000 unbuffed HP at 60/65 (and I've seen that), then you have serious problems.<br />
<br />
My own story illustrates this.<br />
<br />
I remember sitting in Highpass at around level 15 being told by a shaman who was much higher level (I think low 50s) wearing GEBs that wisdom was the most important stat for a shaman, and you should work on wis gear first until at least got it to 200. Trusting person that I am, I had no reason to disbelieve him, he was a high level! Plus, my shaman was an alt, so I never spent real cash on him.<br />
<br />
I levelled fairly slowly, mostly playing healer to friends' rangers, until I was around 45 and my guild was desperately short of shamans, so I started to level in earnest. In my low 50s, though, several things happened - I started getting PoP groups, I switched mains from ranger, and I started reading these boards. :)<br />
<br />
I kept an alternate profile of the gear I had before I made the switch - if the link works, it might amuse you... remember, it was low 50s, without ND3 and charm, so HP would have been much lower even than the 1764 shown: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94917&amp;alt=125188 Over a few weeks, through moving some of my rangers gear to my shaman and spending around 15k (a lot for me at the time), I gained around 500hp and 100ac, lost 30ish wis, but kept around the same mana pool (hooray for +hp +mana items). More importantly, I knew what direction to go in for the future.</div></div><hr />
