<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever had one of those experiences where you realise you totally screwed up and ruined an otherwise successful encounter?  It just happened to me, and I am sad.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, trial of execution, lineup:<br />
<br />
61 warrior, 61 cleric, 61 chanter, 61 druid, 61 ranger, 61 ranger (me).<br />
<br />
All going swimmingly, by staggering trueshot we've cleared to the 4th wave, and on the 4th wave the chanter gets squished and the boss is about to pop.  Everybody shouts 'KITE IT' including myself.... I press the assist key to target the mob... and then.... TO MY HORROR... an arrow flies towards the mob and hits for 480... from my bow.<br />
<br />
I snare and start kiting but the damage is done, I am summoned and killed and the party wipes.<br />
<br />
I feel like crap now - if my stupid finger hadn't accidentally pressed that key we could have beaten the trial, and the entire group knows it was my fault and my fault alone.  Even worse, the server came down for a patch before we could get our corpses so the rest of the group are inconvenienced further.<br />
<br />
This is the part where you console me and tell me I'm not worthless.. :(</div></div><hr />

First time in PoV last night, Im pulling<br />
I get a spidy np then it goes all laggy and i lose my sense of direction even with compass up.  I got clip plane down to 10 percent to decrease lag btw.  I notice i have an add, thats ok my group is 65 sk 63 ranger me 62 shaman 62 cleric 62 bard we can handle too.<br />
<br />
I get reorientated and run back to camp, to find i have 2 spidys and 3 GOLEMS !!!<br />
<br />
We all try and kite the adds while cleric and sk kill one however all fails they say gate or zone.  I relogged as i didnt have camo memmed.  I came back to find all 5 died and 1 lived.<br />

I used to play a druid, and I've had the party die because I healed too late / mistargeted / wasn't looking for a second.<br />
<br />
Regardless, they still happen, and it sucks.  Sorry to hear about it.<br />

If it helps, CR is easy with the GY, and xp loss after a rez is only like 1 kill's worth :)</div></div><hr />

In fact, it seems the whole expansion is designed around 'perfect' groups, when before you could get by less-than-ideal groups just fine.<br />
<br />
My guild is always only looking for high damage classes for the trials. All of our rogues are already getting bored with doing the trials over and over for 1 person at a time. Really sucks for the rest of the classes and people who aren't flagged yet.</div></div><hr />

Was sk, cleric, chanter, mage, wizard, me.  We decided to go for the ae attempt and it worked great for us.  Another nice little thing, go to fv and pick up our lvl 61 spell, Exile Summoned.  Adds about 725 damage in 3.3 seconds.  Nice add in dps.  The spell is at the druid vendor in FV.</div></div><hr />

Best story I've heard yet about a trial was from one of my friends who tried execution the other day.  Apparently they had a shaman mob spawn, and it sowed the executioner...</div></div><hr />

That right there is well worth some of the blue loss. We all learn from our mistakes, now on the next trial, Im sure you will be more aware of what key you actually press. <br />
<br />
Ive wiped out my guild on many occasions. Not just a group or two but the whole damn guild.  The 1st time I pulled the reaver house. I think we wiped in a matter of seconds as I brought down 4 Blackreavers, a few skellies, ghosts,  goos, cats. dogs, planes, trains and automobiles. Sure I was the butt of a few jokes, but I learned how NOT to do it for the 2nd time around. <br />
<br />
There have been a few times something like this has happened<br />
you thell the guild &quot;Hey I have an Idea&quot;<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
you tell the guild &quot;Did it work?&quot;<br />
soandso tells the guild&quot;nope&quot;<br />
you tell the guild &quot;Ok, I have another Idea&quot;<br />
soandso tells the guild&quot;Is it going to Kill all of us again?&quot;<br />
you tell the guild&quot; one way to find out&quot; <br />
<br />
The 1st time we ever went to Kael we had this episode, keep in mind our highest lvl was 54 and we had never been there before.<br />
<br />
Krackin tells the guild “Derakor the Vindicator incoming”<br />
Alinor tells the guild “Tell me youre kidding right”<br />
Qeldaran tells the guild “Um should we worry?”<br />
Alinor tells the guild “No we should pray”<br />

Our guild was raiding Plane of Hate, most logged, but we had enough left for one group. We decided to keep pulling rats etc to the safe spot. <br />
<br />
Our monk that was left was pulling, he FD just in my line of sight. I see one mob there, and for some reason my finger hit the ranged attack key. The monk didn't have to say a word, as I had a ton of mobs on us all in a few seconds. I didn't wait for him to tell me to tag anything, I just slipped and hit it. I don't remember why the monk didn't stay FD, but I wiped us. Wiped us good, in Hate.<br />
<br />
I felt pretty bad until I saw a picture taken earlier in the day before I logged on. The picture was of our entire guild wiped, not just one group, and an arrow pointing to the corpse of a druid that had healed the monk while he was trying to FD an extremely large pull. I still didn't feel great, but I felt a LITTLE better.<br />

<br />
I used trueshot on wave 4, saving the casters mana, snared and kited the boss, and only started getting summoned because the chanter's pet had started beating on the boss when the chanter got AE'ed.<br />

I got a couple of heals, kept kiting, the druid reached 85m, the cleric reached 70m, the chanter got a slow in, the warrior AE taunted off me.... flawless kill.<br />

When I cast a spell, and I need to interrupt for whatever reason, I usually take a step back rather than duck because I'm still attacking, just not casting.  Unfortunately this doesn't work with an arrow...I have shot when I wished I hadn't a few times....</div></div><hr />

You didn't actually snare it, did you?  I'm fairly certain that  Prime Executioner Whatshisname is immune to changes in runspeed.  The reason I asked this is because it seems to me that casting snare on something that is immune does not seem to have an appreciable aggro effect.  Anyone else notice this?<br />
<br />
P.S.  Just beat execution for the first time last night too.  Twice, with 63 Ranger, 64 Pally, 62 Mage, 63 Chanter, 59 Cleric and me, 61 Ranger.  It was a rush :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolair Strongbo</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is true, though, that PoP does require specific classes for every group.  I doubt a group would survive long in Valor without a bard/chanter/shaman to slow.  Clerics are pretty much an absolute must, since the tank needs to have a very large hp to take the hits he's going to.  I've seen many groups having shamans and bard/chanter, since the chanter will drop very quickly if he aggroes the mob while trying to slow it.<br />
<br />
The first planes you can get by, but after that, unorthodox groups seem to be pretty much a thing of the past.</div></div><hr />

Trials are about teamwork and skill.  Ive completed the trials with a bevy of all kinds of groups, and that was before anyone discovered banish or thought to kite the prime executioner.<br />

No, we did it straight up.  <br />
group1: 61 ranger, 62 chanter, 63 mage, 60sk, 61 druid, 60wiz<br />
group2: 62 war, 63ranger, 61 cleric, 62 mage, 61 chanter, 60monk<br />
group3: 62war, 63ranger, 60 cleric, 62rog, 61sham, 61dru<br />

When i did it we had a cleric/enchanter/ranger/warrior/mage/wizzy<br />
<br />
<br />
we made it to the boss nearly flawless had 0 ping pong... he pops and the cleric is at like 30 mana<br />
<br />
<br />
so the warrior tries to kite him around but kills the enchanter first, the warrior nearly dies to getting summoned so they say just tank em...  exe gets down to like 3%, cleric is oom, mage is oom, wizzy is oom... enchanter is still well dead...<br />
<br />
the warrior goes down i try to kite em but get summoned and died...<br />
<br />
and the mage gets enough mana to finish him off everyone is siked<br />
<br />
and than the cleric mod rods himself to dead... so he can't rez the rest of the party<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lot of bad stuff happens lol... and the trials are evil</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you cannot land the snare, but the act of casting seems to generate enough hate to keep the mob chasing you even with healers casting patch heals on you when you get summoned (grrr, stupid chanter pet).  Perhaps not as much as landing a snare, sure, but still an appreciable amount.<br />
<br />
Vash, /rofl<br />
<br />
I bet there were some words exchanged then... :)<br />
<br />
Of course, if you got back into the trial room before the 30m30s corpse timer expired you could have looted the executioner.. you'd have 30 seconds to get all 6 marks, possible but tense.. :)<br />
<br />
I agree that the trial is all about teamwork, and as long as you play your class well and are close to level 60 you should contribute enough to win, regardless of what you play.</div></div><hr />

Casting snare or slow on an immune mob will generate just as much agro as if they weren't immune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About a year ago my guild buffing preparing to kill Sont, and I was the 20 sec tank ‘till the he was slowed/debuffed.  I had memed flamelick to chain cast to keep agro when call of fire faded.  Call of fire had the same icon as flamelick, so you can guess what happened.  I was dead before I realized what had happened, as was the entire guild a min later as a lot of them were afk surrounding Sont.<br />
<br />
Or a better story:<br />
<br />
Another time guild was preparing to do AoW when I went afk to pour myself a cup of coffee.  When I came back I saw an assist message, some rogue criting and a giant in front of me.  What I didn’t know was the assist mob had already died, the rogue was resetting a pally and that the giant in front of my was dire charmed.  I hit assist and fired an arrow only to watch it sail by the giant in the general direction of Vindi.  First thing I did was yell “O @#$%” and knock the cup into my lap.  The searing pain of burning hot coffee seaping towards my groin was enough to break me out of my panic.  I was half way to Vindi by the time the arrow hit him and just managed to train him away before I died.  Luckly I was wearing jeans and no permanent damage was done.  Was hard though explaining what had happened to my sister who was in town and had walked in just when I was cursing, ripping off my cloths ;) .</div></div><hr />

Hehe, reminds me of when I was trueshotting in POA and the island boss mob went down and Sirran the Lunatic popped while my last arrow was in midflight.  Yep it hit Sirran when he popped. Needless to say I died in under a second.  Was kind of embarassing... LOL.  damn near the same thing happened to me.  I was hitting the boss with arrows just by tapping my #2 button.  Next thing I know I see something cover my screen for a split second and I'm dead and loading.  I couldn't figure it out because the chat windows disappear while loading.  After I saw I was killed by Siran, I realized he spawned right on top of me as I shot my last arrow.  Or at least it looked like he did.</div></div><hr />
