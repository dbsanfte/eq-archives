<br />
True, but at least these upgrades are prettyy noticable.  The healing one is effectively 38% better for our level 70 heal (50% max effect vs. 36% allowing for level limts). The previous upgrades weren't nearly as nice (28% more for going from a 28% to 36% max when upgrading Blessed Healing to Discordant Healing).<br />
<br />
If the gear that has these effects is scales up as well, we'll be looking at some extremely nice upgrades.  I'm certain it'll be coming from what raid content the expansion has, though.</div></div><hr />

I would be suprised if it wasn't. All those folks that have worked for high end GoD/OoW gear foci would be pissed off if they found out in DoN better focus gear drops from groupable mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off hand I expect that we'll see some stuff that is near-Elemental quality start coming off the group mobs, or possibly through quests. As for the high end, I suspect that Sony will wait a while to really make a huge jump.  They'll probably hold that until the next expansion that adds levels, since they can then green out lower-end mobs to make people fight new stuff that's even harder to offset better-than-Anguish gear.<br />
<br />
But that's just a guess, we'll find out when the stuff starts to show up on Allakhazam and Magelo. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well, they did the near-elemental from one-group mobs with OoW.<br />

if gear progression continues, there may be drops that are Elemental+ coming from one-group mobs.</div></div><hr />

  Amen to that one.  I'm advocating TAs as a ground spawn right next to the new expansions PoK book :p</div></div><hr />

Note, this expansion is all content and features, there's no gigantic leaps in player power like levels or aa.  There will be, perhaps, greater availability of the 125-135ish gear, but I doubt you'll get the 150 items from one group mobs in this expansion.  Maybe this fall, when, presumably, we get a new set of aa and maybe levels :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This expansion is a little different for me - since we aren't getting any levels, I don't have to worry about outleveling any of the current power of my foci. I am not FORCED to upgrade, I can upgrade foci as it suits me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">omg neeeeeed!  (where's my stalker?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">its just simple gear progression, the Foci I originally posted about will obviously only come from the highest of raid mobs in DoN. but they are still /drool<br />
<br />
take high-end luclin gear and all PoP gear and compare them, exactly where does high-end luclin fall in quality with the PoP gear? (granted there is a difference in available AAs, but AAs aside.) keep doing this with the next few expansions. you'll see that stronger gear is just getting progressively easier to obtain.<br />
<br />
OoW gear is just below Elemental power. some specific drops are elemental quailty.<br />
<br />
the rate at which high-end quality gear is trivialized is a gear progression rate. I think we'll see some elemental+ drops soon as people get more comfortable in the new zones.<br />
<br />
wouldn't surprise me to see these drops. <br />
<br />
on an interesting sideways note, I attempted to solo a DB named in Broodlands, which he hit for ~300, but had an ASSLOAD of HP, meaning, I popped off anathema, and broke into melee, now, I hit for 150-200 avg, with a 400 DD proc. his life didn't move from 99% for at least 2 ticks of anathema. I got him down to 60% before I got two goblin adds that were immune to root. had to abandon my fun, so I ran and gated.<br />
<br />
oh the items you get from getting the box from the store are $$, but not as permanent as the last couple of expansions. you get 10x of a potion that CH's you, and another 10x of a potion that gives you full mana and endurance. both have an instant cast time (w/ recast of 2hrs.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">lol, I'll never use those potions.  I still have the three DA idols I collected in my teen levels from Highpass three years ago.  Nine charges on my Puppet Strings, because a friend used one :p  I hate using expendables</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I hear you, at least the other expansions had something that was just cute, not something you could use up. I like the idea of the potions, but having them as a completely exhaustable resource sucks...you'd need to be able to get more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">all the new stuff seems sweet, but does anyone else think they are trying to come up with way too much. I mean I am not 70 with time gear but im trying my hardest everyday, but every time a new expansion comes out with way more stuff to learn and be behind on again getting left in the dust makes me feel like I'll never be there on a game i love. <br />
=-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You'll get there, psosnake.  Like, at some point you and the people you game with just, like, turn a corner, and all of a sudden you're on the fast track.  That is, you do, if you're oriented that way.  Don't be afraid of getting sidetracked, though.  The people that take the long road in EQ are generally happier when they start in on the cutting edge part of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not? OoW has 200+ items from 1 group trials. GoD had +/- 150 drops from single group mobs as well, as did OoW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">True, Tugela, Omens has items with +200. However, do you really think non-time flagged / ele geared will ever be able to complete the challenge to receive such gear? Methinks Not. Single groupable non-time / elemental geared groups can get some mighty nice stuff for sure, far superior than the previous 2 expansions, but to say &quot;Hey theres 200+ items readily available just look!&quot;  is a little off.  Best bazaar and droppable oow geared warrior I seen was right around 7800 hp 1400 ac and thats a far cry from the tank required to complete even the easiest single group trial in MPG.<br />

I sure hope so. I'm gearing up in MPG &amp; Riftseekers', and now with the gear from missions in DoN to fill the gaps, yes, I intend to be a top-content-capable Shaman without ever having seen an Elemental plane. <br />
<br />
Might not work, but I'm giving it a try anyway.</div></div><hr />

It will work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Perhaps I should clarify. For us shamans, with our abilities and the gear currently available, our job is fairly easy with a well balanced group, even without time/gates top gear. Try doing even something as trivial as sewers 6 in Gates with a non-ele / time+ geared tank.... Ainta gonna happen.  You need a balanced group of time/gates geared players or roughly equivalent, to see the 200+ items. Sure you could sneak one or maybe even 2 that aren't but your meat shield will not be one of them. Nor will your cleric.  That's what I'm saying. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">That makes total sense, Prexus_Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">A full suite of 100-125 armors, from OoW quests, attunables, and WoS/MPG/RSS exp drops, is enough to tank GoD trials all day, if you've the aa to back them up.  One problem I've seen quite often is folks with 120-150ish aa blaming gear for their lack of tanking ability.  A group with Samanna's level of gear (and she still has room for exp-group improvement) and similar 300+aa should be able to beat MPG trials (except the new Arcana, I'm just guessing).  They'd be a strenuous challenge, but once you beat a few and start collecting 200hp items, it starts to snowball.<br />
<br />
I completely agree that beating those is a far different and higher achievement than collecting exp drops, though.  So much that the loot should be considered seperately.</div></div><hr />
