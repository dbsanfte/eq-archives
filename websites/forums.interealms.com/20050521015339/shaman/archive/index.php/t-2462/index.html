<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if these effects stack? If so, that would be so nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I can tell they do.  Basically if a focus item is related to a spell it will go off, regardless of how many you have.  Of course, it's really not that sweet, since affliction efficiency doesn't really save you that much mana from what I can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check Eq.Castersrealm.com on that.  They had a post from one of hte developers stating the higher of the 2 focus effects would take effect.   The developer used the mana preservation vs affliction efficiency as an example actually so if you had both items and casted a dot, the affliction efficiency would be the one used (higher focus effect) to calculate mana saved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rumor has it that slows, roots and malo are no longer affected by this..can someone confirm that?</div></div><hr />

They no longer work on anything but dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That change makes perfect sense, though. Slows and Malo aren't dots. However, Casting Haste does work on them. At least they did for the 1 whole day my onyx gauntlets had a nice focus on them. I'm currently without a casting haste device.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info. While it would be nice to save ~35% on Plague and Ebolt, 25% is still nice. Of course, at the moment, I don't have an Affliction Efficiency 3 item, but if the effects had stacked, I sure would have found one. ;) thanks again to everyone for responding. :)</div></div><hr />
