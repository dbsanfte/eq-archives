<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MeulastheTracke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had the best of times duoing with an enchanter friend of mine in PoV.  He dire charms one of those rusted suits of mail, and I harmony pull the non-kos frogs, malarian larvae, or the undead near the zone.  The pet makes a great tank when the mob is slowed, and I just sit back and shoot, healing the pet between fights and tossing any necessary chloroblasts on my friend while he runs circles around me if he gets agro from slowing.  Mobs usually yield 3% - 5% aa exp per kill.  Archery damage is very low agro, so really the only risk is the enchanter getting agro from slow, which can be remedied to an extent with boggle.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any other usefull duoing tactics from level 61+?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting.My brother is a 62 chanter.He has decided to go the TD3 route and bypass DC for now.Boltrans(and now Beckon) has been our bread and butter since,well,since he got Boltrans haha.I'm suprised to hear a dc pet could tank in PoV....well not suprised but it didnt seem like they would hold up all that well against those hard hitting mobs even slowed.<br />
<br />
We have found that adding a 3rd can almost triple our kill rate.And if you know how to charm kite your already killing at a fast clip.Cleric is a great choice obviously  since they can allow us to keep one pet all night long.A fully buffed Muzzled 57th lvl mob pet in a tier1 plane with a cleric standing by to cheal is an xp machine.And once the cleric see's what the xp can be like...well we have no trouble finding regulars to group with =).Any of the Cheal capable healers is good though.By keeping one pet for the whole session the chanter can focus on other things without worry'ing about mana from constantly rebuffing new pets.<br />
<br />
If your chanter friend has CoD I would give that a try.Beckon wont really allow us to charm kite in tier2 planes but CoD sure will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MeulastheTracke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We seem to like DC better than ghetto charming higher level mobs for the reason that there are quite a few mobs which are immune to snare / root, so at least for pet tanking / archery tactics, if that charm breaks, someone is going to die.  Adding a third does speed up the kill rate considerably; my chanter friend's brother plays a 63 druid, and when he's in the mix, we can kill pretty fast with no downtime.<br />
<br />
Charm kiting is good, but if I'm not mistaken, just about the only mobs in PoV that can be snared that don't summon are the mobs in the cave and the golems.  There's not enough room to move for golems without getting overwhelmed by adds, and the caves are permacamped.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows better camps in the 2nd tier zones for this, lemme know... :)<br />
