<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(I took about a 3 week vacation from EQ so maybe I missed this before.)<br />
<br />
Last night I saw two thing that seems strange to me.  First was a warrior with illusion: high elf.  Fairly minor...<br />
<br />
The second which is more distrubing is I saw both a Paladin and a Rogue using Feign death.  I even got the &quot;So and so has fallen to the ground&quot; message a few times, so it wasn't just some graphic trick.<br />
<br />
wth is going on!?! Has the world gone mad and VI put a non-charged fd item in game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have a warrior in our guild who did the same thing. I didn't really ask about it, but it was interesting seeing a halfling warrior turn into a high elf warrior :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure he was a warrior? I know rogues/bards can redo part of the rogue epic and get a mask with Illusion High Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is an exploit, sort of. Without getting into the details if you are clever you can equip any piece in any slot. Regardless of limitations of the piece. So a warrior could use a SKs FD item. I'm sure some people will go insane to figure out how to this. Also, you can wear multiple BPs etc. Have fun<br />
<br />
PS Not sure how Verant would look at a warrior wearing a SK BP as a bracer, even if it is a glitch with their new UI  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow- now that is a serious exploit.  It's a good thing you didn't tell me about it before I left for work, or I'd've had to call in sick!<br />
<br />
/em imagines the stats he could have using only cheapish items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone being able to equip and use anything? LOL, thats got to be the mother of all exploits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Must have something to do with setting up a custom UI skin ... so that you repeat the BP slot code where the bracer slot code should go... maybe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure!!  It takes a fairly common piece off the 5th island and a rare drop from the 6th island and a rare drop from the Sister of Spire.<br />
<br />
I've cleared Sky 3 times in the past year, had the feather banked for even longer and have never seen the other two pieces drop.<br />
<br />
Sky quests....bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">sky quests suck :) to much work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bastage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So does the high elf mask work from inventory ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think they're using the high elf earring from chardok.<br />
The funny part is the guy who posted an SS of himself in high elf. <br />
That says to me &quot;hi im a dumbass, please ban me for exploiting.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">:( I want a SS as a high elf.  I'm not a bad exploiter...I'm just obsessed with fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The shaman ring doens't explain the FD'ing.  I stated non-charged because people were using it very casually 10 or 15 times in a row as a gag.  (Noone is going to burn 3 charges of a rare ring fr a few laughs.)<br />
<br />
I'm guessing its some kind of exploit - if you can put inventory in any slot I'm willing to bet you can use other class' abilities and AA skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 2 of the items. No sign of the ring in 2 years.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's how long I have had these two items banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thats kinda freaky...time to mess around and try to figure this out before they change it, would be cool just for laughs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Before I had to reformat my hard drive, I had pictures of Juujuu in gnome and ogre form.  Some of the GMs and Guides on Brell were really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Im not 100% on this but i was told that the shaman FD ring is rather useless since we never get the FD skill and the ring checks against it.So maybe 1 out of 100 times it would actually work.<br />
<br />
Anyone actually have the ring to confirm or deny it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I would think of it more like an insta cast spell along the lines of a necro or SK not a monk's FD skill.<br />
<br />
PS Hello, still no private message about turning into a High Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have pics of me as a female halfling, female barbarian, shroom man, spectre, drake, cyclops, sphenx, shark, griffin, a horse, giant beetle, and the barrel barge...Saiphos was one awesome gm, got all those from 1 gm event hehe, in zones from qeynos to freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">this is a bannable offense as i'm sure youre all aware of :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are 100%. 100% wrong.<br />
<br />
The FD is instant click, and in well over a dozen times of having used it, it's never, not once, failed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Knowledge of this has been posted for a few days that I know about.  Might as well stay away from it if you want to protect your account.  Though the temptation might be high just for laughs and screen shots, of course -- but dunno if you might bump into a grouchy GM or something who blames you for Verant's mistakes.  I'd seriously ask yourself if you want to lose your account before you mess around with this stuff.<br />
<br />
Especially as you're not a melee.  Now, two BP's or peacebringers on a monk....<br />
<br />
Anyway, of course they'll fix it.  Don't lose your account if you can avoid it.</div></div><hr />
