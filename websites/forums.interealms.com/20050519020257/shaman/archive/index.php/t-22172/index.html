<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The corpses in Forgotten Halls... where do they go?<br />
I died yesterday exploring the zone. <br />
As it is a dinamic zone, I entered and looted everything except some useless things I have in the ammo slot. Then I exited and canceled the expedition, hoping the corpse would spawn at entrance (nedaria, bears cave), but it didn't. Anyone knows where should I go to get my corpse rezed next time I die inside? <br />
<br />
Thnx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest grabbing a chipped bone rod and trying to use it on yourself in Nedaria's Landing. Maybe the corpse popped elsewhere when the zone depopped.  Or it might have directly gone to that new zone that serves as a corpse repository. Have you tried to see which zone your corpse is in? Maybe it's stuck in a wall, etc., with DX9 anything is possible there.<br />
<br />
If all else fails and you can't find it anywhere, petition. It might take a few days/weeks before you get a response though. If this is the option you need to do, I'm sorry to hear that. Best of luck!</div></div><hr />

If the chipped bone rod does not help, then you can try to petition. the graveyard zone requires the corpse to be over a week old before you can recover it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mine appeared a few feet from the rock that I clicked on to enter the zone. Maybe its under the ground. Try standing near it and summoning your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That graveyard zone only gets your corpse after a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to Nedaria and do a /corpse.  If the message is &quot;the corpse is too far away to summon&quot;, use a chipped bone rod (or necro, SK, or bard) to find it.  If the message is &quot;you have no corpses in this zone to summon&quot; then try again inside the instance or simply petition.  If nothing else, this will let you know real quick what zone your corpse is in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try consenting someone.  I vaguely remember that when you consent someone it tells you what zone(s) you have corpses in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, it now consents the most recent corpse, and tells you what zone it's in, then the second /consent gets the next most recent, and so forth.<br />
<br />
It does NOT mention corpses that the Keeper has snatched up (i.e., have decayed.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just an after-thought. You didn't accidentally loot the thing you &quot;thought&quot; you left on the corpse, I hope. That would solve the problem too.<br />
<br />
I've done THAT a few times too many myself!<br />
<br />
EDIT: dang typos!</div></div><hr />
