<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So after PoP is finished - Quarm dead - LDoN pretty much just a dead repeat and rince without any goal except getting those adventure points, will grow old quickly. <br />
<br />
You think SOV can pull out one more expansion that will keep the interest for EQ alive?<br />
<br />
I have to say that i love the PoP expansion with its storyline and AA points and new lvls. Nice bundle of stuff.<br />
<br />
BUT now some of the guilds/Players have bested the gods on their own homeground, what else is there? What storyline can they build that could work and what could they put in a expansion that would not change the gamebalance totaly. Like having people duo or solo AoW<br />
<br />
What can a new expansion do?<br />
<br />
Some ideas and pondering<br />
5 more lvls? (Dont like the sound of it, but might keep some interest)<br />
More AA (Hmm yeah, but not enough to keep interest)<br />
New spells/abilitys (ohh dont want to be part of the team that would try to balance that in the game)<br />
Storyline (yeah heres the big one, build a storyline, keep some hard rules so you cant jump ahead or go different ways. Like a detective story, Would be fun for the first guilds atleast, until all the spoilers comes out.)<br />
LDoN technic with spawning zones that guilds can use for their raiding, same zone and same bossmob. Take away the damn race for the mob crap. Maybe collect stuff to start the raid session, like the PoI dragon, but now you spawn your own raiding zone and that you need to follow the storyline...<br />
<br />
Or is it that EQ slowly will die now - No new expansions coming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Add on where you travel to other planets / in time to the primal world of everquest  / spiritplanes where the dead rule (and you meet your own shadow). Plenty of possible timesinks.<br />
<br />
And this is just what I came up with in 5 secs. SOE will do better. I expect to be playing EQ for at least 4 years. They will not throw away this player base (and the repeating cash flow that goes with it) New expansions will come, what they will add however is another question. Item inflation has been high, and adding more levels / better items will make existing encounters trivial.<br />
<br />
EQ is buildt around the fact that the players wants to expand and forward their characters, and if you do this forever (as in EVERquest) you will &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to keep making stuff trivial. Adding more and interesting AAs that will give you crossclass AAs and skills is one possible solution (like dual-classed characters in AD&amp;D) however this should be costly in both money and time invested.<br />
<br />
The most probable solution however is migrating the existing player base to EQ2 somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EverQuest might be dead for thos in the higher levels, but not for us that play 1 -3 days a week for a handfull of hours at at time. That is where LDoN is a savior for us since we cannot be in guilds that raid VT, Elemental Planes, etc. An adventure or two is all we can do before RL needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Those in the upper game that have finished Time, killed all mobs, and gotten all the loot possible might consider the game over for them. That is fine. Maybe a few LDoN raids will keep them busy, but no game is ment to keep you hooked forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You think this is the first time folks reached the &quot;end&quot; of the game before the next expansion?<br />
<br />
It's happened EVERY expansion.  The boss mobs go into farm mode and more and more folks reach it until the next release.  <br />
<br />
How long were people killing Trak and clearing VP before Velious came out?  <br />
<br />
I don't see EQ going anywhere.  The older it gets, the better because the content they've spent resources creating doesn't go away.  It builds on itself, and that's going to be increasingly valuable commodity I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd like to see the next expansion focus a little more on character development.   Possibly quests for custom titles, quests for a tiny bit of cross classing, maybe even some fluff like I mentioned in another thread with player and guild housing.  <br />
<br />
I expected this post to be a whiny, &quot;I'm done with EQ&quot; post...however, I agree with the original poster.  I guess we can get new planes, new worlds, whatever...but there has to be something better than new, harder mobs with better loot.  That could go on for a long time, but I'd hope they'd come up with something a little more groundbreaking than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best thing they could do would be to have an expansion with really good AI and as interactive as possible.<br />
<br />
Although I have a ways to go, finally dinged my first character ever to reach 65. Enchanter, go figure. Now to work AA's weeee....<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Sony should lay off the force group crap and put stuff in the game for solo adventurers.  Grouping is nice but in my opinion the real skill lies in the limits of how much can you kill by yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RelthiasFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last I heard, the next expansion will possibly be a more raid centered expansion (similar to PoP perhaps? i hope, just without the lame reflaggings  :rolleyes: ), and its supposedly due out end of 2003/early 2004. this is all only what i've heard from other people so it's really still pretty uncertain, but it seems like a likely path for them to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People have been predicting the end of EQ since Kunark, and probably before that.  Certainly for the entire 3 years I have been playing they have been saying EQ was dying, and I just can't see it happening  yet.  <br />
<br />
They are adding new expansions faster than ever and I don't see why they would stop as long as they are making pots of money. I see newbies daily (unfortunately some of them are 65, but that's another story).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine what they will add.  Probably some things I like and some things I don't.  But since I am some weird combo of time starved powergamer and casual gamer I'll probably be playing til the end (albeit with some breaks in between).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ive had a ton of fun with the LDON raids, but the max 36 players cap sucks. The zones have alot more space than those old ssra hallways, and we all survived that<br />
<br />
Tike the other posters said, thing always die off when a new expansion comes out.  Im sure once the loot for ldon time level raids starts droping it will pick up their intrest.  No ones beaten a time leve raid yet, correct? Pretty sure those raids will keep us all busy for the next 6 months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My intrest comes and goes.  I have tried almost every other MMORPG that has come out.  I play them for a month or two, and think they are really cool... but then I go back to EQ.  I think EQ will continue to have the staying power that the others dont.<br />
<br />
I can think of lots of things that I would like to do in EQ yet.  I havent logged in in a couple weeks (I got in the Horizons beta) but one day I know I will come back and do them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Think there is more can do. So killed some gods , what if there were higher beings than the gods? Who's to say cant make beings that you find out really created the gods. <br />
<br />
 Maybe the god we know in times long passed warred with some sort of beings and locked away what was left of them. Maybe us human since we got into their planes poked around to far and opened a tear into the place where these other beings are locked away. <br />
<br />
   I dunno just thinking of the fly here sure can make more stuff to make an expansion interesting. Could put whole new Demon type infested areas deep underground but of course would have to pass through dark elf lands , dark dwarves , deep gnome. Whatever they do i hope its well thought out and not just a spotch of ideas like i just did lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AS long as they continue to crank out expansions, EQ will never die.  <br />
<br />
EQ2, however, might give it a run for its money.  But most likely everyone will grow tired of the mass bugs in EQ2 and just go back to EQ1 in a few weeks.  Just like every other MMOLRPG that has come about in the past 4 years. <br />
<br />
I've seen so many posts (with valid points) that EQ is dead or dying.  Hell, I posted a &quot;dying&quot; post once myself!  Perhaps they took notice, because many of my concerns were addressed.  Perhaps I'm having delusions of granduer.  Whatever the case, SoE seems on the ball to keep us enthralled in &quot;their world&quot; for quite some time.  Keep dreaming that you'll break the addiction!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LDoN actually has quite a good storyline, if you read the story window stuff that was coming out occasionally.  Although stymied in his efforts to escape from the Plane of Time, Zebuxoruk has been able to contact Calliav Giniuar because of Calliav's devotion to the demi-god.  He has given Calliav what basically amounts to a vision of the apocalypse (crash of Luclin into Norrath to set the stage for EQ2), and has told Calliav to seek the Grozmok stone (part of the storyline of LoY).<br />
<br />
To this end, Calliav sought out the Wayfarer's Brotherhood.  Zebuxoruk told them of his visions of dungeons that had been lost for thousands of years.  The Wayfarer's Brotherhood is well-versed in the history of Norrath, and they tell you of it, piece by piece, as you complete their adventures.<br />
<br />
Basially, LDoN is tying together the PoP and LoY storylines.  I imagine the next expansion will be a furthering of the arcing storyline that SoE has been building for the last year.  If you think about it, PoP was really the first expansion to really have much of a storyline, as opposed to a backstory.  They kinda dropped the ball with LoY, but LDoN is bringing the storyline back into play.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I give EQ a lifetime of about 4 years +/- 1 year after the final expansion comes out.  If they keep on expanding, it will never die, unless SoE decides to end it.  Hell, it took them over 3 years just to reach a churn rate equal to the new account growth rate.  EQ would still be profitable even with 100,000 players as opposed to the current &gt;420,000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is still an as yet undiscovered continent on Norrath.  Perhaps here we will find teh dark dwarves and gnomes that an earlier poster spoke of.  <br />
<br />
Im thinking that the next expansion will try to be more Kunark-esqe, with zones for levels 1 to 65 (maybe higer with an expansion level raise), some new AA, and of course the new weapons/armors that always go along with a new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ2 will have problems unless they revamp system requirements.  They are too high.  I couldn't play it if I wanted to - not that I want to.<br />
<br />
People ask again and again if EQ is on it's deathbed, yadda yadda...  so long as people keep playing or subscribing, no.  And yes even as high end players wind down - new players start up.  EQ is still King of the mmorpgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats easy to know what EQ will become. <br />
<br />
They will give more powerfull mobs, more powerfull items. New  power like ( new AA, New lvls and new type of point ( like the ones in LDON )<br />
<br />
And by the way they always remove casual players fromt the game.<br />
yah the exp group bonus isnt making finding a group easyer.yeah more players stop soloing to group but not more cleric.so all I seen is that more Necro LFG thats making it harder to find a group sometimes but never faster.<br />
<br />
Just add sone with many funy spot to solo. SOmething like OT. I dont really like the OT zone fighting sarnak and tiger is kinda common in the game  but if you want to solo you always find a spot in ot the zone is huge and got many mobs but you still be  able to single pull with any class really easely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">EQ won't be dying anytime soon. Every so often, an expansion runs its course, some folks leave for RL or other games, but for every 1 that leaves 3 more sign up. I personally know 10 people off the top of my head that never played EQ before PoP, and thats just with very limited, casual contact with the playerbase on my server. Those people certainly arent burning out anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of these &quot;Is EQ winding down&quot; posts, and I have to wonderif a more proper question would be &quot;Is EQ winding down FOR ME&quot;. <br />
<br />
LDoN opens up a TON of possibilities. Bigger raids with Godlike loot, solo adventures, adventures adjusted for time (bigger points for speed, with a more generous scale going down), etc, just to name a few. The LDoN model can also be used to eliminate a LOT of the spawn contesting that is going to be a HUGE issue as more and more guilds approach the Elemental planes. I would guess they have at LEAST 6 solid months of just minor adjustments to the current game before peoplewill be clamoring for a new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">According to the Chicago fan fair, that i just went to, as long as there are still MANY people playing EQ, there will always be expansions comming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SOE is a business so the accounting department rules all.  <br />
<br />
As long as enough players are paying their monthly subscriptions EQ will continue to grow and expand.  SOE has said many times that EQ2 is not expected (or intended) to end EQ but to collect a whole new player base.  Wait until a normal rules blue server is closed before you predict the end of EQ.  That will be the first real sign.<br />
<br />
Looking at the changes to the database and the game engine (things they once said were impossible  :confused: ) I would expect to see more dynamic and interactive content in the future.  Things like better AI and quests that can't be solved by reading a walkthrough.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a bone thrown to the soloists once in a while but I'm coming to terms with being an outcast.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see some more big quests, epic 2.0, bring back the rest of the kitty cloak quest,  things that will take a character from 1 to 60+ with intermediate rewards that would attract players to actually want to do them too. (I would also like to see current quest rewards be worth the time and effort too  :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, where could we go next?  Whack-A-Mole?<br />
<br />
Honestly, EQ only really focuses on two things - experience and loot.  They could have gone the story/world development, but they didn't.  It would have been harder, but they could have done it.  Dynamic quests, a dynamic world, change...</div></div><hr />
