<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see tons of people with, Run 3, and other skills, do they AA bar move faster then regular levels? I always thought they moved the same speed as a normal level, but i guess I'm wrong. <br />
<br />
Also, run 1, 2, 3, should shammys get these? I mean justfor use indoor dungeons? Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, run 3 is a great skill.</div></div><hr />

you know when you're really bored and you watch the Discovery Channel ? and there is a documentary on the wilderbeast migration across the Serenghetti (sp) .... all those animals have to swim across the crocodile infested waters .... none of the them can outswim a crocodile, so who survives ?<br />
<br />
the wilderbeast that swims slightly faster than that slow fatass next to him :)<br />
<br />
WORD ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To answer (or at least waffle about) the other question.<br />
<br />
1 AA point costs roughly the same amount of XP as level 51. So if you set AA to 50% while you were in level 51, the 2 bars would move at the same rate.<br />
<br />
But if you then levelled to 52, and left AA at 50%, because level 52 is &quot;worth&quot; more xp than 51, the AA bar would be moving faster than the normal xp bar.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note is that AA xp is not affected by any racial penalties. So a troll starting out with a full yellow bar to go in 51, and no AA xp, and AA at 50%, would get the AA point before they levelled. Presumably a halfling would level before they got an AA point, but I'm not sure about that.</div></div><hr />
