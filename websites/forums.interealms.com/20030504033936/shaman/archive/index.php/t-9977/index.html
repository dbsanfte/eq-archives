<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K i went  to do this part today and the loc they give in the walk thru is wrong.  Its actually minus 1600 plus 4150.  So since the visiblity sucks down there in the water i missed the talking portion with all the swimming npcs.  But i found the spirit when he spawned and he still gave the gem.  So my question is am i gonna be bugged for the rest of the quest?  Im just worried about the true spirt faction being high enough later on.   I looked at the checklist and it said the broken arrow, which i didn't get, is for no known use so if i just do the rathe mountain portion a few times for more faction i should be ok?   Please let me know.<br />

The only variable as to whether or not you can complete the quest is your truespirit faction. All you have to do is do the Rathe part about 10 times or so, and your faction should be max ally. then you just need the tear, kill Rak, and you're done. I dont think you will have any problem, since you did find the spirit and did get the gem. You'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was wondering about the broken arrow as well.  I went to talk with abe and accidently attacked him.  Had to pull him a long way aways and root him.    Greater spirit still spawned and gave me the gem though. <br />
<br />
Anyone know what the broken arrow is actually for?</div></div><hr />

I have heard a lot of speculation (particularly the &quot;epic 2.0&quot; crap) on it but so far no facts.</div></div><hr />
