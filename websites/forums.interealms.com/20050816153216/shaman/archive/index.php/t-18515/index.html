We're powerful in some situations and weak in others, but not exceptional in any one area that you can point to and say &quot;that's just ridiculous&quot;.<br />
<br />
Every class gets nerfed sooner or later in one way or another, but right now the shaman is riding in the middle of the pack so there's not much to worry about.  I can't say what the future will hold, but for right now there isn't much to be worried about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Too easy:<br />
<br />
1) Be given a class-only Trade Skill which is not only pp intensive but horrific in its failure rate. Be told that said &quot;failure&quot; is &quot;Working as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Class defining ability given out to a hybrid sub-class with a HUGE and WHOPPING 10% difference in said ability. <br />
<br />
3) Cool and neat spells not only require a component, but also last an eternal 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
4) Base all decisions on spell duration, efficacy etc, on one aspect of the class - mana regen. <br />
<br />
5) Make class &quot;Master&quot; of a particular subset. (In this case buffs). Make the power of that subset in many cases marginal at best. IOW, a 67 point strength increase makes for a whopping 7% increase in damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, its hard to think of a place to nerf shamans really.  <br />
Nukes-we're already at the bottom.  <br />
Dots-we're second best at a second rate damage option, move along.<br />
Heals-Third best and situationally fourth best, nothing to see here.<br />
Slows-We're the best!  But any nerf would put us below the next contender, not much room to move there.<br />
We're just not better at pretty much anything than other classes.  Its hard to find anything that warrants the 'overpowered' label thats constantly been applied to us by others.  We DO have a nice selection of skills that lets a skilled player do a great many things.  But, so do many other classes, sometimes in much more powerful forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is very little to nerf on shaman anymore, mainly because they haven't gotten anything truely &quot;uber&quot; since Kunark.  Ever wondered why are class defining spell, the clicky on the best shaman weapon in the game, is a level 52 spell from an expansion 4 years ago?  Ever since giving us turgurs, malo and topor SOE has become very careful in what we get.  The only major nerf I can think of shaman were subject to was the change of the affliction haste items to no longer work on our debuffs.<br />

I dont see a nerf for shaman anytime in the future. We have been left behind for a long time on upgrades and the other classes have caught up. Shaman are not weak and if anyone thinks that, they arent playing their shaman right. <br />
<br />
I would say stick with your shaman, i think you will be pleased in the end as long as you dont buy into the crowd that never is happy with anything unless its 100% their way, therefore they will bitch till it is. Find what you love with your shaman and stick with it and if your luck you will be totaly content and complely satisfied with your shaman, like me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman have been stealth nerfed since Kunark, all the other classes have gotten spells , abilities, focus on a much larger scale than we have. Dont get me wrong we have gotten more spells, abilities, and focus but overall most of them suck and were added as filler to make it seem like we were getting as much as everyone else. When you take away all the worthless additions to our class we get about 1 decent upgrade for every 2-3 of the other classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes. I believe that damage over time, mana regeneration, pacify, and hitpoint buff spells since Kunark have unbalanced and weakened most of the the priest classes. The weakening has been enough to no longer make them dominant in a particular field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Most likely Shaman stuff up for the nerf-bat? Oh, jesus, all I can think of is that they'll make totemic and jaundiced bone have a chain graphic. Really that's our only shred of dignity left...<br />
<br />
I kid, I kid. Most likely, we'll be &quot;nerfed&quot; in this next expansion, by virtue of getting group dex + cha and a pet-exclusive grow spell, while other classes get snare-free turgur's, HP + Resist spells, badass melee disciplines, and damage &gt; delay dual weildable weapons.<br />
<br />
Frankly it's sad for the Shaman class when we can look around and say that LoY perhaps gave us the nicest spells since Kunark... since PoP spells are just kunark spells +2.</div></div><hr />

If we do I'm cancelling. shamuofxev hit it right on the nail. We are pretty well balanced I see a few other classes getting nerfed before us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shaman community to SOE: What about shamans in future expansions and in current content?<br />
<br />
SOE: Eh, what was what? Shamans? We have shamans in EQ? Since BETA?? You're kidding, right? Weird...<br />
<br />
What other nerf you want? We did get upgrades, like everyone, when Kunark came out. Nothing spectacular, but then again, it was OK when compared to everyone else. We haven't got anything NEW since then, at best we got some watered versions of existing spells, which aren't even that big of an upgrade - cost more mana to cast, last significally less time, and give just a big bigger bonus. That's that. Not to even mention that with all the crazy items with crazy stats coming out, shaman STAT buffs have no real use at all (not that the stats really did anything in EQ at all). 3/4th of our spellbook is worthless. We had STA regen line of spells, which never did anything, as the STA as such wasn't used in anything at all, so the spells were worthless and now these spells have no use or effect whatsoever - by adding the END and not giving to shamans the END regen spell (nevermind that we were always first, so to say, when it came to restoring the (useless) stamina). I bet that they probably add soon the END regen spell to either enchanters or druids.<br />
<br />
Throughout all expansions, literally every other spellcasting class has got something new as well, some new spell lines, with some new effects and all. Only shamans haven't got literally anything, save some couple of watered down weak-arse combined spells, from which one - Acumen line - was again just nerfed. Not that it did much, the STA regen again wasn't used, but instead of making is USEFUL and wanted spells for melee's, like adding to it END regen, they removed it totally. Now it grants See Invis and UV only, and like anyone needs that, with nowaday items and effects and other class spells, which have more useful effects then that.<br />
<br />
You know, there was such a big fuss when bards got the werewolf illusion attached to one of their items, chanters screamed and other classes asked also for other illusions. SOE said that no way, the illusions are class defining spells of enchanters and others wont get it. At the same time, SOE had no qualms whatsoever with adding the shaman class defining spells, like debuffs (Cripple line procs), slows, buffs etc on various weapons and armors. SOE didn't even blink an eye and thought that it's totally OK with adding the shaman defining spells to the items and give them to the masses.<br />
<br />
And with latest changes, some classes have been brought quite close to the shaman when it comes to their ability to debuff and slow the mob. Sure, shaman does it still better. By a fraction. But that's that, all those other classes have more beneficial spells and AA's then shamans do, so that in quite few cases already the shaman is being ignored and replaced with chanter, or beastlord, during the everyday jaunts. At least we still have some uses on raids. Like warriors did, with their /disc defensive. And just that.<br />
<br />
Now the new expansion is on the horizon, and new AA skills are being added. No idea whether new spells as well, but frankly, seeing how the shamans have been simply forgotten over the years, I frankly wouldn't be shocked anymore when with that new expansion and new AA's, the shaman class would become really obsolete and only useful on raids. After all, we're so damn well balanced and so satisfied with what we have, and the rest are not satisfied and are asking for new things and improvements - what's there to stop SOE from improving other classes even more and yet again ignore shamans, because we're so damn happy with what we have and don't want anything else. Add AA which will finally close the gap between shaman and bst slows - after all, aint the BST partly the shaman anyway. Stat buffs don't matter anyway, but if we get new spells, I bet we will get another +80 to STR and +70 to STA and +80 to DEX buff, like anyone needs those. Maybe a new line of Acumen as well, which will give See Invis, UV and True North while worn, all the time. Ah, who cares, by that time there will be more and certain news about WoW available anyway.</div></div><hr />

Other shaman might not have memmed it till 52, but every shaman I know got and memmed this spell at 51.  This is the 3 or 4th time Ive seen a shaman of 60+ post that Turgurs is a 52 spell in the last month or so, and it has just got to stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The nerf list is interesting, but a pretty faulty premise.<br />
<br />
Necromancers were absurdly overpowered at one point.  It was ludricious.  <br />
<br />
They've been made a very strong viable soloing, grouping and raiding class now.  Sorry, I know some necros like to pretend they suck in groups and raids so they can ask for more toys, but the fact is they own now - and they were crazy overpowered before.  <br />
<br />
Similarly, while I would love more toys as much as the next guy, shaman are pretty balanced on the whole.  <br />
<br />
It's not perfect, and some modifications/ enchancements make sense, but shaman are plenty attractive and viable, and that means balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why are you guys dogging PoP spells?  <br />
<br />
Tnargs?  True Spirit?  Quiescence?  Blood of Saryrn?  Ferine Avatar?<br />
<br />
Sure, some PoP spells suck, blow and/or are useless, but on the whole, we did fine.  <br />
<br />
Plus, PoP style mobs made slow the end-all, be-all.  That certainly carries a price.  As it should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I remember everybody complaining when the PoP AA and spells were announced how uninspiring it all seemed.  But fast forward to today, and the perception is that a 65 shaman with all spells and 80 AA is a vastly more powerful character than a 60 shaman.  5 levels higher per se helps some, but we all know that is not the source of the power difference.  The spells and AA must collectively mean something.<br />
<br />
That said, it is fair to say it is all relative to other classes.  I would like to see some exciting new stuff in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree the 65 spells were nice.  Apart from True Spirit, though, I'm not terribly jazzed about the 61-64 spells though.  <br />

That said, I wouldn't swap my shaman for any other class.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you but my heals go like this &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tnarg's&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Quin&gt;&gt;&gt;Good luck!  Quin. is hands down one of the best heals with Complete Heal being the only real competition.  There are no other classes that can tank and heal themselves like a Shaman.  Even those Time equipped druids and such are no match for a Time equipped shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Worst thing they can do to a Shaman as a nerf, is to reduce the effectiveness of our slow.  Shaman's are often sought after because the Shaman has the best slow in the game (75%).  Nerf that and we're a dead class.  Peeps don't usually look for us to join a group for our buffs, nukes or melee skills as other classes can do these much better.<br />
<br />
Slows make the Shaman a powerful class at soloing and to nerf it would make it very difficult in general.<br />
<br />
All in all, Shamans are well balanced of all the other classes and to nerf any of our spell abilities or skills, will tip the scales.<br />
<br />
I don't see any nerfs for the Shaman in the future; however, hehe, I wished they would give us a bit more power to tip the scales to more positive side.<br />

        May be because only lvl65 spell(+tnarg) are good . But only good ,even just ok. <br />

<br />
   So what you are saying is that since there was a nuke AND a dot connected with the pre-POP poison line, there were two checks against poison that had to be unresisted with every cast? Is there a thread or article that states this? As far as I can tell from Lucy's info, each cast can only check a resist once. IMO if it was ever checked twice the original design would have been pretty sadistic.</div></div><hr />

Did you ever have Bane of Nife resisted after the DD part landed?<br />

The resist check on the pre-PoP DoTs and the PoP DoTs is exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

bards and beast will slow, enchanters will crowd control, clerics and druids will heal.  pure melee will use new abilities.  pallies and SK's will still do damage.<br />

we will be sitting in the bazaar after farming multiple thousands of plat to buy one spell that we hope will get us a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">*** are up with those numbers in the above post?  Kragg?  Is that a heal? Does anyone use it?  I don't know about you but my heals go like this &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tnarg's&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Quin&gt;&gt;&gt;Good luck!  Quin. is hands down one of the best heals with Complete Heal being the only real competition.  There are no other classes that can tank and heal themselves like a Shaman.  Even those Time equipped druids and such are no match for a Time equipped shaman.<br />

Hehe. I was refering to the Talisman of Kragg, our long forgotten hp buff line, not Kragg's mending. I figured we needed a &quot;simple&quot; hp buff slightly higher than our focus line since few casters have need for our melee stats. I don't think there's anything wrong with our healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Enarch's post is pretty spot on.  There is active nerfing, which involves a class's abilities being undermined directly, and there is passive nerfing, where you merely increase the power of other classes disproportionately to the nerfed class.  Active nerfs cause a huge uproar and rampant hate mail for SoE.  Passive nerfs tend not to be noticed, and are doomed by the fact that the other classes love them, after all they are getting big fat upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">We have been nerfed already and it was not something done directly to us. It was the implementation of mobs with huge resists, ability to mitigate slow, and outright immunity to slow. <br />
I read an interview with the guy in charge of spells at SOE when LDoN was about to come out. He basically stated that the hardest thing about creating zones is the need to design around high level slow, I.E. ours. The answer has been obvious in all the refurbished zones and the new expansions. Through it all, we've maintained our desirability because most mobs are still fully slowable and mitigating mobs are still easier to kill even partially slow. Its just those encounters when the mob is immune that make me feel useless. I basically debuff and nuke. If they are going to continue to nerf our ability to slow mobs, they really need to give us something else we can do to make ourselves useful. A bigger nuke for example.</div></div><hr />
