Go to the south with and work your way inwards.  Go down the little incline and turn left.  You'll come to a room with a rug on a dias (trap).  From there go left again.  At the T intersection, turn right and there is an illusionary wall just as you turn right.  Turn right and go through the illusionary wall.  As you go down the tunnel you'll see a hole in the wall.  Just past the hole on the left is the Iksar Apparation.  Behind it is another hole in the wall that is actually a 1 way wall. <br />

Hope that helps.  Oh, and beware all the HT mobs in there.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">#2, right next to the crack in the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually he's in front of the crack, not behind it.  You can't miss him if you go through the hidden tunnel there, he's right at the end.</div></div><hr />
