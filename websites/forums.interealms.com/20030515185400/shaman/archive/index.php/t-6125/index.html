<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been messing around alot, not really playing much but i've managed to gain a couple levels since my last post, and I got a couple different items.  Here's my equipment.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=406455 <br />
<br />
The money isn't really there.  Just wish I had that much.  I am wanting to get some more mana and hp items...if anybody knows any good ones that I should get, please post here.  I have an Emerald Dragonscale Tunic to sell, I'm trying to get 10k for that, and I also have some other stuff I can get around 50k for.  Please post some nice items that you recommend I get. Also, if you can, please post some quests or where the items drop at.  Or at least the price of the item, and stats.  <br />
<br />
I am a Wisdom shaman and I like to solo alot...I know you will all say to get AC if I solo...but I pull stuff in DL with a slow, then my pet kills it while I med or Canni and regen hps.  I know DL sucks, but I don't really know where else I can solo decently.  I don't have any keys, and not many friends at all, my guild is small, so I can't get too many good items, and will probably never get my epic.   <br />
<br />
If you can, please post where I should hunt too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know you say you're a soloing wis shaman, but I've found the game really changes with 51 and Turgur's.  Turgur's has a couple of results:<br />
<br />
1) The power of Turgur's makes you very valuable to groups.<br />
2) Increased taunt factor of turgur's.  The spell has a tendancy to really make mobs mad.<br />
3) Related to 2, mobs you encounter as you hunt in the 50+ range start hitting really really hard.<br />
<br />
With level 52 and regrowth and level 53 and Can III, hitpoints will become increasingly important to you as a method of mana regen.  Your max mana pool may be less important to you than your speed in regenning mana.<br />
<br />
I made a transition from wisdom shaman to more AC-oriented shaman in my early 50s (I became a hitpoint junkie after hitting 60) so I do hear what you're coming from, I just have the experience of playing both a wis shaman and an AC shaman to base my advice.<br />
<br />
Some basic gear advice:<br />
<br />
1)  You said you have about 60K to spend (10K for EDST, 50K for other stuff).  I would encourage you to spend the whole chunk on a fungi tunic.  I know that sounds kinda wacky, but it's very very powerful.  Of all the gear I've looted, it's the only piece of gear that I put on and experienced immediate greater ability.  (JBB would be the other contender).<br />
<br />
2)  Mask - crystal spider eyes and enshrouded veil both offer a bit of wisdom while adding a chunk of AC AND mana and hitpoints.  Enshrouded veil should be VERY cheap on your server, it runs less than 1K on mine.<br />
<br />
3) Replace the rings with 2 velium fire opal or 1 velium fire opal and 1 shadel bandit ring.  I know this is a big loss of wisdom, but the addition of 130 hitpoints is a VERY good thing.<br />
<br />
4) Shield slot - a Charred Guardian Shield would give you 10 AC at the loss of one wisdom.  There are some higher priced shields would be very nice for you (with wisdom)  Crystal chitin or bone braced buckler (pricey).<br />
<br />
5) Legs - we just don't have a lot of good leg choices.  Since you're a barb, I would suggest no drop jarsath from KC.  You can try to loot a pair (since they are no drop they can rot) or get a basement group.  They are the common drop from the undead jailer.  Brown chiton is also a choice as well as the GD quest legs (can never remember the name)<br />
<br />
6) Belt - chitinous belt or spider fur belt, both should be very cheap.<br />
<br />
7) Shoulders - death watcher shroud (very nice, but might be pricey)<br />
<br />
8) Wrists - dragon hide from WW<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation to you, your gear in many places is MUCH better than what I was wearing at 51, never say never about gear/loot, you just don't know what's going to happen next in this game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's me at 51, this is in my wis gear.  All of this is no drop however (which means two things, on... better gear does exist, and two, you CAN get all of this stuff pretty much solo at my level, some did require *a* group, except the planar which I got on the only hate raid I've been on).  I'm on a PvP server, so this is what you'd call my &quot;travel gear&quot;  I have a few assorted other items I'll use in a safe group, like a Froglok Scale Chestplate, Elder Wolf Hide, Chipped Bone Bracer :-/  I've been mostly just going for no drop- AC first, Wis second, hp/mana next, then resists.  If that helps at all...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get slime covered rubicite coif, barbed rubicite bracer, a bandit ring, replace your shoulders with ANYTHING, get a tattered mantle, a dragon mantle, or a chokodai mantle, new arms, maybe crystal chittin or even giant scalemail, get an arctic wyvern mask, and a flayed turmoil skin belt or chitinous belt.  And new legs.  I know barbs an't wear seb scale, so try brown chittin.  Oh, and last but absolutely not least get a new secondary item, an sbs if you don't mind losing the wis, or a strathbone shell shield if you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for your help...I sold my EDST for 11k and I bought some new stuff profile: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=406455   Posted there.<br />
<br />
If you know some other stuff I should get, please tell me, I appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You still need a new bracer and new arms.  Barbed rubicite bracer has great ac/hps for about 1-2k (nameless anyway), and look into new arms, too.  Giant scalemail has both wis and hps, and ok ac for about 500pp or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nastix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know how I managed it, but I got a decent AC while still keeping a high wis to go with it.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking to improve my AC even more, but I'm broke (thanks to a splurg of spending) so I can't right now... here's my stuff:<br />
