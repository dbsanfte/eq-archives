<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In ME do we have a spell that can be used to single pull Scouts?  I get 3 everytime with slow, and then my dog hates me for a week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try to pull with Cancel Magic. In the past, I've been decently successful single-pulling with it. Things I couldn't pull singly with Turgur's, I was able to pull with Cancel Magic. I haven't tried the scouts in ME, so I can't say for sure that it'll work. Just a suggestion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, short of sitting, Cancel Magic is about as low aggro as you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have found a trick that works SOMETIMES. If you root a mob at it's spawn point, his nearby friends will get mad and chase after you. If you then run a good ways off, the fellow you rooted will sometimes forget all about you. This works very well on coterie and I've had it also work on 4 arms. Be warned! Sometimes they will keep aggro on you and might pass it on to passing mobs. <br />

Use at your own risk. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I haven't been able to single pull them...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It has been my experience that similar to pullling shrooms in FG, in order to single pull scouts, or anything in ME for that matter,  I had to be level 60.  <br />
<br />
When I was level 59 in both FG and ME and tried to get a single pull, it didn't happen.  However, when I reached level 60, I could get anything single.  I use slow to pull with most mobs; that way when it attacks me or my pet, it's already slowed plus you can be pretty far away and have it stick.<br />
<br />
I have also used the low agro Burst of Flame level one spell to pull golems and snakes in the Grey.</div></div><hr />
