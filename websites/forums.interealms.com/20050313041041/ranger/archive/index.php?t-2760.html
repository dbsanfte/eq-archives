<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whist</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that many people have the &quot;see my gear&quot; link to Magelo as part of their signature.  However, I have never seen anyones gear.  Each one I've clicked on takes me to Magelo but with an empty character template.  Is there something that needs to be downloaded or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need a new, IE browser, patched up, need to clear cache frequenlty, and need to jack down your security settings to be able to get any use out of it at all, in my practice.</div></div><hr />

The page loads, but none of the equipment shows up.  I tried clearing out my temp internet files and updating IE 6, but neither worked.  Other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I found I have to disable my ad blocker in order to get Magelo profiles to load correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be your web browser. I was getting this on one of my work machines and reinstalling IE completely from scratch fixed it. Be sure to download the IE installer before uninstalling.</div></div><hr />

For me, it was a matter of turning off my firewall protection in order to view the site. Any kind of protection like Zone Alarm or Norton Internet Security may cause this.</div></div><hr />

It's a tricky brand of site, and a number of security features can prevent it from loading right.</div></div><hr />

Magelo works fine for me in AOL 5.0 (which I think uses internet explorer 4.0) <br />
<br />
OUCH!  AOL!<br />
<br />
do you play EQ on dial up?  ive been wondering if its really that bad or not.  my friend only has dial up and he wants to play.<br />
<br />
even with cable the lag gets really bad sometimes so it must be almost unplayable with dialup....<br />
<br />
anyways, ive noticed the magelo thingy too... the boxes come up but are all out of place and are moved around teh screen and stuff. it usually fixes itself if i reload.</div></div><hr />

EQ works just fine with dial-up.<br />
<br />
From what I understand it was designed as a low bandwidth using game and actually only requires a 28k modem... <br />
I wouldn't recommend trying to win a jousting duel in the ec tunnel but that's about it.<br />
<br />
Your friend should be able to play np :)</div></div><hr />
