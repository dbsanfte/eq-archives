<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CatteNip_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started a Cat shaman on SZ. I was wondering if someone can give me a few tips.. Like what is a decent MR FR CR PR DR.  What resist should I concentrate on.  Also,  Should I go wisdom in lower lvls??  What exactly is a good order for dots and debuffs?? Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to avoid getting rooted shoot for 150MR. you will still get rooted sometimes but at 150+ your chances of resisting are good. Focus on MR at your lower levels because at least you can run away hehe. Send me a tell sometime im also a Vah Sir shaman on SZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been looking for a good PvP guide for shamans for a while, and i couldnt find any on this board or any on the net. Anyone know of any that could post a link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are so many factors in pvp it would be hard to post a general guide like that. First of all your level determines what your strategy should be, second it depends who your fighting. Shamans are all around good vs any class in pvp but there are so many X factors a guide wouldnt be able to answer.<br />
<br />
Try asking some more specific questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was the highest shaman on Sullon Zek before I retired my character.  If you have any specific questions you can inter server tell me and I would be more than willing to give you answers and advice.<br />
<br />
I had a guide partially written at one point but its not currently posted anywhere.<br />
<br />
One thing I would advice you to do right away is start your epic, the black fur boots are extremely useful in PvP both as an instant rebuff and a fast way to rebuff sow.  You won't need to worry about stacking it away from dispells as you can click and go.<br />
<br />
Crimsons potions are a good thing to have handy in a bag if you know you'll be encountering enchanters.  The only two ways I've died in PvP post newbie deaths when the server was brand new was to manaburns and enchanters.<br />
<br />
The most successful enchanters who have killed me were able to do so by rapturing me and using all their strength debuffs to encumber snare me, proceeded to sieve me after that so gate was not an option.<br />
<br />
Stay away from wisdom, remember the way to stay alive is to have positive HP.  The easiest way to keep your HP up is to not allow spells to land, hense the need for good resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crimson potions are worthless if you have regen3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">vs melee:  malo till it sticks and then slow, u win (mostly).  <br />
<br />
vs chanter:  while u are mez'd mem ur lowest desease dot and cast it on urself when u get the chance.  if they are good they will continualy rune themselves, gonna be a tuffy.<br />
<br />
vs wizzy:  well if they are good they dd faster then u heal.. try to just keep healed and hope dogdog takes care of the rest.<br />
<br />
vs necro:  dot them they dot u keep thier pet off and try and get urs on them.. they can heal themselves but not as good as u.<br />
<br />
vs mage: keep pet off <br />
<br />
make sure and use the tab button so you can heal yourself and get back to the target quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Crimson Potions have nothing to do with regen dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CatteNip_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice.. I was actually leaning towrds wisdom until I get cannie and a Ikky BP. Is it worth getting a Ikky BP in PvP since there are no resist.  at lvl 16 my wisdom is 170 with some resist gear.  I am going to work my MR up above 150 buffed.  To avoid roots.  Does this also hep with snares.. Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you can get an ikky bp that would help you out a lot.  Directly in PvP it will let you kite around other players while you regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They changed the way that regen and dots stack, and now if your regen is higher than the crimson potion damage, you won't break mez.</div></div><hr />
