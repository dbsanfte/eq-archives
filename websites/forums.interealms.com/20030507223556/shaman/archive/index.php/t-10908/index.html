<br />
I searched and couldn't find the answer. I was down there with a group last week so we just pulled em all. I didn't stay long enough to test a single pull thou as the cleric and chanter left and the rogue i was with decided to do crypt pulls. He pulled the gaurdians back to us and they gated and all hell broke out. Had to gate out for I could try to single pull.<br />
