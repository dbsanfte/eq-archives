<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know at this point it doesn't really matter, but I'm at a loss as to what I should get. You can check my magelo for my current AAs and see what I mean.. I'm running out of choices, and I really don't want to get spirit call 4/5. Pet affinity is worthless, so forget that.. spell casting subtlety is an option, but if I get agro at this point in the game, I am dead anyway. Quickened curing is an option, but I don't use radiant cure so much that a minute and a half would be worth the aa to max that. swift journey? I don't go to many indoor zones. convalescence? 3 points of extra regen is worthless.<br />
<br />
That leaves secondary forte for some reduced mana cost on my dots, fomm for better burst dps when/if I nuke(I rarely nuke), or call of the ancients. Not sure about call of the ancients, as my guild already has quite a few people with that AA line already..<br />
<br />
So, what would you do in my situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCS3 all the way - the point is not to get aggro in the first place. Then secondary forte is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The rest of the advanced resist aa's as well. On lots of incounters resists are everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would get swift journey two and then finish up your resist AA's.  Swift journey was the first thing I got when GoD came out and I haven't regretted the 15AA's I spent on it.  It doesn't just help for indoors, it helps when you get dispelled, sow wears off, or you just plain forget to cast sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCS3, and then I went for FoMM3.  I just love 3 criticals in a rain :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never use my rains.. on a pvp server, they hit my group.. so fomm is kinda low on my priority list..<br />
<br />
I have my sow boots in a clicky spot in my inventory(pvp you need the clickies), so sow never wears off me unless I'm deep in a dungeon(which I rarely am). This makes run 5 kinda worthless for me. as far as resist AAs go, my only lacking resist is cold resist, and I can't think of a single encounter that I engage in where CR is needed.. and even then, I can get over 400 with buffs/bard pretty easily, and can even max it if I try. So I was looking for something more useful than that.<br />
<br />
looks like spell casting subtlety may be my next aa, unless someone can come up with a better suggestion..<br />
<br />
How good is the 50 more spec from secondary forte? will I notice a difference in the mana cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SCS.  Forget Sec Forte.  I'd be very, very surprised if you noticed the difference.</div></div><hr />
