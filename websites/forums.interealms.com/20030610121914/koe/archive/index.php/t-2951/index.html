<br />
first want to say congrats to Coatie, Xun and aseid!! ((im so proud and pumped for you guys))<br />
<br />
~~I as well as many of you im sure have friends and family effected by this..our thoughts are with you ALL ~~<br />
<br />
~~now here is im little story~~<br />
<br />
well my birthday was on 9-11 can't say i'll never forget it!!<br />
<br />
We where in Boston for a wedding and had taken a couple of days off to visit the city. ((thank god)) Much to my surprise while eating my birthday breakfast i flipped on the news and watched it all from the start.  Then i got really scaried when i heard the WHAT WHERE WHEN AND HOW..<br />
<br />
<br />
So i call everyone for course thankfully all our family and friends where home or already on the ground some where. Of course my mother was in pieces scaried.<br />
<br />
We tried for 2 days to get a rental....remember this is me, my wife her 2 sisters and her mother..<br />
<br />
we where staying at the marriot down down right next to the westen....after that whole thing---I WAS GETTING OUT OF TOWN.<br />
<br />
We finally got a montaro sport so off we went 5 adults-- too many damn suitcases and lots of junk food and water.  I took the drivers seat figured if i was driving i wouldn't have to sit in the back.... ((i never let the keys out of my sight))  Needless to say the automobile was tight, but it was the largest thing they would let us take out of town. ((BTW mother-in-law doesn't travel well acccck))<br />
<br />
So 10 states  two over night stops, and three days later im home....didnt know people had to pee every 2 hours <br />
<br />
I hope everyone else is safe and has thier families with them.<br />
<br />
All my love and thoughts<br />
