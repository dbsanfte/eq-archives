<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, there I am, strolling through Allakhazam's website reading up on some quests I am doing for my alts when I hit this gem of a post.  It's referring to the Marsinger's quest in PoHate, in case yer curious....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
==================<br />
<br />
&quot;When I started EQ in Feb 2000 the game moved at a snails pace. Yea the gear sucked and I was so stoked when Kunark came out. It seemed to me back then about a Year later Velious came out. Better Gear,Bonus Party ! <br />
<br />
TIME WARPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP ahead 7 expansions to the present. I feel like I am upgrading my gear every week. Gear I use to covet is now worn by my level 5 Tradeskill Mule because I cannot give it away and the Tribute value is not worth the trip. Folks ask me if I am Keyed for GoD yet. Hell Im still working on my SoL and PoP Keys and Flags. I have Freaking Shards coming out of my Arse.I was looking in those Deluxe Toolboxes in the Stuff to Save section of my Bank Acct. and realized the Save crap is half of my Bank Space! When did this game go from Sub Light speed to Warp 9 and how the hell do we apply the brakes to slow things down a bit? I know that even you hardcore futhermuckers got to be feeling the Arms Race , weekly gear replace with haste , Monty Hall Burnout ! <br />
<br />
How am I going to handle EQ game in the fast lane you ask? I'll tell you how. I am going to put my Ceramic Shield of Valor up for sale even though it seems like I just got it yesterday. Then I am going to put the FT-3 Gem in it's place. It sure is a long way from that silly resistance pottery range totem I use to cook up and sell for phat lewt back in the day but I think I can cope :) <br />
<br />
Hey I figured a lil trip through time is what all you folks needed to get that warm and fuzzy feeling back. Enjoy whichever jem you pick because Im sure it will be obsolete before you can say &quot;Are you keyed for Space Travel on the Koada'Dal Spacejammer Yacht bro?&quot; <br />
<br />
==============<br />
<br />
<br />
And THAT in a nutshell is just the way I have been feeling.  The game has gone from getting an upgrade of 10 hps, on an item that previously had NO hps on it at all, and being EXTREMELY HAPPY to getting an upgrade of 200hps/mana and thinking &quot;Hmmmmm.....  Should I have waited for that?&quot;  The magic is gone.  Like this poster I copied said, it's an arms race.  He/she with the most loot wins.  What a shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wins?<br />
<br />
There is no wins, who in the hell ever said there is a wins to this game?<br />
<br />
The only people I have heard who have said they have won the game are not the ones participating in the loot race.  And there is NEVER a wins in the loot race.<br />
<br />
Alot of the people who play this game don't play it for a concept of winning, of beating EQ and seeing the credits go scrolling by with some funky music as the princess comes out and hugs your toon.<br />
<br />
You want to know why we play this?<br />
<br />
You REALLY want to know why we play this?<br />
<br />
I HAVE NO FREAKIN IDEA WHY I PLAY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
