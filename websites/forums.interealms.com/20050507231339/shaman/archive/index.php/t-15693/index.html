<br />
Dang, I still don't have my bracer/boots/sleeves!  Bah on price hikes.<br />
Hoping this was just Sol Ro affected (where I can't go), and maybe I can still try to get lucky in Tactics or BoT.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

Btw 100 post wee~ :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, the drop rate was changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The green dots represent the reputation system.  If you hover your mouse over the green dots, a pop up message will appear stating the status of the individual.<br />
<br />
If you would like to feedback for a particular post, click the small &quot;talking head&quot; button on the bottom, right hand side of a post.  A pop up box will appear and you can either select &quot;approve&quot; or &quot;disapprove.&quot;  You can also leave comments if you want.  The reputation bump is anonymous.<br />
<br />
If you would like to check the last 5 reputation bumps you have received, click the User CP button on the top,  right hand side of your screen.  <br />
<br />
You are limited in the amount of reputation you can give in a 24 hour period, I believe it's 10.  If you give feedback to a person, you have to give feedback to other people before you can return to the first individual (I think it's 20 people).  <br />
<br />
The more positive reputation bumps you have, the more you can affect others by bumping.  If you have 0 reputation points (or heaven forbid, negative) your bump doesn't affect the other person's status, although they can still see the bump and the comment (if any) in the User CP.<br />
<br />
You can also click the talking head for one of your own posts and it will let you know if you have received reputation for that post.  Salas, I bumped your post in this thread if you want to check it out.<br />

<br />
thanks for the bump too hehe guess that was just to show me /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Typical ...something gets fixed they have to rebreak it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh well so much for legs for me.<br />
<br />
I was waiting for them to come down form 100k. Back to hording raid points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, if there's one thing those wacky monks love, it's a good nerfin'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm glad I saw this thread then...<br />
<br />
Boots went down 10k from their previous 45k (3 people were selling) price, so I nabbed em.<br />
<br />
The rest of the spells that I will ever cast will be 15% less mana now... /dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can tell you from personal experience that they have indeed changed the drop rate, but I think 'nerfed' is too strong a term...I think now the drop rate is closer to what they originally intended. On our first raid to TSR after that first patch, so many ornate molds/patterns dropped that it was almost silly...I think we got 16 clearing to Dreso. In fact..it took the raidleaders so long to award everything the timer to get a flag from clicking down the portal expired (the things you find out that you never thought you'd need to know, lol).<br />
<br />
Now the average seems to have dropped to 1 mold/hour or so...which still isnt that bad all things considered. Although slower, it still makes an excellent incentive to exp in groups there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I havent read the post but My bazaar still showing alot of ornate for sale. Hard to say if its as much or leftovers but ive seem some chain roll through. Guess i should read the thread but just skeptical. Been waiting for the nerf rumour and raised prices for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm on VS server, amount of ornate in the bazaar has dropped right down. And in an exp group in solro now I did not see any drop in the hour I was there. I heard that the elemenentals still drop them at same rate just not the yard trash /shrug. Also for info apparnently ornate nodrop on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is like the 7th time it's been &quot;nerfed&quot;, so I am a little skeptical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it's real, definitely a very noticable change in solro, not sure of outsdie solro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Also for info apparnently ornate nodrop on test.I've been hearing that one all year...<br />
<br />
Next rumor please...</div></div><hr />
