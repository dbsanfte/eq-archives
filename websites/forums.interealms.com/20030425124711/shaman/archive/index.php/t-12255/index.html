<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I am a 55 Shaman and do not have my HS key yet, but have Sebilis.  I am wondering if I can soloing Kasorea just yet or should I bring some friends?  Thanks for the info on the zone and the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiya Zukl!<br />
<br />
Kaesora should be a cinch.  A well-prepared dog should quickly chew through most critters there.  I'd suggest a friend (anybody, really -- a 2nd pair of eyes is handy, but not necessary).<br />
<br />
Pathing for our pets absolutely sucked.  I recommend having the pet sit, then moving forward and Summon Companion.  I must've lost 4 or 5 companions to the pathing before I started doing that.<br />
<br />
/pet guard here doesn't always work, since he sometimes suicides on the way back.  Sitting will park him wherever he killed the last critter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Shandy,<br />
<br />
I have a couple of options.  I se to two box a lot now I have slowed down since I wanted to focus on Zukl before alts and the Girlfriend took over the other account to play.  HEHE I so have her addicted no way am I letting this one go.  <br />
<br />
Here are my choices<br />
50 Warrior easy to equip with moderate gear and i think this would allow me to not need dogdog<br />
<br />
49Magician Nice nukes and hard to reequip.  <br />
I would like your votes on this and info.  I am right now leaning twoards the War since he can take a beating and I will get us both hit up with HoV before going so HP should not be a problem.  Have Chloroblast(HOLY CRAP WAS THAT SPELL EXPENSIVE) and Stoicism<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No need for a second person down there, just zone in and take out the skeleton at the entrance if you want, or alternate between invis undead and invis to get down to Xalgoz.  Once you get down to the bottom though you will need your pet to dispatch the baddies camped around Xalgoz so summon him up and start taking names =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tegsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can single pull everything, it shouldn't be a problem.  I've gotten multiple HS keys for people by using an epic druid; root + epic (1650 damage) is enough to kill everything except Xalgoz himself, who dies easily to root + epic + Winged Death (1287 damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did mine at 49 / 50 -- blasted undead thingys swarmed and annoyed me.  Bah.  Why don't people kill things good enough so they stay dead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are going to take one of those 2 characters down with you, go with the Mage.<br />
<br />
1)Even naked, a Mage has good damage output.<br />
2)The mage won't need healing.<br />
3)The Mage can gate out after you are done, skiping the annoying walk back out.<br />
4)With pretty crappy gear, a 49 Mage can solo the area (I did it back in the Kunark days, without the newer spells, focus items, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cheaters way to Xalgoz.  <br />
At 55 should be simple for you to get to the church.  Do not go in the church.  Summon your dog dog and park him on the back wall facing the back of the church.  Do not be in bear form.  When you have full mana and dog is fully buffed go directly to the back of the church, press forward into the wall and hit your sit down key.  You should now be sitting down and staring into the church.  If Xalgoz is up, he and his pet will come running.  If place holder is up place holder will come running.  This is how I Soloed Xalgoz at 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">warning about using a pet near xalgoz.  I went down with two friends an SK and a rogue(actually my wife) the SK was upper 50s and my wife and I 51 or 52 at the time.  The SK pulled and stopped to fight X and I believe one other near the entrance to the church courtyard.  I tossed in an alacrity or heal or something and caused one of the MOBs to attack me, ranged attack.  In response my dog charged into the fray.  He chain triggered at least a dozen or more MOBs.  It just got worse from there, we wiped recovered and went back in without a pet dropped Xalgoz without a hitch.  That was the night I realized that when operating in an area where you are safe because of your level, you should not pull out a pet that is 15 levels lower than you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did do this over the weekend and it was quite easy.  All I did was Invis/IUV down to the basement.  Summoned dogdog then had him sit well out of range of aggro.  Single pulled them dogdog killed rooted when some of them ran.  When I got the main guy it was a pain cuz during fight stuff was poping and I was ugh but E Bolt killed most of them and I tanked a lot.  Got some decent lewts too.  The PP was not that bad and I got a 25% WR pack  that holds medium items and an emerald.  From what I see of this zone it looks like it has a lot of potential for PLing too.  Not many people = few to no trains, something is always up, has some okay items for lower levels, and it is in an indoor zone.<br />
Thanks all for the great tips and Shandy you are still my Idol.</div></div><hr />
