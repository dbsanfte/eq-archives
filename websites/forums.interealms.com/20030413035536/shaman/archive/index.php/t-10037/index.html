<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upon joining my new guild I decided to actually do my epic, something I'd promised myself I'd never do as I loathe questing with an ungodly passion.  Besides, it was getting embarrassing seeing ppl 5lvls lower than me with one, while I was sporting that ugly arsed REIF.<br />
<br />
Like many, I cruised thru the quest right up untill the Kirn part.  Then after 3weeks of failed attempts at assembleing a raid, I said screw it and started the faction work.  I'd take 20mins after I logged in to go kill the &quot;fools&quot; and do the turnin to the wandering one by tower 2 in WK, and then usually do it again at the end of my night.  In 2weeks I had the faction maxed but still needed the tear.  Luckily my guild had a PoF raid scheduled and Cazicthule shined on me and let the minis up on my first attempt.  <br />
<br />
So with the tear and faction we went to CoM last Friday with a single group and started whacking reavers.  When Rak popped we cleared all the mobs back to the U-turn.  Then I did the turn in and promptly died.  Was dragged and rezzed and we prepped for the fight.  We had 60Cleric, 54Druid, 62Chanter, 59Shaman, 61ShadowKnight(217MR / 204FR), 56Rogue.  We pulled Rak to the U-Turn and let the SK tank it while the rogue threw daggers, the chanter kept him Runed, the druid and I used smaller heals, and the cleric CHed when needed.  It took about 15mins, but he did eventually go down and really didnt get close to taking the tank out once.  RaR! got my scales, got my spear, and got a big Ole Epic sized smile on my face in record time. :D :D :D</div></div><hr />
