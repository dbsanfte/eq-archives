I went in with a druid friend the other night, and didn't see anything until I just in front of the tower. And no one was sitting inside the entrance, so I assumed at the time that those were the first spawns I would see.<br />
<br />
Seems wrong though. Any insight?</div></div><hr />

Spawn time in entrance has seemed a little twitchy lately, upwards of 20 minutes on some spawns on Karana. A good raiding party could probably clear out of there a lot faster than that and get well out of sight of the tower.<br />
