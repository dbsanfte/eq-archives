<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really have no intention of playing WoW, but like most I'm curious.<br />
<br />
Could someone who is playing it please tell me what is the big deal?  Ultimatly, isn't it the same as EQ, you kill stuff, get phat lewt, explore, do a few quests,  make level, get new spells, rinse, spit, repeat?<br />
<br />
I always considered EQ a chat room with a game wrapped around it.  I assume WoW is the same, just with pretty pictures, and a few new bells and whistles.  In the final annalysis, is it REALLY all that different from EQ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For me its the hope for something better. SoE really doesnt care about casual players imo. Retards that they are they dont reallize that a small percentage of EQ players are in &quot;uber&quot; guilds. By uber i mean they did Ssra when luclin was out PoTime when PoP came out etc. No down time in WoW is a big factor to get me to start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The big difference for me is that Blizzard has a long history of quality, and thusfar they seem to have been able to live up to their name.<br />
<br />
I also think that SOE has tarnished their name by the poor development and support of EQ the last few years and i have no confidence in their products anymore.<br />
<br />
From what little i saw of the beta i can im fond of the atmosphere and overall feel of the environments.<br />
<br />
Cant wait until they release it in europe in January.<br />

But as with EQ2, WOW might not be appealing to every EQ veteran...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what ive read it seems to be that WoW caters to the casual player and not so much the hard core raider.<br />
EQ really gave up catering to the casual player about the time of PoP.(Yes i mean catering too not just chucking them the odd bone as in LoY-LDoN).<br />
Also WoW is something new and different and Warcraft has had a big following for a long time.<br />
If it wasnt for EQ bad CS etc then I think EQ2 would have been a much bigger draw for players of EQ than it seems to be.<br />

I mean it isnt going to cure cancer or anything.<br />
<br />
But for my gaming doller. WoW is superior to EQ in fun, polish, support, and most importantly mindset. <br />
<br />
EQ was a great game when it started. But the years and shoddy management have run it down considerbly. Now. to a new player that wants to get into a MMORG EQ is not the direction I would steer anyone. Wow is. But. If they wanted to raid large scale targets with a virtual horde of players. EQ still wins hands down.<br />
<br />
EQ has the most content. 6 years sees to that. But much of it is conflicting, and Obsolete.  I mean Paladuel caverns for xp and bazzar for gear. Most new players will never know east karanas Like I do. Or west karanas. They will never learn of Pyzjin. Or even glimpse Tovax Vmar. <br />
<br />
EQ has been changed from a RPG to a tactical simulator. And to most players &quot;the real game starts at 65-70&quot;<br />
<br />
In WoW, &quot;The real game starts at level 1&quot; <br />
<br />
That is the differance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WoW is compared to EQ a lot but I think there's another game we should be comparing it to more often. What it really is, is a better version of Dark Age of Camelot - the graphics are about DAoC level and the realm vs realm combat is similar, and the no zoning except in dungeons and cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't try WoW beta, and I wasn't really planning to buy retaili either.<br />
<br />
But I did, and I have been mighty impressed.  The word for Wow is &quot;tight&quot;.<br />
<br />
Everything is designed closely together.  The quests gently guide you to new areas.  The quests are perfectly logical, consisting mostly of kill/fetch/deliver type stuff.  They give some purpose to gameplay, and are a great source of experience and money - and the exclusive source for me so far.  <br />
<br />
Completing these quests leads you to new areas, where you end up &quot;binding&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I've very much enjoyed it so far.  Whether it has the legs of EQ or not remains to be seen.  It's the nature of the beast that balance issues will arise and players will consume content faster than it can be developed, leading to new content that is not as tightly developed.  <br />
<br />
But it's got a real polish to it, and EQ really lost that.  <br />
<br />
I still like EQ, but with my guild withering and me increasingly regulated to screaming &quot;lfg&quot; in MPG and RSS at odd times of day, EQ lost some charm for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In WoW, &quot;The real game starts at level 1&quot; [end quote]<br />
<br />
So in other words, its a completely unbalanced comparison: you SHOULD be comparing EQ 5 years ago to WoW now. Of course a game that is 5 years old will have evolved. And in 5 years, I'm willing to bet that WoW either a)won't exist, or b)will be radically different than it is now, and quite probably WON'T start at level 1 any more.<br />
<br />
Players are ALWAYS going to be more innovative (and more demanding) that the designers of the games. They will FIND the ways to exploit, they will force the sorts of changes they want: in EQ, that means twinking, PLing, etc., all the things that STOP EQ1 from &quot;starting at level 1&quot;. You won't convince me that WoW won't see the same thing happen...<br />

<br />
Correct. But Since I was around 5 years ago when EQ started and have a very very clear memory of the game back then. Compared to the newby interaction of today in both Eq and WoW, the comparision can stand. <br />
<br />
Start Eq today and you are told what?<br />
<br />
Start WoW today and what are you told?<br />
<br />
That is a valid comparision. And in todays spotlight WoW is a better game. Not as deep. (It can never be it is 6 years behind) But the gameplay is just, to me, much better overall. <br />
<br />
The highest compliment I can give WoW is it feels like the first days of EQ. Without some of the suck. <br />
<br />
And EQ was back then the most incredible game I have ever played. And WoW is better.  <br />
<br />
As for where will WoW be in 5 years. I don't know. But I will enjoy the ride. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chances are good that WoW will go the same route and in 5 years be a completely different game, but it is not that way NOW.<br />
<br />
What it is NOW is simply FUN; EQ is not fun NOW. Remember that feeling waaaay back when you couldn't wait to get home to finish that quest? Remember the first time you traversed the Karanas and went.....holy s++t this is awesome. It's the feeling that makes you come back to a game over and over until the feeling is gone. Atleast for me, that feeling was gone from EQ and I have found it again in WoW.<br />
<br />
In WoW, tradeskills are actually fun and useful from the very beginning. As a Tauren Shaman I have made every piece of armor I am wearing with my Skinning and Leatherworking skills. It's a whole new world to explore and to reiterate from the beginning of this post, IT&quot;S FUN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I played a lot of WoW in the closed and open betas and I found the game to be pretty fun. The world is very vibrant, and if you have played the other Warcraft games, they got the feel exactly right. In many respects, the PvE experience is a streamlined version of EQ. Nearly everything in the game is laid out in a logical manner. Quests are easy to find and the rewards are almost always worthwhile (and stated up front, too). <br />
<br />
It's possible for any class to solo and get meaningful xp/loot, which is important to a lot of people. WoW is much less of a grind than EQ - the death penalty is pretty minimal and xp comes fast in any case. The combination of quest xp, plus the xp you get from killing mobs along the way means you are pretty much always progressing.<br />
<br />
I just can't say enough to convey what a difference these changes make. In WoW, you ALWAYS have something to do and it really helps to reduce the feeling of &quot;grind xp all day&quot; that EQ tended to give you. This is especially true early on, when all the quests are fresh to you. Some of the quests are fantastic - the early Tauren and Undead quests really fit into their backstory wonderfully. The McClure vineyard quests in the human starting lands are also great, and revolve around reuninting two young lovers from feuding families (only including early quests as examples so folks can check them out without too much effort). There are also plenty of less interesting collection/slaughter quests, but even these are good for when you just want to log on for an hour and make some progress with your character.<br />
<br />
There are a few things that worry me about WoW. The biggest problem in my mind is the lack of differentiation between PvE and PvP abilities. There have been a number of nerfs/changes made to balance classes in PvP which have been a major detriment to the PvE game. To me, it just seems crazy to try and balance the two using the same ruleset, but that's what Blizzard is trying to do. I don't begrudge the PvP folks their fun, but I don't enjoy PvP and the fact that it impacts my gameplay experience so much (with the various &quot;balancing&quot; efforts) makes me unhappy.<br />
<br />
The emphasis on being able to solo is a blessing and curse. In EQ, you were forced to learn good grouping skills early. Zones like CT and Dalnir weren't forgiving of mistakes and tended to force you to learn basic things like aggro management, how not to ruin crowd control, etc. This is not the case in WoW. The abundance of soloable quests into the top levels of the game mean that player grouping skills are often in a sorry state. When you start doing high-level instances with pickup groups, this can lead to some really ugly situations. If you always group with friends, this isn't a problem - otherwise, you have to be careful. I do wish the game would create bigger incentives for grouping, and put them in early so that players get a chance to develop these skills from the beginning.<br />
<br />
The high-end raids are still largely untested (most were not released to the beta testers). The jury is out on these events until enough people in the raiding guilds are level 60 and able to try these out. The raids that were tested publicly looked interesting, but not enough data was available for meaningful conclusions at this point. In two or three months, the situation should become clearer.<br />
<br />
As with any new game, WoW is in its &quot;honeymoon phase&quot; when everything is new and shiny and bright and everyone loves it. This happens with every new MMOG. The longevity of the game, and its ability to retain the interest of high-level players, is still up in the air. We'll just have to wait and see how it turns out. For now, I'm having fun with it (still regularly playing EQ though), and that's all that matters to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone that thinks that WoW will be like EQ is now 5 years from now hasnt played the game.<br />
<br />
Face it, right now, EQ really starts at lvl 65...and soon that will be lvl 70...<br />
<br />
Why?  Bad planning, bad design and lack of well planned limitations.<br />
<br />
The result was excessive twinkage, and because of the incredible grinding (read non-fun) required to level a lot of power leveling.<br />
<br />
A lot of people ended up multi-boxing just to get anything done.<br />
<br />
Sure, later SoE finally started putting in some level limits on gear and added all the incredibly stupid flagging to limit access to new gear, but it was just badly done.  The result was the effective closing off of huge areas of the game to anyone that disliked raiding or didnt want to be guilded.<br />
<br />
WoW does it differently.  You almost never feel like your grinding, at least so far...the twinking that can be done is minor and just really not required.<br />
<br />
Gear you get from mobs you kill is useable (wow what a concept, that early on in the game you can actually improve your character without having to buy stuff that other players looted)<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are worthwhile and actually dont lead to carpal-tunnel...and you can actually use some of what your making...<br />
<br />
Does WoW have the content depth of EQ, no, of course not, but the viable existing content already in someways exceeds EQ, because its all new and all worth doing at present.<br />
<br />
Huge areas of EQ are now just wasted space...quests were almost totally useless in EQ except for a few and even those were really never designed properly.  Anytime a guild/multi-group force is required to finish a quest, well, what can I say...imposed limits.<br />
<br />
Currently as I havent seen the end-game in WoW, I cant really comment on longevity, but I can comment on the fun-factor, and frankly there is no comparison..its WoW hands down...<br />
<br />
After having spend over 5 years in the world of EQ, I frankly see nothing pulling me back.<br />

<br />
It's like they took everything bad about mmorpg's and threw it out the window. No xp loss when you die. You can't train other people. You can't ks someone elses mob. I could go on an on.<br />
<br />
For the first time in a long time I'm actually having fun. The graphics are well done and doesn't take a super computer to run. I can't say enough good about this game, it's top notch all the way.<br />

Goodbye EQ, I'm not in your world anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Some interesting observations which I felt the need to comment on. I made some of my characters in EQ to solo and was told by Verant that soloing was a viable option. And by being able to solo I lost skills that made me group desirable. Shamans could both solo and group and were very group desirable. Then they changed the rules, grouping is the recommended/required style and you got penalized or zones/mobs made it difficult/impossible to solo but didnt receive any new grouping skills. Then beastlords came out and pretty much reduced the shamans group desirability and other changes made them buff whores. So much for EQ's version of soloing. WoW is solo friendly.<br />
<br />
And I recall what happened in EQ when you took someone who was a solo class, druid, necro, shaman and bards to different extents, and forced them to group for xp, spells, loot etc., you had the same ugly experiences. Today in EQ those ugly experiences usually happen with Ebays as there are few true n00B's, mostly experienced twinks. Besides the nerfs in the game has made soloing almost impossible in many circumstances. (summoners, unreal dmg output mobs, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jedani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Played  WoW up to level 12 and was basically bored into cancelling the account- call me demented but i want at least a chance to die for some kind of challenge .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Should have played to a higher level Jedani, it gets more difficult and you have chances to die just like any other game. But your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EQ1 was designed originally as a social game where players would be dependent on each other, and that has remained the underlying theme of the game. While some classes could solo, it wasn't by design. WoW (at least the grind to 60 part of it) is clearly designed for soloers, and I think that is a fundamental weakness. The real strength behind EQ was the social structure it build up around grouping, and after a few weeks on WoW it is pretty clear that the game lacks this element. This may change in the high end game (which apparently wasn't in the beta) when raiding/grouping will be required for progression, but the consequence of the game design is two fold (1) most people will be woefully unprepared for group encounters; and (2) large numbers of &quot;casual&quot; players who played the game solo for the exploring/leveling experience will find themselves with little to do and no means to progress other than to reroll a new toon. Personally I think the game population will decline pretty severely within 6 months as the latter are winnowed out, after which it will be a demographic fairly similar to the current EQ. I don't think it will take 5 years to reach EQs age though, it will happen a lot faster than that, players are just too sophisticated in their expectations in this day and age for anything else to happen. I don't think that this is a bad thing, for a game to have a long life it is pretty much an evolutionary requirement. It's probably not going to please a lot of people, but in the mean time they can still have fun ;)<br />
<br />
As the game ages I expect that the auction houses will rapidly become the primary means of gearing people up, not drops. You can allready see this happening.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Oh, btw, there are at least some locked areas, I ran into one of them while exploring on beta. Probably going to need more than peanuts and a banana to get in there I expect ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am not sure I know exactly what it is.<br />
<br />
It just seems less tedious. There is so many things to do. You can actually get a nice drop from yard_trash_mob_1850. The quest are nice. Some require just ordinary drops that mobs normally drop. Others require special drops and they do not drop until you are on the actual quest.<br />
<br />
If you need a &quot;Boss Mob&quot; for a quest and you share that quest with you group. Every single person in your group that loots the mob gets the quest item.<br />
<br />
There is no kill stealing. If you damage it first, it is your mob. It does not matter if you only do one point of damage and someone else kills the other 500hps when the mob dies you get exp (lessened to some extent) and you get to go loot the mob.<br />
<br />
Travel - you have to go to places first and talk to griphon(sp) trainers and once you do certain trainers can fly to certain cities. The rides are amazing. You can see stuff going on as you fly over the world seems seamless. I have run into 3 zones so far. Travel between the two continents and there is a train between Ironforge and Stormwind you have to zone into the &quot;station&quot; on either end. You can however after you travel to the last two fly there with out having to zone.<br />
<br />
That might seem like a bad thing but you can usually outrun aggro on mobs. Lets say you tag one mob. He is yours and no one else can steal him from you. So all the sudden another mob decides to jump in and you cannot handle the two of them. If you start running the mobs will only chase you so far. Once you out distance them the mob that you previously aggro'd will run back to his spawn point and become a free mob again. <br />
<br />
Lets say that someone tried to help you and you just got out of range as the mobs lost aggro. You will not be able to hit the mob until he gets back to their spawn point. They will ignore you and they will evade or resist any attack until they are back at their spawn point. Then if you followed them back into their aggro radius they will attack you or you can attack them. This for the most part eliminates training.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are fun. They are pretty simple for the most part but fun none the less.<br />
<br />
Dying - Who cares! I mean seriously you spend a few silver to repair your armor and the time it takes to get back to your body. <br />
<br />
It is a simple game but I have way more fun than I did in EQ. This comes from a long time EQ addict too. My 7 year old now has a few characters and begs me to play with him all the time now. (Blackmail for homework ROCKS!!!!) But now my 4 year old is eyeing the computer and wanting to play too. He can finish all most all of the levels for Jedi Knight, which is their favorite multiplayer games!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like its emphasis on gameplay and where tradeskills yield very nice results which are equippable as upgrades. And in the open Beta the prospects of playing some of the characters in pvp was quite exciting. I will probably buy it for when I am bored as it seems quality enough but doesn't hold the same appeal eq did and I am waiting for the next game that can provide that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">WoW to me has been overly simplistic.  The risk to dying is not there.  The rewards for grouping dont seem to be there.<br />

Its like Blizzard made a game that sole purpose was to give everyone everything they wanted.  In the long run, that tactic will come back and bite em in the ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to Blizzard not making a bad product, thats not necessarly true.  Look at both the Diablo 2 expansion and the cesspit known as Battle.Net  The D2 expansion wasnt properly play tested and thus had many xp exploits in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are plenty of risks to dying, for I have died many times.  I admit, the risk of dying is fairly low for lower level characters (pre 20) tho.  <br />
<br />
Corpse retrieval in general is much less stressful than it is in EQ.  There are times that I have died getting my corpse.  (Died deep in a cave and it had respawned by the time I got back, leading to a another death).<br />
<br />
<br />
The rewards for grouping are there.  You will not see it until your upper teens and up when elite quests and instanced zones are made available to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game itself is fun and has removed just about everything bad that was in EQ.  Quests are actually fun to do and have meaning.  You are never forced to camp trivial green con mobs for hours on end.  You are not forced to sit in a zone to forage a rare drop to obtain a component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most quests in EQ dont force you to camp green cons either, if you do them at the level they are supposed to be done at.

I think Blizzard has learned the hard way to counter hacks, so I wouldnt expect to see the same phenomenon surface in WOW as it did in D2 before they patched it up.<br />

My experience from having played several years on a PVP server tells me that hacks and ShowEQ like tools have a minimal impact on the game as whole. Sure, there was one or two griefers who would use ShowEQ to track you in the zone, but chances to run into the same persons day after day are very slim. Besides, the benefits gained from ShowEQ can be duplicated by having the track skill (read: Ranger with Trueshot = teh pain).<br />
<br />
However... what REALLY destroys the game is plat/item dupes. It kills the economy and ruins one of the more intriguing aspects of the game. Whereas PVP hackers are so few and do so little impact, its the &quot;peaceful&quot; hacking that is the big killer.<br />
<br />
It is my belief that Blizzard will be able to counter these problems atleast aswell as SOE has done, so unless item/money dupe occurs in WOW, i think we will have little to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">WoW to me has been overly simplistic. The risk to dying is not there. The rewards for grouping dont seem to be there.<br />
Obviously you've never done an instanced dungeon.<br />
I went with a group to Wailing Caverns to do 6 quests I had for the zone.<br />
All of them were Elite quests.<br />
The reward for clearing the zone was a staff with 20 dps, but I didn't end up even needing it because I won a 21.5 dps staff from the end boss of the zone.<br />
In comparison, after 5 full levels of hunting, the current reward for doing yellow quests for me are still only 17dps or less staves.<br />
We also saw a 15dps 1h mace drop off one of the named mobs for the quests.<br />
In comparison, the absolute best weapon I can me with 150+ blacksmithing so far is still only about 12 dps, and same for comparable item drops (I just sold a 12.5 dps mace the other day for nearly a full gold piece).<br />
Grouping to kill the elites is where the big items are...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Played WoW up to level 12 and was basically bored into cancelling the account- call me demented but i want at least a chance to die for some kind of challenge .<br />
That's kinda like cancelling your EQ account because you've gotten to level 12 after twinking a warrior with a boc, fungi, ooiv, cof, 65hp rings, and a variety of other +hp gear, and think that eq is too easy.<br />
WoW gets challenging at around level 12 when you have to leave the safety of the newbie grounds, you actually have to go out hunting some dangerous new locations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I only have one complaint about WoW and I am sure it will be addressed as I level.  The mobs die too fast.  I didnt play Beta more than once or twice and am only level 22 now, but in groups stuff just seems to drop faster than it should.<br />
<br />
As to why its different than EQ, thats easy.  Its different than EQ.  I have a foot in both worlds currently, but I can see having/wanting to make a choice very soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Elite mobs are the fix for mobs dying too fast.<br />
Also, fighting mobs 1 or 2 or 3 or even 4 levels above you makes for longer and scarier fights.<br />
I don't know how it'll be at higher levels, but IMO the elite instanced dungeons need for more mobs to be grouped together.<br />
Making a dungeon full of elite mobs, and then making them all solo pull or 2 pull doesn't especially make for a tough dungeon.<br />
Making the pulls come in sets of 3 and 4 and 5 at a time would make for much more interesting fights to deal with with some real risk of death.<br />
The clearing I've done of Wailing Caverns with a few others was pretty damn easy except for the final boss fight.<br />
The challenge of everything needs to be pumped up a weee bit IMO, especially when there's virtually no penalty for dying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but for a game everyone praises as being so great regardless of level, I shouldn't be bored to tears the first few levels.  My first few levels of EQ were FUN!  I didn't reach level 10 for a month or more in EQ and I enjoyed every moment.  I was bored in WOW after the first few hours.  And sorry, telling me to play the game to higher levels to enjoy it just doesn't make sense, I already enjoy a game that you are villainizing for requiring what you are telling me I need to do to enjoy WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">WoW doesn't really &quot;start&quot; at any particular level.  It &quot;starts&quot; the first time you demolish someone in PvP and realize how PvE will never give you that kind of rush again.<br />
<br />
On top of that, the leveling is fun.  It is mostly guided by quests, and all the quests have great rewards.  Whenever you get a quest, it usually involves exploring the land until you find your destination.  Many times, you'll be introduced to a whole new zone, where you'll get quests there to guide you in your exploration.  This yields a much more satisfying experience than EQ's &quot;Ok I'm level 30 now so I guess I can go OT and sit there and kill stuff for another 10 levels, then I can go to dreadlands and repeat until I get to KC.&quot;  In EQ, the leveling up was fun for most of us because it was the first time we'd done it.  Every other game I've tried since EQ, I have quickly gotten bored of the level-gaining process and it became a chore that I merely wanted to complete so that I could do the high end stuff (CoH, DAOC).  WoW avoids that, and leveling up is fun again.  For the first time in years, I am no longer in a rush to complete things in a game.  In EQ, I wouldn't waste my time with anything that wasn't the most efficient way to do things.  In WoW, I am more interested in exploration and just having fun than I am with improving my character.  There are level 40's on my server and I'm only level 25.  In EQ, that would have been completely unacceptable to me, but in WoW I just don't care because I am having so much fun.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I guess you could say that WoW and EQ are similar.  But you can say the same thing about every MMORPG that is going to be made in the next few years.  Do you really think EQ is going to be the best for all that time?<br />
<br />
If you tried WoW and didn't like the newbie levels, I'm not sure what to tell you.  Maybe you picked the wrong class, or maybe it just isn't your game.  I had fun at level 1, and started having more fun as the game progressed and my character started developing into a shaman.<br />
<br />
For me, though, the real deal-maker was the first time I went to Ashenvale and happened upon a night elf the same level as me.  When he was lying dead at my feet, I realized that this really was going to be a fun game, and I was hooked.  I try and kill at least 10 night elves a day, now.</div></div><hr />

WoW is a well designed top quality game. If you don't believe us try it for yourself. I can only speak for myself but the game gives me the feeling that I once had in the early days of EQ. I used to think that I was having fun in EQ until I played WoW and realized that I had forgotten what fun actually was and by comparison how much like a &quot;job&quot; eq was. Even if WoW turns into a 3 month game I don't see myself ever comming back to eq. I just don't like what Sony has done with the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">EQ1 its done the rounds, evolved yet its still 5-6 years old using 5-6 yrs old gamestyle and graphics. It will never looks or play like EQ2 or WoW which are new style, new graphics and have a 5yr game development edge over EQ1. Comparing EQ1 in its current state to WoW is unfair, comparing it 5yrs ago is also unfair as EQ1 at that time had no competition or anything else to be compared too.<br />
<br />
EQ1 will stay for those still dedicated to play, but as it seems lots playerbase have moved top take a look at the other 2 games EQ2 and WoW, some will continue with these new games dependant on what they have to offer for the future, others will go back to EQ1 cause they know what future sorta holds their. Maybe in 3-4 months server populations for EQ1, 2 and WoW will stabilise and server merges within these games will happen. I think one the biggest things for me on all these games now is what is the roadmap....when are expansions planned is going to be the interesting one for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">for myself, the kicker has been that WoW has done the shaman class right. it's what I thought the eq shaman was going to be 4 years ago, hoped it would be recently, and now realize that it never will be. I don't know what draws me to the shaman class in most games that offer them, but imo WoW offers the best example so far. <br />
<br />
personally, I think that many 'die-hard' eq fans (and I have been one for many years) are protesting a bit much about WoW. who are you really trying to convince that WoW sucks? I think you're trying to convince yourselves for the most part. let it go already, be happy for those of us that have moved on and found something that we enjoy as much as we used to enjoy EQ. both games aren't going anywhere for a while (though open recruitment w/ reduced reqs is way up for even the most uber guilds in EQ these days :)) so take the time to try it out and see for yourself. of course, if you go in thinking 'EQ roxorz!! no way WoW can be any good!' your bias is probably going to cloud your opinion anyway. and that's cool too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think i summed it up best in a post i made in the WoW forum. Do you want to play the game from the people coming up with the ideas or the game from the people stealing ideas from all over and slapping their logo on it.<br />
<br />
When i look at blizzard i see a long time experienced company that has a lore laid out for this game from games prior, they have a real sense of the fantasy adventure and what makes it fun. They listen to the customers much better then SoE and try to not shove things down your throat and make you do it how they say. They know this is a product for us and while they have to govern it and maintain its continuaty, its our interest that is making the game.<br />
<br />
Another thing is camps dont exists, atleast not like in EQ. I was reading a thread the other day about someone camping a mob for 4 hours and not getting a drop they need and will have to come back the next day and invest probably another 4. I remember camping my VP key and camping 1 mob alone for 16 straight, none stop, not leaving my chair. This is not a problem in WoW.<br />
<br />
In WoW goruping is not a must, 1 class is not a required class. If you dont have a priest a shaman or druid or pally or someone that like to bandage alot will do fine. You can actualy solo effectivly without 10 minutes of down time as a warrior or any class.<br />
<br />
PvP is actualy fun. There is a reward and penalty system in place to encourage honorable play int he PvP and its simply a more advanced system with town sieges and 1 on1  PvP.<br />
<br />
WoW is just more fun in my opinion, im not knocking EQ or EQ2, but in my life i find that WoW offers the perfect balance of fun, excitment and the ability to quit any time. There is no real exp penalties for death also. I dont mind paying a durability price, but exp is hard earned and hold you back from progression. Plus its just new and a change, that alone is a huge redeeming factor. For me it was time to move on from EQ. WoW or no WoW.</div></div><hr />

I could really give a sh1t if you play WoW or not, so I'm not suggesting that you do in any way shape or form.  However, how you could be entertained in EQ from levels 1-12 while sitting in the newbie area mindlessly whacking everything that walked by for exp, vs. going on varied and entertaining quests from multiple sources in multiple areas for both exp and usefull drops starting with level 1 in WoW, is beyond me. <br />

The soloing sounds nice but as to no required classes, that's how mmorpgs are though. As a low level EQ warrior in february 2000, I was usually healed by ranger and paladin friends, I didn't need a cleric/druid/shaman. At low levels in most mmorpgs, any class will do to group with.<br />
<br />
We'll see how WoW is about class requirements when people are level 60 and raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I would honestly liketo go back, and quote 20 of these posts, and add the words &quot;for now&quot; on the end of every one. <br />
<br />
I havent played WoW, but its obviously a great game. Its a game that is helping both old-time EQ players find that &quot;magic&quot; again and, at the same time, it seems to be a respectable introduction to MMORPGs for the n00bie. Thats fine. <br />
<br />
I see a lot of tradeskill props in here. None of you wore Tae Ew? Or Valorium Rings of Gallantry? Are you folks telling me there isnt ANY useless tradeskilling in WoW? Come on. <br />
<br />
<br />
And honestly, is &quot;the abaility to solo with any class at any level&quot; REALLY a plus? It may seem that way, but lets look back at the early days of EQ. Players in those days were seperated by one, basic thing. Time played. It took TIME to level. WoW doesnt seem to have that feature. In the end, this may be ok, but speaking as a veteran of EQ, I guarentee you if I coulda made lvl 50 in the first month of EQ, I probably wouldnt be playing. <br />
<br />
WoW has had to advantage of seeing all of EQs mistakes, and avoiding the same pit-falls. But we have to remember something. Ease of play, and ease of leveling, and the ability to do your thing non-stop without ever interacting with anotehr soul isnt EVERYONES cup of tea. And I can already smell MASSIVE problems with the whole PVP thing. Theres a reason that EQ has 95% &quot;blue&quot; servers, and 5% &quot;red&quot; you know. <br />
<br />
I am not trying to cut on WoW, honestly. I would probably enjoy it if I tried it. But for myself, I am still having a lot of fun in EQ. Gates drove me to the brink of /deltree, but OoW brought me back with triple the incentive and fun factor. No other expansion in the history of EQ drove me like OoW seems too, and that includes PoP, LDoN, Kunark and Velious. <br />
<br />
EQ made a lot of mistakes. No one is denying it. Its hardly a &quot;perfect&quot; game now. WoW is probably a lot slicker, more polished version of EQ, from a company who has a proven track record of great games, and the benefit of having a WHOLE LONG LIST of what NOT to do based on EQs mistakes. <br />
<br />
But they are diffferent games folks. You cant compare EQ now to WoW now. You cant compare EQ 5 years ago to WOW now. And you cant compare WoW in 5 years to EQ now. They are different, and if a new, exciting, dare I say &quot;Magical&quot; enduring world is what you are looking for, then WoW may be the best choice for you. Speaking for myself, Blazz is a part of my life. I will be hard pressed to hang up his Spellbook for ever. I, personally, just dont think WoW is the one that has &quot;what it takes&quot; for me. And lets face it, if EQ dies, and WoW turns out to be &quot;The One&quot;, how hard will it be for a guy like me to buy it, load it, and catch up. Judging from the reports I see, it wont be too difficult at all.</div></div><hr />

Not if you tradeskill up as you level. Everything is upgrades or useful. For example 12 blacksmithing a stone which has 3 charges of +3 dmg to the weapon you are using. Its much different from other tradeskills, in that its not a labourious affair, and its no fail. Sure, that may take away some of the achievement of it but if you are a real tradeskill junkie you will probably prefer eq2 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Also, yes I agree with you about the soloing. I think I would prefer it if was more focused around grouping but that doesn't take away from the game, each of the classes are very rewarding.<br />
Pvp, there are pvp servers which are a minority of the servers, however, I believe there is an option of playing pvp later on at the higher levels as a realm vs realm thing, I don't actually think you have to involve yourself in pvp. WoW also has raiding content for those that prefer that.<br />
Its good that you're still enjoying eq, really its just what people prefer to play. I think a lot of people are enjoying the freshness of WoW over eq and its more arguably advanced gameplay.</div></div><hr />

There is no useless tradeskilling in WoW.  Period.<br />

Tae EW and Valorium needed relatively rare drops obtainable arguably 60ish level and those that could get and make them raped the rest of the world on prices.  (BTW, never bought or wore a single piece of Tae Ew :P).<br />
<br />
WoW tradeskills immediately provide a viable source of gear and other items almost immediately and progresses with you as you go.  There is no basis for comparison really, WoW wins hands down.<br />
<br />
Yes, the option of soloing to 60 in WoW is a good thing.  Period.  <br />
[EDIT: Key issue here is &quot;option&quot;.  WoW has made it so soloing provides a viable means of character advancement in both levelling and loot.  Unlike EQ.  Do I intend to solo the whole time, no?  Again, it is a viable option.  If your friends aren't on you can still advance meaninfully.]<br />
<br />
And do we all think that as soon as you hit 60 it's game over, you won??  That is ludicrous and just because EQ had nothing to do or DAoC had nothing to do or Shadowbane had nothing to do or SWG had nothing to do at high levels at the start doesn't mean WoW will follow that same path.  Given how they've improved upon every annoying aspect of an MMORPG so far, I find it hard to believe that anyone can logically think they will screw up the high level game and allow for longevity and replayablitly. <br />

Sorry, but I have zero interest in PvP. I avoided DAoC for just that reason, and I've avoided every other game that featured PvP significantly. And I think the masses have spoken pretty loudly and clearly in supporting PvE games massively over PvP games, time and again. Besides which, even if I WERE ever to try a PvP game, it sure as hell wouldn't be one that drew B-Net kiddie griefers by the hundreds to the game. Thanks, but no thanks.<br />

As somebody said above, I'm not trying to trash WoW. I'm just saying that right now is the &quot;honeymoon&quot; and the marriage will show blemishes, just like every marriage does. You may not WANT to see them, you may try your best to ignore them, or even lie to yourself and say they aren't there, but they will be. The question will become, is the upside worth the downside.

This one was good for a few giggles ;).<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no useless tradeskilling in WoW.  Period.&quot;. Can't believe you said this with a staight face. My toon has a few smithed pieces on, but only because I haven't taken the time to farm caves for merchant fodder. The auction houses &quot;read: Bazaar&quot; have much better items available for the most part. And the high end tradeskills apparently require dropped recipes, which probably translates again into: &quot;if you can get this, you don't need it&quot;. Btw, tradeskilling in EQ provides plenty of usefull items. Be it banded/fine steel in the old days to cultural/magnetic etc in the modern game. Plus its much more sophisticated in EQ2. Tradeskilled items in general will never match dropped items though, particularly as a game matures and the market becomes saturated with farmed items.<br />
<br />
&quot;just because EQ had nothing to do ........ at high levels&quot;. You obviously haven't bought any of the recent expansions, since if you had you would be well aware that allmost everything new that you can do starts at &quot;high levels&quot;. The content is there, if people don't play it its for other reasons, not because its absent. I'm sure the high end in WoW will mimic EQ, if you want rare items you are going to have to face tough battles, and those are going to be raids or single group events that require you to be well geared to start with. The people who couldnt cut it in EQ for one reason or another, and were pressing their noses against the glass window drooling at the glittering gear of the raiders feasting within are going to be doing the exact same thing in WoW, the only difference is that it is going to take them a few months to realize that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This i have to agree with 100%.<br />
TS in every game seem to be more a diversion from fighting than a path to making something really useful.<br />
In EQ1 it seems to be that anyone who can make something useful already has better.<br />
The people who actually would use the items just end up buying them as theyve not got the money to get to the skill required or the access to the drops.<br />
Then it ends up 2 months later that the latest highly sought after TS item goes way down in price (ala VRoG) because so many people make them just for the skill up that anyone who wants to do a TS to make money cant sell the items they do make.<br />
Lets not even mention Alchemy :)<br />
Yes in WoW now and in EQ 1 at startup time TS stuff was very good as in banded etc but as the game grows more dropped stuff becomes cheaper etc etc.<br />

I can't believe I actually have to defend this since it has been beaten to death.  I said &quot;had&quot;.. past tense.  I made no claims about recent expansions, I was comparing the games in their nascent stages.  The poor design of EQ now is that the only content is for high levels.  We'll see how Blizzard handles this.<br />
<br />

As for tradeskills, I am talking about the ability to be self sufficient, provided you chose a skill that makes stuff you can use.  Wearing at least a couple pieces that you made your self at almost all times is pretty darn good I think to speak for the usefulness of crafting.  Banded was useful 4 years ago, probably mostly to use to turn in for quest armor.  There is a huge gap between banded levels and cultural armor.  WoW allows you to have useful things at every level as you progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Sorry, but I find this just hilarious, in light of the fact that Blizzard had to do an emergency patch last night JUST to fix the first big plat dupe hack. Fishing, believe it or not. A macro for fishing, that people were using to fish out big-plat-selling items and racking up 100s of plat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did Sony ever do an emergency patch in order to fix a dupe bug? My view of sony was that the milled about for weeks before doing something to counter their problems. That speaks for Blizzard, not against, if i understand you right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">/agreed.  Hacking is going to happen, period.  What distinquishes a good game and company from a bad one is the quality and timeliness of their response to known hacks and cheats.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard was made aware of the problem and instituted a modification within 24 hours.  If I recall correctly, when SWG got hacked, SOE decided to ban hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent players.<br />
<br />
Also, plat dupe cheats continue to exist in EQ, some of the schemes have been used for months.  I don't think SOE is even attempting to address them anymore.  <br />
<br />
There is no comparison at this point between the two companies.  &quot;Deeds not words&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">/agree vigdis...<br />
<br />
In fact the only response I've ever seen from SOE regarding dupes was in SWG and the screwed that one up so bad it wasn't even funny.  Banning innocent accounts (e.g., vendors that happened to have items purchased from them with duped credits) in probably the first time I've ever seen them be so heavy-handed was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
SOE's response would have been to let the dupe/hack continue and then just implement some poorly thought out money-sink to penalize the innocent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">In EQ1 it seems to be that anyone who can make something useful already has better.<br />
The people who actually would use the items just end up buying them as theyve not got the money to get to the skill required or the access to the drops.<br />
Then it ends up 2 months later that the latest highly sought after TS item goes way down in price (ala VRoG) because so many people make them just for the skill up that anyone who wants to do a TS to make money cant sell the items they do make.<br />
<br />
Yes in WoW now and in EQ 1 at startup time TS stuff was very good as in banded etc but as the game grows more dropped stuff becomes cheaper etc etc.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
Geez man, come ON, isnt it time to trying to hate every single thing about EQ just for the sake of hating it without any REAL facts? You think no one but twinks is wearing Magnetic armor? You REALLY think that the stuff for Valorium Rings, the Pottery range items (Ceramic Shield of Valor, etc) is HARD to get, even without buying it? EQ has effecively reduced the cost of 90% of its tradeskilling progresion to a level that ANYONE can be a 200 skill Brewer, Baker, Pottery master, etc with a few K in pp, and there are items in all those skills that are VERY usable. My food is Misty Thicket Picnics that I made myself. My drink is Kaladin Constitutionals that I made myself. I carry bags I tailored myself. I made myself armor, sheilds, and jewelery items in the past that I used for a long time. <br />
<br />
I am glad WoW has a solid tradeskill function. I like tradeskilling myself, so I think thats an important option in any game. EQ had periods where TSing wasnt so hot, but people need to stop making comparisons to the problems EQ had IN THE PAST to WoW's current cool features. If you didnt/dont/havnt used EQs incredible tradeskill features to further your character, your missing out on some really solid stuff. And I am not talking about stuff that only drops in &quot;locked-flagged&quot; zones or stuff that obscenly rare, I am talking about simple, easy to get supplies in skills that are relatively cheap to master. <br />
There is no useless tradeskilling in WoW.  Period.<br />
<br />
Tae EW and Valorium needed relatively rare drops obtainable arguably 60ish level and those that could get and make them raped the rest of the world on prices.  (BTW, never bought or wore a single piece of Tae Ew :P).<br />
Your kidding me . . . right? Of COURSE there is no useless tradeskilling for a lvl 5 character, HOLY COW! Tae Ew and VRoG components are &quot;rare&quot;? LOL What game have you been playing? Lvl 60 to obtain? LOL, sheesh man . . . did you even PLAY EQ? BTW, I am not suprised you never wore an Tae Ew. Why would you actually put any effort into your character?<br />
WoW tradeskills immediately provide a viable source of gear and other items almost immediately and progresses with you as you go.  There is no basis for comparison really, WoW wins hands down.<br />
Of course it does, Mr Rocket Scientist. Guess what, WoW had 6 years of EQs try-fail-improve-abandon experimentation to build THEIR system on. Frankly, I would be SHOCKED if WoWs tradeskills sucked, because Blizzard is pretty good at that kind of thing, so I fully expected them to create a viable system. But stop dissing EQs tradeskilling because YOU werent industrious enough to take advantage of it and YOU were already pretty much sick of EQ when they finally created some solid, usable, simple items. <br />
Yes, the option of soloing to 60 in WoW is a good thing.  Period.  <br />
[EDIT: Key issue here is &quot;option&quot;.  WoW has made it so soloing provides a viable means of character advancement in both levelling and loot.  Unlike EQ.  Do I intend to solo the whole time, no?  Again, it is a viable option.  If your friends aren't on you can still advance meaninfully.]<br />
That is your OPINION. PERIOD. Its not an opinion shared by everyone who plays MMORPGs. Oh and in EQ, when your friends werent on, you could have been advancing yuour character in a meaningful way. Tradeskilling is just ONE of those ways, LOL. <br />
And do we all think that as soon as you hit 60 it's game over, you won??  That is ludicrous and just because EQ had nothing to do or DAoC had nothing to do or Shadowbane had nothing to do or SWG had nothing to do at high levels at the start doesn't mean WoW will follow that same path.  Given how they've improved upon every annoying aspect of an MMORPG so far, I find it hard to believe that anyone can logically think they will screw up the high level game and allow for longevity and replayablitly. <br />
LOL you are cracking me up. Nothing to do in EQ once you reach the highest level? What are you smokin man, cause I want some.<br />
<br />
Face it Mach, you are a &quot;Diablo 2&quot; model guy. You wanna log in for a couple hours, score your uber loot, by yourself, tradeskilling, or with friends (and yes, I put that as your &quot;last resort&quot; option) and log out. Sorry, I like my games to have a BIT more time-consumption than that. You are the poster child for &quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;.<br />
The poor design of EQ now is that the only content is for high levels.  We'll see how Blizzard handles this.<br />
<br />
Face it, neither of us can see the future, so it will remain to be seen how the high end game works out.  You are basing your opinion on previous games, I am basing my opinion on Blizzard's design and development so far.  Who can say who will be right.

I am glad you are at least willing to make a concession to the fact that a couple months of a game proves NOTHING. But come on, the entire &quot;EQ is only for high levels now&quot; debate has been pounded to death. If you havent been following it, then let me do a quick re-cap. EQ is OLD. A VAST MAJORITY of its players are &quot;high-level&quot;. So it stands to reason that new content would be directed toward THAT level of play. I am not saying EQ did a great job of this, they made TONS of mistakes and Gates alone almost put them into grave, but SOE would be insane to create a bunch of content in EQ for anyone BUT high levels. Thats why they made EQ2. By the same token, WoW would be insane to release an expansion RIGHT NOW that was targeted at High Levels, cause no one is THERE yet. But trust me, once the vast majority of WoWs player base starts maxxing out their levels, you bet your ass the new content they release will reflect that. If it doesnt, that would be a poor marketing move, and Blizzard just doesnt make poor marketing moves to that degree.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your comments though.  I never wore Tae Ew because I put a LOT of hours of time and effort into my character, by GROUPING, in LDON's and got 3 EF 1492 pieces and 2 760 LGuk pieces and over 200 wins total.  How many metallic liquids would you get in a 10 hour day at any camp in PoV?  I've done it before and got 2, and oh btw, I better win the roll to even get one of those.  I'd call that pretty rare.  Sure I can farm plat since I can't get to half the zones in the game and buy one from someone.  I guess I can even do that at as low a level as 45 or 46 or whatever it was.  Tradeskilling in WoW can be useful at every level you are at starting from lvl 5, and you can do it yourself.  It's not instant... it takes a lot of time and effort to farm the materials, there is nothing &quot;diablo 2&quot; about it.  The only useful crafted items in EQ are obtainable at high levels.  The stuff you can make at low levels is useless.  I believe that was the core of this discussion.  How many guides out there exist telling you the fastest cheapest way to become a grand master in TS'ing?  Low level items are good for skilling up.  In WoW low level items are useful.  That's my point.  And it is the case across all tradeskills in WoW.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Dude, thats because there ARENT any low-level players (in general terms, I know there are SOME) in EQ. If therre were, then there would be tradeskilled stuff that would be good for them. As it is, I bet I can get a pretty basic list of good, lvl 45 usable gear from tradeskilling off lvl 45 zone drops. <br />
<br />
And please dont tell me &quot;you can buy better in the bazaar&quot; cause that same rule applies in WoW, already.<br />
<br />
And for the record, Tae Ew has been around a LOT longer than LDoN. The bloods drop in CT, where there are many, many great items, and solid XP, even by PoP standards. Oh and I am sorry you couldnt Diablo-2 your Metallic Liquids all in one 4-hour stint. Took me a few days of XPing in that area to get a couple to make rings and a Ceramic Shield. /shrug, thats the differnce here, the one your not seeing. What takes DAYS in EQ takes HOURS in WoW. This is all fine and dandy, but I say again, be careful what you wish for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">SOE's response would have been to let the dupe/hack continue and then just implement some poorly thought out money-sink to penalize the innocent.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's another reason why I left EQ.  SoE doesn't think about their responses to an unbalanced economy, or most other things.  For example, take Qvic gear and augmentation removal.  It costs 10k or 20k for a piece of Qvic armor FOR NO REASON other than SoE's perception that raiding players are involved in the plat duping chain.  This is a baseless plat sink as most of my old guild members never had much money because they were always raiding and had no time to dupe plat, or farm items to be sold in bazaar and bought with duped plat.  The augmentation removal was another plat sink aimed at raiders too.  2-4k just to remove an augment because it was obtained in a raiding zone.. give me a break.<br />
<br />
Most of the plat exploits that I've heard of were EASILY preventable if they simply had a program to check their item and monster loot table databases for inconsistencies.  There was that one time where the Thurgadin vendor was selling Coldain Velium Tempers for 0pp.  Another time there were sharks (in Erud's Crossing I think) dropping thousands of plat.  Some tradeskilled items could be made for very little and sold back to vendors for a lot.  Things like that seem like they were done on purpose almost.<br />
<br />
In WoW you can make money from tradeskilling and selling back to vendors, because you get &quot;rewarded&quot; for tradeskilling.  It's not a large amount, but you might get 2% more from a tradeskilled item than just selling its basic components to the vendor.  That system encourages tradeskilling.  EQ's system mostly punishes you for tradeskilling with failed combines on desirable items and poor buyback amounts (like in alchemy, spend 200pp to make a potion and get 1pp back). In WoW you never fail any tradeskill combines, but the plans/recipes/patterns for good tradeskilled items come from quests and difficult mobs.<br />
<br />
There are so many things in WoW that are done correctly, in a way that rewards you for doing something other than killing mobs endlessly, that SoE would never even try.  That's why WoW wins in my book.  EQ became like real life, you get &quot;taxed&quot; with plat sinks, you spend a lot of time waiting for something to happen and you get punished for trying stuff that's not part of &quot;the grind.&quot;  WoW is a game, it's entertaining, there's no real punishment for screwing up or doing something different.  <br />

WoW is for lovers.  EQ is for masochists.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe I actually have to defend this since it has been beaten to death.  I said &quot;had&quot;.. past tense.  I made no claims about recent expansions, I was comparing the games in their nascent stages.  The poor design of EQ now is that the only content is for high levels.

Wearing at least a couple pieces that you made your self at almost all times is pretty darn good I think to speak for the usefulness of crafting.  Banded was useful 4 years ago, probably mostly to use to turn in for quest armor.  There is a huge gap between banded levels and cultural armor.  WoW allows you to have useful things at every level as you progress.<br />
<br />
Well, my warrior is an Iksar, and as such there wasnt a lot of armor options available in those early days, because of restriction to chain. I was still wearing banded until my early 40s (when they introduced the Iksar equivalent of quest armor), all of which I made myself. There were plenty of people running around in fine steel, fine plate and similar stuff too. When velious came out the tailored stuff was in high demand. Most expansions have had usable tradeskill made items.<br />
<br />
There might not be as big a gap between stuff you can make and stuff that drops at the high end (both in WoW and EQ2), but you have to remember that those high end products require that you get high end recipes, which are dropped (and likely rare) not bought from the trainer. So not everyone is going to have them, those that do are likely to allready have better gear and consequently it isnt going to be a means of gearing yourself up.</div></div><hr />

And please stop patting WoW on the back for not making the same mistakes that EQ did with their TS system. OF COURSE its better, like all the other things WoW did better, because they had the chance to LEARN from EQs mistakes and failings. <br />

In WoW you can make money from tradeskilling and selling back to vendors, because you get &quot;rewarded&quot; for tradeskilling.  It's not a large amount, but you might get 2% more from a tradeskilled item than just selling its basic components to the vendor.  That system encourages tradeskilling.<br />
. . . is just a license for disaster. MUCH of EQs excess pp was created from loopholes JUST like this. What good is a system where a player can sit there and make pp just buying, clicking, and selling? Come on man, get a grip. There were a couple large-scale plat duping expliots in teh history of EQ, but these types &quot;final TS product sells back for more than the original components&quot; loopholes are responsible for massive chunks of pp flowing into EQ. Mark my words, WoW would do well to close these loopholes NOW, before they thoroughly demolish the economy of that game. If nothing else, experience in EQ has shown us that a market place is a delicate balanced thing, and very difficult to restore to some regular, fair economy if there are loophole like this.<br />
Yes WoW maybe easier in its take minutes to achieve some things but you have to ask do i want to be playing a game for 50 hours a week consuming time which could be used for other purposes, or do I want to play 20 hours and achieve something worthwhile in those hours? WoW allows casual play. <br />
I think the point you are failing to see, the point that will become evident with time, is that that extra 30 hours a week is what kept EQ alive for years instead of months. If you do not have these types of timesinks in a game, then some of the player population will quickly burn through the available content and then become bored at a faster rate. Its really imposible to create a game whose pace of play will satisfy everyone. <br />

That analogy isn't really apt.  Marriages usually aren't for entertainment.  Games are.  If playing a game requires me to be &quot;married&quot; to it, then I don't really want to play that game.  EQ is a broken game that provides little entertainment and it lacks good mechanisms to provide entertainment, and currently WoW is not broken and is entertaining.  If another game comes out that's more entertaining than WoW, then I would expect people to play that instead.<br />
<br />
I've spent about a total of 10 days worth of time in WoW and I have found far fewer errors than I would find in EQ during 10 days worth of play time.  And while I'm only in the beginning half of the game, which has been tested more than the later parts of the game, I still believe this indicates Blizzard has better practices when creating and testing content.  SoE isn't focused on making an enjoyable game anymore, they're focused on not losing customers.  Blizzard set out to make an entertaining game, and so far it has been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">A lot of people talk about these games as games, which technically they are but there are different types of games. MMORPGs are a hobby type game, at least for many players. <br />

And in a hobby you do not expect to have fun all the time, you work for what you want. Someone who takes golf seriously as a hobby might be out at 7 am in the drizzle practicing for hours. Is he having fun? Yeah sorta, but not all the time, in the same way people have fun in EQ, mainly from suffering and striving and trying to improve. People love and hate their hobbies at the same time, be it chess, softball, everquest, golf whatever.<br />
<br />
It's fine for other people to want a game that is just a  game, pick it up, have some passing fun, put it down. But try to understand those who view it more as a hobby, it's a legitimate point of view and approach to it all, and it doesn't involve having fun every minute you are doing it.</div></div><hr />

Not arguing whether SoE or Blizzard is better because frankly I don't care. But I ask you this, how long has the Beta for WoW been going? And how long has the NDA been open in that time. There are people that played from the start of that beta and are continuuing to play, so it is perhaps a suggestion that WoW will be a little more than a honeymoon.<br />

Why not? I'm saying its a better system. Sure they will have learnt from Eqs mistakes and failures but in that they have adopted their own way of doing things, a fair bit involving innovation not copying Everquest.<br />

&quot;I think the point you are failing to see, the point that will become evident with time, is that that extra 30 hours a week is what kept EQ alive for years instead of months&quot;<br />
<br />
In your opinion. However, I believe that eq simply had little competition until now and because it reguarly released expansions ie content. WoW probably won't last as long as eq, as it will have stronger competitors, and it is less of a groundbreaking genre meaning there are a lot of other games in the genre right now.<br />
Additionally because eq has lasted so long does not detract away from what the quality WoW has as a game.</div></div><hr />

Just for clarification, pretty much all tradeskills in WoW require dropped components.  You can't macro going to a vendor, combining, selling, ad infinitum.  At some point you're going to have to go farm up a ton of components.  <br />

Yeah, most of our clerics were drunk or high during raids, because it's the only way to tolerate being a cleric, or any class, on EQ raids.  The ones who weren't drunks, which was mostly the females, left the game when EQ2 and WoW appeared.  Most of the drunks stayed though.  Impaired judgment, I do believe.<br />

The fact that so many of our most necessary class left upon the arrival of a viable alternative to EQ is notable.  We treated our clerics well also, and they still decided to ditch us for WoW and EQ2.  Honestly, if Anguish had been working properly when we entered it, you can bet that far fewer people would have left.  I would have stayed playing EQ if Anguish was raidable when we got there.  It would have been a sign they listened to us at the guild summit.  But true to SoE form, yet another end zone was bugged, untested and untuned.<br />
<br />
I've hated EQ since GoD came out, but I could tolerate playing it.  After seeing another expansion shoved out unfinished it became intolerable and I left.  It's a shame really.  SoE had a chance to redeem themselves and they squandered it.<br />
<br />
The players remaining in EQ are probably 3 types: players whose friends remain in EQ, players who aren't affected by the major flaws in the game, and players who believe they've invested too much time to quit.  I used to be the last type, but I got over it.  I'm glad I did too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">EQ is a broken game that provides little entertainment and it lacks good mechanisms to provide entertainment<br />
<br />
Anyone who can utter these words or can agree with them has to be talking bollocks unless they gave up playing eq at lvl 10.<br />
<br />
Most ppl here loved EQ for its entire time thats why we are on this website with so many discussing epics, quests and issues of concern to our community. EQ gave us all 5yrs+ of fun and enjoyment, with a fair bit of frustration and a wee bit of anger along the way. But its been FUN, when it ceases to be FUN you stop straight away and find something more fun. <br />
<br />
Remember back to EQ start when internet access was a joke for 90% poulation, EQ was built with very limited funds 2 millionish and was expected to have 50,000 ppl playing within the first year. It exceeded expectations with 50,000 ppl in week1. Over 5 yrs it has just shy of 500,000 subcribers, not bad for a game which SOE rejected at first.<br />
<br />
WoW comes out millions ppl now have ADSL or Cable so it more accessable to play from the start, 500,000 on beta you know the game is gonna be huge. The game has been able to take all the faults/pluses, idea from EQ1, SWG, DAoC and add them to its gameplay.<br />
<br />
EQ1 is the King still, as WOW and EQ2 still too new to compete, 12months from now maybe we can say different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Yeah eq is great, I haven't felt immersed in a world in any other game like eq except maybe AC2 but that wore off after about a day.

Neither of the two competitors have fully provided what appealed me to eq.</div></div><hr />

Actually Jeis, EQ had not been FUN for years before I stopped playing it. EQ was turned into a boring timesink, a game that still had the same name as the game I once loved but that was all it had in common with that game.<br />
I stayed because i had friends inside the game and I considered it more of a chatbox with pictures then as a FUN game.<br />
In EQ I had so much time to chat while grouping and raiding because there was so much downtime, in WoW I hardly have time to type because the game is fast. (good thing there is ventrillo)<br />
<br />
But to each his own, IF you still like EQ for what it is then by all means enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Well i'm not prepared to chuck my eq accounts. But 1-20 wow has been alot of fun for me. <br />
<br />
  I like the little things like a ! about a persons head if they are a quest giver. Some may say thats dumbing things down but eq was always to vague to me especially in alot of their quests. In old times if i was in a small town i could ask the inn keeper if anyone needed a hired hand. He could tell me talk to farmer jones. Now farmer jones for us would just have the ! above his head and ? when your completed the quest. <br />
<br />
   The quests in wow have been really fun for me. Great way to keep exping without having to sit your ass down in one spot and kill for 3 hours. Than when i want to just sit down and kill at one spot for 3 hours i can do that also. I just like the quests that arent earth shattering quests but it keeps you moving into new places and keeps you &quot;doing&quot;. Next thing i know ive leveled and made some cash. <br />
<br />
  I do agree with what ive read about grouping skills. Some people are going to be pretty rough to group with later. I grouped up with one other person to finish a quest and it was a bit of a train wreck. I'm to used still to my pally in eq. At lvl 70 with my aa's and group heals. So thats going to take some time. <br />
<br />
   I do wonder if being able to solo throughout will hurt the game in the grouping area in the long run. But the flip side is i dont feel the need to find buffs or multibox because i'm playing at an odd hour. <br />
<br />
Again this is from 1-20 and there is the &quot;new game&quot; smell to it still. But 1-20 have been alot of fun. Even when i first played eq way back i never enjoyed the newbie levels. I always just felt naked and broke. With wow i'm getting equipment and money. Its not pouring in but i dont feel totally gimp to start with either. <br />
<br />
   I do quest in eq and did when i started my original wizard. BUt quests mostly feel like chores in eq. So far in wow they been part of the fun. Shall see what the next 20 levels bring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">One big thing for me, is that I was having all kinds of wierd video/connection problems. I figure it is going to take me a week to get any help, but just in case I log on to Blizzard.com/support/wow... on the main support page is an exact discription of my problem and a fix that takes 15 seconds to apply.<br />
<br />
I am not high level yet (mid teens on all my chars) but I don't feel a need to rush. The quest at the lower levels are FUN, challenging, but not annoying. I have done every quest available (except a couple of the elites) for each of my characters and they have all worked and been enjoyable. So far I have played about every class, and they have all been able to solo well untwinked, and have been a fun and unique experience.<br />
<br />
Here's another HUGE thing. I have 3 systems, one being a high end game system, one being a laptop with an mx440 64mb video card. The game runs well on ALL my systems, and still looks good! The graphics aren't the most state of the art amazing thing ever, but they look good and feel very cohesive... a bit cartoony at first, but they realy work.<br />
<br />
The bottom line for me is that so far I have had more fun in less time with WoW than with EQ and EQ2. After EQ2 my hopes for WoW were not that high, and I did not see me quitting EQ for it, but after a few days of playing, I have found my new mmorpg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Blazz - go back and re-read your posts. Seriously dude.<br />
<br />
If you haven't played WoW - yet come here to vociferously &quot;defend&quot; EQ by making observations about something you haven't even logged in to?<br />
<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
Look at the first 10 posts or so of this thread. What word comes up over and over?<br />
<br />
Fun.<br />
<br />
Say it again. = &gt; FUN &lt; = <br />
<br />
Not &quot;work,&quot; not &quot;grind,&quot; not &quot;camp,&quot; not &quot;farm,&quot; but   fun  .<br />
<br />
By now people should know that WoW is more DAOCish than EQish.<br />
<br />
Want to solo to 60? You can do that.<br />
<br />
Want to group to 60? You can do that.<br />
<br />
Want to quest to 60? Grind to 60? Either one works.<br />
<br />
Want to PvP? You can do that.<br />
<br />
Don't want to PvP? You can avoid it.<br />
<br />
Worried about raiding? Why? If you hated &quot;Ever-raid&quot; then chances are you don't like that anyway.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills? Dunno what you guys are doing - but my buddy the 180 BlackSmith just made me (35 Paladin) a BP that knocked the socks off my former BP and a Helm which was a slight upgrade.<br />
<br />
Drops? Got an upgrade to my 1H Mace (Bash) weapon off of a random MOB in Desolace (Zone on Horde side) today.<br />
<br />
Quests? OH...........MY......GOODNESS.  Awesome, awesome, awesome. LOVE the quests.<br />
<br />
And you know what? I can SEE spell effects in WoW. Not that that side of my brain (artsy-fartsy) is more than shrivelled grey matter - but the logical side said - 'Hmm, interesting.'<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong - I loved EQ. But after four years? (Kunark era created), it got a bit stale.  <br />
<br />
Oh and to people who say WoW has no lore - are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
Warcraft one, Warcraft two, Warcraft three, and to an extent Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
There is TONS of lore in this game.  <br />
<br />
But to go back to the ORIGINAL question: &quot;What is it about WoW&quot;?<br />
<br />
Fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I really have no intention of playing WoW, but like most I'm curious.<br />
<br />
Could someone who is playing it please tell me what is the big deal?  Ultimatly, isn't it the same as EQ, you kill stuff, get phat lewt, explore, do a few quests,  make level, get new spells, rinse, spit, repeat?<br />
<br />
I always considered EQ a chat room with a game wrapped around it.  I assume WoW is the same, just with pretty pictures, and a few new bells and whistles.  In the final annalysis, is it REALLY all that different from EQ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Otani<br />
<br />
But WoW is so much fun.  <br />
<br />
There are no (in my limited experience) needless timesinks, quests are rewarding - with items and xp, and they are also rewarding story-wise.  They make sense.<br />
<br />
On nights when you're busy with other things, you can log in for one hour, finish up a quest, or whatever, and log out and have done something meaningful and fun with your time.  Groups are helpful, but not required.  (Keep in mind my highest character is 24, so that may change soon, I don't know.)<br />
<br />
My character is fully decked out in armor that he made himself.  It's rewarding that way.  Tradeskills are not just some huge timesink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy doing quests.<br />
<br />
I enjoy looking at the little things in the game... like the dwarven mortar team playing games after I delivered a new supply of ammo.<br />
<br />
So far, at no point has it felt like a grind.<br />
<br />
So far, at no point was there some stupid timesink.<br />
<br />
Will those things change at level 20, 30, ... , 60?   I don't know.<br />
<br />
Another huge thing... is that WoW is new.   Just like expansions that re-energize people for EQ... WoW is like a huge new expansion... it's new, it's different, it's exciting.     People want to try it out.  Some will love it, hate it, or just be okay with it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is having more technical problems than  I honestly expected with the servers, but I still enjoy the game a lot.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed EQ a lot in the early days too... until I became bitter by everything taking so long, for no reason... I think epics did that to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Been reading some of the posts, and figured I would add my two cents<br />
<br />
Got to agree...WoW is fun...grouping in Elite instances can rock if your grouped with a bunch of ex-EQ players that know how to play...grouping with B-net kiddies can suck<br />
<br />
Currently at lvl 20, on my Tauren Shaman, and having a blast...<br />
<br />
Look, we all played EQ, and initially, we all loved it and hated it...<br />
<br />
But face it, there are a lot of things in EQ that could have been done better...<br />
<br />
Quests.  Someone, can't remember who exactly was saying that there are worthwhile quests in EQ.  Well, as something of a quest junkie, I sat back and thought about that, and really couldnt think of one quest that did not require a multi-group force that would result in a useable item for the levels required.<br />
<br />
Shawl quest...nope requires at least 2 groups at the level required...<br />
Shaman cudgel quest...same thing...although I do admit I did enjoy the quest<br />
<br />
Epic quests...hmm guild required<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 quests...hmmm..same<br />
<br />
About the only type of quests that didnt require a guild at one point or another either required incredibly long, boring periods of factioning...like the Chardok quests...<br />
<br />
Have played EQ since late beta...although I did take a short hiatus between close of beta and launch...<br />
<br />
Done all tradeskills but tinkering...done pretty much every quest that interested me...<br />
<br />
Leveled one of every class but bard past lvl 60 and have 3 post lvl 65 toons<br />
<br />
Frankly, now when I think about EQ, I really think about two words...'GRINDING &amp; TIMESINKS'<br />
<br />
It seems that aside from the odd bit of exploring when new expansions came out, I was always grinding...grinding levels....grinding aa...grinding faction...grinding @#$@#$# flags...(god I hate the flagging system)<br />
<br />
Even at lower levels you feel that in EQ...especially if your not twinked...<br />
<br />
I havent cancelled my EQ accounts yet...holding them in reserve in case I find that WoW doesnt hold my interest long term...but, after a little over a week of live, I can say that so far WoW has been fun, and I havent felt like I am grinding even once...<br />
<br />
Death has a very minor penalty, but then again face it, when was the last time you died in EQ without your 96 percent rez afterwards...all WoW has done is remove some of the time lost from dieing...<br />
<br />
Oh, and on the tradeskill issue and auction house...yup some nice stuff for auction, but its all  level limited...and while there is the odd-piece that is better than what i can make, there aint much...<br />
<br />
Currently my level 20 shaman can make gear that he can't even wear yet...and its way way way better gear than what I remember crafting for my first EQ character (banded)<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you havent tried WoW out yet and are tired of the mandatory raiding and grinding in EQ...I highly recommend giving it a try.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Faern, I never said WoW wasnt fun, but you, and others, seem to be under the impression that EQ INS'T fun for us, just because it ceased being fun for you. This simply is not true. <br />
<br />
I honeslty think this is a pure case of Apples vs Oranges and I am trying to get people to STOP comparing lvls 1-20 in a brand spanky-new game to lvl 65-70 in a game that is going on 6 years old. They are TOTALLY DIFFERENT. <br />
<br />
I am not denying the fun. My opinion though, is that its a shooting star, and the more I read, the more I truly feel that way. Hey, Diablo 2 was FUN. MAJOR LEAGUE fun man. I played it for HOURS and HOURS and HOURS. I have had TONS of fun in other games too. I have played a LOT of games over the years during my EQ career. My love of EQ is totally unrelated to this FUN. <br />
<br />
And so is you folks and your current love for WoW. Stop comparing them. You cant. They are different games. About the only way EQ and WOW can ever truly be compared is in a few months, when people in WoW are maxxing out their characters, and the questing and soloing loses its &quot;newness&quot;, and everyone in WoW is max level because, as I understand it, its relatively simple to get there, THEN we might POSSIBLY have something to compare in EQ with WoW. <br />
<br />
But right now, its apples and oranges. This gushing is all well and good, but its nothing new. EQ is what it is. WoW is brand new, and has many of the traits that drew most of us into EQ in the first place. Time will tell if it has the power to maintain that level of &quot;fun&quot;, but right now, EQ is &quot;fun&quot;, for me. WoW is . . . different. Who knows, WoW may be the &quot;one&quot; that takes people from EQ and keeps them, in larger numbers than the other games that have tried. Its impossible to tell. But  trust me, when the newness wears off, and folks are runing out of stuff to do, and the leveling is done, and there are very few people with adequate grouping skillls because of the ease of soloing, etc etc etc, then we will see what WoW does, faced with some of teh problems that EQ has been faced with already BECAUSE EQ IS NOT NEW.</div></div><hr />

Let's compare in a year, I'm guessing they will have an expansion out and even us slow leveling non-raiders should have hit cap.  I still say no more than 500K sustained subscribers but I could be wrong given the record breaking sales to this point with Asia/Europe still in the wings.  As awesome as the game is it still suffers the same problems with drawing people to MMORPG's that I outlined in another thread.<br />
<br />

I agree that you can't compare newbie leveling in WoW to end game raiding in EQ, but you can certainly compare WoW to EQ overall- they are both MMORPG's after all. I'm wondering what my crew will do at cap as well but it's far enough off that we should know well in advance if we'll be out of content a la EQ or if we'll have lots of fun stuff to look forward to.  We're playing Alliance so we also have the entire Horde content to go through, not to mention the differing experiences of the various races.<br />
<br />
It's early in the game's lifecycle but the gameplay so far is just so much more... fun.  We'll see if doing instance dungeons over and over gets to be as boring (and useless) as LDoN.  Until then, how soon before I can get back on? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Having finally played WoW for a few days now, I have a more complex opinion of it than I did before.<br />
<br />
1) I think it is a great game and I love the graphics, the graphics remind me of the early eq and kunark graphics, only better, which had a lot of humor in them back then. In recent years EQ has become too serious, it lost its style and humor. EQ became too &quot;professional&quot;. What WoW does is bring back that amateur joy (for lack of a better phrase...). People forget but EQ used to be very stylized and had a lot of humor in it, similar to like WoW does now.<br />
<br />
2) WoW might be doomed by a fatal flaw: overly fast levelling. EQ feels old not only because it is old, but because the average level is high now. It is the average level going up over time that really dates these games and makes them feel old. With ridiculously fast levelling, WoW will age faster than most mmorpgs, it will feel ancient in a year.<br />
<br />
But they could fix that, by making exp slow down a lot post 20 or something. So there's hope, but I'm just saying based on what I've seen so far.</div></div><hr />

Here's the reality of it for me.<br />
<br />
Even if WoW burns out in 30 days, I won't be able to go back to EQ.  It's just too much of a step backwards at this point.  If WoW sputters and crashes I'll have to look at EQ2, or Guildwars, or something new.</div></div><hr />

And I absolutely respect your opinion in that regard and fully understand where its coming from. EQ ran out for you (an a lot of other people). So many people were PRIMED for a game exactly like WoW that its become a frenzy. Great. I bet I would LOVE WoW if I gave it a try. But judging from the things I read here (and other sites I visit), I would love the game . . . then move on, unless they managed to keep the content rolling out to keep pace with my particular playstyle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I played EQ for a LONG time, and tried many other MMOGs. Playing WoW now, my take is this<br />
<br />
1: Combat is fast and furiious, you must pay attention, no pressing autoattack and walking away. Every class has both ranged and Melee skills to use.<br />
<br />
2: Solo Friendly, I like to solo sometimes, and sometimes group, I am not limited in class choice because of this.<br />
<br />
3: Quests, I like doing quests, in EQ it was hard, most times you did not even know if the Quest was doable by you, or what the reward was. In WoW, as has been stated you are only offered quests you can do. and the rewards are always good (even if the Item is not useable by you, they tend to sell well) And quest XP is great. You can make as much or more XP from your quests and from killing the Mobs you need to do them.<br />
<br />
4: Level restricted gear, I like this, cuts twinking down.<br />
<br />
5: Tradeskills, the best thing about WoW Tradeskills is that there are no fails. Either you can make an item, or you do not have the skill yet, the slow down point in tradeskills is gathering the Items needed to craft with.<br />
<br />
5: The look, although the graphics are of a lower Quality than EQ2's, the well rendered, very detailed world around you LOOKS great, trees look like trees, huts like huts, vastly greater work was put into the art than EQ had.<br />
<br />
This is just a small part of what makes WoW better in my view.</div></div><hr />

 One of the most powerful things a raid group can possess is knowledge. That's why we're trying to keep so much of the raid game confidential. We don't want to put a lot of this type of content in the beta<br />

It was listed here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/insider/020/interview.html)<br />
<br />
Apparently there is a good amount of raidable stuff already in WoW, they just didnt want everyone to know how to beat it before they got to it so  a lot of it was tested inhouse. Probably means a little bit of retuning down the road but it's in the game!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">2: Solo Friendly, I like to solo sometimes, and sometimes group, I am not limited in class choice because of this.<br />
One of the things I actually LIKE about EQ is that there is a fairly clear cut path to choose. If you want to solo, there are classes designed to do this. However, they tend NOT to be the &quot;most sought after&quot; classes for many game situations. EQ basically FORCES people to interact. Lots dont like this, but there are many benefits to this system.<br />
3: Quests, I like doing quests, in EQ it was hard, most times you did not even know if the Quest was doable by you, or what the reward was. In WoW, as has been stated you are only offered quests you can do. and the rewards are always good (even if the Item is not useable by you, they tend to sell well) And quest XP is great. You can make as much or more XP from your quests and from killing the Mobs you need to do them.<br />
I just cannot get my hands fully around this concept, honestly. Isnt part of any &quot;game&quot; doing some of the groundwork yourself, be it exploring the quest in-game or doing research on the internet to find out if its a good quest for you? And please, dont start in with the &quot;spoilers suck&quot; arguements, ok? I will start linking WoW quest spoiler sites right now. Well, half the quests anyway, cause the other half are so simple-minded and UN-gamelike that they present almost mo challange whatsoever, and as a result, no feeling of gratification for completing them. But time will tell if this is the type of system that will be sustainable over time. Personally, I dont think it has the meat. <br />
4: Level restricted gear, I like this, cuts twinking down.<br />
There is a certain degree of &quot;twinkability&quot; that is necessary though. And again, as I ahve said before, there is no way you can compare EQ twinking to WoW twinking. After 6 years, re-playability with twinkable gear is ESSENTIAL to the games future success. Its difficult to assess WoWs whole re-playability VIA twink system right now, since its basically all new. But when players reach their level limits, and want to start new characters, and dont want to go through all the stuff thats so fun right now, we will see. <br />
<br />
The games are different. I cannot stress this enough. I continue to see post after post comparing this part of WoW to that part of EQ, etc etc, and its just not a fair or reasonable comparison. There hasnt been NEARLY this much comparison with other competing MMORPGs. Is it because WoW has Elves and Trolls and Shaman and Warriors that we are putting them into the same bin for comparison purposes? 5.75 years vs 3 weeks. Those are the only REAL numbers you need to look at when you start making these comparisons.</div></div><hr />

As far as the mystery rep bumper, by the sounds if it some of the heavy posters on how WoW is changing life as we know it are getting multiple rep bumps.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">And I absolutely respect your opinion in that regard and fully understand where its coming from. EQ ran out for you (an a lot of other people). So many people were PRIMED for a game exactly like WoW that its become a frenzy. Great. I bet I would LOVE WoW if I gave it a try. But judging from the things I read here (and other sites I visit), I would love the game . . . then move on, unless they managed to keep the content rolling out to keep pace with my particular playstyle.<br />
<br />
I really don't have any fear of running out of things to do in WoW anytime soon.  Although some people may race to 60, as in EQ, they will miss out on a ton of content and fun.  If they then get bored at 60, well, it's their own fault.  However, with the PvP and raid options in the late game, I doubt anyone will find themselves without something worthwhile to do.  <br />
<br />
For an example of a raid event, take a look at this in game video of a raid encounter with Onyxia the dragon.  Not to spoil it, but at 65% health she goes airborne and pulls a few tricks out of her hat.  Enjoy, I know I will be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I really have no intention of playing WoW, but like most I'm curious.<br />
<br />
Could someone who is playing it please tell me what is the big deal?  Ultimatly, isn't it the same as EQ, you kill stuff, get phat lewt, explore, do a few quests,  make level, get new spells, rinse, spit, repeat?<br />
<br />
I always considered EQ a chat room with a game wrapped around it.  I assume WoW is the same, just with pretty pictures, and a few new bells and whistles.  In the final annalysis, is it REALLY all that different from EQ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Otani<br />
<br />
I didn't read the other posts in this thread...but going to the original question...<br />
<br />
For me the difference is in the implementation.  Gaming in WoW generally moves faster because combat is faster and what you need to do to complete an activity is more obvious.  For example, you don't need to hunt around to find a quest giver, then hunt around for exactly what they are linked to...in WoW the quest givers are marked and they tell you what they want and roughly where to get it.  It doesn't mean it's easy to get...just that you know where and what to do.<br />
<br />
Also, I hated tradeskills in EQ, but the WoW implementation is a lot of fun for me.  It's fairly obvious what's needed and what the rewards will be for doing X.  It doesn't take 50 combines to get a skillup...usually just a few.  (initially, usually just 1)  Yes, I still have to go out and get the tradeskill items, but I can normally do that as part of questing.<br />
<br />
The one part I think EQ does better is the chat system.  In particular, I really like the bit about having 1 chat window per person you're talking to...hopefully WoW will add a similar option at some point.   ;)   <br />
<br />
If all you want is a chat box with a game wrapped around it, EQ is as good or better than WoW...if you want a game in addition to a chat box, WoW is better - at least the portion I've seen...I don't know what it'll be like after hitting lvl 60 since I'm not even close now.<br />
<br />
Of course, all of this is IMHO. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Sorry, but I have zero interest in PvP. I avoided DAoC for just that reason, and I've avoided every other game that featured PvP significantly.

Playing WoW and it is fun....since that is the only reason i play games then WoW it is and later EQ......enjoyed my time in EQ but the days of sitting for 4 hours hoping to get the mob, then hoping it dropped the loot and then hoping to win the roll for it is just not fun.....WoW may lose its appeal as well; don't know but i DO know that EQ has lost all appeal for me....<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">EQ basically FORCES people to interact. Lots dont like this, but there are many benefits to this system.<br />
<br />
That's an interesting question. It's true that WoW doesn't require you to group, but there are significant benefits to grouping once you get to a certain level.<br />
<br />
Let's review where WoW items come from. First, you can loot them from random mobs. Second, you can buy them from vendors, who actually have fairly decent stuff for the level, which is somewhat affordable.  Third, you can buy droppable items at the Auction Houses (automated Bazaars with some catches attached to them). Fourth, you can tradeskill yourself, which comes naturally as you level up, or buy tradeskill items from other players. Fifth, there are NO DROP items in instanced dungeons suitable for one group. Sixth, there are quest rewards. And, of course, there is raid content, but we haven't really seen it yet.<br />
<br />
Of all the options available to you, quest rewards and the NO DROP gear in instanced zones is generally best, from what I have seen. And you usually need a group to finish Elite quests or go into instanced zones at the level when the rewards are still good. Similarly, if you try to do regular non-instanced dungeons, which tend to have named mobs and better loot, you will need to be grouped if you want to get the gear at the level when it will benefit you. Remember, almost all gear is level-limited, so wiping out a level 10 dungeon when you are level 20 won't help you much since by that time you will be able to get better items elsewhere.<br />
<br />
So yes, grouping is optional, but it tends to get you better equipment for the level and you also get to see more of the game content. Soloing is still eminently viable and there are many quests with decent rewards for soloers, but groping is encouraged, just not mandatory.<br />
<br />
Also, it's not quite true that the death penalty is inconsequential. Sure, if you die outdoors, you lose a few minutes of game time and a few silver pieces to repair the armor, no big deal. However, if you die in an instanced dungeon and you don't have a rezer on hand, the penalty is substantially higher.<br />
<br />
Overall, it looks like WoW and EQ have similar risk-vs-reward structure, it's just that the WoW one is more flexible and differently tuned. So far, I am liking the WoW model better, but we will see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I dont give a dingo's kidney about VP faction with Yella, we only went there once to check it out after the revamp. Didnt need faction to get in as far as I could see. And with Mok, who might actually use the quest items, all I did was sit him in a room in quenos overnight with pooch on guard. The next day he was max faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">One thing that Blizzard and Vivendi (sheesh - nearly wrote Verant there) messed up on is their release schedule outside the US. I think Gunderson was right - EQ could have been in line for a huge hit this side of the pond if both EQII and WoW were out. As it is only EQII is out over here (here being Europe btw), which I don't think Sony will be too worried about &quot;losing&quot; EQ bucks to. WoW doesn't arrive until February (current expected live date at some of the preorder partners listed on Blizzard's site).<br />
<br />
It looks very much like to counteract the loss of potential revenue, Blizzard and Vivendi are releasing preorder packs with guaranteed Beta access. However, since you can't charge someone for a Beta (not if you want to have a successful product anyways - nothing like ripped off consumers pissed at you to ruin a good thing), its not exactly money in the bag for them.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm looking forward to WoW (am set on a tauren shaman I think), but I have to say the quiet over on AB has its uses. I'm leader of a small family type guild that's been around since the server opened. To combat the loss of people to big guilds head hunting to replace lost members several small guilds banded together to run Allied raids (progression, epic 1.5s). There are bad days when its hard to scrape together even an xp group but in general the new lack of raiders means more mobs up.</div></div><hr />
