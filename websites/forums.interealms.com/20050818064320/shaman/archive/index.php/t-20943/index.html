Hes a bloody druid! no wonder were getting nothing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Brenlo is a spokeperson. His decision powers are strickly limited to some discretion in what he tells players or report to the devs.<br />
<br />
For that matter, he probably doesn't report to the devs directly but to a project manager of sort... ain't corporations grand?<br />
<br />
While he could possibly decide to redact every mention of shaman problems from what he reports, that would matter not if the devs themselves had any interest in our class. And, honestly, I don't think Brenlo pays enough attention to us to do this.<br />
<br />
There is no big conspiracy here, no druid or cleric bent on revenge against the all-hated shamans. Just run-of-the-mill inattention, mild incompetence and Peter's Principle in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brenlo said he plays a shaman ... to about level 52 or so I think he said, and I believe as part of that he also tried to empathize with us that he understood the shaman class since he's played it.<br />
<br />
In my own opinion, a shaman at level 52 or so is pretty nice.  Especially with a JBB and a horse.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if most of the SOE employees - especially the customer service types have played every class out there, at least into the mid 40s or 50s so they can get a feel for the class.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily feel that playing a shaman to level 52 in and of itself qualifies you to be able to make assumptions about shaman's functionality and desireability in the level 65+ game, but that's not my job.<br />
<br />
I don't think Brenlo has anything &quot;against&quot; one class or another, and I don't think comparing one class to another is any more useful than pointing at an orange and a pear and saying &quot;hey, this one's orange and segmented inside and that one has a core&quot;... you can't compare the two, and they're not meant to be.<br />
<br />
What you can say is - HEY!  That orange gets squished flat and all it's innards explode all over the patio every time I step on it - before anyone can even get any real use out of it.  Is that how it's really supposed to work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, first off Brenlo has no decision as to what the devs look at and what they change, he is simply the liaison betweeon the devs and the EQ community.<br />
<br />
Second, it was pretty clearly stated at the FF why Shamans are still considered so powerful in GoD by a statement from Rytan, &quot;The Spell Guy&quot; along the lines of, &quot;5% slow is still very significant in GoD.&quot;  This was then followed up later during a response to a different question, &quot;Nobody likes long fights anyway.&quot; which basically means Shaman are SOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Nobody likes long fights anyway.&quot;<br />

Shaman do ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5% sint a big difference. i wish Rytan would understand that. Sure, you can say omgzor, a shaman slowed mob deals 20% less dps. But when its... 500dps chanter slowed and 400 dps shaman slowed, and dies 6 seconds faster due to chanter pet... really the chanter is MORE effective at preventing damage. Mobs die so fast, that a few hundred dps difference is barely the price of a heal.<br />
<br />
DoTs and Hots are a joke. There are no new long fights, and we suck at short ones. Of course, they cant balance us for short fights, because it would imbalance all long battle encounters. That drew a lot of derisive laughter from the crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason they ignore balance requests is because we continue to pay them money.  If they continue to make money, they have no legitimate reason from a purely greed perspective to change one iota of the game.  Capitalism at its most Machiavellian.<br />
<br />
Oh, on another note, it's pretty obvious that Brenlo is incompetent.  I knew this from the moment I saw the &quot;What's a shaman?&quot; quote.  Rarely does insulting your customer result in an increase in sales.<br />
<br />
PS I know people are quitting their shaman (I'm one of them, although I quit for a beastlord first then quit due to boredom) as well as other classes, but until it really starts to affect the bottom line, I hold with my first couple sentences.</div></div><hr />

Some people can't take a joke, which is why he doesn't visit the EQ community boards very often.  If he wasn't immediately labeled as incompetent for not doing a job that isn't his in the first place, maybe the situation wouldn't be so bad.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo never said that.  That quote was posted by some guy named -Evil-Robot-Arvor.  Pull your panties out of your butt and find a better reason to gripe.</div></div><hr />

People can take jokes but a customer relationsperson should not make a joke to a very upset customer.<br />

Hes the community relations representative, its his job to visit us and try to placate us in order to keep the companies bottom line intact. Posting insanely assinine drivel and pissing off sony's customer base (costumers =$$) means hes not doing the job he was assigned very well. Sure its a ****ty gig when the devs are clueless, but its possible to do it and do it well nonetheless. Brenlo however doesn't do his job well, as evidenced by the types of posts he responds to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brenlo probably plays nothing but a ranger, but as a spokesperson he needs to be quoted saying he plays every class so that the morons can say &quot;oh well Brenlo plays my class and he is the King Balancer so we must be balanced!&quot;</div></div><hr />

well its good to see the shaman sence of humour is still on fire... <br />
way to go ---- face, the whole thing was ment to make you smile not make those storm clouds worse.</div></div><hr />

You go, poopy head!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get over it. Brenlo is actually doing what he is supposed to. He has the devs looking into it in earnest. What more do you expect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ahem, that kind of put-down isn't acceptable jeyche.  This isn't that kind of message board, consider yourself reported.</div></div><hr />
