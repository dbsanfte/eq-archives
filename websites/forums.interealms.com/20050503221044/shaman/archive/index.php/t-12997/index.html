<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I am in some serious need of help. I duel box a 58 shaman and 57 monk with 18 aa. He is well equiped and tanks for me in the CYs in PoD with no problem. This gives me a good idea that my monk can tank and he does some great DPS. I was wondering where my shaman and monk could farm? I am beyond broke. I am out of virtue and kei money. I need alot of money for 60 spells, SoFW, and other things for my monk and shaman. I cant kill in PoG like I use to since the nerf : ( so I have no idea where to go or what to do? I have thought about the emp in seb but having no rogue will be a pain. UP has also come to mind but might not be a steady source for plat. Any ideas on where I can go with my 2 for some good plat would be nice. Thx!!! Sorry for typos really sleepy and drained of all energy..</div></div><hr />
