<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I did a search, but couldn't find my answer.<br />
I heard from some people that slowing again and again a mitigating mob increases the final slow %.<br />
Lately, I heard it wasn't the case.<br />
On BoT nameds, I always threw 3 to 4 slow thinking it was slowing it harder each time. So, my question is:<br />
Did I burn mana for nothing or was it a good thing ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If a mob mitigates slow, and you slap Turgurs on it once, that's as slow as it's going to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and dont listen to the morons who will tell you that any slow is good enough, <br />
<br />
the mobs mitigate slow, i.e. your best slow is still the best one to cast. I had some retard telling me to bust out my lowest lvl slow because the mob could only be slowed 20% and that one would cover it...thats not how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">kk ;) too bad I wasted mana trying to slow over and over so :D Thx for the answers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe mitigation mitigates your slow by a percentage, rather than having a slow &quot;cap&quot;.  I could be totally wrong here, but I am just putting out what seems to make sense (or else everyone would just use their lowest slow, and BL's slow would be as effective as shamans on mitigating mobs).<br />
<br />
So it would look like this:  you cast a 75% slow, and the mob mitigates it by, say, 70%.  your left with a slow of 22.5%.<br />
<br />
Now if your little beastlord buddy were to slow the same mob with a 65% slow, and the mob mitigates by 70%, effectively, the beastlord would be landing a 19.5% slow.<br />
<br />
I believe this is the reason why everyone complains about slow mitigation.  On a non-mitigating mob we have a 10% differenceon our slow, though this is actually a misnomer...  our slow landing at 75% makes the mob swing at 25% of their current attack speed.  BL's 65% slow makes the mob swing at 35%.  the difference between a mob swinging at 25 vs 35 is actually roughly 28.5%.  that's a significant difference in damage output.<br />
<br />
Now back to that mitigating mob...<br />
Though the 3% difference in slows scales up just like the 10% did, its a HUGE difference.  Ever learn the dramatic effects of compound interest?  Well, lets just say with a mitigating mob, your interest is not compounding nearly as much.<br />
<br />
Now you have the shaman slowed mob (slowed by 22.5%) swinging at 77.5%, and the BL mob (slowed by 19.5%) swinging at 80.5%.  Believe it or not, this is only a difference of 3.8% in actual damge output.<br />
<br />
To make a long story longer, lets say you all were fighting a mob that pumped out about 8,000 dps per minute (just pulling this number out of a hat here).  If it was a non-mitigating mob, the difference between the shaman's slow and the bl's slow would be 2280hps of your MT, saved every minute.<br />
<br />
However, on a mitigating mob, the same 8000 swinger slowed by a shaman instead of a beastlord is only hitting your tank for 304 less damage a minute.  A VERY trivial amount.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I believe that is how slow mitigation works, and why it really screws us in comparison to others who also have slow.  If I messed up at any point in my math (or with my general assumption) please feel free to correct me (I am a troll after all).</div></div><hr />

<br />
- The EQ game I play, that 10% of slow difference results in 10% more damage done compared to the unslowed mob DPS. There is no &quot;misnomer&quot;. No conspiracy theory. No black magic.<br />
<br />
I posted this to another guy who was lacking parsing experience and basic knowledge about shaman slow. The test was done with Togor (aka Enchanter slow) and Tugur. Same logic can be applied to Beastlord slow and the endresult is going to be 10% extra damage soaked. Not &quot;significant&quot; damage output, just 10% more.<br />
<br />
I ran a few tests his morning, basically 6 tankings of the mist panther in WL, 2 x Togored, 2 x Tugured and 2 x Unslowed. Level 61 or 62 mob, hits like a sissie. Had no AC buffs whatsoever, no AGI either. Each test lasted 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
The average of the two tests were as follows:<br />
<br />
Unslowed damage: 38278, DPS: 31.98, AVG Dam: 77.64, Accuracy: 53.41%<br />
Tugured(75%) damage: 9916, DPS: 8.25, AVG Dam: 78.80, Accuracy: 54.15%<br />
Togored(70%) damage: 12162, DPS: 10.19, AVG Dam: 79.49, Accuracy: 54.24%<br />
<br />
The difference between Togor and Tugur is 2246 damage. This 2246 damage is 5.8676% of the total 38278 damage. Now that's pretty close to 5%. And if I wouldn't lose my sanity of pure boredom or if I would install a macro program, I could do parses over hours of time and that will also show the same endresult. PS: No I won't do that.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you take 8.25 DPS as baseline for comparison, 10.19 DPS is 23.15% more. Now that's pretty close to 20%. So, again, both ways of looking at slow are correct. BUT, at the end of the day, I only had to soak an extra 5% damage compared to unslowed total damage. Don't forget the DPS values are perfectly inline with % that many posters pointed out in this thread. 8.25/31.98 does give the DPS % people were poiting out: 25.7973% and Togor: 10.19/31.98 is 31.8626%. Both values extremely close to 25% and 30%, shaman slow and enchanter slow.<br />
<br />
If you still don't beleive it, go parse it yourself.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It depends on what you mean by &quot;more damage&quot; or &quot;less damage&quot;.  <br />
<br />
You're saying that a 65% slowed mob does 35% of its full unslowed damage output and a 75% slowed mob does 25%, which is true, if a bit obvious.<br />
<br />
He's saying that a 75% slowed mob does 28.5% less damage than a 65% slowed mob, which is true.  (.35-.25)/.35.  Your own numbers reflect this as well: (12162-9916)/12162 = .1846, or 18.5% difference, pretty close to the 20% difference in damage output you'd expect between a 70% and a 75% slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">parse is too small to tell anyone anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you weissblau, that's exactly what I was trying to say.  <br />
<br />
A Mob slowed by a Shaman is doing 28.5% less damange to it's target than a mob slowed by a BL.<br />
<br />
I'll bust the same theory out on the shaman Vs. Chanter slow so we can compare it to your parses (mind you I am in no way partial to this, I just pulled this idea out of my theoretical a** but mathematically it makes perfect sense).<br />
<br />
Shaman slowed mob is swinging at 25% of it's normal attack rate, whereas the enchanter mob is swinging at 30% of it's normal attk rate.  A mob swinging at 25% of it's former attack rate is doing aprox. 16.7% less damage to the target than a mob swinging at 30% of it's normal attack rate.  your parses actually show this number to be higher (though your claiming its still only a 10% difference).<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point was refering to mitigating mobs.  Lets go back to my example of a 70% mitigating mob.  The shaman slow is only slowing this mob at 22.5% (75% slow at 30% of it's normal effectivness).  The enchanter slow is slowing the same mob at 21%.<br />
<br />
This means said mitigating mob is swinging at 77.5% when slowed by the shaman, and swinging at 79% when slowed by the chanter.  This actually means that the damage a mitigating mob is doing to it's target is only reduced by 1.9% when slowed by a shaman rather than an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advice is to avoid using actual numbers at ALL costs when deciding what to do in the game.  If your slow overwrites the other ones... yours was better.  If your group/raid was doing fine before yours, then maybe you don't need to bother in the future if you don't want to.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Hauling out the numbers and parsers and all that leads to headaches, rather cyclical arguements, and fluffing of post counts while making possible enemies if the arguement goes sour.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The game seems to usually know it's own mechanics (usually) so if one thing overwrites another... the second was the better one to use.</div></div><hr />

- Exactly. You can portray slow in two different ways. Both are correct. My points was that the end of the day, the extra damage you soak, it's far beyond &quot;significant&quot;. I wanted to point that out before some of people jump on the &quot;shaman is perfectly balanced look at his 20% better slow&quot; bandwagon.</div></div><hr />
