<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can we get a new &quot;Help me with my gear &quot; forum ?<br />
<br />
Since it has been about a week since the boards were wiped and upgraded I scanned back the 5 pages to see how many of these types of posts there were.<br />
<br />
~6.5% of all posts to the general forum were &quot;gear help&quot; posts since the board was wiped. <br />
<br />
I am not sure about the community as a whole but I know a good number are getting really tired of seeing 2-3 of these a day get posted to the general forum.<br />
<br />
If these show up just start moving them to the new forum,<br />
<br />
Comments?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah sounds good but I think that no one would use it... especially the people who come here for 1 or 2 posts...</div></div><hr />
