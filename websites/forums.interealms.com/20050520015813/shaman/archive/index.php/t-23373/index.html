<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Four L54s get an EC collection adv.(not hard, just regular), and proceed to the Halls of War dungeon.  <br />
<br />
Right at zonein there is an intersection, so we pac a mob ahead and pull &quot;a beaten laborer&quot; to the left, with the L54 SK doing the pulling.  Immediately, the SK gets hit with a Ice DD for 1100, another 1100, and then 968.... &quot;loading, please wait.&quot;  The Beaten Laborer was doing some casting, but there is also a message that &quot;a Thrashing Slave looks nervously around.&quot;  Other members zoned out but we went back and got a different adv, needless to say.<br />
<br />
*** !!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
We are Level Fifty Fooking Four!!  How do we take 3K damage in like a tick or maybe two??  Is something broken or is there some tactic that we are missing?<br />
<br />
If you have encountered these Ice based DD spells for 1100 and have overcome them (if cold resists, how high are yours to resist it, or maybe pulling with nulify magic, or maybe avoid that leg of the dungeon, or some other tactic??).  Maybe its specific to just Halls of War.  BTW, I have looked up a Beaten Laborer and there is no mention of him casting a 1100 damage spell.<br />
<br />
Please don't just speculate.  I would love to hear from those of you who have experienced the spell in Halls of War and overcome it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response and help.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like he was casting ice comet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=732&amp;source=Test), which is a lvl 49 wizard spell.  It's rough, but at lvl 54, it's very possible that it'll get cast on you.  Sounds like you just got unlucky to see all 3 hit at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably agro'd two casters you couldn't see and all decided ice comment would be nice for you. <br />
<br />
I think I was 51 or so first time I rand up against ice comet in the vampire castle in TM. Not fun when you've only got 2k buffed hp. All I can suggest is resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He...isnt that what the boss at the end of Dalnir used to cast? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember when they revamped mobs to cast the higher level spells, previous to that they cast a lot lower than their level.<br />
<br />
I nearly fainted the first time I got hit by an Ice Comet in Sebilis instead of one of the 500 or so hp nukes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for suggestions.  My SK will up his cold resistances which I hope helps.<br />
<br />
Also, will need to pac my way left to try to not aggro more than one at a time.  Also, will get a HOT just before pulliing just in case...<br />
<br />
Sk plays with about 3200HPs buffed, so can take ONE ice comet, but certaiinly not THREE.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replies....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just as a further note, halls of war is a VERY difficult zone to break - probably the hardest initial break of any LDoN. While playing my monk, that and Arena of Chance are the two zones that I just groan at when I see them on zone-in.</div></div><hr />

Lickety - bam boom.<br />
<br />
Let's avoid THOSE days please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Much HATE for arena of chance, got that as my first ldon hard the other night and was not very happy. I've done that zone a lot and its never fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If i'm remembering the zone correctly halls of war is the one that has the 4way looking intersection right by zone in there. It can be a real pain to initially split. I think we've gotten 6 or 7 on our first pull there before. I'd say it was probably just 4 ice comets from 3 aggroed wizzy's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, Halls of War is a real pain in the butt.  You are guaranteed more or less unless you've got a paxer to get 3 or four on initial pull.  You had two named apparently right there at zone in nuking the hell out ofyou too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The point about IC being a major pain at that level is certainly true. Heck, I am not a big fan of it at 65. It is also true that this ZI is one of the worst in all of LDON. One tactic for breaking this zone that seems to work for some people is to train a few of mobs to the ZI and zone out, leaving a FD there if at all possible. Then have the FDer notify you that all but 1-2 mobs have left the ZI area and go back in. A fast connection helps.<br />
<br />
However, you said that the SK was doing the pulling. Did he use pet pulling? I think the agro range is small enough to enable you to fight a single mob at the ZI without agroing the rest of the intersection population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When you zone in have everybody stay back near the door.  In my opinion the easiest way to break the intersection is to pull the left most mob once the wanderer goes to the far right of the intersection.  This will only bring 1 or 2 mobs max.  I do need to remind you the key is keeping the group back near the door because anybody takes a step near the right rock you gonna get all of them.  I have perfectly pulled it a couple times and the times it wasnt perfect somebody just had to see what was going on and pulled them all.</div></div><hr />
