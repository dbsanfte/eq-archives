<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jargurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where are the new components for the research spells dropping more frequently? What level mobs are they tending to drop off if they drop in any zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sticky thread in the general forum Anyone know where to find these research components? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11628)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont know about other servers, but on Inny, the new concept of research hasnt produced an influx of rare spells.  I have seen a hand full of Words,Runes, and other needed componients for sale in the bazaar and those items now sell for 2-8k.  I saw one Word selling for 8k.  Thats nuts.  I think there needs to be an increase in componient drops.<br />
The spells themselves are still just as rare.<br />
<br />
Do sub 61 spells still drop off the mobs they used to?  If so, then researched spells would be a nice addition to the current flow of spells, but if they removed them from the drop tables and made them research only, then I think they have just made the spells more rare them before.</div></div><hr />
