This guide is written to help you, the consumer, who is henceforth assumed to be an armchair warrior and all-around annoyance amateur, create an EverQuest character that will annoy, to no end, a good portion, if not the vast majority or even entirety, of the EverQuest population. Herein you will learn the tips and tricks used by the pros of Assholism, to wreak havoc, invoke fury, and bring out the unbridled You'd-swear-it-was-coming-from-God-Himself wrath from even the sweetest housewife.<br />
<br />
By following these simple steps, we guarantee 100% sadistic satisfaction as you utterly destroy the enjoyment and accomplishments of others, and degrade the morale of the gaming community as a whole. Yes, even you can single-handedly become a center of attention for as many as *6 entire weeks* on the famed Flame Boards of your local server's forums.<br />
<br />
This volume is specifically geared to pissing people off as a DRUID. Let's get you started making your character before we move into what you will actually do to ravage the fragile balance of fair play and happiness.<br />
<br />
Make a druid, a halfling druid. Everyone hates halflings, so simply by clicking &quot;halfling,&quot; and then &quot;druid&quot; you have already pissed off approximately 70% of the server and convinced a full 98% of the server that you wanted to take the easy way to 65. Whether or not this is true makes no difference, as the mindset of the average drone is easily manipulated, and after all, we want to make them mad anyway.<br />
<br />
So you have your halfling druid, but you're not done. No, there is far more you can do to cause annoyance among the general population. You can still give your druid an annoying name. The trick here is to name your character something &quot;druidy,&quot; but extremely cliche. Therefore, you want your halfling druid to be named something that references either their halfling heritage, their druidic caste, or even better, BOTH. So pick a name that has one or more of the following in it: Leaf, Wolf, Feet, Pie, Picnic, Tree, Run, Frolick, Grove, Copse, Bush, Knoll, Shrubbery, or anything of the sort. If you want to not only annoy but also confuse your victims, put something elven into their name. A halfling druid named &quot;Tunareswolf&quot; is guaranteed to really screw with people's heads before ultimately inducing &quot;beet-red-with-gritted-teeth syndrome.&quot; If you want to be simple yet annoying, pick a phonetic spelling of druid.<br />
<br />
However, this only takes care of your first name; upon reaching level 20, your character will be eligible for a surname. This must be chosen carefully and with great planning as to induce further anger and fury in your victims. When choosing a surname, obviousness, stupidity, and blatant asininity are your friends. Pick a surname that has something to do with being a druid - &quot;portingforplat,&quot; &quot;taxicabforhire,&quot; and &quot;willsowfordough,&quot; are all fine examples of surnames. As a general rule, when choosing a surname be sure to contain at least one of the following: sow, plat, port, taxi, dot, snare, root, nuke, damageshield, or anything of the sort which deals with your innate strengths as a druid. For added effect, add some of the suggested parts for first names onto your surname; for example, &quot;wolffeetportsforplat&quot; or &quot;picniceatingsnaredoter.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, now you have a halfling druid and your name is set, with a surname already in mind for that &quot;fateful&quot; day when you ding level 20 from quad-kiting hapless animals (this will be covered more below). The next step is to assign your bonus points. As a druid, everyone &quot;knows&quot; that Strength and Dexterity are your most important stats, so be sure to put half of your points in each. The important thing here is to always brag about these two stats any time you happen to group, making sure to let people know that you assigned your points this way to ensure that you could melee with the best of them. More on this later.<br />
<br />
Now that you actually have your character created, here's how you get started wreaking havoc on the masses:<br />
<br />
Levels 1-10: TRAIN PRACTICE AND BEGGING<br />
<br />
You don't lose your equipment, cash, or exp when you die below level 10, so while you're getting these first few levels, practice &quot;accidentally&quot; aggroing large groups of monsters and running them to the guards. If there are other newbies in the zone, make sure you run right past them, using the /shout channel to shout &quot;HEPL,&quot; HLEP,&quot; or some other misspelling of the word. This will no doubt invoke furious wrath from the victim(s), who will likely send you your very first hate tells! Get used to these, and cherish them (or better yet, screenshot or log them) – these are what your druid was born for. To add insult to injury, make sure to tell the offended person that you just bought the game, and that you're practicing before you start playing the level 65 druid you bought on Playerauctions.com. Better yet, ask them for advice on how to quad kite, especially if they're a melee.<br />
<br />
Make sure at some point to stop in the Plane of Knowledge, and spam a request for platinum, old gear, or spells in /ooc, /shout, and /auction for at least 3 minutes. If someone yells at you, tell them your account was hacked and your items/loot was all stolen; pathetic attempts at garnering sympathy will really rile up the masses.<br />
<br />
While in PoK, make sure to send tells to every level 65 druid asking if they have old gear in their bank that they don't need. Offer them your Bread Cakes and Skins of Milk in exhange for some. If you come home empty handed, you'll have to do it the hard way –TWINKING.<br />
<br />
Levels 11-20: RUTHLESSLY SLAUGHTERING WILDLIFE<br />
<br />
Never gain experience by killing undead, evil NPCs, or monsters if you can help it. Instead, kill any and all animals you see, even if they're green. This will really annoy the &quot;true&quot; tree-huggers who role-play that their druids and rangers actually respect and protect nature. If they yell at you, simply argue that you need their pelts to work up tailoring so you can tailor phat lewts, or that you need the meat to work up your baking skills.<br />
<br />
Quad-kite animals in front of other people if you can. If you get non-animal adds, quad kite through other people and try to pawn the mobs off on them. This is the meat and drink of being an ******* druid, so practice it early and often; this is what you'll be doing for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
Levels 21-30: GROUPING<br />
<br />
Spend levels 21-30 grouping with other people if you can for maximum exposure and hate. Brag about your high Strength and Dex. Say &quot;oom&quot; and then go melee. Snare the mobs right away and run around yelling, &quot;TAUNT YOU SUK WARRIOR&quot; and &quot;GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF.&quot; Don't cast SoW on the others unless they ask. Don't cast regen on them at all. If they ask for it, tell them you don't have that spell, even after casting it on yourself. If they call you on it, tell them you thought it was self-only, then cast it on everyone except the guy who asked. If he asks again tell him you already gave it to him and he must have clicked it off like a n00b.<br />
<br />
Remember, if the group breaks up on account of you, this is a good thing. If the people try to harbor a grudge next time you try to group with them, tell them it was your little brother playing your account without permission last time.<br />
<br />
Levels 31-40: GOD OF THE GREAT PLAINS<br />
<br />
Quad-kite and solo exclusively in the 30s, but do so in open sight of everyone who's grouped. Make sure to kite over, under, around, and through them from time to time just to keep them on their toes. If they complain, tell them to move. If they kill the mobs, accuse them of KSing and /petition. The Overthere is a great zone for this as the appearance of the Dragoons at night will let you execute maximum trainage.<br />
<br />
When you're bored of soloing, make sure you sit in the PoK and spam /ooc, /shout, and /auction with offers to port anywhere for donations.<br />
<br />
Levels 41-50: THE DREADLANDS<br />
<br />
These levels are easy. Turn yourself into a wolf, get in a group, snare and put one DoT on each monster. If you get asked what you're doing, tell the group you're DoTing the mob. Most people are dumb enough to think that's a lot of work. As with the earlier levels, don't SoW, Share Wolf Form, Regen, DS, or HP buff unless specifically asked. If the group becomes too demanding, complain about the slow exp and that you're going to go quad kite somewhere. Then quad-kite right in front of your old group, making sure to run through them if you &quot;need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
As with previous levels, make sure you sit in the PoK and spam /ooc, /shout, and /auction with offers to port anywhere for donations.<br />
<br />
Levels 51-60: THIS ZONE IS CAMPED<br />
<br />
Port out to Cobalt Scar, and immediately call Camp Check. Ignore whatever is called and start quad-kiting anything that moves. If you get in trouble, pawn the mobs off on others. If someone KS's, yell at them in /shout, post flames about how gimp they are on the forums, and /petition them. If someone says they were camped there first, tell them there are no camps in EQ. If someone else comes and infringes on your mobs, tell them the whole cliff is camped. Train them multiple times if necessary, and claim it was because of lag.<br />
<br />
As with previous levels, make sure you sit in the PoK and spam /ooc, /shout, and /auction with offers to port anywhere for donations.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 61-65: EASY STREET RUNS THROUGH POV<br />
<br />
You've finally made it, and this is where it pays off. If you actually get tired of quad kiting monsters that can't summon and can't cast spells, join a group. Joining a group actually maximizes your ability to annoy others, and here's how. Snare all pulls immediately, and run around screaming for the tanks to taunt and yelling for help. As soon as the tank establishes aggro, begin chain nuking and then repeat the running around and bitching at the tank part. After about 4 or 5 mobs, when the group starts yelling at you to stop pulling aggro, this is when you will truly begin to shine. Tell them, &quot;ok sorry&quot; and stop doing it. Stop doing anything altogether. Miss a few snares and tell them &quot;sorry lag,&quot; or &quot;sorry, in tell hell.&quot; You'll be surprised how mad a group can get at a freeloader who does nothing, yet most groups won't do anything about the person. If they really start to get ticked (i.e., your plan works too well), start snaring the mobs but claim you're getting resists on your nukes and DoTs.<br />
<br />
If you have trouble getting groups, train people until they start to leave and spots open up.<br />
<br />
Ask for a Camp Check, especially in PoV, every 2 minutes. Say in /ooc &quot;moving to [x camp]&quot; where [x camp] = whatever camp was either first or last, mix it up for fun. When they start yelling &quot;no [x camp] is camped&quot; in reply, wait a minute and then ask if they have room for you. If they say no, ask for a camp check again. If they are nasty about it, train them, and ask if they have room for you while everyone is being killed.<br />
<br />
If you have your epic, click it on people. When they yell at you, tell them it's supposed to be casting SoW on them. If they continue to yell at you, tell them the guy you bought the account from swore the sword cast SoW.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, IMPROVISE. There's plenty of material not included herein, and combinations of these schemes can cause massive attrition in the server population for hours or even days as people go to see their psychiatrists or priests. And remember, if anyone has the audacity to yell at you or call you a noob, threaten to KS them, quad kite their mobs, or better yet, quad kite their mobs through them and get them killed.<br />
<br />
When you've finally become bored of annoying people as a druid, it will be time to make a necromancer.</div></div><hr />
