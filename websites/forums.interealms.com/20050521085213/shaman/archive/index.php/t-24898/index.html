<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like some, because I am one.  About the only thing I've figured out so far is that there's a ton of gear and items to be had on the newbie starter island, and all my characters need to do most of those quests.<br />
<br />
Any info that will save time or pain (other than out and out spoilers) from you beta folks now that the NDA isn't an issue will be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If someone has the location of the 3 items the Gnome asks for (Regarding his fathers boat) I would sure appreciate that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is the gnome quest, the feather quest, the shell quest, the tradeskill quest, and your relevant npc series of quests. The feather one is just getting 5 feathers which all spawn around the grutt invador area, the shell one all the shells spawn on the beach. Never did the gnome one. And the other two are just follow what the npc says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh wait and there is a priestess looking for undead bones, and by killing the undead fighters you get another quest to kill a ghost captain which you kill at the gravestone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gnome Quest-<br />
<br />
I dont have the piece names memorized but ive done this quest 7-8 times between now and beta so I know the locations all pretty well.<br />
<br />
Piece 1: Look on the map for a big tree near the undead fighters/orc cave area. Its near the base of the tree between some roots on the side near the cave.Looks like a big gear...double click on it to collect piece #1<br />
*NOTE* Named mobs spawn at the top of the tree, so if youre feeling froggy hop on up with a couple of friends for some loot.<br />
<br />
Piece 2: Look on the map for the two bridges over the river. Underneath the south bridge just above the waterfall is the second place to click and collect a piece.<br />
<br />
Piece 3: From the island the gnome is on, look straight out towards the ocean...swim straight out towards a couple of islands (that you will eventually find out you cannot reach since theyre just out of bounds). It's underwater and looks just like the place you collected the item from #2. <br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
Underneath the above mentioned waterfall  (in the lagoon) you will find some ruins....there is a statue lying in the sand. If you right click on it you will have to option to accept a quest. Accept the quest, kill 10 razortooth sharks, and you get a waist slot item for your troubles. When you accept the quest you are given EB so it isnt too bad.<br />
<br />
While you are here, keep an eye out for Bladefin. Named shark, 1 arrow up even/blue to level 6. Ive soloed him with every class except mage (havent tried), but due to adds youll need to try hauling ass to the beach and fight him there unless you have a lot of space around you in the water. Drops some random items and can also drop another piece that starts a collection quest- this quest yields a 2int bracer I believe.<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
At the big goblin camp, named goblins drop 6 slot bags, and rarely drop &quot;Goblin Attack Plans&quot; or something similar. These start a quest to kill goblin saboteurs, which are near the stairway at the lagoon (stairway leads to the skeleton/cave area). Finishing this quest yields a head slot item.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">are all your spells automatically added to your hotkey bar? or do they have to be made or bought? i'm only lvl 10 atm, so all the ones so far except the app2 ones have been added automatically....does this continue for each lvl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spells are not automatically added to your hotkey bar. They appear in your book for you to place yourself.<br />
<br />
And heres my noob hint for being a healer in a group:<br />
<br />
* keep the main tank targetted the entire fight, do not switch at all. If you cast a heal, it will land on the tank (obviously) and if you cast any detrimental spell it will automatically land on the mob the tank has targetted. This way you can contribute dots/dd and even melee without switching your target back and fourth between the mobs and the tank for heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get groups of quests for each newbie zone and knock them all over in one hit.<br />
<br />
Let scouts open chests.<br />
<br />
Just because any item is red, doesn't mean you can't wear it later/if an item is red it may mean you can't use it ever.<br />
<br />
Upgrade your spells to app3 or better, the difference is noticeable.<br />
<br />
And...<br />
<br />
Download a map and find the f-ing claymore yourself!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spells are not automatically added to your hotkey bar. They appear in your book for you to place yourself.<br />
<br />
I have always had new skills and spells appear in my hotkey bars, but I have always had open space for them so that's probably why.<br />
<br />
* keep the main tank targetted the entire fight, do not switch at all. If you cast a heal, it will land on the tank (obviously) and if you cast any detrimental spell it will automatically land on the mob the tank has targetted. This way you can contribute dots/dd and even melee without switching your target back and fourth between the mobs and the tank for heals.<br />
<br />
While this is true if you only plan on casting spells on either the MT or his target, you still need to switch targets pretty often for healing group members, buffing group members, and debuffing/damaging mobs other than the MT's target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>chia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so, except for the upgrades to app2 and app3, all the spells will appear automatically? for all levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In your spellbook yes. They won't pop onto the hotbar unless you have a space for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I talked to every NPC that I could find on the newbie island, and I never found a shell quest, feather quest, bone quest, or anything like those.  Is there some hidden cave or something where those quest-givers are located or something?  Or are they only for certain classes?<br />
<br />
Another question:  When you arrive at the docks of your chosen city, your banker asks you if you are, for example, a scout or an artisan.  What are the repercussions for answering that question either way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Make sure you are eating and drinking (showing the effects) to regen health and mana the fastest.  There's a big difference.  Don't forget to eat after a death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Instead of leaving the Main Tank targeted leave the mob/s targeted..  You will cast heal and beneficial spells onto the mobs target which is a team member...  8)..  great for a shaman's Wards..  Cleric keeps MT alive you keep eveyone else through wards n spot healing..  oh and don't think this means you dont cast your wards on the MT throw one on him if he hits yellow or if your bored..  this way it gives the cleric something to do 8P....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look for little question marks on the ground. If you click them an item will pop in your inv which you can examine to start the collection quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You get the shell/bone quests by &quot;collecting&quot; the little sparklies with a question mark over them in the sand.<br />
<br />
A popup window shows up when you Examine a shell or bone you've picked up.</div></div><hr />
