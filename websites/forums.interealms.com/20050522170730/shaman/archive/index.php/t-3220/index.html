<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ravenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, maybe I'm just sort of thinking out loud, but everyone's input would be greatly appreciated.  I am starting a shaman.  No way to twink, so I will be fighting, biting and scratching for all equipment and spells I get.  I do have experience playing a Barbarian Shaman up to L35, so that is all I have going for me.  So let me lay out what I know, or think I know and go from there...<br />
<br />
Races:<br />
Iskar- Weapon quest; highest starting wis (I think); lowest starting str and sta; AC boost; regen; infravision; xp penalty; KOS to all but Calabis<br />
<br />
Barbarian- Nice starting wis/str/sta; slam; can wear med and small armor; like visa and master card...accepted in most cities;  everybody and their brother seems to be a barbarian shaman.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir- Nice starting wis; infravision; str and sta seem to be low;  don't know much more about them<br />
<br />
Ogre - Great starting str and sta; wis a little lower then Barbarian; Slam; infravision; prob KOS in most cities<br />
<br />
Troll - Right behind Ogre in starting str and sta; lowest starting wis; Slam; infravision; KOS in most cities; regen<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm thinking the regen/Canny combo would be nice... No personal experience to draw from there.<br />
<br />
Cultural Armor &amp; Weapons...Barbarians prob come out ahead there with Ogre's running second...<br />
<br />
Since I'm running short on time here I will just stop here and hopefully get some feedback.  No flames please, just honest opinions and experience is all I'm asking.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Use the Shaman FAQ it will help immensly.<br />
<br />
But IMO you should choose Iksar because we are superior to all others. We don't need some toy &quot;space ghost&quot; bracer to bend others to our will. We are real Shaman ! Only reason someone would choose a race that can use a JBB is because they don't have the guts to be an Iksar ! <br />
:D <br />
<br />
J/K you should choose what race is best for you ! In the end game Shaman race is irrelevant !</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is:<br />
<br />
iksar.  they are cool.<br />
<br />
if you can't live without a jbb, then the answer is:<br />
<br />
troll.  they are oogly, which is cool.<br />

Iksar. We are superior. We also have other things that matter like nightvision, regen, and tails. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sta = overrated for shammies. 3hp/1sta at 60. Not worth worrying about<br />
<br />
I would respectfully disagree, particularly if you have your eye on end game play.  I can easily max 255 wis with halfway decent gear (a couple of spiffy pieces of NTOV, full SS, Lodi but nothing outrageously uber) but I'm still having difficulty getting gear with nice sta and I'm stuck at 221 buffed sta.<br />
<br />
If I had it to do over, I would put less into starting wisdom since wis is a primary stat for shaman and is readily available on nearly all high end gear, whereas stamina becomes increasingly important due to the mass hitpoint loss of can IV and can 5 yet is much harder to raise.<br />
<br />
But, I actually messed up my starting stats and put points into str and I'm still doing fine and enjoying my shaman, just do what you think feels right for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">sta = overrated for shammies. 3hp/1sta at 60. Not worth worrying about*  <br />
<br />
I also disagree....sta is probably the most important stat. More HP's = more mana. More Mana equals less downtime. More HP's = being able to sustain a beating. <br />
More HP's means you survive alot longer than that candy-ass druid with 200+ wis and crap for HP's and AC ! <br />
A properly geared AC Shaman with Torpor and HP's is a walking fortress, no other class can make that claim. <br />
<br />
So do not underestimate the power of Stamina ! <br />
YOU DON'T KNOW THE POWER OF HP'S !!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Think about it. 10 stamina in gives you just 30hp.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the whole picture and compare a level 60 ogre and a level 60 troll  with a level 60 iksar, all with regrowth on.<br />
<br />
An ogre will have 1301 base hp*<br />
A troll will have 1247 base hp*<br />
An iksar will have 1145 base hp*<br />
<br />
Both iksar and troll will regen 33 hp/tick to ogre's 22/tick<br />
<br />
In an hour's time, the iksar will have 20945 hp to canni from.<br />
<br />
A troll will have 21047hp to canni from.<br />
<br />
An ogre will have 14463 hp to canni from.<br />
<br />
For all the ogre's stamina, an iksar's regen gives them 6,482 more hp(roughly 45% more) to canni from in an hour. <br />
<br />
The troll will have 102 more hp to canni from in an hour(a little less than half a percent - .48% - more).<br />
<br />
Stamina is not nearly as important as some of you make it out to be - as far as choosing a race. Other things are far, FAR more important to a shammy than starting stamina. Like charisma. Or tails.<br />

*edit- almost forgot, the base hp is figuring 5 to sta and 25 to wis..you can  put whatever wherever, but the ratios will stay the same</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At 60 you're using Torpor and everyone is regenning at 300/tick. Then the only stats that make a difference are the 40 free AC an Iksar would get (and how many people have Magelo with 1.3k AC already?), OR the lack of stun on an Ogre. Less stun is more casts is less interrupts (Ogres ignore bashes).<br />
<br />
Personally...<br />
<br />
1 - 59<br />
Troll &gt; Iksar &gt;&gt;&gt; Ogre &gt;= Barb &gt;= Vah Shir<br />
<br />
60<br />
Ogre &gt; Troll &gt;= Iksar &gt; Vah Shir &gt;= Barb<br />
<br />
Iksar start with 39 sta less (117hp) than a Troll and 52 sta (156hp) less than an Ogre. How much would you pay for an item that weighed nothing, used no inventory slots and was soul bound that had an extra 120/150 hp?<br />
<br />
AND... you never get a JBB. Sure, while a shaman doesn't NEEED a JBB to be uber (32dps doesn't compare with BoN's 200) it makes getting uber a hell of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, sure ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
At 60 you use torpor- if you can find it. JBB is just a crutch for soloing, iksar have no problems soloing without it. In fact they do much better than any other race(aside from trolls) who do not have the 20k to plop down for one.<br />
<br />
<br />
More HP's = more mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, more regen is more mana. More hp is just like more wis- regen plays a MUCH bigger part(93.8 times more important in the example above) than actual hp, just like manaregen is much more important than the actual size of your manapool.<br />
<br />
Hp is not important for mana making(see the comparison above. 39 stamina boosts your hp cannipool by less than half of a percent in an hour's time).<br />
<br />
Hp is important for taking hits. But for god's sake, get +hp gear, not +sta gear. More bang for your buck(you'd need 34 stamina on an item at 60 to beat a 100hp item). sta is nice, but don't spend any sleepless nights worrying about it.<br />

<br />
If this means ogres can not have spell casting interuped when bashed this is simply not true.<br />
<br />
I have had spells interuped when bashed.<br />
<br />
This was not an easy thing to determine....  how do you tell?  It is quite rare to get bashed but not hit at the same time and even less rare to get interuped but I have been watching closley to see if this was true or not and I can say that ogres can be interuped when bashed.<br />

<br />
I was interupeted so either<br />
<br />
a) an attack that causes no damage can interupt or<br />
b) bashing an Ogre from the front can interupt.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how you would go about discriminating between the two possible options but I do know that I have been attacked and interuped when the only damage received came from a bash.  In light of this I must conclude that the Ogre racial abily of &quot;No Stun from the Front&quot; means no stun from the front and has nothing to do with bashing and spell interuption.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gerka is right.  We can get our spells interrupted with a bash. But that doesn't change the basic advantage.<br />
<br />
When stunned I can't do *anything* (except slowly spin in a circle if I'm unlucky :( ) and I never get stunned when I'm dealing with a mob.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've had spells interrupted by a lucky bash, and rarely enough regular hits will land to interrupt my spell (maybe from knockback?  I dunno).  But, even when the mob is whaling on me and landing multiple hits, if I see <br />
&quot;Monster tries to Bash YOU but missed!&quot; <br />

I hear all this raving over having hp here hp there its silly.  OK for instance you have 6 ac 65 hp rings on, ok thats 130 extra hp, and yes I wear these.  However, that 130 hp wont even cover 1 canni 4.  That only gave you what 75 mana?  Not even enough to cast Torpor once lol.<br />
<br />
AC is way more important than sta and hp..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">AC means very little when all the damage you are taking are from AEs. HP is the only stat that matters in the end, all other stats exist to help you maintain your HPs.<br />
<br />
When you take 200,000 points of AE per week and never gets melee, then you'll get to see how useful AC really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thunndar, <br />
<br />
I have nearly 500 more hitpoints than you do. When you consider mass cann takes 1924 hitpoints a shot, 500 is a pretty big chunk and having that extra hitpoints is very very helpful to me, all the time.<br />
<br />
My AC is also higher than yours. :)<br />
<br />
Who says you can't have both?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What I meant when I said &quot;Ogres Ignore Bashes&quot; is they treat them the same as any other hit. Getting &quot;bashed&quot; is the same as if you took a normal hit whereas any other race would be stunned and have zippo chance of having their spell go through.<br />
<br />
For instance...<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 17:19:44 2002] You begin casting Blizzard Blast.<br />
[Thu May 30 17:19:47 2002] A sand giant bashes YOU for 26 points of damage.<br />

[Thu May 30 17:19:49 2002] You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br />
<br />
[Thu May 30 22:13:12 2002] You begin casting Venom of the Snake.<br />
[Thu May 30 22:13:13 2002] A sand giant bashes YOU for 26 points of damage.<br />
[Thu May 30 22:13:15 2002] A sand giant slashes YOU for 46 points of damage.<br />

[Thu May 30 23:53:17 2002] A sand giant bashes YOU for 30 points of damage.<br />
[Thu May 30 23:53:18 2002] You regain your concentration and continue your casting.<br />

Those are a few cuts from my feeble attempt to camp the AC for my monk so she can stop feeling guilty and asking for sow.<br />

He died twice kept running around like a chicken and Im sure he went oom more often healing himself than anything else...I said I would take slowing duties for a bit and it was amazing how much more efficeint the group was..at first they would rush to get mobs off me but once they saw me meleeing it and intentionally getting aggro to rootpark the mob and still at good health they would leave me alone to do my job..<br />

<br />
Or 500hp being the difference between being able to use Canni5 without getting low hp summoned and squashed like the lizard you are. ;)<br />
<br />
And considering Shaman can only roll out about 2.5 - 3k hps, that 500hp is 15-20% of your total health. So a Shaman with it will survive under AE 15-20% longer.<br />
<br />
There's a reason everyone thinks the way they do. At the higher levels it's ALLLL about hit points simply because stuff does so much damage you need those hit points to just not die. Prior to that it's 60% regen, 33% AC, 7% hit points... or there abouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">to get back on track with the races...<br />
<br />
I have read the posters above and their opinions on regen and what not.  Ogre's with no stunning from the front.  But you have to ask yourself...<br />
<br />
What would make this game fun?<br />
<br />
I have tried the regen classes, iksar and troll, they just weren't for me.  I tried listening and keeping at it because I &quot;knew&quot; that regen would be most important to me at the higher levels.  Along with stats and abilities.  But in the end, I stopped playing because of some stupid thing I didn't like about the class.<br />
<br />
I have re rolled my shaman, as I moved to a different server, but I stumbled on the class to re roll as most people like above said troll and iksar for the regen.  But really...it is whatever is fun for you.  That is all that can be said, because what people say here does not impact the end game for you, it just add's point of views to look at.  That I have learned from trying different races.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;better&quot; class, because this is a game to have fun with.  A game where you choose who you want to be, not what everyone else &quot;thinks&quot; you should be.<br />
<br />
No one here since I have been reading the boards, has been limited to what they could not do because they chose the &quot;wrong&quot; race.<br />
<br />
to each his own.<br />
<br />
these are my opinions, so take them at face value.  I am just trying to give a little advice from what I went through trying to find a race I was comfortable with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I told myself I wouldn't respond to these threads anymore because the arguments people make just go round and round and round, and the people asking the questions end up not really learning anything.<br />
But hey, on the off-chance it actually helps someone . . .<br />
<br />
I agree that regen is not the end-all be-all.<br />
I've talked to regenning shamans who have played non-regenning shaman races, and they've said that it's really not as big an issue as people have made it out to be.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to fun.  Please don't be another min-maxer who chooses race/class combination based only on who others say is the &quot;best.&quot;  Choose who you think is the best for you.  <br />
<br />
As much as we poke fun at Verant, the one thing you have to give them credit for is that they really did a good job on race/class balancing, especially in the shaman sector.  One race is just as viable as another.<br />
<br />
Basically ask yourself:  What abilities do you look for in a shaman?  What race looks like the most fun to you based on your personal preferences?  When you can honestly answer these questions, you have found your race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">AC is way more important than sta and hp..<br />
- During our Arch Lich fight (we leveled it because some clerics lacked HP) we had 2 clerics die because they mod rod too much, fall below 40% HP and BAM. You are dead. Next is rampage or main tank, and then the raid. With 4.1k HP raid buffed, I can cannibalize 5 AND not fall below 40% HP so I don't get summoned and killed by beserker aggro. <br />
<br />
There is also the other insance with mobs that have extremely hard to resist or unresistable AEs (a la Dozekar, Cursed in Ssra or Zlexlax) that have to be slowed ASAP so you have to stand there and slow it. Your 3 million AC won't do much when you die after 2-3 waves of AE.<br />
<br />
Then there is also the aggro gained from mobs, I tanked a few NToV dragons/Flurry drakes for a round or 2 no problem, not because my uber AC of 1130ish buffed but because I had the HP to live long enough to give tanks time to gain back aggro.<br />
<br />
Having ulta high AC means nothing. There are way too many benefits of having high HP instead. Not saying to dump all AC gear to 0, but after a while, AC means nothing. If a big_bad_mob wants to hit on you, it will, no matter the AC you got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If levelling fast is a priority then go Barb, if you want to be the 'best' shaman from 1-59 then go Troll, if you want to be the best at 60 then they are all generally the same but maybe Ogre take the biscuit for Hps and Lack of being stunned frontally.<br />
<br />
Iksar are trash :)<br />
<br />
If i remade I would go troll purely as you spend a lot of time levelling and the added regen would be nice coupled with the dinky snare necklace.</div></div><hr />

There comes a time when you realize resists aren't all they are cracked out to be.<br />
<br />
There comes a time when you realize that generalizing and saying &quot;AC's way more important than sta&quot; doesn't do much for others to respect your opinions.<br />
<br />
There comes a time when you realize that saying &quot;but then I have a life&quot; is one of the oldest cliches used by people who knows they are wrong, but refuse to admit they are wrong, and would grasp anything at all to keep themselves floating.<br />
<br />
Until then, live and learn.</div></div><hr />

Hard to cast debuffs from around a corner.<br />
<br />
During most big raid fights, I'm not taking any damage.  I want the high hitpoints to better use the torpor/mod rod 2 combo to twitch mana to priests and casters.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's not as glamorous as being the shaman that lands the slow, but it's really helpful in winning fights that last 20+ minutes.<br />
<br />
AC doesn't mean jack in that situation.<br />
<br />
Although I'm a current hitpoint junky, I'm not crazy.  I've made a bunch of hitpoints for AC gear decisions and I'm currently just cracking 1100 AC raid buffed. That's my comfort level and I wouldn't sacrifice any more AC for more hitpoints unless it was something really really outrageous.<br />
<br />
A good example is the Cloak of the Sky from NTOV, I've passed on three chances on it so far..it's a GREAT cloak, but I'm just not at the level where I can give up the resists off my Lodi.<br />
<br />
My goal is gear that provides good hitpoints, AC and resists, all three are important.</div></div><hr />

Boinshar, there comes a time when you realize that taking 200K per week in ae and never being in melee means you should be hiding from it a hell of a lot more often. <br />
<br />
You begin casting (insert spell here).<br />
You can not see your target.<br />
<br />
And of course you can hide from AE in a few zones, but there are fights where mob has to be continually debuffed (aka fight lasts long), there are also fights where you can't hide, there are also fights that something goes wrong (aka adds) and you have to step in to slow them. In a perfect world, every AE wave is called out, every spell lands fine, nothing is resisted, mobs die fast, no adds, no lag, nothing goes wrong.<br />
<br />
Well it's time to wake up, this is not a perfect world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hi everyone,<br />
I'm Mums, and I'm a regen addict!<br />
One of these days, when I give up on normal times and start playing from midnight and onwards, I'll get gear with good stats so I can get back to wearing my beloved fungi tunic as 'most used' *sighs dreamily*<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to go Troll anyday! ...but then again, I'm pretty partial there ;) It's a fun race and the regen is a sweet, sweet thing no matter what other ppl say. If you have a male char you might go iksar if you prefer, but female iksar? ..sorry, wouldn't recommend to anyone :p<br />
<br />
My first and most played shaman is a troll, but i've played both cat and ogre shaman on other servers, ie. from scratch and with no twinking - just like my troll once. The one sole thing I feel is missing when I play them is regen. <br />
<br />
I'm rambling... but what I really wanted to say was to go with what you like. A shaman can never be wrong no matter what race you settle down with and no matter how you put your starting stats - we're just best, like that. Can't help it :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, beyond all the min-maxing, &quot;my race is better than yours&quot; BS, the above quote is basically what it really all boils down to.</div></div><hr />

Maintank_001 tells the guild, '&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; AE HAS HIT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'<br />

Nope, but 200k is a high number even for our imperfect, non called ae/no hiding spots eq world.</div></div><hr />
