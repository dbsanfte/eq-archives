<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wooohooo !! I got one.<br />
<br />
An ex-guildmate was in a group in sebilis where on dropped and sent me a tell, telling me that one had driopped and the name of the Thugstump who won the roll,  and then Goldark, another shaman who I had  been talking to about JBB's and who was in the same guild as Thugstump who won the roll, sent me a tell also, saying what the bidding had gone up to, so I was able to get it.<br />
<br />
So big grats to Anitellum and Goldark, who also told Thugstump what a nice chap I was,  and finally to Thugstump for selling it to me at below the market rate because he doesn't like selling to rich twinks. What a nice Chap.<br />
<br />
<br />
/em Youichi wanders of with a Cheshire Cat smile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are very welcome and glad I could help.<br />
