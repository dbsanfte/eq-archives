We didn't even get into Canton yet.  I have yet to go back to ivory room or electric stick since I started going to the shark club.  I'm there a few times a week.  Free buffet for monday night football, free pool, hot ass waitresses, can't beat it.  Oh yah, my gym's 2 blocks from there, that helps too =)</div></div><hr />

Oh, I play on Saryrn for some reason.  No one in my guild from the immediate area, but we have every old-school Big Ten school represented (no one from Penn State, but they're not really a Big Ten school anyway).  <br />
<br />
Detroit Fanfaire would be excellant.   I can only imagine the number of people I'd see that would say &quot;Dude, I didn't know you played EQ?!?!&quot;<br />
