<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The next wave of multiplayer games seem imminent. Interested to see what people intend to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Going to be keep playing eq1, play wow, and probably at least try eq2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No way im gonna start another game after EQ1 so im quitting games for good and try to get my RL back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Staying in eq1 and start playing wow, where I will move to permantently if it suits me better than eq1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm theres a chance on me buying WoW, but other than that I am waiting for an unknown other, perhaps Turbine's newest offerings or Vanguard. There are a load of them coming soon. Matrix Online, Guild wars, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should have left an undecided option.<br />
<br />
I may or may not be in the EQ2 beta, but I've heard from a friend of a friend that it's fine but very dull. Limited spells, not much in the way of tactics. Lots of nice touches and very nice graphics, but the gameplay is lacking.<br />
<br />
So I'm probably not going to play it.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting to get my hands on WoW but from what I've read that sounds like more fun. So I put that.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much finished with EQ as it stands. I've started leveling a necro, but it's not the same game that I started 4.5 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll keep playing EQ1 until I get tired of it.  Then I'll quit and not pick up another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WoW for this bear. I like the look of either the druids or the shaman. <br />
Leaning towards the druids though, the totems don't sit well with me, for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WoW Beta bored me to no end after only a week.  Won't be seeing me there.  EQII beta... same thing.   I'm waiting for Vanguard.  Till then I'll be playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im at 3 and 4. Im working up a surfing trip right now and i have totaly quit EQ1. Deleted my folders and canceled my accounts and i browse here only once in a while to see the cool people here and what has changed. So far i see nothing worth coming back for on a personal level. <br />
<br />
Secondly i am a lil excited about WoW soon, i have a feeling ill be playing that cause it looks about right for the level of involvment im willing to issue to a game at this point in my life. I just have a a feeling eq2 is going to require too much to play, which is ok, its just not for for me. eq1 i already know takes too much time to play it ;)</div></div><hr />
