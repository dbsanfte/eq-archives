<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i have around 700pp to spend on a upgrade(850 tops but i'm saving some slowly so i'll have enough for level 44 spells). Can you guys reccommend an/some upgrade(s)?? I was thinking get a JB Helm? they got for 350pp on server btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your 40 which your magelo says, it might still be worth it to go ahead and get a cheap Aflliction Eff. II item. There are some old school bracers, cant think of the name off the top of my head. They are cheap around 250. About the only thing you could afford that really have noticable benefits.<br />
<br />
/edit: yeah Zyphyr got it. Chipped Bone Bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your rings are your current biggest weakness.<br />
<br />
Replace one with a Velium Fire Wedding Ring (AC 6, HP 65)  - likey available for 500pp or less<br />
<br />
or both with Platinum Fire Wedding Rings (AC 5, HP 55) - probably available for 300 or less each.<br />
<br />
Cutthroat rings are just awful.<br />
<br />
The bracer Ezeekial is probably thinking of is the Chipped Bone Bracer.</div></div><hr />

Nice and free and then you can spend your money on other slots.<br />
<br />
If you are short of money go back to CC and kill he orcs. I have spent the last 2 nights there and made around 2k in total on weapon drops, plat drops, velium and items from the 2 casters (oracle/xxxx). If you can get the genoids camp you can get good fast XP and gems (Chipped Diamond goes for 185pp to vendors)<br />
<br />
The orcs are light blue/green and some db to me @ 40</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Decided to look up the Prince.  Did some research on Allakazam seemed to be in my level range. I'm level 40 moderate twinkage w/ horsie.  Approach ent to owlbear caves and see small group of green and L blue grimlings.  Decided to try to single pull a greenie.<br />
<br />
Got my ass handed to me by the green and L blue grimilings at the entrance.  2 Casters piled Dots and debuffs on, the greens double hit upto 50-60 with 900+AC, and they Summon!? Yes they do, took down all but 2 before my CR.<br />
<br />
Been told takes a full group of 40,s or a mid 50 solo to do this.<br />
<br />
What does it take, these things are kinda cute but nothing great.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those Grimling casters are nasty and there are so many of them.<br />
<br />
The zone can be a pain too with the war that goes on, sometimes there's owlbears a plenty (the prince just wanders about outside) around the cave and surrounding area and then for weeks it seems to be only Grimlings. You won't have a problem with the owlbears tho at 40.</div></div><hr />
