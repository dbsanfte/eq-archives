<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odrigeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Everyone,<br />
<br />
My friend and I have been trying to camp the main floor outside of the building in the Hole and are having some add problems. <br />
<br />
We are on Fennin Ro<br />
He is a 57 Necro<br />
I am a 51 Shaman<br />
<br />
We have no problem getting down there but we are trying to find a decent spot to pull to. We have tried right at the end of the ramp after the drop off but we get all kinda of adds due to the crazy pathing there. Has anyone found a good spot to do this? Should we move into the building? And if so, any good spots in there?<br />
<br />
Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
