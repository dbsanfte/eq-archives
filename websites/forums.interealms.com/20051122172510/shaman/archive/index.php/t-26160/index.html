<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A buddy and I from our normal PVE crew rolled undead rogues on Frostmane (new low pop server) that we're planning on leveling together. So far it's been a lot of fun- if one rogue is abusive, 2 rogues are doubly so.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm thinking of doing a full subtlety build as I love that tree the most but am mostly assassination on my PVE rogue build.   Is sub a viable build? Also, when does the PVP action start? We're getting impatient to gank and be ganked. I am really, really, really, really looking forward to ganking paladins left and right- I know exactly how weak that class is, it will be fun abusing it.  :p <br />
<br />
Any other general PVP advice? I took skinning/mining as professions to build up a stock of gold, but would herb/alch be better since potions are so important? Or skinning/lw on a new server since gear will be hard to come by? Lay it on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in my opinion th best profession for a rogue is engineering. Vanish&gt;jumper cables can save a wipe.<br />
<br />
The target dummies work like the shaman stoneclaw totem that taunts enemies. <br />
<br />
And the dynamite can be an extra stun line for pvp action.<br />
<br />
Subtlety is reputed to be great for pvp too. Preparation can be an awesome ability. And I found camoflage is important because as a group of 2 rogues, you will spend alot of time stealthed.<br />
<br />
I may suggest a rogue group on a pvp server with some of my mateys, =), it may be fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no more rogues....<br />
<br />
hehe jk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's viable, but like Mill will probably tell you after that initial attack prepare to get smacked. Especially against paladins. Subtlety builds are great against light armored opponents, but start to really slack off against mail + wearers. <br />
<br />
I also reccomend herb/alchemy. Potions are great, along with thistletea (different timer since its food), and blind which is huge in pvp. <br />
<br />
On my server, which is a high pop original the pvp starts as soon as you set foot into contested territory, hell the alliance raids the barrens all the time. The worst zones for ganking would be STV, TM, and to a point 1k needles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great advice so far, thanks.  My only short term worry on taking herb/alch is affording a mount right at 40. On my PVE rogue I make tons of gold but I'm barely scraping by on a new server so I'm a little worried. Maybe it'll shake out by the time I hit 40.  I may very well hit 40, buy a mount then switch profs. Engineering sounded like a great idea as well.<br />
<br />
Since I'll always be paired with my buddy's rogue, is there such a thing as complementary builds? Maybe I go subtlety for front loaded damage and he goes combat to finish off our victim? Or both spec for that big first hit and try to instakill?<br />
<br />
So far I've noticed that in the undead newbie areas it's about 3:1 rogues:anything else. I have a sinking feeling that rogues are about to get &quot;paladin'd&quot;. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The nice thing about alchemy is that it sells really well. Potions are expendable, so there is always demand, and at every level of the game if you price it right. If I ever need cash, which is all the time since I buy a lot of toys I just spend a few hours daisy picking. It's not in the crazy amounts a deathstriker will bring you, but without the headaches. <br />
<br />
If you have a partner, any build will do. 2 Rogues together are just plain evil. If you get improved sap it's all the better, you will be able to take on greater numbers at higher levels. I'd actually suggest both going with subtley to offset timers between you two, but really anything would work. <br />
<br />
The only real downside, is that if it's only the two of you, daggers might be hard to come by at higher levels. Still, your build is great for instances so finding a pickuo group shouldn't be too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, you've convinced me- I'm going to go take herb/alch while I'm still in the newbie lands and can raise it up fast. We're going to want lots of potions anyways so this should help out. I just hope I can start making money soon like I do on PVE- it sucks being broke every other level.</div></div><hr />

me and my roomie, also has a 60 rogue, went to defend xr early sunday morning, there were 4 alliance rogues, wanna talk about pain!<br />
<br />
Wouldn't get your pally bashing too optimistic, you run into one good level 60 paladin and you are going to be really humbled and feel like a total waste. Ran into a badass level 60 pally in ws, me and a 60 warrior jumped him, he calmly beat me down, I had to run, vanish, bandage, came back and we still could not finish him off, battle lasted a long time. At one point I got hit for 800 something, he just would not die. And of course the zerg got us after, but heh.<br />
<br />
Pallies are a hell of alot tougher, and a hell of alot more dangerous then you will admit. The bad ones are difficult, the good ones are godlike.</div></div><hr />

After the seal of command nerf in the upcoming patch paladins will be lucky to break 80 dps with epic weapons and will have zero burst dps, even burst proc dps.  It is a massive nerf to the tiny shred of paladin dps remaining.  My friend and I will have loads of fun wrecking paladins again and again and again.  All the free lives in the world won't give them an ability to escape or to prevent us from escaping if help arrives. They are so screwed it's not even funny.  If you can't handle a flat 80 dps with no damage spikes you're in some pretty sad gear. 80 dps is prolly pushing it as I cannot come close to that with 1h/shield and I can only break 80 dps w/ a big 2h and command (which is going bye bye).<br />
<br />
Bottom line: paladins hold zero fear for me. Given that we have fear immunity I'm not sure what besides Alliance rogues will be a challenge assuming comparable gear/skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because you have not fought a decent one then. You are full of crap about the 80 dps too, not in pvp. <br />
<br />
Hunter catches you in open, you are dead. Mage? You are likely dead. Warrior, if not combat specced, he will kill ya. Rogues just are not as billy as you think, sounds like you will have two rogues simply ganking? If so, and you find solo targets all the time, yes you will win. Not exactly great pvp skill needed there. I dunno, sounds like you will just be gankers, woot?<br />
<br />
I am really getting the feeling that perhaps the paladins you know truly do suck, or are equipped really poorly. You talk like you know all about high end pvp, high end pve, yet you have never been there Iz, at least think about what people say and keep an open mind.<br />
<br />
And, I am one of the toughest rogues you could possibly meet, my gear is fine, as are my skills. I ain't a l33t circle strafe guy, but I almost never lose to another rogue. For the love of pete please don't be one of those silly rogues running around with 3200 hps at level 60.<br />

I am not full of crap about the 80 dps. You consistently mistake big hits (damage) for dps (damage per second).  They are two completely different things.  And don't worry, you won't even have to worry about those after the next patch. There will be zero a paladin can do to hit you with meaningful burst dps, even randomly. Matters zero to me regardless.<br />

We'll always be duoing and joining pu groups (/cringe) to do instances. I'm not sure you can play a rogue w/o ganking, if by ganking you mean jumping unsuspecting foes. Their best moves are all from stealth.<br />

I can't speak for everyone but the paladins in my crew are geared very nicely as the only time they're played is in instances. Our rogue is running all the high end instances with pu groups while we catch up, so admittedly a lot of my info is from his experiences.  He recently did BRD with 3 paladins and a hunter (sound familiar?) so I'm none too worried.<br />

Heh, I'm becoming a convert to combat style if not the combat talents now that I've gotten my SM mace. Ambush -&gt; weapon swap to mace -&gt; ss X 2 -&gt; loot mob. But for my PVE rogue I am going max dps because I don't give a damn about my hps- that will not be the case on PVP. For that I'm going to follow your lead that hps &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">two rogues together is brutal, you will enjoy it, no doubt. The only problem I run into, is the feeling of guilt hehe.<br />
<br />
Didn't mean to sound all high and mighty, just still sore from that godlike paladin we ran into. Jesus he was tough.<br />

I've got a level 25 rogue on a high population european server. It's been open for just over a month now so the middle zones are the busiest, but there is a lot of action going on in the 20's.<br />
<br />
I found my first taste of proper PVP (not just defending the xroads) at around level 20 when I started to venture into Ashenvale. I've since moved onto Hillsbrad, and that is quite busy for PvP.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in Ashenvale with a friend (level 23 warlock) doing the Zorlam Strand quests and we got into a few rumbles. Some we won and some we lost. I do know that it winds people up more if you /dance over them and eat them rather than if you /spit on them ;)<br />
<br />
One of the things you can do is use one of you as bait while the other is stealthed, and when your bait gets taken jump out and kill em :D</div></div><hr />
