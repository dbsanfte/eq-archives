<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or has EQ become WAY too easy? I started playing a bit before kunark came out and things have changed greatly. it seems that anyone can get to 50 without much trouble anymore in months and with PoP 50+ is a joke (59 in a DAY! come on...). It just seems that this game has lost its challenge completely.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who misses zones without graveyards? Dungeons? (CoD is the closest thing to a dungeon in pop) and haggling in EC?<br />
<br />
It just seems that SOE is progressively making EQ a joke in the difficulty factor. Kunark was a good expansion. With a nice story, great environments etc... BUT it was the start of the trivializing of encounters. The loot that was released with kunark completely upset the game. Remember when an SSoY was the melee weapon of choice and if you had two you joked that you could kill naggy solo? It’s an expensive pet weapon now. Not just because it’s a 4 year old weapon, its because its an 8/24. That’s laughable now. Make a quick run to the bazaar and buy yourself a lammy. Vox and naggy were thought to be unkillable, now they have to set a level cap because a duo could easily take them out (or one shaman =D). Kedge was a mystery, people were freaked out about going in. now its just a detour to get some epics.<br />
<br />
I guess this is just a /rant from a guy who misses the old days =P But seriously does anyone else think that EQ is just incredibly easy now?<br />
<br />
btw only reason I post this is because I was talking to this guy yesterday, he was a 52 monk and lfg in PoD... He had been playing 3 months without any outside help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on your definition of easy I guess. With so much raiding content out there now, there's no reason to be a lower level really. Might as well get you into the upper tiers so you can enjoy the new expansion and raiding the fun stuff.<br />
<br />
Exp grinds for hours to get a couple of blues in Sebilis were once the norm.  I'd prefer to be a part of the end game.  With EQ2 coming out and the lack of appeal to be a low level and have it be &quot;fresh and new&quot; I can see why they've made it so much easier.<br />
<br />
Guild is currently working on the Rallos Zek encounter and it's probably the hardest thing I've ever seen on EQ bar none.  More to come in EP for sure, but it's all relative.<br />
<br />
I was with you Pre Kunark, I did the grind.  I'm glad I don't have to be a part of that anymore and am experiencing new fun encounters.<br />
<br />
EQ was once one of the few online RPG's out there (Yes I know, Ultima, Diablo ( I guess) and there were others.  Now with so many games out, and coming out, the only appeal to me of a game like EQ is participating in challenging encounters.  It's no longer just some online game that does what no other game does.  It's now the norm of the gaming industry. I don't want to swing a rusty sword at a little rat, I want to shoot fireballs at a huge dragon with 15 horns and 9 heads and have him pick me up and eat me for lunch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is very easy now.<br />
<br />
No hell levels.<br />
No book.<br />
No boats.<br />
KEI<br />
Bazaar<br />
And the loot it crazy.<br />
<br />
The only way to keep the 12 yearld happy is new and more outragous items, and stupid player races like frogs.<br />
<br />
I am sooooo looking forward to EQ2 and a fresh start without all the cartoonish junk we have in EQ now.  Even a then new level 1 server will not change things much.<br />
<br />
I so much hope that all the lewt d00ds will continual to chase pixels in EQ and that the new game will have a long life cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No matter how easy it is now compared to yesteryear, EQ is still the hardest most timesinkish mmog out there.. and thats really what hard is, a measure of how much time it takes to progress.<br />
<br />
They just shifted the timesinks to encounters you will fail 20 times before beating them.. rather then killing dark blue sebilis frogs for 8 hours for 2 blues of xp.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. low levels were always easy and fast if you had stones and hunted in dangerous exciting places.(barring the old hell levels).<br />
<br />
Maybe its a personal thing.. but I hate &quot;xping&quot; I loathe it with all of my being. I would rather drill holes in my head then &quot;Grind&quot;. &quot;xping&quot; is all about killing the most mobs as safely as possible. It sucks ass, its boring, all it is is a treadmill.<br />
<br />
Doesnt bother my twinks a bit that they can breeze through the easiest parts of the treadmill with a few good buffs and come into their powers quickly.<br />
<br />
I enjoy raids, I enjoy helping people do quests, camp hard tradeskill parts or do epics et al, but just xping to xp cause its what there is to do.. makes me want to stick my head in a meatgrinder, cause thats about what xping is =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think what you're saying has validity, but in a way I'm thankful for it. It was once (as you say) exceedingly difficult to make 50, but that was the end-game. Now the end game is up to 65 and stupidly large numbers of AA points.<br />
<br />
As entertaining as this game is, people do leave to do other stuff, and if it was as hard to make 50 as it once was, a lot of higher end raiding content would start to stagnate after a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As one who remembers the Bad Old Days (TM) I have to say that the game is a lot more enjoyable at lower levels now.  There used to be SO many ways for you to almost permanently **** up your character to the point you'd have to reroll.  So many ways to lose everything, so hard to get levels, and so easy to die for no particular reason.  Now I die more than ever, but it's more fun because things make at least SOME modicum of sense.  Hmm, then again come to think of it, my Velious expansion-geared monk (fungi, 34% haste) leveled to 50 only having died about five times . . . total.  I guess that's a bit &quot;off&quot; but whatever, death is a pain.  <br />
<br />
I think the point of this post is this: There are no more bragging rights to being low level.  There's almost nothing you can do pre-65 that will make anyone jealous, or anyone respectful of you.  And even when you have &quot;arrived&quot;, you have to share the glory with everyone else who already has arrived too, so it diminishes your own accomplishments.  In a game that has traditionally been all about being &quot;uber&quot; in the sight of one's peers, this is a fatal blow to the will-to-play of many people.  I know my own guild has been caught in a lot of apathy and lack of interest among the long-time players.  Many people retiring or taking extended breaks from the game.  Oh sure, the &quot;EQ bug&quot; will bite them again at some point, but right now there isn't a whole lot to brag about, and that makes less reason for many people to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When Brad left they gimped the game so that all the gimps who thought dreadlands was the shiznat could play too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is supposed to be a new server opening soon.  Supposedly SoE is not going to allow transfers for 12 months.  So you will have 1 year to &quot;turn back the clock&quot;.<br />
<br />
Granted, the changes that have been made to the game will be in effect.  But for the first month or so there will be no redily availible KEI, no 100K level 12 uber twinks, no Ageo, no virtue, no focus.  People will have to make do with sow (if they can find it), breeze and clarity (if they can find it) and rusty weapons to level 15.<br />
<br />
I think that only those folks that the majority of folks that play on this server will be those old timers and post-kunark pre-luclin era folks.  Anyone newer than that will not be able to stand not getting PL'ed through levels with the benefit of high end buffs and gear.<br />
<br />
I cant wait to try again.  As I look back on my almost 3 years of EQ the best times were when I was an untwinked newbie beating up bears with a rusty morning star hoping for a HQ pelt that could get me about 20 plat in EC.<br />
<br />
I jsut have to figure out what class to play....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No doubt Thorzion, I agree.  Without going into all the debates I'll just leave it with... Old days &gt; New days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thorzion -<br />
a new &quot;no transfer&quot; server will be much of what you say - but consider some of the other changes.<br />
<br />
one example:  SOW will be available within hours - up to level 10 there is no death penalty and when ya die ya don't have to do a CR - you pop at bind with all gear.  Level 9 for Shaman SOW will happen the first day - easily.  Druid SOW as well.<br />
<br />
Very few will be seeing Norrath for the first time - so many will be racing to the camps they have planned on for equipment drops.  SSoY used to be uber, but you can farm Velium weapons with similar procs from Tizmaks now.<br />
<br />
Friends will start together, grouping immediately and min/maxing their way to Paludal that first day.  If a guild starts up together (I think that is probable) they will make rapid progress.  If an &quot;uber&quot; guild starts up (not sure this is likely, but someone may want to go claim every &quot;first on the server&quot; they can).<br />
<br />
You are right that there will not be any posted screenshots of a level 65 frog getting their cleric  epic with 13 days played (something like that wasn't it?).  But there will be level 50's within a week of server start up.<br />
<br />
I think that the people who truly want to start at the bottom, untwinked, etc. will be able to do so.  And with the whole server starting from scratch, it will be quite a while before the bazaar is overflowing with traders. <br />
<br />
But the race to the top will be on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My biggest complaint...there is no challenge anymore. There is no penalites anymore if you screw up. Since PoP death is a joke. Not only 90%-96% rezzes, but you can go and kill 1 mob and get back all the exp you lost plus some. With graveyards, it doesn't even matter if you train in somewhere you shouldn't be...no consequences. There is no such thing as risk taking anymore. <br />
<br />
Also they did away with the &quot;fun&quot; exp camps. Sure it's boring doing exp for hours on end, but throw the promise of an elusive item drop into the equation and it WAS fun. Sure it might have been a &quot;timesink&quot; for some, but when you finally got that item you were after, it was an accomplishment. Not just bragging rights, but something you really wanted. Something like camping your own Fungi tunic...<br />
<br />
Great items from a raid kill just never have compared to me. (only exception being a first time kill thrill)<br />
<br />
There is no fun 65plus exp camps anymore. LoY has a few but they are too low level for the 65 player group. PoP has a few single group boss mobs but you can clear them all out in 30minutes then what do you do. If your not in a raiding guild, there is very little fun challenging content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">old eq was 'hard' level<br />
<br />
expansions added uber gear (compared to original eq) and brought the game to the 'normal' level.<br />
<br />
kei and aego bring the game to the 'easy' level.<br />
<br />
how easy?  I got kei and aego on my 20 necro a few days ago.  I 'tanked' for 4 levels before my buffs went away.  My necro has cloth and junk armor, but a nice piercing weapon.  I brought up one of my wifes chars and lifetaped it (in duel mode) between fights if my hps got too low.  It is so rediculous that I can tank with a necro.  My pet was just adding bonus damage.  I figure that my necro will be able to tank up to around 40 with ease.<br />
<br />
a necro should not be able to tank until 40 with cloth gear.  this game is so rediculously easy now that it is fun to play the lvls (pun intended).  i played a druid up to 50 (when 50 was the cap).  It sucked.  I wouldn't play anymore if it was still that hard.  My wis got to 200 (cap) when I was 48 i think.  with kei, you don't even have to get your wis up.  130 is good enough.  I hated that stupid spell book.  Looking back, I don't understand why I even played the game.<br />
<br />
I do think that kei and aego type spells should be nerfed though.  I think they should have a recommended lvl of atleast 45.  If my 20 necro gets kei, he should only get 5 or 6 points of mana per tick, not 14.  Aego should only add a few hundred hps, not 1200.  It seems rediculous to see lvl 1 chars with 1200 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its way too easy now.  90% of people don't know what's best for them.  They see nothing wrong with 4 hour KEI, with PoK stones, with PoP exp.  It allows them to get level 65 in a month, then get tired of the distraction that EQ was and move on.  Their complaints, throughout the years, however, have pushed sony to make the very changes that make the game a shadow of what it once was.  No biggie for them, but it sucks for those of us who truly enjoyed EQ at some point and can look back and see what a sh!theap its become.  Sure, the diehard, uberguilder addicts will only see that tier-4 God that provides an actual challenge when flaming me for this opinion, but would have no argument if they were to look at the rest of the game before doing so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in OT, having met a freind who had just hammered in. We went to the bank, there in the Outpost. I was showing him the brand new Velium Stone Etched Mace I had managed to get a hold of, for 2000pp.  I handed the bag to him, instead of the mace, why I have no fuggin clue. He didn't have any inventory room at all left, and it dropped to the ground. THe banker sucked it up, told me to report to the docks for duty for littering (or some trash like that) and I just sat there in shock. <br />
<br />
GM did squat for me. Have been petty and vindictive about GM's ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The game has been dumbed down too much I think.  I liked a lot of the things that used to exist and the rewards once you got to certain levels.  I liked that once you started casting a spell you couldnt duck out of it.  I liked faction issues.  Many things were a balance and the game has changed where those balances were thrown out the window to make things easier and more convenient.  Item upgrades became too powerful too quickly through the expansions.<br />
<br />
Spells were not properly balanced to begin with, CH, 96% rezzes, they make the game truly less risky (or rather not risky at all).  Death does not mean anything except a small amount of time in recovery usually.<br />
<br />
However, I never liked hell levels, and the experience gain through the 50s was horrible, I like that experiencing has sped up, it makes a lot more AAs and levels available for a casual player (I do think its a little too good though).  I think the experience gain rate change will impact Sony negatively, too many people will get to the end much quicker now and sooner or later I think more people will leave than might have if the experience gain was slower.  I like that travel is easier.  Many things were changed for the good but many new changes were bad I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something I was thinking would rock is if they were to implement GYs in mid level dungeons.  I don't mind that it's easier to level now than it once was, although I think certain zones are out of hand when pretty much EVERYONE goes a set route of zones to level as fast as possible.  Ideally, the harder dungeons should offer enough of an xp bonus to warrant the added risk of death.  In order to do that successfully, you'd either have to drastically increase the xp in certain unused dungeons to the point where people could PL their twinks in hours OR you could lower one of the big risks that keeps people from exploring those dungeons.  Namely... Long ass CRs and worse.<br />
<br />
Add a GY to Kaesora, Droga, Nurga, MM, Splitpaw, Crystal Caverns, Chardok, Sebilis, etc.  And dare I say it... Nerf xp in some of the outdoor zones that are just ridiculously easy right now.  As is, I'm pretty sure most people skip those dungeons as they're coming up because there are easier and safer places to get xp and often at a faster rate.  /boggle  <br />
<br />
Go to PoN and fight some hard hitting mobs that are mostly a joke to single/double pull for mega xp.  If you wipe out it's no biggie because your corpses will pop at zone in for you to res at your convenience.  OR you can go to Chardok mines and fight mobs that may not hit as hard, but are a lot harder to split effectively into manageable pulls.  If you wipe out, you could be looking at a very painful CR and on top of all that you get less xp overall even if you don't wipe.  See the problem here?<br />
<br />
<br />
Paludal, DS Peaks, and Tier 1 PoP zones pretty much killed dungeons in norrath other than the occasional adventurous group or high level farmer.  Pre-PoP, I'd go to Chardok and see from 18-30+ people in there after the revamp.  It was a great dungeon.  CT was the same way.  Now I can go to either zone and it's surprising if there are double digits in zone.  A lot of the midlevel dungeons were great but always underused due to the risk of a wipeout and incredibly painful CR at those levels.  Take that PoP GY idea and apply it to those dungeons where it's actually needed!  Make levelling up an adventure in itself again instead of just an uphill grind to be done as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't buy the difficult=time premise.  There is nothing difficult or hard about everquest.  There never was.  It takes a little common sense and knowing when to hit the button for the pellet.<br />
<br />
Teaching a dog how to drive is difficult.  You want everquest to be difficult, try playing it while underwater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't buy the difficult=time premise.<br />
In a pay for play model, it has too.<br />
Otherwise why continue to play once you have &quot;won&quot; the game. It's so easy to get to 65 and tons of AA now that you can be maxed out in less then 2 months even as a casual gamer. Sure, you can then go on your raiding and uber mob hunting, but that is less then 1/2 of the game. It's really the only part of the game that is left to do then.<br />
<br />
The basic incentive of the game is to build your character up to as strong as possible within your means. This is done through EXP and Gear. The exp portion of the game has been almost completely removed now. Which leaves only gear and chasing the carrot that way.<br />
<br />
Mudflation has finally caught up to EQ to the extreme, and there isn't much they can do to get it back to a balanced level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A game is only difficult while it remains unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
EQ beta was the most difficult game I've ever played, as far as an online game goes. I remember dying every day. No, dying every hour. Why? Because things were new, I did not know what to expect. Who could have thought a glowing blue thingy can kick your ass more thoroughly than any six orcs in EC?<br />
<br />
Even if they reactivate the code they used on the day of release--with no expasions, no improvements, and all the bugs--EQ would still no longer be difficult. Everyone's experienced now--we know exactly what to expect from each type of exp mobs, and we know exactly what to do in order to kill them and gain optimal exp.<br />
<br />
Playing EQ now is like beating any other game for the 50th time. You know how to beat it, it just takes time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A game is only difficult while it remains unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfamiliarity certainly makes things difficult but there are other ways a game could be difficult. But in EQ all the mobs you fight have close to zero ability to adapt to what goes on. Thats why EQ is &quot;easy&quot; - it can be extremely predictable.<br />
<br />
But I think we all know what makes EQ a LOT less predictable and WAY more difficult - grouping with people that are not as knowledgable/uber/experienced as you are. So if you want a challenge try playing with people you never met before ;-)<br />
<br />
My hope is still that WoW will have monsters that are much better at adjusting to what happens around them and will scale in difficulty with how many and how well equipped the people that try to kill them are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Looking at all the advantages everyone has now compared to four years ago then the game has definitely gotten much easier.  Not it's also easier for people who have been playing that long to go back and start a young char because you know the best places to go for everything.  For someone brand new it's still difficult, but not nearly as bad as it used to be.  I hated that tree in blackburrow and it wasn't easy finding to someone to go on a corpse run then, especially before corpse dragging.  Although all these new folks don't get to experience the power of the spell formerly known as sense magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree for the most part.  One of my fondest memories was when I originally started playing EQ a few years ago.  Me and a couple of friends were trying to run from Qeynos to Freeport. We had no sow because that had to have been a godlike spell that not many were willing to share with others.  We hit East Karana then ran into some big trouble in the gorge area.  A couple of my friends died and started the trek again.  I was so scared to run through the West Commons because I heard just how tough it was.   Then finally we hit Freeport.  Luckily we had someone in our group to bind us all because none of us could afford the 5 or 10pp for someone else to bind us.  The adventure had taken so long that we were all tired and decided to camp for the night.  I've never forgotten that day, it was so much fun learning the geography and exploring new places.<br />
<br />
However, I really doubt that there's tons of people that would tell you they play this game for the lower end game.  We probably would all love to see ourselves as powerful characters, enjoying the high end game to the fullest.  Everquest has now made that easier to achieve.  While I am grateful for some of the new changes, I still do miss the 'good ole days'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">EQ has gotten incredibly easy. With each expansion leveling becomes more and more trivialized. And I have to admit, at times I truely miss playing in those pre-kunark days when everywhere you went you were terrified of dying and permanetly loosing your corpse.<br />
<br />
I find myself playing a completely different game now. I drone on casting the same spells in the same order in both groups and raids. No longer am I terrified of dying, death now simply means a 10-20 minute delay between casting those same spells again.<br />
<br />
The one remedy I have found is this: challenge yourself. Take an unlikely partner and try to duo things you wouldn't normally dare to. The most fun I've had in years now is taking a cleric friend, promising eachother to only cast heals, and seeing how far we can get in CoD by purely meleeing everything. The exp was horrible, but I haven't laughed because I felt so helpless like that in years!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmm, if I get really bored, I might make a chanter on that new server and charm solo to 60 real fast, find a copy of KEI, LOL ya right, and be the SHIZNIT for the entire server for a long ass time.  <br />
Nah, but good plan eh? <br />
<br />
Can you imagine the difficulty of getting certain high level spells on this new server?  Hmm, KEI can be researched now tho can't it?  That would make it much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's so easy to get to 65 and tons of AA now that you can be maxed out in less then 2 months even as a casual gamer.<br />
<br />
I have read this type of statement over and over again during the past couple of years or so I&#8217;ve played EQ and I have to strongly disagree with it.  Can it be done by a level 65 player tweaking his alt like crazy and power leveling him? Perhaps.  Can it be done by someone who has never played the game before and had to earn his own gear?  No way in Hades.  <br />
<br />
As I said, I&#8217;ve been playing the game for over two years and my highest level character is level 52.  And I usually play about 40 hours a week.  Yes the game has become easier.  And for power gamers who do nothing but grind away for experience day after day I&#8217;m sure they can achieve high levels much faster then they could when the game was first released.  But faster is a relative term.  I solo and group for experience and even do raids from time to time.  But I also practice baking, tailoring and smithing and brewing and pottery and fishing and swimming.  I spend time in newbie zones helping out other players like I was helped out when I first started playing.  And I spend time doing quests and working on my faction, among other things.  There are a lot of things to do in this game besides leveling.  <br />
<br />
For me the changes have been, for the most part, welcomed ones.  I like the fact that I don&#8217;t have to spend 45 minutes going from Butcherblock to Freeport.  I greatly enjoy being able to see weapon and armor stats, and who can use them, before I buy them.  And I think its great that players have new character races to choose from.  Maybe a lot of people do reach 65th level quickly, but if they&#8217;re having fun doing so then more power to them.  I&#8217;m still doing all the things I enjoy doing and since this game isn&#8217;t a race their getting to 65th level before me doesn&#8217;t bother me in the least.  I really am sorry if some people don&#8217;t enjoy the game as much as they used to.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean the rest of us are miserable.  And if you really aren&#8217;t having fun any more, perhaps its time to fine a new game and new goals to reach.  I quit playing UO after a year and a half because I consistently found myself becoming bored shortly after logging in.  For most of us there just comes a point when its time to move on.  And if you&#8217;re no longer having fun in EQ, perhaps that time has come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played EQ a while back (pre-Luclin) and managed to get a Dwarf Pally to level 37. The constantly horrendous timesinks in travelling (no Sow, sitting on boats, etc), begging for binds, looking for ports, and paying everyone and their alt plat to help me do things I thought should be frreely available to all lead to the game becoming tedious and boring. So I quit playing.<br />
<br />
This time I was a bit wiser in my knowledge of the game and am playing a Barb Shammy that has capabilities for travelling, tradeskills, and getting along without the constant aid of others. This char was started from scratch, is not twinked, and has reached level 37 over the course of casual playing in about 3 months. Knowledge of the game has made it easier, and some of the game changes have made it easier. But there is no way I could have leveled up to 65 in so short a time - unless I played 24x7 and made EQ the exclusive aspect of my life. And even then I'm not so sure. I have even read all I can on this and many other EQ message boards and sites and have not gone into any encounter totally blind. Yet I've still died an average of once a level (at least). <br />
<br />
I wish all of you &quot;old people&quot; would stop complaining that things just aren't the same as the &quot;good old days.&quot; In this case, you CAN start over. Give it a try. No twinking allowed. No PLing allowed. No trader bots. No multi-boxing. I bet the old will become new again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Thorzion -<br />
a new &quot;no transfer&quot; server will be much of what you say - but consider some of the other changes.<br />
<br />
one example:  SOW will be available within hours - up to level 10 there is no death penalty and when ya die ya don't have to do a CR - you pop at bind with all gear.  Level 9 for Shaman SOW will happen the first day - easily.  Druid SOW as well.<br />
<br />
Very few will be seeing Norrath for the first time - so many will be racing to the camps they have planned on for equipment drops.  SSoY used to be uber, but you can farm Velium weapons with similar procs from Tizmaks now.<br />
<br />
Friends will start together, grouping immediately and min/maxing their way to Paludal that first day. .<br />
<br />
Yes, but how many of those folks are actually gonna be able to make it in Paladual chain and recondite weapons?  Me? Im starting a shaman and an SK and heading to Kunark as fast as I can.  How many folks do you think are gonna be headed to Kaesora or Droga as soon as they can?  I sure will be, cause thats where the gear and exp really starts to get good.  And ya know what?  While the exp in Paladual at 12 to 25 is insanely good its almost as good in Kerra Ridge (off Toxx).  And I can bet that I wont have to deal with nearly as many wankers there..probably only a few.<br />
<br />
And while I do agree that the game has gotten easier over the years I still think that it is because of the availibility of easy buffs and an overabundance of good gear.  On a new server you wont see any  of that gear for months.  I can go to the Bazaar today and see crafted armor on sale for less than the cost of the gems it needs to make it.  But I also remember when I saw my first set of crafted on a level 49 warrior in EC. I was amazed at it..even more so when I inspected him and saw all the stats and spells that it had.  You know how long it was till that stuff became common?  about 9 months.  Till it became cheap?  about 16 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I hate the grind as much as anyone.  Hell, I'm still doing it 4+ years after I started in phase 4.  But I will say this for grinding: it teaches you the game.  I'm not talking about kiting HGs around Rathe Mountains for 5 minutes a pop.  I'm not talking about single pulling a blue to a group of six.  you may as well buy yourself a level 65 ______ on ebay.  <br />
<br />
raise your hand if you ever died in a group with a druid who had spent his life kiting.  or a warrior who didn't know about taunt.  or watched a wizard die because he chain nuked as hard as he could even when he was getting pounded.  <br />
<br />
People always say this game requires no skill to reach 50 or 60 or 65.  Yep.  you're absolutely right, it just takes time.  But the people who are worth their salt at 50/60/65 didn't take the path of least resistance.  What has happened with the latest expansions is that people are losing the avenues to pick up that skill.<br />
<br />
For those of you who played pre-Kunark, what did you learn from xping in Sol B? Lower Guk? Unrest? Mistmoore? Splitpaw?  you learned how to play your class and you learned how to do it well.  playing over your head makes you better.  you learn your strengths and weaknesses and you learn how to complement other classes.  can you learn it in a group of six level 40s single pulling giants in DL outside of KC?  or in Luclin?  or in PoP?  not a chance.  you learn the basics... warrior engages early, shaman slows, druid/ranger snares, mage/necro sends in pet, etc.  i've met level 50+ enchanters who didn't know what color flux was or why it might be useful.  It's mind-boggling.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to disparage the folks who came to the game later.  It has gotten easier to advance, a lot of it's because people don't have to wait on a list for hours to get a group.  I'm thankful I don't have to do that anymore.  But I'm sorry verant took the easy way out and made lots of big outdoor zones with easy single pulls.  That's what took the soul away from EQ, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Find the people on your server who are good.  who are really good.  i guarantee they learned from grinding xp in groups in dungeons.  That is the part of the game that I feel is gone and it's a shame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I disagree with the idea that graveyards are a bad idea: the skill factor is in not getting killed rather than being good at CRs.<br />
<br />
My group is sticking at 60, doing Kunark dungeons when we can.  But we are all mature adult players so our playing time is limited.  Not having graveyards is about the only thing we miss from PoP - sometimes we can't go deep into a dungeon simply because we wouldn't have the time to do a CR if things went pear-shaped.<br />
<br />
I do agree that PoP allows the low skills player to progress and do well.  But thats always been SOE's intent: to maximise the number of people who are able to play the game, not limit it to a few skilled players.  They have developed the perfect paradigm: Bobo the clown can fool himself he's uber by being the deputy healer for the 3rd assistant slower in his guild, and get the phat lewts by doing this.  And then when he's not off zerging he can exp. in Dreadlands of Valor.  If he enjoys that great - its not my cup of tea but it doesn't give me any problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its going to be the biggest opportunity for the 'Jerry Springer' set this year.  There will be a high-stakes race to become the dominant guild on the server - with all the ebaying privileges this brings.  We can expect to see groups of them levelling 24/7.  I wonder how long it will take them to get level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I started playing November 30, 2003.. I only had the regular everquest no expansions.. OMG the game sucks.. ya great you and your 20 closest friends spent 3 hours running from halas to freeport then 5 levels later you ran another 3 hours back to train and buy spells, then you ran for 2 hours back, died in the middle 4 hours later you got your body 2 hours later you are in freeport. WOOT what a good day. It's adventure, but it's also a lot of frustration that's unneeded. At higher levels you probably pressed the num lock key went afk and came badck to see if you're half way through the karanas yet.. <br />
<br />
I died in the karanas when I went to talk to some bandits in the middle somewhere (Level 14, I thought they were pcs).. You know how long it took to get my body back.. NOT worth my time, I then went and bought EQ gold.. The game is great. I'm constantly seeing new zones and being amazed at what I see.. read you have taken 20,000 damage.. falling off of a FAKE bridge in the deep.. A friend died with me and you know what he said when he was done for the night? &quot;Thank you for bringing me along, this was really fun and I would have never seen it if it wasn't for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
This game, just like anything else is what you make of it. I'm level 61 now 1 blue from 62 and 8aa strong and I die about 10 times a day now questing.. you know what? I don't care at all.. i can get the xp back in no time and have FUN, 2 hours in pov inner (which I can almost always get). and I can die hundreds of times and come out on top.. <br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but if you have to grind 8 hours for a blue in freakin Velks (level 58 I duoed there for 2 hours straight and got about 2 tics).. if you die won't you get PISSED OFF? I just wasted 2 hours worth of my life now because I just died.. <br />
<br />
I raid and I die more than anyone else.. Siludorf take the HT etc.. I gladly do it, hey how about a nice malo before you turn the lights off? It's fun to do what I want.. when I want to not have to worry about an 8 hour grind..<br />
<br />
As far as skill goes I had a 52 paladin tank for me in pon doing with me as healer and slower.. we constantly pulled no down time decent xp (me at level 60).. <br />
<br />
If you see someone who you consider not to have skills don't just think they haven't played enough, some ppl just can't play or don't want to learn how to play.. they want to do what they want to do.. the warrior wants to max the damn taunt he thinks it helps,.. you think after a year grinding in velks he's going to suddenly say gee maybe mashing this thing is not helping.. NOPE! You think that ranger who runs or call evac at the drop of a dime, after calling evac and being the only guy to live (him calling evac kills the group) for 1 year in velks will cause him to suddenly play his best role and not run? No way he's going to think these guys are dumb, when I say run they should run, I'm not going to stick and snare etc.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">khozik,<br />
<br />
You said you started playing 11/30/03 and you're now level 61 with 8aa almost to 62.  And you don't think that's too fast to progress????<br />
<br />
I would bet money you've not seen/experienced 1/3 of what is out there for the mid levels as you come up.  You say you have fun seeing new zones now, but what about all the zones you totally skipped and won't ever experience at the correct levels because you took the fast xp path?<br />
<br />
Some of the best times I had in EQ were in my 30s and 40s exploring mid level dungeons and pushing my character to it's limits and beyond.  It took me well over a year to reach level 60, but it was fun all along the way.  Most people now seem to ignore the great dungeons and zones out there to experience and explore at those levels and that's just sad for a few reasons: <br />
<br />
1-there is a TON of this game world devoted to content for those low-mid levels that is mostly wasted now.  High end zones are crowded as hell because everyone wants to power through those levels to get 'uber'.  'uber' is relative.  You can be an 'uber' level 20 or an 'uber' level 65.<br />
<br />
2-the majority of those players powering through the low-mid levels to 60+ in a few months are, quite frankly, ****ty players.  No, it doesn't take a massive amount of skill to play EQ.  But it does take a fair amount of knowledge of your class as well as others to be good.  You gain that knowledge as you level up by pushing your character and groups to their limits, not by single pulling to camp in outdoor zones for 3 months.<br />
<br />
3-The sense of accomplishment is diminished when it's easy.  It's hard to understand until you've done it really.  powering up to 65 and grabbing some essential AAs then joining the best guild you can is great to boost that magelo, but I just can't imagine what it's like for some of our new recruits who've never been on a vox/naggy raid, ToV or Kael other than some arena farming, and so on.<br />
<br />
I've been in 3 guilds throughout my 3-years in EQ.  The first one was a mostly 30-40 guild.  We actually raided places like Kaesora, Droga, Dalnir, Mistmoore, and so on.  It was incredibly fun, albeit at times frustrating as hell when we wiped and had painful CRs (see my above post about putting GYs in mid level dungeons to encourage exploration of them)  That guild fell apart and the next guild I joined raided Fear, Hate, did epics and the like.  Nice solid, steady progression.  And lastly, I joined my current guild who at the time was raiding HoT, Vindi, Velk, and since then we worked on through Statue, Tormax, Yeli, NToV, Luclin, and PoP content to the Elemental Planes.  I feel like Sciek has a history and can look back and see the progression through all the levels.  Seems like many of the newer players miss those experiences as they come up and IMO that's their loss.</div></div><hr />

This isn't about EQ not being fun anymore, just that it has become easier then ever and there is a fine line between Risk VS Reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brad was the worst thing that ever happened to EQ.  Now the old guard have gone and the vision has been given the unmourned death it deserved the game is a lot more enjoyable, but even so, EQ still eats up way too much time of many people.  The difficulty of EQ has been shifted from pointless grinds and timesinks and frustration to high level raiding content.  It's not perfect by any means, but EQ is a lot more enjoyable and accessable now that it ever was.  And yeah, I was there in the bad old days.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to Sigil producing their first game.  If it's anything like EQ was when it was released I'm going to enjoy trashing it loudly and long.</div></div><hr />

Probably more then you would expect. Still, the server population will be low so it won't much matter but I wouldn't expect to be the only veteran player that knows how to level in out of the way zones with less then optimal gear. <br />
<br />
Back to the main topic...<br />
<br />
EQ never was exceptionally hard, it just had harsher penalties for doing something stupid. As someone who's already dealt with those penalties, I'm happy they're not there anymore. As someone who groups with people that never learned from their own mistakes, I hate that they're not there anymore. But I can't have it both ways. In the end, I like not having the &quot;run through 4 zones/wait for boat/ride boat/run through 4 more zones/hope I don't die and have to do it all over again because I don't have bind and cannot find anyone to help me because I play at off hours&quot; type of corpse runs a whole lot more then I dislike running into idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;Back in the good old days I had to walk up hills both ways to get my trainer to kill me and drop me 5 levels just to learn my True North spell, and I liked it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Descriptions of the &quot;good ole days&quot; are the very reason I refused to consider playing the game. &quot;Yeah, me and my guild spent a week online waiting for our turn to kill XMob for that really cool drop. Of course, I lost my job and my wife divorced me but a warrior in our guild finally got a SSoY.&quot;  Yeah, sounds like fun.......(Evercrack addict!)<br />
<br />
Grinding xp for 40 hours to get one blue is not my idea of fun. Neither is taking an hour to get from Freeport to Butcherblock. I just don't get how experiencing any of these timesinks makes one a better player. I would have to agree with Ronax. There was nothing hard about EQ from the beginning, just time consuming.<br />
 <br />
I finally broke down and bought EQ after Luclin was released after a friend convinced me things had changed. I started with a Halfling Druid and nearly drowned in Rivervale before realizing I could change the gamma setting. After several nights of playing, I had proudly reached level 5. I had no money, no spells beyond my first 2 but it was cool.<br />
<br />
Since then, I have learned how to play the game, read various online guides and have a 44th level Shaman as my main. And I have enjoyed it.<br />
The game was unfamilar to me so it was a challenge. As I played more and more, it became easier.<br />
<br />
The game has changed over time. It has become more accessible to the casual gamer. For those of you who view Norrath as your private playground, TFB. SOE has a right to make money since that is why they exist and casual players have a right to play EQ. This may mean that some hard-core individuals can power their way up to 65 (Though not without outside help) but if that is what they need to do to enjoy the game then So What?<br />
<br />
The ability of someone to play EQ is not based on whether they are &quot;old school&quot; or a relative newcomer but rather a matter of the intelligence of the person behind the avatar. One way or another, the smart people will learn how to play their class regardless of in which zones they leveled. Besides, if it really bothers you that someone doesn't know how to play his or her class, do something about it.<br />
<br />
The game will always be what YOU make it. And remember that it is just a game. HAVE FUN!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly right and I love PoK because it takes most of the obnoxious, unnecessary timesinks out of the game: travelling.  I don't miss the haul from Halas to Freeport one bit.  It was exciting the first couple times when it was still new, but about hte 3rd time i crossed WK, I was ready for a nice teleport (which there used to be if you were heading from NK from QH, til they fixed it).<br />
<br />
I would have to agree with Ronax. There was nothing hard about EQ from the beginning, just time consuming.<br />
<br />
That's flat out wrong.  There's plenty of hard stuff.  If you haven't experienced it, I'm sorry.  You're missing out on a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
I think what you meant is that it's not hard to advance in the game, which is basically true.  It's time-consuming and tedious, but not &quot;hard&quot;.  <br />
 <br />
The ability of someone to play EQ is not based on whether they are &quot;old school&quot; or a relative newcomer but rather a matter of the intelligence of the person behind the avatar. One way or another, the smart people will learn how to play their class regardless of in which zones they leveled.<br />
<br />
I will respectfully disagree with you on this as well.  Old-school hasn't got anything to do with it, yes.  But, I'd put a fair amount of money on there being a strong correlation between the talent of a particular player with the zones they leveled in: good players generally come out of dungeon groups, bad ones come out of groups in large, open zones.<br />
<br />
I've also known a lot of smart people who are terrible at EQ.  Like anything else, intelligence isn't the end-all of ability.  Check the IQs of professional athletes, i bet they're not in the top 1%.  Ability in EQ comes from a flexible and creative mind and experience with your chosen class in situations where that flexibility and creativity is strained.<br />
<br />
And remember that it is just a game. HAVE FUN!<br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever agreed with this.  I have trouble articulating why exactly, but it's more than a game.  I played competitive sports for a long time and this is probably closer to a sport or a hobby, than a game.  People dump their time and money into hobbies, but not games.  People get passionate about sports, but not games.  I don't mean to sound like a raving lunatic about EQ... I play less than 10 hours a week, but I've been puttin in those 10 hours/week for over 4 years.  I get passionate about EQ.  I devote significant time and energy into it...  All of that is trivialized by saying, 'it's just a game.'<br />
<br />
But I do have fun.  EQ is always fun in the end, even if the road is bumpy sometimes :)</div></div><hr />
