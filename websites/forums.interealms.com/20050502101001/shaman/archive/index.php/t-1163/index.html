<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild's at the point where we do VS everytime our rotation comes up, and I'd like to help. Plus I hear the exp is nice in HS.<br />
<br />
But the downside is that with my OT gate hammer I can gate anytime I want and gate back to whereever I'm hunting. =/ <br />
<br />
What did the rest of you evil shamans do and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've got a gate hammer due to the old Howling Stones faction bug - hunt there enough and the faction rolled over.<br />
<br />
The OT outpost really is a hole, its expensive and limited n supplies. Got Luclin? Bind yourself up there, buy all the vendor spells you're going to need to 60 and trash that faction. You can use the gate hammer to travel still as you can avoid/outrun the KOS mobs where you gate to.<br />
<br />
Howling stones is such fun, don't deny yourself the fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm... I guess I'll wreck it. ;) Maybe i'll get lucky and get the bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They fixed that a while ago, it was the only faction it happened with, I think. <br />
<br />
If you get to go on and live through Kunark dragon raids you get +VS faction tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am considering doing the same - is hard to part with.  Selling prices are fine as long as you sell to the DE guy - not those clockwork peeps.  Is just such a useful thing to be able to gate there whenever and pick up supplies or grab stuff from the bank.  The problem I find with relying on being bound in the bazaar is that I am always asked to bind near where we are fighting when doing raids or stuff.<br />
<br />
Every day it is becoming more tempting to trash it - especially with the ability to gate to thurg with the potions.  Cant see my VS faction staying high for much longer.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also bear in mind that if you ever want to do the VP key quest you pretty much will have to trash it as you need to fight in KC.  Think it is a piss poor show by verant making the OT run on such an important faction - all the good races would be pretty pissed off if some of the best xp zone for them and a zone you  must fight in for the VP key trashed their FV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OT faction is not really important. I'm kos and still use my gate hammer every day.<br />
<br />
When you hammer in, you only have to kill one green skeleton. Run off the boat towards the hill and kill him. Then invis up and run over the water to the other side of the Outpost.<br />
<br />
To buy supplies in OT use the Iksar vendor at the mudpit. He cons indifferent.<br />
<br />
You can still use the bank in the Outpost when you are kos. You just have to use it from 8pm-6am gametime. That's when the General goes out on patrol. Just invis past the Cliff Golem until you get inside the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good to know, thanks shin. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't wreck your faction!  It's not worth it.  Sure, you can hunt in KC and Howling Stones, but there are so other and better places to hunt of for xp.  You can hunt in Seb, Solb, the Hole, Kedge, the Deep, Fungus Grove, the Grey, Maiden's Eye, Akheva Ruins, Acrylia Caverns, Umbral Plains, Kael, Thurgadin B, Skyshrine, Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, Wakening Lands, Skyfire, Burning Woods, Chardok, and Siren's Ghetto.  Why would you want to trash the faction of VS when you have so so so many other places to hunt?  I wish I had my faction back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been on VS raids for 3 of our guild wizards in the last month or so and am still amiable to outpost (I'll fix it back to amiable if it drops below)<br />
<br />
Hunting in HS or Kaesora though will drop your faction to KOS in a matter of hours though, HS especially.<br />
<br />
I've often thought about trashing my VS faction, but I just like to have a few places that I'm not KOS to in game, and I use the gate hammer a lot ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OT faction is worthless if you have Luclin.  You can bank safely in the evening in OT when the goons go out.  Bind in Nexus, kill where you want, and don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kept my faction and still have it at lvl 60, dont see why the need to destroy it myself.<br />
<br />
So you cant hunt in karnors or howling stones, plenty of other zones.  You can still kill VS, just run down with a group and only kill the stuff KOS to you (IE undead and such) as VS has no faction hit on him.<br />
<br />
Gate hammer is a nice toy, even tho OT is a load of crap and I wish verant would notice that and update it somehow, put some nice VS faction quests in and such to make it worthwhile to have the faction.  Everyone I know ditched it because of this...<br />
<br />
VS faction is also quite cool in karnors, some mobs aint kos to you so you can just walk on past em and take the mobs you want, people will wonder *** your doing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Venril Sathir doesn't give negative VS faction, neither does anything in the basement *except* verix kylox himself - and you won't be killing him much while doing VP key i can assure you.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't trash VS, it's good. HS xp is NOT all it's said to be....lots of light blue mobs at higher levels, and it's dangerous + a biatch to get a group there (and stay).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At the moment I'm indifferent to VS, and the dogs in KC con KoS to me. Basically I have to kill them to get to VS, even if I don't touch them, or slow, or heal. I still manage to take a faction hit(not sure why).<br />
<br />
Yes, I could go hunt sarnak berserkers after every VS raid, but I don't see how it's really worth the trouble. EQ has enough timesinks as it is without me having to create another one, just so I can bank in the OT between 6am and 8pm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have zero desire to wait till between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. to go to the bank. :P  That sounds like a big fat pain.  Heck with that.  The whole point of going to the Outpost is convenience.  Bind where you're fighting, loot up crap loots you otherwise might have let rot, or get your bags overstuffed with things you want to keep, and get to a bank almost instantly, unload your stuff, sell your crap, restock food/water for everybody and maybe bandages for your monk twink, and gate back.<br />
<br />
Messing up the faction accomplishes pretty much nothing for you, in return.  And getting it back is a gigantic pain.<br />
<br />
I've killed Venril a fair share of times, hunted the VP key piece for hours and hours on multiple occasions in Karnors, and I'm still amiable and I think even ally to most Outpost mobs.  <br />
<br />
However, despite people telling me time and again that hunting the VP key piece in Karnors wouldn't give any faction hits, I found out repeatedly that they were wrong.  There are numerous mobs there that give you faction hits besides Kylox or whatever the heck that guy's name is.<br />
<br />
Take the two paragraphs above and work them together.  <br />
<br />
You'll lose faction, but the faction hits in Karnors are tiny.  It takes a good long while to really screw yourself up too badly.  <br />
<br />
Just stay the heck away from Howling Stones.  You'll blow your faction almost instantly, and with so many other good zones in the game, it's very silly to do it.  Yes, HS is great for experience, but even if you don't think you're not giving up much, you're getting even less.  One more zone to fight in -- big deal.</div></div><hr />
