<br />
Item Decay. Wouldn't be so bad if there were ways to prevent it (ala The Realm) but given item decay AND the 'brain trusts' long standing aversion to allowing &quot;too much loot&quot; into the game as well as drop rates -no thank you.<br />
<br />
What my EQ 2 Shaman Epic BROKE ?<br />
<br />
No character transfer.  Hmm, so I spent 3+ years (longer for others) developing my little bunch of pixels and you want me to START OVER?  No thank you.<br />
<br />
On the plus side I heard EQ 2 has a really cool new graphics engine. Woot! Way to go for that DAOC crowd.<br />
<br />
Oh and as Zorlac said - the same bunch of geniuses who gave Norrath Shard Farming and other Luclin time sinks are apparently in charge of EQ 2.  Wow.</div></div><hr />

If SoE are such a bunch of *******s why d you and thousands of others insist of playing the game? Obviously they've done something right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Verant did something right, not SOE.  Now I have a lot of time invested in EQ, friends I don't want to leave behind, and some pretty lackluster options in the other MMOGs out there.  Sigil games looks promising, aparently they have some people from the original EQ team.  Could be years before they have something going though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, from what I understand Sony has owned everquest from before release.  Verant was unable to complete it on their own, and sold out.  Of course, Qeynos could be just a homage to their future bosses.<br />
In the end, they were working for a boss.  Since then there have been different teams, all working for the same boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sony owned it, but many of the people who put their hearts into the game were still there for a good while.  They're all but gone now, and it shows.</div></div><hr />

If they suck, I'll play WoW.  I will continue to play EQ, no matter how bad it gets, because I have already invested so much time in to my characters.  If EQ2 sucks in the same way that LDoN sucks, I'll have no reason to even start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have tried every new game up to DAoContent.  I am sure I will give EQII a try.  <br />
<br />
I started with Meridian 59 then to UO the EQ then tried AC then back to EQ all of this is with some other tries at minor titles.  Every time a new game was on the horizon I said &quot;No, I am happy where I am at&quot; but a month or two after the new game came out I tried it until AC.  I was totally bored by AC and went back to EQ and subsequently started to pay more attention to hidden messages in the hype in the up coming games there after.<br />
<br />
Something about the attitude of the folks behind DAoC irritated me and I can't say why.  EQII is the first new game that has caught my attention and it is not just because of the connection to EQ and SoE.<br />
<br />
As far as Verant they had their share of screwed up ideas that made EQ terribly painful if not addictive to play in the beginning.  I know one of the original programers of EQ in RL and from what he said it make me think that Verant built a game that they likeD and really did not give much thought to what the players may want.  It just so happend that most of what the developers wanted in a game the general gaming public did also.  BUT, where the opinions differed AS LONG AS VERANT WAS IN CHARGE THE PUBLIC'S SUGGESTIONS WOULD FALL ON DEAF EARS.  I am glad that some changes have been made but SoE has gone too far and dumbed the game down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate how people use this argument.  It would be impossible for them to allow transfers to a game thats completley different!  Anyways, would you really want maxed out chars. in a completely new game, missing out on all that content?  I must not understand something.</div></div><hr />

I'll probably only play WoW if it's better than Everquest (which I expect it to be) and if it attracts a large following to populate the servers.<br />
<br />
As for the starting over arguement; to me, it doesn't matter if I have to spend six months getting experience to max out all the new AAs from a new expansion or if I have to spend six months getting experience to max out the experience levels from a new game, it's still experience grinding.  The content that I'm exploring while I'm doing it is the important part.</div></div><hr />

What makes you think that people weren't trying to hack EQ from day one? Blizzard is quite sick of people hacking their system, but they never had enough people devoted to it to really keep ahead of the hackers. That's why battle.net was free. With a monthly subscription there is no reason that WoW should suffer from these sorts of exploits any more than EQ does, and I would even venture to say you'll see less of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sorta non of the above on the poll.  Will I try out EQII?  Yeah, since a lot of RL buds are so I'll give em the first months free trial.  Will I play longer?  Really depends on how we all like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I will never again pay a monthly fee for an on-line game.  There are enough other games out there multi player included that I only have to pay a one time charge for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm enjoying EQ but I'm definitely read for something new and different.  IMO, all recent MMORPG titles either suck or aren't worth playing.  I'm hoping that either WoW or EQ2 end up being at least worth trying.<br />
<br />
I'm also hoping that Sigil is in fact working on something.  I'm guessing that Sigil is working on a new MMORPG and that they aren't leaking info because one of the things that always happens when an MMORPG is in dvelopment, as is evidcenced repeatedly in posts like this, is that hype and misinformation run rampant and it leads to people ranting without a clue on forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never noticed any hacks/exploits on EQ when I played EQ awhile back (3 years). Back then you could accually find 2 or 3 GM's on at a the same time, at least on The Rathe. Perhaps now since there is a lack of people watching over the game, doing whatever else they are doing (pretty sure they aren't on Planetside... anyone who plays that would sure know why I say that.) let's more hacks/exploits to slip through. Hopefully Blizzard will have plenty of people devoted to WoW and when they decide to move on, find someone just as good. Doesn't seem like SoE has been doing to well at that lately. Who knows =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I know one of the original programers of EQ in RL and from what he said it make me think that Verant built a game that they likeD and really did not give much thought to what the players may want. It just so happend that most of what the developers wanted in a game the general gaming public did also.<br />
<br />
If I were making a computer game, that's exactly how I would make it also. People who make these games are just people, like us. They've probably played lots of different games, like us. They found things they liked in various games, and things they didnt like. They made the game and tried to include all the things they liked. They made the game - not us. <br />
<br />
Why do people think they have the right to tell them how to make the game? Do they sit and write to all the makers of their other computer games and tell them how their games should work? Do they write to their favorite author and tell him the ending to his latest book sucked, and he needs to change it? Your subscription fee does not give you that power. The only thing your subscription fee gives you is the power to say whether you enjoy the game or not - by either renewing it, or cancelling it.<br />
<br />
BUT, where the opinions differed AS LONG AS VERANT WAS IN CHARGE THE PUBLIC'S SUGGESTIONS WOULD FALL ON DEAF EARS.<br />
<br />
As you so aptly put it, Verant - and now SOE - is in charge. They make the game. We, the public, are consumers. I know that the American public has this notion that services you pay for have to bow to every demand that you make, because for many of you that is the only power you ever have in your life - but it's not always the case. There is only so much that they will do to keep you happy, and at some point they will tell you to just take your business elsewhere.<br />
<br />
However, because of the nature of Everquest as an ongoing, evolving game - we do have an option to present feedback to those people who make the product. It's an option - not a mandate, for either us or them. Too many people use this to issue demands to the staff, probably in much the same manner as you see these rants and petition posts on message boards time and again. If it were me, those would be ignored. Maybe once in a while, if I had time to kill, I would read one and probably chuckle at it. Once in a long, long while I might wade through a 50 post thread and see what people had to say. <br />
<br />
The ones I would read would be the ones that were simple, direct suggestions worded politely instead of written with the tone of a 6-year old who isnt getting what he wants. But that wouldnt mean those suggestions would ever come to pass, but at least they'd get noticed. Once in a while, though, there might be a damn good idea that perhaps got lost in all the mounds of negative clutter on the class message boards. At least half a dozen things that I've given feedback on, in this way, have come to pass. It does work.<br />
<br />
I'm not slamming you, Sionnach, so dont be offended. I quoted you because your comment is what got me to reply, and the rest is just the thoughts that finally came out - about this message board and the attitude here. I wont pine about what the Crucible once was and now isnt, but I hope some people will read this and perhaps get a little perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I will most likely try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Absolutely not, unless they completely change it and take out all the features I loathe - item decay? I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am not sure what to make of your caveat Steel.  You are slamming me so it is silly and insulting to say you aren&#8217;t.  Just quote me if you don&#8217;t agree and take my reaction or lack of one.  I find it really odd that I more or less support SoE in a thread that is negative yet you select my post as indicative of the anti-SoE whinny public.  I don&#8217;t think you really have any idea as to what I was saying.<br />
<br />
My statement that the original developers of EQ did not take public desires into consideration is not necessarily negative.  It is just the way that they originally approached creating the game AND it is just my feeling listen to this EQ programmer.  But after the game is out in the world or any product for that matter, a producer would be stupid to continue with elements of that product that the public does not care for.  I used to own an off -license, you know a Mom and Pop shop.  You can certainly believe that I paid attention to suggestions or even demands that my customers made and if enough folks asked for the same thing I tried to give it to them or explained why I could not.  My take was that Verant was totally arrogant in their view of their product and would not make changes almost as a matter of principle.  To me that is insanity and economic suicide.  <br />
<br />
As far as complaining to companies to give my life meaning; that is a pretty arrogant assertion there mate.  You may say that you made that comment in general but the general population is made up of individuals and this time the example you selected is me so I do take it personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eq is and has been for a long time full of client side hacks. Why is it that u never noticed? Well let's see if a guy is running past u while u are sitting at a camp he could have sow on. Maybe. you are swimming and u notice some dude swimming also. He could have EB on or an eb item even. it's raining you see it guy beside u does not. A nasty dot lands on somebody and they &quot;click it off&quot; somebody falls a million meters and takes zero damage. Things like these have been in the game. How do i know about them? i read. U can click bad effects off like u would a good one and u can breathe forever u can run much faster than the best equipped bard etc. Some things are subtle some are not point is nobody would be dumb to run past u at bard speed if they are not a bard so a lot of ppl might be hacking and u never knew. With no gm's on and with the level of care from SOE this is possible and it has been for quite some time. These are all client values stored in your ram and can be changed. I don't and never did this but to me and many other ppl who read other boards it's common knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us hope Blizzard never lets it get this far.<br />

Haven't seen the same designers that made original EQ so hence it's going to be like everything post Mcquaid and is just the horrible Suck.  Trust me EQ 2 is vastly inferior to original EQ.<br />
I would rather pay to play a game like original Everquest then a flawed POS like EQ 2 which won't be finished on release.  Wait for WoW if you want to see something ground breaking.</div></div><hr />
