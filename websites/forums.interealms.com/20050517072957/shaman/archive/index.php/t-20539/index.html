<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I run the patcher, click play, and get this message...<br />
<br />
Eqgame has caused an error on &lt; unknown &gt;.  If you continue to experience problems, please restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Now, I tried deleting eqgame and rerunning patcher - still received the message.  I am pretty sure I downloaded directx9...I clicked on the download button, told it to open on the dialog box, but nothing happened after that, so I assumed it was a silent download (is that even possible?).  After that, I have no idea what is going.<br />
<br />
Has anybody experienced a similar problem that can help me out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to Run under your start bar and type dxdiag, it will tell your current DX version and a lot of other useful other info....its probably the best way to check if your Dx compliant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks helfdane, showed me that I'm still running on directx 8.1.  Just have to figure out now how to download version 9 since the official website doesn't seem to be working for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I downloaded the dxwebsetup file from the official website, but everytime I try to open it nothing happens.  I did a ctrl-alt-dlt command to even see if it was running, and it seemed to be.  But again, nothing was actively happening on my screen so I'm confused.<br />
<br />
Sorry to bug everybody, but again, can anybody help me out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you still connected? thats the version that run and downloads everything you need. Alternatively you can try windowsupdate.microsoft.com and should be able to select dx9 as one of the things to be installed there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">open internet explorer, go to tools &gt; Windows Updates. You'll have to click yes to install somethin from microsoft, then click scan for updates. from there, if you're using windows XP, it'll be under the &quot;Windows XP&quot; tab on the left. if running win98, it'll be on the critical updates option.</div></div><hr />
