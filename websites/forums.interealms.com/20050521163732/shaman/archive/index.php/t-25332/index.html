<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has gone.  On Bertox, Order of the Scattered Winds no functions as a raiding guild.  We were a Qvic geared, done-with-Time guild.  We kicked ass, we had fun.  We came, we conquered, we laughed in Quarms faces.<br />
<br />
And SOE killed us.  It wasn't WoW, it wasn't EQ2.  It was SOE, failure to manage content and class issues.  Failure to manage raid issues.  Whoever came up with the GoD content should be taken out and flogged.  It broke the backs of nearly every hard core raider, and forced many to leave...and when an alternative like WoW came along, many who were frustrated and disheartened by the direction SOE had taken jumped at the chance to try the shiny new game, and never even gave OOW a chance.<br />
<br />
I know all this has been hashed over and said before, but I have lost an organization I have grown to love because of the mismanagement of SOE.  I am angry, and am bitter and sad at the loss of such a great group of gamers.  God, we were good.<br />
<br />
SOE won't feel it for several months until current subscriptions run out, so atm they won't even comment.  But they will....EQ was such a great concept...too bad it was managed but a bunch of meatheads.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cc worth...sorry for the rant, but I felt the need to vent.<br />

When we found everything was broken, a lot of players just quit once EQ2 and WoW came out.  People were leaving even during the open beta.  That's pretty sad.  They had one expansion to show they were working to make good changes.  They didn't use it wisely. SoE gets an &quot;F&quot; for effort.</div></div><hr />

Emp is still one of my favorite raids.  If you can do HP and Cursed, Emp shouldnt be a problem (unless you lack the keys).  And remember, your Disease dots (especially w/ the new one) will allow you to do more DPS then any bane wielding melee aside from rogues.</div></div><hr />

I dont think Otani was complaining about OoW, he was complaining about Gates. He has a point, it was VERY harsh on upper level guilds. <br />
<br />
As I have said in other threads, SOE truly did mess up their expansion order. They should have released OoW, then a better, fixed-up Gates. If they had done it like that, I am betting that there wouldnt be NEARLY the mass exodus we are now seeing. Gates took many many players way down, and not JUST because the content sucked for upper guilds. It also sucked for lower players, and since PoP was the last &quot;true&quot; expansion, and LDoN was just old and boring, Gates was a kick in the teeth to EVERYONE. <br />
<br />
I am with Wulf, OoW brought it back for me. I think SOE fully realizes their mistake, and I even think they knew it when it happened, but OoW just wasnt near ready enough, and they felt they had to release SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
EQ is going through a major change. A lot of guilds are folding, a few are absorbing people and making a go of it (my guild is raiding at about 75% of our previous frequency, and have a bunch of new recruits). Its time to adapt or cave-in. There are people in all the folding guilds that STILL want to play EQ. Go find them, add them to YOUR guild, and keep going along. One thing I have noticed, the people still playing EQ are the people who LOVE to play EQ, and its fun to play with people like this, instead of those folks who you KNEW were just going through the motions. <br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about OSW Otani. A lot of good friends have left EQ. Not sure if any will be back this time, I think WoW is going to have a bit more staying power than DAoC did. But there are still guilds on Bert your level. They arent the same guilds they used to be, despite having the same names. I realize its not the same, since they arent as close friends, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

No Kidding!  I loved when FV came out as a brand-new non-transfer server.  It gave everyone a sense of newness that many players enjoyed.  Of course, the lack of no-drop and introduction of &quot;trivial&quot; loot sucked, but there was still a sense of what EQ was in its infancy- the mad dash to be the best......</div></div><hr />

For what it is worth, my casual, occasionally-Luclin-low-PoP-raiding, mostly-65, small guild is gone. The guild leader logged on the other day and the two of us advised the last remaining active member (who dind't want to leave out of loyalty) to join our sister guild. That guild has been hit hard as well, with probably half its members gone, but it's something.<br />
<br />
A close friend's guild, which was high Elemental/borderline Time, has pretty much ceased to exist as a raiding organization and he is about to cancel the account as well.<br />
<br />
It wasn't just GoD -- we certainly weren't burned out by GoD aside from the occasional &quot;I wish I hadn't spent money on it&quot; comment. It wasn't just WoW, although it lured a lot of our people away. (Including me since its system requirements are low enough so that I can play it on the road whereas I can't play EQ1 effectively.) It wasn't just EQ2, although probably half my guildies are playing it. It was a combination of all of the above happenning within less than a year and EQ2/WoW happening within the last two months.<br />
<br />
At night, I used to bump into the Bazaar limit of 500 concurrent traders all the time. Then they raised the limit. Tonight there are 150 traders on E'ci.<br />
<br />
Oh well, the game is still there and it can still be fun. I got a couple of AAs in Grieg's End the last two night (I am on vacation at home for a couple of weeks) and had a pretty good time. I just wish I could still play with friends...</div></div><hr />

No way, Eq2 has max about 300k subscribers and WoW has about 500k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ has to come to an end sometime.  I can't imagine that most guilds just disintegrate without warning unless perhaps they have managed to get by for 5+ years without using a messageboard.  Most of my own guildies have made it pretty clear where they wil end up be it WoW, EQ2, or RL after they get their fill of EQ.  Following the people who made the game a peak experience is simple in any event, and if you are not yet done with EQ, finding a guild recruiting has never been easier.<br />
<br />
The fact that SOE contributed greatly to the demise of their own game will hopefully provide future games with more insight on how to handle interactions with the playerbase and help give those future games the longevity that EQ has enjoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think everyone has different ideas as to the state of eq. But for me there was a certain loss of appeal when certain changes in the game happened. <br />
Like,* the 72 man raid.<br />
      *papercut dungeons<br />
      * Mad item inflation on raid level gear which devalued other methods of obtaining items in the game.<br />
       * Pop travel, while the concept of travelling everywhere instant isn't bad, its the way its done. There is no magic like that of say a druid stone to a pok stone.<br />
        *the change of the core activity of &quot;grinding&quot; to raiding.<br />
<br />
While, other people may have different views I believe that is what stole away some of my appeal of the game. The game is still good but the appeal of it was no longer so strong for me with those changes. However, its not really the fault of SoE asuch, since the name Qeynos, sonyeq backwards suggest SoE was behind eq from the beginning. Its just the way the developers chose to develop the game. The developers have also incidentally added a lot of good stuff to the game</div></div><hr />

He shows WoW as between 200-250K subscribers, and EQ 2 as around 150K subscribers..... then again, his numbers are made up as well. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
mcroc I agree, your estimate is in line with what I would choose if I was put on the spot.... my original post was to point out that the 1 million++ subscriptions was made up...... although everything else is too or what else is an estimate? heh, it's just in fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My best guestimate would be: <br />
<br />
WoW nearing the 400K mark, probably topping it in January, after the holiday. Just remember, not EVERY copy of the game is going to have an ongoing account. There are going to be considerable people who buy it, play the free month, and not re-new. <br />
<br />
EQ2 staying steady around the 200Kish mark, not going up or down. I think they are gaining some new people, but I also think they are losing people back to EQ1, and many to WoW.<br />
<br />
EQ1 is falling, and as subscriptions begin to run out, they will probably hit the 200K mark as well, and hover there. I think there are that many who will stay with the game, maybe not playing it as often, but that will keep their accounts active.<br />
<br />
These are all guesses, BTW, based on nothing more than my own intuition about games like this. I know that when I left to play games like DAoC and Diablo 2 for a few months, I never canceled my subscription. I think this time is differnt for EQ though, but I honestly dont see them falling below 200K for another year at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW was released on the 23rd and any account made on that day was given a 4 day extension, 24th 3 day ext, 25 2 day ext, 26th 1 day. Basicly every account purchashed so far is good until at least the 27th of dec! That means every single person who has bought WoW is still in their trial period so they are still active.</div></div><hr />

Since EQ2 hit the shelves 3 EP and 2 time guilds vanished and WoW is not even out in Europe, can't imagive what it will be after that...<br />

And no not only uber guilds took heavy looses EP guilds got hit harder imo with EQ2/WoW losses AND members jumping to uber guilds.</div></div><hr />

 SOE lent the developer of EQ 50% or about $2million to start the game, with an expected uptake of a mega 50,000 ppl playing by end of year 1. And with about 200,000 ppl at end of life 3 yrs later. EQ was never meant to be as successful as it was, it was just a game developed to get a few ppl playing yet 5yrs on the game is still going.<br />
<br />
As i say i think it will be what the other competition can offer at the high end for how long they can hold them their before expansions arise. WE knock EQ1 but SOE 90% released or announced a release as soon as a guild was basically completing last one. This way they kept ppl in it, sucking them back to get to the end, and the ppl stayed.<br />
<br />
I would like them to take a look at all the events from PoP on and retune them now for smaller forces, then look at active populations on each server maybe combine a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Blizzard announced sales of 400K + within two days of going retail.  IIRC, they announced sales of 500K within a week.  Note this was pre-Christmas and pre-Euro release. (Not sure about Asia).  I figure each of those counts as a &quot;subscription.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Anecdote - had a buddy try EQ2 then leave it for WoW.  He said that Sony made massive changes to EQ2 days prior to - or upon release.)<br />
<br />
FWIW, in Cary, N.C. (USA), at the local Wal-Mart and Best Buy there are very few (if any) copies of WoW.  You'd think it was a Monica Belluci - Jenny McCarthy pr0n video the way they can't keep it on the shelves.<br />
<br />
For the dedicated EQ1 players I wouldn't fret.  As somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if Sony turns off the servers, someone will be there to buy the license.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait until late January 26th (the day after the free month trial)to see who returns (I won't, but I'm a lone customer) and who doesn't.  <br />

<br />
There is a pretty good reason for the expansions coming out at the speed that they do, and the &quot;benefits&quot; effect everyone.  With OoW being the 8th expansion to date, most of your uber guilds have gotten even faster when it comes out to the new raid content.  The new expansions are designed partly to keep up with them.  Your non-raider doesn't necessarily need the new expansion as they tend to not blitz through the new group/solo content as quickly as your die-hard raider.  Why would the expansion effect everyone? Simple.<br />
<br />
- Raid guilds work on a tier system (X guilds in OoW, Y guilds in GoD, Z guilds in Time, etc.)  The top guilds have to move on in order for the guilds below it to progress.<br />
<br />
- Given that there are approximately 2-3 guilds in OoW, 2-3 guilds in GoD/Time, 2-3 guilds in Elementals, and approximately 3-5 guilds still chewing away at lower PoP/Luclin- that's a lot of people (approx: 400-800 active accounts from just raiders.)  Slowly down the raiding process bolos the movement through the tier systems and leaves you with disgruntled players.<br />
<br />
- SOE has very few disadvantages coming from releasing a new expansion unless it is poorly implemented (i.e. GoD), so for the most part there are few qualms coming from releasing a new product. <br />
<br />
I am not attempting to post a Pro-raider post, but looking at the number of raiding guilds on my server I have an inkling feeling that previous estimations of raiding accounts were low.  I would venture to say that in all likelyhood 50-60% of each servers' active accounts are raiders/part-time raiders and therefore, require a strong precedence for SOE to chuck out expansions to keep that playerbase occupied.  I have noticed also, that for many- once the raid is over, people log off.   That means that if there is no progression going on there is no reason for these guys to log in, and for many, that leads people to stop playing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">IT seems that this game is going through a huge influx  which has some people on edge. Personally my guild on quellious is picking up steam. A bunch of us are starting to hit 70 and we are starting to farm runes and armor in OOW as well as hitting Sol ro tower. Things are looking up for my guild and I see us lasting adleast another year if not more.<br />
<br />
People keep saying that EQ1 is dead and I think they are wrong. you have to take into account all the people who don't want to upgrade thier PC's and also the people who will not buy another game because of the time and money they have invested in EQ. It is these people that will keep the game alive. I am one of them and love the fact that it's cheap entertainment and it keeps my interest because I didn't blow through content.<br />
<br />
If your guild is folding I you have my sympathy because finding a new guild is a big PITA. I ams ure though that when the dust settles someone will pull 10 people together and start the &quot;Next Uber Guild&quot; to keep the hard core raiders that are staying entertained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fall 2002, most of us played a couple of times a week plus our group night.<br />
<br />
Fall 2003, I was about the only one logging in other than group nights. I was raiding NToV and PoP Tier I/II.<br />
<br />
Fall 2004, the monk now plays his beastlord in the middle of the night; the cleric and enchanter would have sold their accounts, except they're all-access, and they play EQ2... from time to time; the bard stopped playing, but I talked him into joining my guild; he logs on for scheduled raids and then logs off. And I'm still playing 15-30 hours a week.<br />
<br />
So... my group still represents five 'active' (currently payed if not played) accounts, but only three of us ever log in, and only I am putting in more than 10 hours a week that I know of.<br />
<br />
However, my guild is growing and taking out bigger targets. Blood and Emperor are the only Ssra nameds we haven't killed yet, and BoT tower clearings are boring targets to rush through when we don't have enough for other stuff. I figure with spawn cycles what they are, we'll just blow through Ssra weekly, and start some Tier II PoP stuff. That puts us as what, a fourth-tier guild, maybe moving into third? We sure wouldn't be there if the guilds ahead of us didn't have OoW, GoD, Time and Elementals to hit.<br />

<br />
That's a mixed bag. Some people have posted to the effect that their PCs run EQ1 but not WoW, but in my case it's the exact opposite. My laptop PC chokes in almost any XP-able zone (Cazic Thule is OK, LoY is borderline playable if I don't look in the wrong direction, PoT and Luclin are effectively frozen), while it runs WoW well enough for me to be able to play.<br />
<br />
and also the people who will not buy another game because of the time and money they have invested in EQ.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's a big issue for some.<br />
<br />
It is these people that will keep the game alive. I am one of them and love the fact that it's cheap entertainment and it keeps my interest because I didn't blow through content.<br />
<br />
Well, as I suggested above, it's not just the hard core raiders that are dropping out. My guild was the opposite of uber and it is now gone. Heck, we were ecstatic less than a year ago when we killed Doomshade with our mega raiding force of about 10-12, that's how un-uber we are :)<br />
<br />
If your guild is folding I you have my sympathy because finding a new guild is a big PITA. I ams ure though that when the dust settles someone will pull 10 people together and start the &quot;Next Uber Guild&quot; to keep the hard core raiders that are staying entertained.<br />
<br />
Hard core raiders, although they are obviously hurting, may have an easier time of it than us, casual folks. High level raiding guilds may have to server move and/or merge and/or recruit (although some may not bother and simply jump ship), but I liked playing with in-game friends that I had been with for a number of years. That won't be easy to rebuild inside or outside EQ1...</div></div><hr />

Ironically, I think it would be a good move by SoE to release an expansion in the next few months, I could see it tuning Eq for less people, so majorly group content, and low number raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I thought I had a relevant point when I started typing... /shrug<br />
You made an excellent point Samanna, and in fact, YOUR story is the reason EQ is so far from dead. You and your friends have a LOT of fantasticly fun content to do still, and now there will be a LOT less competition for that content. <br />
<br />
Truth is, MOST of the servers were a tad overcrowded. I think the original idea was to have about 800-1K people on a nightly average. In the hey-day of POP, there were that many in guilds raiding PoP+ alone, easily. At one point on my server, there was 1 guild past Time, doing Gates content, soley, 4 guilds farming Time, with 2 of them still hitting the EPs, 3 more guilds EP flagged or on the verge of EP (in Sol Ro, lacking RZ, etc), and 2 or 3 other guilds hitting PoP and Luclin (Ssra-VT) content regularly. Thats a LOT of people. Raiding people. <br />
<br />
A purge like this may end up being a blessing. I was never a fan of the whole &quot;Guild vs Guild&quot; race-for-mobs concept. In fact, I despised it. Leapfrogging, Spawn jumping, cross-farming, racing, guild &quot;claiming: Fennin Ro when they have 12 people on, but kill the trigger, and start to clear while they wait for the rest to log in, etc. Ugly ugly garbage, IMHO. Trimming down the number of people will force folks to consolidate. Less guilds = less competition. Less guilds = more good people per-guild. <br />
<br />
The lower numbers wont be totally horrible for casual players either. There will be far more &quot;easy access&quot; camps, far more mini-targets for smaller guilds (less &quot;big guilds&quot; settling for lesser targets due to lack of other options), etc. There are going to be less groups, but the pro-active players will make their own, and have confidence that a decent camp option will be available. <br />
<br />
This isnt going to happen overnight though. People need to stop panicing, and let things settle. A couple months of upheaval arent gonna kill anyone. Once things start to consolidate, and settle into a pattern, I think a LOT of folks will wonder how the heck we ever got along when the servers were as crowded as they were. There may be some servers that need merging, or closing with &quot;open ticket to move&quot; type things, but thats not gonna happen while the whole game is in a state of flux. End of January, when those free-months of WoW and EQ2 start running out, and the hardcore players who moved to those games begin to decide if those games have what they want for the long-term, thats when we will start to see whats-what. But I think, in the end, EQ is going to be a much better game with 40-60% populations.</div></div><hr />

EQ will still be around years from now, but it may shrink a bit.  It's going to have to rely more on new customers and long-time-casual-players for its subscription base, since there's little it can do to attract the hardcore element to return.  It's a very playable game,however, and should be fun for anyone starting a new character.  Should be, that is, if it weren't for massive shortfalls of new players and new characters leading to lack of people to group with, less fun. <br />
<br />
WoW is pretty fun so far.  I'm having a blast with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">WoW hit 240 subscriptions on its FIRST DAY.  Imagine what it looks like now. <br />
Diablo 2 hit 500K units sold in a week. I bought 2. Battle-Net still regualrly has HUGE numbers logging in nightly (its free, after all). My son is one (his computer cant run EQ and I havent been able to find the 200 bucks to upgrade him enough to play).<br />
<br />
I will be interested to see how WoW parses out in:<br />
<br />
Units sold vs Subscriptions after the 30-day free trial is up<br />
Units sold vs Subscritions after 6 months<br />
Units sold vs Subscriptions after 1 year. <br />
<br />
Those are the critical numbers, IMHO. <br />
<br />
Another number I would love to see, but I am sure is going to be extremely difficult to estimate is:<br />
<br />
People who left EQ for WoW and came back to EQ.<br />
<br />
I think of the new choices, WoW has the most potential to keep EQ players. But a LOT of that is going to hinge on the high-level end game content. Everyone, casual, hardcore, raiders, non-raiders, everyone needs to level. Creating an enjoyable atmosphere for leveling isnt that hard. We forget that EQ doesnt really have to do that, because such a large percentage of their playerbase is ALREADY leveled. But if you look at a lot of the people who talk about &quot;The Best Of Times in EQ&quot; its related BACK to the time when people leveled. Most of the bitching in EQ came when people got there, and went &quot;What next?&quot;. <br />
<br />
WoW hasnt had to deal with that question yet, but given the reports of how fast leveling can be, its gonna start popping up. Then what? The slower levelers complain about the gear the faster levelers? The people who choose PvP getting better stuff than the non-PvP, and the non-PvP starting thread after thread about that concept? Raiders and Non-raiders? Content options for people who DONT want to raid and DONT want to PvP? Walls? Any of this sound familiar so far? <br />
<br />
I think WoW is destined for some growing pains in the comin months. Already hearing about unbalanced classes (Paladins?). Some of my guildmates who moved are about to max out their level. Over 50% of the people in my guild who left for other games are back at least a coulpe nights a week to raid. <br />
<br />
In the end, we will see what happens. But I will say it again, its not reasonable to compare EQ to WoW. They are 2 different games. Once WoW has established a &quot;majority of high levels&quot; and we see what they come up with for content, THEN you can compare. But if the past week is any indication, at least from the people I know, SOE would be insane to make any drastic server decisions until WoW has proven itself capable of keeping the people who left EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">nice post Blazz and i have to agree with the way you put it. The main questions will not be raised in WOW for a couple months. When you can lvl to max within 6weeks of game coming out and 75% ppl can level that fast its going to be about what content you can give them. High end game for Wow is pretty unknown at present but if it appears that it is no challenge then the hardcore players will leave as they will have nothing left to prove. I still await to find out what eq2 has in the ways of high end content, as both eq2 and WoW hinge on not only being good games but delivering a game that can be fun not just 2-3weeks after release, but 2-3 months and 2-3yrs after, cause its no fun when you have done everything and wait for too long for something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">One point WoW has is replayability.  Either within or outside of a particular faction.  It's not the noob &gt; Kurns &gt; Paludal &gt; * route, race and class regardless.  <br />
<br />
From Lenardo at MB the Korean and European numbers are looking huge. <br />
(www.monkly-business.com).  Personally I will have no qualms at all if furor and his ilk chew up content, grow frustrated then leave.  None.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kanudil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Personally...I think a lot of people will come back from WoW, especially the higher tier raiders as WoW seems to be pretty easy to get up, and since no higher content=bad...the reason why SoE always came out with expansions was to keep just that from happening, even if it was broken higher end guilds would still go there and try to beat it. <br />
<br />
My guild crashed for about a week, we could only get about 30 people on, and in OoW we weren't able to do much at first, then we started recruiting and now we're at 54 + and we have to start up our CiH73 channel again :-p. Granted we're back flagging atm to gear people up so they could survive Anguish and MPG trials, we are doing pretty good and far above the expectations of some people, I mean we're doing Queen/King np now.<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of people left because when the numbers were starting to go down, the same thing happened with content and people got tired of doing the same thing. So when a new expansion comes out and the higher tier guilds break through to new places a lot of people will come back due to that as well. Then there will be other problems :-p. There is a future for EQ, as I've seen some things started to being corrected. EQ can keep people there and SoE is starting to see that as the people who spent way too much money and time into EQ will not leave for anything else. I mean look at how well OoW was done and it did not have as many bugs as people made it seem. Although stun resist is broken *grumble* but that's with the patches lately :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I also think that a fair number (a third to maybe a half of those who left) may eventually wander back from WoW and EQ2.  One of my friends who continues to play EQ2 (I tried it for a few weeks and have already cancelled the account) has been telling me that content in the mid-to-high levels of that game is fun, but there probably won't be enough as people start to break out of the 20s where many are kind of mired down right now.<br />
<br />
Personally I am enjoying the lower population on Lanys.  Since I frequently play in pick-up groups, fewer people means that I tend to run into the same people more often in these.  They in turn are getting a better feeling for my skills which makes it a bit easier to find groups than back when there was two to three times as many people active in the game.  <br />
<br />
Two advantages that aren't apparent at first:<br />
<br />
1. I think that the players who remain are more valued, since there aren't a dozen other (insert class here) looking for group at the same time.<br />
<br />
2. Since people are having to look for new groups (instead of grouping with the same friends/guildmates they spent most of the last few years with) I think many players are having to learn to cope with other play styles.  The &quot;perfect&quot; group is much harder to build, so many people are having to learn to function in groups that previously would have been almost inconceivable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">What a lot of people are missing is the proliferation of boxing. It used to be uncommon. Now a high % of people do it. This has saved EQ (I had 9 accounts when I bailed this month) for a long time. <br />
<br />
But when people leave the hits are becoming harder and harder (and why the changes are more dramatic than before). Of my 9, 6 will be subscribed (assuming the persons I gave them to stick around) after March. Likely at least one or two of those people will not stick around. And when they leave they will take 2-4 accounts with them as well (they all 2box+ now).<br />
<br />
In short, boxing has soaked up most of the accounts of the hardcores leaving the game (if you are gonna buy, buy big). It has concentrated the accounts in far fewer hands, however, opening up the potential for real pain if the remaining players begin to migrate.<br />
<br />
You can tell the health of most games by tracking prices on Playerauctions (and sites like them). Prices on most EQ accounts peaked 3 weeks before WoW/EQ2 and they are not coming back. Prices on EQ2 are lower than you would expect given the stage of the game (i.e. stuff is expensive early when supply is low and demand is often high). WoW ramped from no interest in gold to high interest pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
That being said if you are new to the game or if you have been casual for a long time, you are in a good spot if you are on a med-high pop server. If you are low-pop you are SCREWED since you cant usually solo.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's interesting that most seem content to do PoP and get to Time, while hardly anyone talks about GoD raids/progression and a few about 1.5 epics/OOW.<br />
<br />
Numbers seem to be down on the server as a whole though, I guess the guilds that get hit harder will simply combine with the remaining guilds.  EQ is a long way from done, although the tediousness of grinding experience by killing the same respawning mobs in a giant field for hours and hours to get any reasonable experience is likely to not exist in any good future game.  Folks may call WoW too easy, but I think its definately a more gamer-friendly system.</div></div><hr />

I disagree; auction site activity predicts only some of the market of individual servers, not the 'heartbeat' of the server.  Remember the plat dupe scams from mid PoP?  That sent prices on plat plunging pretty quickly, and caused a simmilar rise in Bazaar prices.  Just because the prices for plat on Playerauctions dropped dramatically doesnt mean that EQ had started hemmoraging accounts.  It just meant there had been a (dramatic) shift in server plat amounts.  <br />
<br />
Why would prices on WoW items be high ATM?  I can think of 2 reasons.    First, Blizzard just started banning people that they find are selling money and items at auction sites.  That increases the risk for the seller, so the reward has to be high to compensate.  Second, the newness is starting to wear off for some people.  Its no longer wide eyed wonder when they log in but is starting to become &quot;if I only had THAT sword, I could be uber&quot;.  To get the items they want people are willing to pay a premuim.  Its no different than what happens when a new expansion hits and new items start showing up in the Bazaar. When its new and the quantity of the item is small you can demand whatever you wish for an item and someone is gonna buy it.  After a few weeks the market starts to get flooded and prices plunge. (an expample- I sold 3 or 4 pairs of Armguards of Repentance for 50-75K in the first days of OOW; now Im lucky to get 5-6K for a pair, and see then for 3-4K fairly often.)<br />
<br />
Can you tell how much life a server has by watching the prices of plat ?  Possibly, but I wouldnt bet the farm on it.  While people may visit these sites I think that fewer people use them than it may appear.  Ive a pair of friends (husband and wife) that used to buy plat every few weeks.  It looked like there was alot of activity there, but it was really only one person buying.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

I personally got 4 or 5 characters to 90+. Its mindless. Fun, and time consuming, but mindless. I played a TON of D2 for a couple months, then played th expansion for a couple months, then played again when they updated stuff with new &quot;elite&quot; gear and such, etc. great game. But there is no real difference between an 80 and a 99 in D2, honestly. Nothing close to the differences between a lvl 65 and a level 70 in EQ.<br />

My son has a bunch of 99s, but he and his friends shuffle accounts so much I cant tell whats active and not active. But its free, so he plays it. <br />

Come on Faern, thats not being fair. EQ had MASSIVE re-playability in the first few years, and even today STILL has excellent replayability due to its sheer SIZE and volume of content. People dont HAVE to take the Kurns -&gt; PC -&gt; Unrest route, it just happens to be the min-max path. You dont think that WoW will haev web sites VERY VERY soon with similar min-max paths to level the FASTEST way possible? Of course they will. <br />

I am not saying WoW doesnt have good replayability, it looks to me like it does have a nice system. But dont dis EQ's replayability just because its been solved. WoW will be solved a LOT faster that EQ was, trust me. Blazz!!!!  Don't be pointing people to Berthall... Even I get offended there :)  I'm joking of course.

I think the people with the rose-colored glasses on may have forgotten the bad old days when entire groups would cluster around a single spiroc spawn, hoping to make 17 by the end of the week.  Druids being the master class, could track the elusive exp mobs and then SOLO them . . wow!!!  Nobody could solo.  Deaths being extremely costly and hard to escape at times.  Down-dinging.  Travel being a complete bitch and requiring tons of time to get anywhere.  Traps and pitfalls and mob trains, bad pathing, chain aggro, runners you couldn't stop who brought back hordes, trains from Hell, getting stuck in walls, terrible customer service, and the list really does go on.  The only reason it was fun to level up in EQ was because 1) it was a new sort of game and fun for that reason, 2) it was so darn HARD to level up (in the beginning) that you took great pride in doing so.  I remember it took me about 3 months to get from 51 to 60.  That's quite a while really considering I was playing as often as I could.  <br />
<br />
WoW has leveling that is FUN, not just hard.  Sure the game is challenging, but you don't lose exp when you die.  You also have no shortage of quests (that really have nice exp/loot rewards) and mobs to kill.  Every class can solo, some slightly better than others but it's mostly balanced.  The mob hp progression is logical and scaled according to player hps.  Travel is reasonable, and even sorta fun with the griffon rides and the fast boats.  Tradeskills work, and are kinda fun.  You never really get stuck in walls.  I haven't had to test their CS because the game is so perfectly finished that I HAVEN'T HAD TO!  How refreshing, a game that works out of the box!  Instead of having to wait a year or four for all the bugs to finally get tracked down.  By then nobody cares if you fix Fippy's  pathing, people are all 65 and don't care any longer.  <br />
<br />
I think more than anything that killed SoE.  The bugs interrupted the flow of the game so much that people couldn't stay immersed, couldn't keep having fun.  Unfinished content at the high end was a persistent problem that seemed to be nothing less than a HABIT at SoE.  You couldn't just PROGRESS up their scale with your high-end guild.  You had to go up half a rung, wait for the bugs on that rung to get fixed, then advance to the next bugged encounter.  It just simply sucked.  <br />
<br />
WoW is gonna do fine on the high end.  Why?  Because people are going to WANT to make alts and level them up from the beginning again!  It's fun to do so, and not just because you can &quot;see how much I can twink him&quot; because the game sorta prevents twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Leveling in EQ was fun, but also extremely frustrating!  I think the people with the rose-colored glasses on may have forgotten the bad old days when entire groups would cluster around a single spiroc spawn, hoping to make 17 by the end of the week.  Druids being the master class, could track the elusive exp mobs and then SOLO them . . wow!!!  Nobody could solo.  Deaths being extremely costly and hard to escape at times.  Down-dinging.  Travel being a complete bitch and requiring tons of time to get anywhere.  Traps and pitfalls and mob trains, bad pathing, chain aggro, runners you couldn't stop who brought back hordes, trains from Hell, getting stuck in walls, terrible customer service, and the list really does go on.

<br />
Incoming 2 cents.......<br />
<br />
The newness eventually wears off- ask some of the old timers on how many/what lvl alts they have- there are quite a few out there with 6-7 ranging from lvl20-65.  When EQ came out there was tons of playability and twinkage then wasn't nearly what it is today.  New games like WoW have a strong advantage.... the puzzle has been solved.  Devs were able to look at games like EQ and learn from its mistakes (bad patches, pathing, exploits, twinking, poor game concepts, etc.)  <br />
<br />
WoW is &quot;extremely new&quot; in the realm of mmorgs- most games take 1-2 years before you can even determine a stable consumer market.  Eventually, there will be plenty of &quot;exploit&quot; sites like Alla, uber guild sites, and Yantis-clone &quot;we buy your crap&quot; companies messing with the economy.  It eventually happens to every online roleplaying game.  EQ has its follies (there are a ton of them), but I still remember bs'ing with my military buddies during patch downtimes as we waited 2-3 hours for the servers to come back up.  I still remember my buddies staying up until 6-8am so they could get a full set of Hate gear, or even the joy of completing their epic.  Some of that is dead for people, for others the game is still very much alive.  I have watched friends leave the game to play others, and I have watched friends come back. <br />
<br />
I am still a fan of EQ, I think for the very same reasons you mentioned.  When EQ was in its infancy, it was hard as hell.  I had buddies ding 60 back when it took a month of grinding from 59 to get there.  (Velks spiders are still the most excruciating sound in the game btw...)  The newness of the game is gone for me, but I still get a kick out of logging on to get the new &quot;shiny&quot;, grab some more xp/aa, or see how sickly I can twink out an alt.... Each to his own I guess.<br />
<br />
EQ is a classic... complete with old timers talking about &quot;walking uphill through the snow in Everfrost both ways....&quot;  I put it into a completely different category than the new games out there- you just can't compare the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">for others the game is still very much alive<br />
<br />
Amen right there. If EQ just doesn't do it for you any more, please move along to something that does, with (all of our) blessings. Really.<br />
<br />
But the fact that the magic is gone for some of us doesn't mean that it isn't in full force for others. I hope your current (new) hobby (addiction) gives you wet dreams. Really. Good for you. Everyone derserves the wet dream now and then, after all.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't make those of us who stay any less intelligent, or &quot;with-it&quot;, or whatever. I imagine that the splendor of playing EQ will one day wear off for me. So be it - but until then, I really, really enjoy playing, whether I'm in Riftseekers', feeling over my head but keeping my end up and getting wicked loot, or in WoS, just wowing people with my ability to  keep everyone alive and make the Beastlord's slows bounce besides (HFS, you can heal AND slow!?), or if I'm &quot;slumming&quot; in old-world content, helping friends, acquiantances, or total strangers with some quest, whether it's a new epic, and old epic, or just some cool loot they want.<br />
<br />
What was my greatest EQ moment this week? Well... there's this buddy of mine, he plays a Bard. He was, hands down, the most knowledgable and efficient player I'd ever seen. He was leagues ahead of me and the rest of my regular crew. He would obtain stuff and give it to us, or hold our hands as we got it ourselves. From my Bloodstained Tunic, to my Testament of Vanear, to my Crystal Chitin Shield, to my Beginner's Magic Manual. He was just so uber, going to zones I never thought I'd see.... He'd even swarm-kite hobgoblins in PoN, and let me and the Chanter mooch XP in the group just for chatting with him on the phone (conf call), to keep him from getting too bored while he did it. I probably got like 20 AAs that way, just refreshing buffs on him between bouts.<br />
<br />
Well, fast forward, and he's stopped playing for a while, then he starts, then he stops... So I convince him to join my guild and just log in for raids, if the rest of the game holds no magic for him. Okay, he does. So, we're raiding the HP in Ssra, and I have some junk loot from WoS in my bags. Boots of Slaughter and Armguards of Repentance. Just crap loot for when you lose on the Rune roll, right? Well, I'm kidding, and I ask him if he could use them. And he said yes, to both of them. My jaw almost hit the ground. I had finally become more uber than this person who was an icon of the game for me. But I didn't feel good because I was somehow more advanced than him. I felt good because I could FINALLY return one or two of the many favors he'd given me over the years.<br />
<br />
So, anyway, knock yourself out in [insert new activity here]; I'm still playing EQ, with all my heart and soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think a big part of the problem is the people have had nearly 6 years to pick apart EQ, and find every little tiny thing wrong, and most have played it SO FROAKIN MUCH that it became more like work than a game, and a LOT of those people forgot how to have fun. WoW grabbed hold of those people and SHOWED them some fun, and thats fine. <br />
<br />
Wow has been around 2 months. No one has had time to pick it apart. There arent 1000's (literally) of sites dedicated to it. Min-Maxing hasnt been &quot;totally solved&quot;. People keep wanting to compare WoW to EQ 5 years ago. Doesnt work folks. <br />
<br />
Almost every single &quot;WoW is better than EQ because . . . &quot; I have read could have the following words added to it: <br />
<br />
For Now. <br />
In My Opinion. <br />
For the Way I Want To Play. <br />
<br />
I honestly cant wait to see how WoW plays out in 6 months. Its been 2, and I am hearing a LOT of the SAME OLD grumbles beginning. &quot;That class is broken&quot;. &quot;Doing that over and over is boring&quot;. etc etc. <br />
<br />
Sam, Pred, Wulf, and you other &quot;Staying with EQ&quot; people, let the WoW folks rant away. When that game has put out a solid year, they are more than welcome to come here and say &quot;I love the choice I made&quot;. But until then, I will just sit back and wait, sticking to my old stand-by, a game I still have a lot of goals in. <br />
<br />
I dont mind the folks gushing about WoW. I left Quake 2 for EQ, and gushed my face off about it to my old Q2 friends. Let people be excited. Just remember they probably had EQ on their hard drives longer than any other single program in the history of their computer lives. If they want to kick EQ around now, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I will be leaving EQ at end of march when billing expires.<br />
I wont be going to WoW,EQ2 etc etc.<br />
Im very pissed at SoE but not pissed enough for them to make me quit.<br />
Im just generally jaded with online games dont know why perhaps its my age :).<br />
When  i started to play EQ there was no way on Earth i thought id still be playing 5 or 6 years later so this to me proves how much longetivity there is and how good a game it is.It was an incredibly hard game when i first started and to be honest i think it still is for total newbies despite what a lot of old timers say.<br />
EQ will die despite what people think but it wont be for a few years.<br />
I will be very suprised if WoW/EQ2 last as long as EQ 1 i personally dont think any other subscription online rpg will ever last as long as EQ because it was the 1st of its type and held that sort of unique appeal.<br />
<br />

Wulfbane<br />
<br />
I think a large part of EQ1 lasting as long as it has was due to two very unique game mechanisms at its implementation....<br />
<br />
1) 1st person view<br />
2) Chat interface<br />
<br />
There were a few other rpg's out there that used the first person point-of-view, but I think using this technique in a mmporg had a dramatic effect.  Players felt as if they were the character....<br />
<br />
This leads into the chat interface which resembled so many of the highly addictive chat rooms we saw all over the internet.  This further blurred the player/character line...<br />
<br />
End-game, graphics, content aside I think these two functions held the strongest hold on why so many players stuck around.  Players were able to allow their own perosnality to blend into the character they were playing.  Relationships ensued and kept people around for as long as it has.  Raiders and non-raiders aside, many people leave the game when their friends leave, and I think this again attests to the two game mechanics I pointed out.<br />
<br />
To voice an opinion on EQ2/WoW, I think both will stick around for quite a while.  I think WoW will have a stronger staying power, though- for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
WoW- first real mmporg for Blizzard, little expectations aside from<br />
         Blizzard product quality.  Blizzard's strengths are catering to a <br />
         very diverse community with their products.  Their games are <br />
         also easy to put away/bring back out.  I, myself still play Diablo 2<br />
         from time to time and its a great game to hit when you are burnt<br />
         out on the slow pace of EQ.  <br />
<br />
Weaknesses- I get burnt out on Blizzard games pretty fast.  There just<br />
                  doesn't seem to be the same desire to get the &quot;ubah&quot; stuff<br />
                   like there is in EQ.  Security...Security....Security... I<br />
                   can't say it enough, Blizzard has been horrible in the past<br />
                   with hackers penetrating the system.  This is their first<br />
                   pay-to-play game, though, and hopefully they will fund<br />
                   their watchdogs to keep the game leveled.  Blizzard has<br />
                   already started blowing the whistle on exploits and that is <br />
                   a good sign of changing times. <br />
<br />
EQ2- sequel.  I think EQ2 has a lot less hype going for it and a lot more<br />
                   pessimism around it than WoW.  Its a sequel and will,<br />
                   therefore, be judged by the first game- complete will all<br />
                   the trials and tribulations of EQ.  I think there are many<br />
                   more reasons for players to avoid this game &quot;due to&quot; the<br />
                   first one because of issues/expectations.  If it isn't as <br />
                   good- it fails.  If it doesn't fix the problems- it fails.  If its<br />
                   too much like EQ1- it fails.  If its not enough like EQ1- it<br />
                   fails.  Sequels for anything rarely achieve the prestige<br />
                   that their predecessor attained- in regards to anything. <br />
                   Players also seem to be moving faster to compile data and<br />
                   parse info in EQ2 than they are in WoW, and I think this<br />
                   will kill it's newness factor faster.  It will become the<br />
                   same-old grind that we are used to.  It's what every  <br />
                   game eventually becomes in the end.<br />
<br />
I expect EQ2 to hang around for 3-4 years before losing massive amounts of members, and I expect WoW to last 5-6 (10+ in the Asian community.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">My guild has gone. On Bertox, Order of the Scattered Winds no functions as a raiding guild. We were a Qvic geared, done-with-Time guild. We kicked ass, we had fun.

<br />
Sorry. Been playing on Bertox for a year and a half now, never once seen your guild tag. Are you new?</div></div><hr />

Wow are you kidding? OSW has been a Top 3 guild since PoP came out and they &quot;made the move&quot; to advance in content. I am pretty sure they were the 2nd guild on the server into Time, and the 3rd guild to kill Quarm. It kind of suprises me that anyone playing the 60+ game on Bertoxx wouldnt know about OSW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Zmabik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">What killed EQ for me was OoW and the gear that came from the massive amounts of single groupable named.<br />
<br />
After spending years working threw Luclin, PoP, most of GoD knowing that the gear the drops in Time that takes 60~ people (I say 60 because only Rathe and Coirnav are difficult without more, though some content could be done with as low as 6 (Vallon Zek anyone?)) could be seen with the same quality in a matter of an hour in most cases in a group of 3 in OoW.<br />
<br />
A single group in Riftseekers can get gear equal to Time or Raid sections of GoD, and Imo that is messed up. Not to mention that lower end guilds (Progressing threw PoP/Luclin) can get gear in a single group that makes raiding some of the content pointless. While the raid gear may have better (or actually have) focus effects, LDoN augs can give well enough effects until said guilds get drops from better places, making the use of old raid zones for progression (NToV, Kael, Ssra, VT, all PoP except Time) a waste of time, add that with GoD being a pile of crap and OoW is the center of the game and the only expansion that means anything.<br />
<br />
Single group MPG trials give loot that is, IMO game damaging. While the trials are not the easiest they give loot that surpasses even Quarm/later GoD loot, and progressing threw GoD to do Texvu or Tacvi for what may be higher quality gear is retarded if you are going to be looking at scraps all the way threw to those zones.<br />
<br />
While the game is still perfectly fine for casuals and non raiders, the item drops from single groupable things in OoW completely throws the progression scene of Velious, Luclin, PoP, Gates and then OoW out the window for the gear up in OoW and start with GoD or OoW. While the start of raiding in GoD or OoW maybe difficult at the start, it is very possible.<br />
<br />
Even though each expansion effectly damaged the one before it to a small extent, I don't think any expansion made the previous ones as useless as OoW did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">**** i love EQ but would never spend over $100 on it a month.<br />
<br />
Whenever I was playing EQ actively, I was spending about 4 hours per night in Norrath. Possibly less on weekdays and more on weekends, but it all averaged out. 4 hours times 30 days per month is 120 hours, which adds up to about a dollar per hour of entertainment if you pay for 9 accounts on an annual basis. That's quite inexpensive even for people with less than average income. And I would think that just juggling 9 accounts would take more than 4 hours/day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">good points all.  yes, I played EQ for the longest playtime of any game I've ever played.  But, Starcraft was on my hard drive before EQ and I still play that game from time to time when the urge strikes me.  <br />
I think the frustration that EQ made me feel actually added to its allure, in a sick and twisted way.  All those failed patches, bugged gameplay and quests, servers coming down, and yet it was exciting when I finally did get in and got to play and it wasn't messed up.  <br />
People these days, casuals and all have it nice.   You get an essentially &quot;finished&quot; game (for the earlier expansions anyhow) that works reliably.  It's quite a good game from that perspective.  With a good and easily accessible casual-gamer progression in loot and gear since the newest expansions have come out.  I just can't forget the 5 years of frustration and it sours my outlook on ever returning.  Nothing against the rest of you who still enjoy playing EQ.  I did too for more years than I'd care to admit to anyone I know IRL.  <br />
My time has also gotten to be more valuable via work, social life, and a woman who's rapidly becoming something I can't do without. <br />
<br />
Cheers to those who still play, <br />
I hope EQ lasts a good long while yet.</div></div><hr />

Woh i do believe we have a jealous raider.<br />
Yes OoW drop gear is good but wouldnt think its anything like Time gear.<br />
Time is now a year old why should that still be the be all and end all of loot ?.<br />
The fact still remains that if you want to raid in OoW you get better gear from that and that is how it should be.<br />

You forgot to say &quot;WHAAAAA My pu#%y hurts!&quot;<br />
<br />
People like you are what gives this game, and raiders in general, a bad name. What do you care what someone else has, as long as the gear YOU have access too is still bigger. Nameds in Riftseeekers, PG Trial Raids, etc etc are all dropping gear that SMOKES all that other stuff. <br />
<br />
The gap was too big, and SOE closed it. Its likely they saw the writing on the wall with WoW coming out and thought &quot;Gee, server populations are going to be hurting for a while, lets give the folks something to shoot for with less people&quot;. <br />
<br />
Oh and guess what, genius. Guilds dont have to progress through Fire Giants, Nagafen, Vox, Trakanon, Severellios, etc etc etc. People dont have to get Epic 1.0 anymore.

Bah no sense argueing with you. Suffice it so say your attitude repulses me. I am glad your opinion isnt shared by the &quot;majority of raiders&quot;, at least its not shared by the people I know. <br />

Hopefully SOEs decision to close the gap will drive people like that out of this game. If so, it would make OOW DOUBLY the best expansion ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are not seeing the large picture..... and I will explain why.<br />
<br />
I believe that on my server, approximately 50% of the population are raiders: either casual (1-3 nights) or hardcore (5-7 nights).  I also think that the forward guild movement of a player ends when they hit a hardcore raid guild (no matter what the content.)  What does this mean?<br />
<br />
-upper tier guild apps are going to be under-geared/under-flagged<br />
<br />
This was a MAJOR issue for upper tier guilds.  On top of having a high turnover rate of burn-out players, they also have to deal with the choke-hold of backflagging/gearing up new applicants.  This isn't that big of a deal for a VT guild dealing with apps in ornate, but it becomes a very big deal for Time/GoD/OoW guilds when they are dealing with those same apps who are still wearing ornate....<br />
<br />
SOE attempted to solve this issue with backflagging fixes and groupable equipment, which takes an enormous amount of stress off the recruitment teams.  Players now require less:<br />
<br />
-Backflagging<br />
-&quot;Trivial Equipment&quot; farming<br />
<br />
Progression is fine and dandy.  It would be nice if everyone followed the same line of progression, but guild turnover prevents this from happening often.  Its hard for a cutting-edge guild to continue to progress if they have to back-flag/farm old gear every three months.  We are not even looking at massive hitpoint upgrades with OoW either- it just seems that way.....<br />
<br />
PoP- 35-65hp gear (some focuses)<br />
LDoN- 65-100hp gear (available w/ many hours of time)<br />
GoD- 90-120hp gear (little more available than LDoN- mostly no-drop)<br />
VP- 100-130hp gear (requires some raiding- little easier than GoD)<br />
OoW- 100-120hp gear (many pieces buyable)<br />
         120+ gear (no-drop, requires well-equipped skilled players)<br />
<br />
Casual Shaman Hitpoint totals:<br />
<br />
PoP- 3500hps max<br />
LDoN- 4000hps max<br />
GoD- 4600hps max<br />
Vp- 4900hps max<br />
OoW- 5500-5800 hps max<br />
<br />
Of course, mob dps has been scaling up, as well, this entire time.  What you are seeing is the same that happened to raid gear back in PoP/GoD.  Gear is just scaling up at the same rate that the mob dps is.....</div></div><hr />

I am throwing out the 5500hp number as a &quot;final&quot; max hitpoint.  This is after you have exhausted all outlets of OoW loot/augs.  Breaking 4500hps is still very good for OoW, and I wouldn't expect non-raiding shamans to be hitting 5.5k hitpoints for another 6 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant it in a way that the OoW gear damaged the progression of the game.<br />
I dont see how? The gap in POP was much too big. Top PoP non-raid gear was Ornate. However, the raid level stuff was MASSIVE. If anyhting, SOE blew it right there, but not leaving themselves any room to scale upward. LDoN offered sub-EP level gear to non-raiders, but in many cases, it STILL wasnt even equal in quality to VT gear, a 3+ year old expansion. Gates was just a joke. For everyone. Raiders, non-raiders, was a total cluster-f#%@#. <br />
<br />
Enter OoW. OoW narrowed that gap. EP and Time gear is still better than most OoW non-raid stuff. The PG trials are the exception, and I will admit that the gear in those seems a bit too strong for the risk involved, but regardless, they certainly arent doable by everyone. <br />
<br />
I have absolutely no issue with 120 hp/mana gear dropping off one-group XP mobs. Bout time, IMHO. The non-raiders have been forced to suck up substandard gear for far too long. I am really sorry that now people can get one-group stuff it used to take a raid to get. Thats EQ. I think Ornate was an insult to the EQ community, honestly. Given the quality of EP level stuff, Ornate should ALL have been 30/30 higher at LEAST. SOE created this gap, and now they have closed it some. <br />
<br />
I still dont see Time T5+ stuff dropping off XP group named. If you have the skill to complete a trial, good for you. Got a trial loot myself. But sheesh, man. Making a statement similar to &quot;closing the gap ruined the game&quot; is kinda ridiculous. <br />
Probably the reason I didn't mention old world and Kunark. No one soloing Aten Ha Ra or Rallos Zek etc, so you completely missed the point, or read what you wanted to see. Some of the most fun I had was progressing threw PoP, people will miss out on that now because you can skip it with OoW or it makes PoP easy enough that it is no fun.<br />
PoP is 2 years old. At what point should SOE make it &quot;skippable content&quot;. When Kunark came out, it basically made ALL of Antonica skippable, even for non-raiders. Velious offered armor and progressive quests for stuff better than most Kunark dragons. Granted, much of that content wasnt doable by single groups right away, but eventually it became more and more trivial. PoP is 2 years old. 3 expansions old (sorta, LoY and LDoN kinda count as 1, I guess). I still dont think any guild is going to Qvic by skipping Time, though, regardless of how much OoW gear they get. <br />
<br />
All OoW did was give both raiders and non-raiders gear path choices. No cleric is replacing EP arms with Armguards of Repentance. No casters are replacing Babs mask with the one in PG. Full EP gear is still better than full &quot;Xp groupable&quot; OOW gear. RSS has some higher quality gear, but its no cake walk up there, even for lvl 70 Time geared groups. <br />
<br />
I am sorry my post was so abrasive, but man, it bugs me to see people who think this way. OoW did more to keep EQ alive than any other expansion I remember, and closing up the gear-gap was a BIG part of that boost. I think your having trouble seeing the forest, cause the trees are in the way. Go to the Equipment board, and read some of those threads. OoW gear is still work. Its still takes playing the game to get. But now the non-raiders have a legitimate path they can follow, wihtout worrying about spending 1000's of hours running through the same dungeon over and over like LDoN. Try to be objective, and you will begin to see what a HUGE benefit to the game OoW gear has been.</div></div><hr />

Oow is just as bad as Gates is, especially long term. Oow like a poster above me said trivialisies most of the game at such an alarming rate it simply boggles my mind. Especially after SoE's little speech of who EQ and EQ2 were going to be catered too. I have absolutely zero faith in SoE after Oow, and believe either they simply do not know *** they are doing, or they are intentionally getting people to be done with EQ and go to EQ2. <br />
<br />
It was not even about casual and hardcore for me whatsoever, I still maintain that useless players in good gear are still worthless (and its pretty much been proven true with Oow), and good players deserve good gear, so what the hell do I care about that anyway. What people don't seem to comprehend is that mudflation shot up for EVERYONE, not just casual gamers. When rangers and beastlords in your guild can now tank 80-90% of the content you are raiding thanks to levels, crazy ass buffs and stupid itemisation, it kind of kills the game, especially as a tank at least. Stats became even less meaningless if that was possible.<br />
<br />
PoP did the same thing to a lesser extent (SoE got itemisation in PoP spot on except for time where items were too good) and it was bad for the game. Its stupid to introduce an expansion where it becomes the only place people even want to go to. At least PoP had some decent lore. Oow for all intense purposes has all but none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">So far I OoW does not seem to mudflate anything more then Kunark and PoP did. Levels are huge in EQ. Far, far, far more so then AAs or gear. Everytime an expansion adds more levels old content gets trivialized. Then on top of that you get new gear and new AAs.<br />
<br />
Level 60s in all content made for level 50s completely trivialized it. Lower Guk at 60 in a fungus BP with a slow-proccing sword and a set of Kunark armor was not in any way compareable to being in there with twin ykeshas and a mix of quest and hate armor.<br />
<br />
Players in a mix of ornate and elemental gear with 5 more levels and quite a few nice AAs under their belts completely stomped Velious and Luclin, grind and raid zones alike.<br />
<br />
And now players who got minuscule gear upgrade (compared to what PoP did to the game), 5 levels and couple nice AAs find that the previous expansions are much easier.<br />
<br />
Of course they are. The microsecond that new levels were announced it was clear that previous content would be easier. Speaking for myself I do not have any issues with that. People are free to avoid OoW. People are free to do the now easy raids with fewer people, which to me seems to fit in nicely with having others leave for WoW or EQ2.<br />
<br />
The impact of OoW gear isn't even all that big. OoW brings less power to the crowd then Kunark, Velious, Luclin and PoP did. Of course after LDoN and GoD it may seem like much. But from where I stand this all looks exactly like the complaints about previous expanions.<br />
<br />
Yes, OoW is the place to be. Guess what, level 60s did not stay in the old world. Velious more or less emptied Kunark. Velious was abandoned for Luclin. Level 65s did not stay in Luclin. Then the pattern was broken by a casual &quot;expansion&quot; (if you can call it that) and the complete breakdown of sanity that was GoD. Now we again have an expansion worthy of the name - and people leave the old zones. That is completely normal and probably even intended.<br />
<br />
The only unnormal part of the whole expansion chain (not counting LoY and LDoN) was GoD. Expansions are meant to increase player power and to move people into the new zones.<br />
<br />
My main concern with OoW is it being too small and the top end being a little too easy. Other then that it is a good expansion, with many of it's problems not stemming from the expansion itself but the two expansions before it.</div></div><hr />

The raid eventually fizzled out at P4 VZ but really reminded me of the good old days, especially as it was 'first night past P1' for a good part of the raid.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are negative about the God expansion, but I actually enjoyed it. Admittedly I haven't gone past ikkiniz4 raid wise, but for single group content there was some great and challenging stuff to do. Tipt alone is a great trial, challenge , variety tactics etc.<br />
<br />
I used to really enjoy single grp ikkiniz trial 'fishing'. I had all 3 trials beaten, so used to initiate trial and send rogue friend into check for nameds. Then we'd move into temple using all sorts of devious tactics, get into the trial, kill the nameds and scoot off to next trial. Got some great stuff for doing this, but everyone had to be on top of their game.<br />
<br />
For OOW, well again I havent done much raiding (we have been rebuilding/backflagging in PoP/God for last few months), but for variety and single group challenge its up there. Had some great fun in MPG trials/rifts etc ;)</div></div><hr />

Now before i flame you can you explain what you mean by a &quot;useless players in good gear are still worthless (and its pretty much been proven true with Oow)&quot;.<br />
Now if Beastlords are tanking the content your raiding thats either because youre raiding old content or your bsts are Time plus equipped  <br />

<br />
<br />
What should they do? If they dont revamp stuff for free and we know they wont. Eventually old expansions become less and less used for raiding. Not to mention the difference between raiders and nonraiders gear before OOW had gotten pretty silly. Oow pickup group stuff closed THAT GAP that needed some attention. EVerytime i see people mention this stuff they fail to mention how much the raid gear is doing in OOW now. <br />
<br />
There is still a gap and should be one, and in order to balance the pickup zones they need to give the nonraider more gear. But the gap can only be so big. Ever grouped with a pickup warrior in a higher zone that had subpar gear and heard people snicker about how much of a mana sponge they are? Would you want that feeling in the front end of the expansion? <br />
<br />
Because they have to make mobs hard enough for higher raiders to kill and even than they scoff at the WOS mobs while never understanding people in baz gear as the expansion unfolded might not of agreed. <br />
<br />
Sorry i just get real tired of hearing how WOS gear and the like is going to ruin all these other expansions because nobody will raid there. While at the same time you have people who raid with 250-300hps slots who can 1 two person some of the other stuff. That makes stuff obsolete than its going to happen no matter what. <br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong either. I am not bothered but what people get raiding nor do i care what people get in pickup groups. The difference though in gear was way off for a while and they had to fix it simple as that. The gear for nonraiders really isnt that stupid high either. I had top of the line bazaar gear and while ive added alot of new stuff i'm still a decent amount by the higher raider and more in line with the joe average raider. I think i should be able to go all out as a serious nonraiding player and be on par with some of the so so raiding guilds out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Even pickup gear from GoD and OoW aren't good enough to do end-game raiding. Raid gear from 3 expansions ago still being better than the best 1 groupable gear attainable from the most current expansion is a problem IMO. While having a few newer people with sub-par gear was always the norm for most raiding guilds, right now most face a huge influx of new people with not only this problem, but also aa's and levels sometimes.<br />
<br />
While I don't think SoE should shift too much the opposite way, the bottom line is that you need to have at least some raid gear to be a productive member in a end-game raiding gear, at least PoTime +. This is a problem. While they tried to alleviate some stress caused by this with flagsharing (albeit too late, the flagsharing patch should had been out BEFORE WoW open beta/EQ2 release), there is more they can do.<br />
<br />
Revamping some older zones that are rarely used to increase the areas to hunt for good equipped single groupes with non raid gear is a +, more variety in attainable loot (visible armor pieces and weapons especially) that are near or even match EP+ gear would be a good idea, etc.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, like some have mentioned, the gap is too great. With the exodus of alot of people, especially from raiding guilds, the people who would want to move up to a raiding guild are so sorely undergeared that right now everyone has to stay stagnant for at least a little while, some even regress, to gear up new people to continue to do challenging and interesting content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I am not sure why you mention time and the endgame in your post, but OoW gear is certainly better then what I had when I entered time (a mix of ornate, bazaar gear and 3 elemental pieces as well as 2 VT pieces).<br />
<br />
Now whether it is enough to be of use to a raid in Anguish or Riftseeker depends on your class. If you are playing a support class you should manage to do ok, although mana may run out for the healers. Tanks will certainly suffer though.<br />
<br />
But for a shaman one-groupable OoW gear will be enough to make you useful on raids, up to and including Anguish. That means finding a decent OoW item for most of your slots though and having some decent augs in it. Merely the various 70 HP items mixed with ornate won't do.<br />
<br />
You can debate whether the gap between one-groupable gear and raid gear is too large or whether enough of it drops, but a full set of OoW gear from Dranic City, MPG and Riftseekers with the missing slots filled with items from GoD, LDoN and PoP will certainly work to make a shaman (as well as most other classes) useful for raids in any current content, including Anguish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Its truly amazing to come back here and find some people are still arguing the idea that their style of play (raiding) constitutes 'real work' and should be rewarded with uber gear whilst the other two playing styles (group and solo) should be rewarded with 2nd or 3rd rate gear.<br />
<br />
I'd hoped by now that most people had come to round to the idea that anyone who pushed their own particular playing style to the limits should expect to get 1st rate gear.  And thoses that dont push stick to 2nd rate.<br />
<br />
The only excuse for demading something different from this would be if one playing style demanded more from a player.  Yet no raider has ever come up with the reasons why raiding demands more skill.  I accept that LEADING a raid requires a certain ability, but thats about it.  In my opinion a player in a 6 man group, pushing deep into the latest content (with maybe no res or easy CR mechanism) has a far more demanding role than than the 70th player in a raid (with resses and summoning = zero risk).<br />

When I raided the only skill I found in raiding was to avoid getting aggro: you did less rather than more - not a particularly demanding skill once you realised that you were just a very small cog in the raiding mill.  With mob dps these days any non-tank class casual player has the same problem on non-raid mobs so even thats no longer there.<br />
<br />
But hey; if you disagree, maybe after all these years someone might enlighten me with the skills that raiding demands.  And if you can't - then why should raiders get better gear?<br />
<br />
The arguements raiders usually give at this point generally fall into two categories: both equally bizarre:<br />
<br />
1 'no one would raid'.  If people find raiding boring lets not force them to raid.  Raiding should be for those who want to raid, who find it fun.<br />
<br />
2. 'uber gear dropping off moss snakes in EC'.  Obviously this doesnt count as pushing a playing style hard.</div></div><hr />

........I'll bite.  I will be honest, some of the past raid events were literally: throw X amount of people at a raid target, but I think SOE has fixed a majority of the new events with &quot;scripts&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, once said raid content is trivialized- then it reverts back to &quot;throw X amount of people at a raid target.&quot;  I didn't understand raid skill until I was an app for the first guild on my server that advanced to Qvic- Uqua was insane!  It looked like the Devs had fallen asleep on the mob spawning button.  In order for that raid to succeed- everyone had to know &quot;exactly&quot; what they were doing.  If a guild of 50-70 people can coordinate with each other to that degree- then they deserve the loot that drops.  <br />
<br />
Raids are no longer ran by raid leaders alone.  You have healing channels, CC channels, slow channels, etc. that all need to coordinate with each other.  Some of those previous mentioned raids &quot;fail&quot; if the clerics don't switch heal targets in time (we are talking seconds here).  If the chanters/rangers/etc. don't know how to handle their CC targets- everything fails.  <br />
<br />
I don't think we see or hear about a lot of this because the vast majority are &quot;not&quot; in top-end content, and we do not see what it takes to survive and win in nontrivial raid targets.<br />
<br />
Example: Soloing Yeldema<br />
<br />
Today's shaman- nice to do, but its no longer going to raise eyebrows<br />
<br />
First shaman- dude knew what the hell he was doing.....<br />
<br />
I am all for everyone having options available to them for gear upgrades, but if they want the top gear- they need to work their butts off to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Its truly amazing to come back here and find some people are still arguing the idea that their style of play (raiding) constitutes 'real work' and should be rewarded with uber gear whilst the other two playing styles (group and solo) should be rewarded with 2nd or 3rd rate gear.<br />
I dont think our definitions of &quot;real work&quot; are the same Crusty. My main reasoning that Raid gear SHOULD be superior to single-group gear is that it takes more &quot;work&quot; for 50+ people to coordinate than it does to log in, grab 5 players, and kill stuff. I am kinda sick of the arguement that &quot;raiders are lazy tagalongs who dont work that hard but reap the rewards&quot;. You are basically doing the same streotyping you are arguing against. For every slacker raider, there are a bunch of other guys who lead, pull, lead their class, orginize, swap MAs, swap CH chains, swap Curers, etc etc. Raiding isnt about &quot;just not getting aggro&quot;. Maybe thats why you dont enjoy it, eh? <br />
<br />
At any rate, SOE addressed some of your complaints in OoW, with the single group PG trials. The loot dropping there is Quarm+ in quality, and its mostly in slots that arent available in Qvic armor quests, making them attractive to the raiders and non-raiders alike. PG trials are also probably the best source of 69 and 70 runes, as well. <br />
<br />
But please, whether you agree with the loot paths set by the game or not, stop trying to argue that raiding is &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;less work&quot; than grouping. <br />
I'd hoped by now that most people had come to round to the idea that anyone who pushed their own particular playing style to the limits should expect to get 1st rate gear.  And thoses that dont push stick to 2nd rate.<br />
As I said, there is raid+ level loot available in PG trials. The loots in RSS are very solid too, and 1 groupable for strong players. But you will never convince me that the &quot;single group path&quot; should equal the &quot;raiding path&quot; in gear, in general. I will use the 5 failed RZ attempts, a weeks &quot;work&quot;, untold hours talking, trying, strategizing, etc, as the example. If you want to join a raiding guild, and stand there and &quot;try not to get aggro&quot; thats up to you. But lots of us dont play that way, you know. <br />
The only excuse for demading something different from this would be if one playing style demanded more from a player.  Yet no raider has ever come up with the reasons why raiding demands more skill.  I accept that LEADING a raid requires a certain ability, but thats about it.  In my opinion a player in a 6 man group, pushing deep into the latest content (with maybe no res or easy CR mechanism) has a far more demanding role than than the 70th player in a raid (with resses and summoning = zero risk).<br />
I htink the main problem might be you are confusing &quot;raiding&quot; with &quot;farming raid mobs&quot;. Why does the single group guy &quot;risk&quot; anything again? Cause he cant get a summon and a rez? LOL, wake up Crusty. <br />
<br />
How many raid level mobs did you attend that were &quot;the first kill&quot; for your guild? Everything becomes more trivial the more you practice it, INCLUDING your so-called single group example. <br />
<br />
For my final arguement, I will simply re-state the position I have taken all along in these raider vs non-raider arguements. The game is set up the way it is. You can play it however you choose, but you CANNOT force the GAME to modify itself to YOUR PARTICULAR STYLE. The path to the best gear is well known. Its raiding. And even inside that there is anotehr sub-division, the LEVEL of raids. I am not in Uqua or Qvic, or Cit of Anguish. I am in Time and Ikky. My choice to get that level of gear, which isnt &quot;the best&quot; by any means. <br />
<br />
Everquest is set up that way. The best gear in the game is obtained by high-end raiding. Heres a shocker for you too Crusty. I am willing to bet that the &quot;other options of games&quot; are set up that way as well. I dont think its a big stretch to think that the BEST gear in WoW will be obtained by raiding, better than any quest, tradeskill or single group drops. Its the nature of games like this. Whether you agree or not, it IS a lot of work to get 40-70 people together to kill something. Not on an individual basis (although there are DEFINITELY people in raids that do more &quot;work&quot; than any single grouper possibly could concieve of) but more on an overall &quot;scale&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying this isnt a good idea mcroc. Personally, I think there should be a gap, but there is no question it got too big with PoP and Gates. LDoN helped a bit, but fell WAY short in the end. THAT is where the potential is, IMHO. Not LDoN, but a &quot;point system&quot; all over the entire world, linking in all the old content. Make em long and a pain, whatever, but doable, to earn &quot;gear points&quot; to buy stuff. <br />
<br />
But OoW definitely brought things more into line. I am a &quot;mid level&quot; raider, mostly casual these days (I log in about 5 non-raid hours per week, and about 10 raid hours per week). I wear a couple OoW drops. I have used the new levels, spells, AA and gear to work on bigger, more difficult content like the PG trials, Ikky single group trials, RSS, etc. I think, honestly, that my personal demographic is one of the biggest in all of EQ. Not uber, and not a complete non-raider, just a guy slugging through the game, because I want to play the game. I joined a guild that was starting to do Ssra and big Luclin bosses a good 6 months after PoP went live. I could have skipped to a bigger, more advanced (progression wise) guild, but I CHOSE my path, because I wanted to PLAY the game. About the only content I can truly claim to ever be on the cutting edge of was the first year, when I was killing naggy and Vox regularly before Kunark. Other than that, /shrug. Didnt kill Trak til Velious was out, didnt really farm Velious until Luclin, and even then, never even got to HoT and NToV much at all. Did VT well after PoP was out, made it to Time after Gates shipped, and killed Quarm the first week after OoW was out (we were 0-3, getting better, and probably would have beaten him anyway, since we finally had the whole &quot;curing&quot; logistics in place) when we had a few 68-70s with some new spells. <br />
<br />
Ideas like yours are fine mcroc, and even Crustys opinion is fine, but its really not that realistic. I think a large part of the problem is that if stuff is TOO easy, people will tire of it faster. Note, by &quot;easy&quot; I mean doable by the average guy in a small amount of time. Raids take work. Lots of it. People have to show. People need to be able to follow directions. Leaders need to know their events. Pullers need to understand the area. Its not HARD work, but its work all the same. <br />
<br />
The MMORPG pattern has been established. Bigger mobs drop bigger stuff, and it takes more people to kill bigger mobs. Period. I dindt make the rules, I just follow the path thats there. But heck, almsot anyone lvl 67ish on this board could do Subversion Trial in PG quite easily, once you get the strategy and the concept well in place, and get the range item I have, or a sweet earring, or a 69 or 70 spell rune. Thats work too though, despite how easy it is (only 3 mobs to kill from the WoS zoneline til you win the trial). <br />
<br />
I really dindt want to get into another big raider vs non-raider debate, or a gear arguement. OoW has great gear, and good events to get it. NC minis are mostly doable by smaller guilds. RCoD has a couple 3-5 group events. Epics are great items and MOSLTY doable by smaller numbers. SOE MADE some adjustments to narrow the gap. But still, people complain. New Rope Syndrome I guess. Of course, on the flip side, we have the guys who go &quot;I busted my ass for my Time flag and Time Gear and now any scrub can get 85% in and loot a mask thats been rotting for 4 months&quot; or the ol &quot;OoW gear is too good for single group drops, it makes killing Moss Snakes in EC trivial&quot;. /shrug, cant please all of the people all of the time, and games that try generally end up failing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Raid MOBs are harder to kill then trash MOBs (duh). That means they need to give a bigger reward. SOE has two choices - either they drop more items or they drop better items. One of these choices makes people play more and gives a sense of progression to the game. The other makes people stop playing and limits progression.<br />
<br />
To me it is pretty obvious that there needs to be a gap between raid gear and group gear. How big this gap should be is largely debatable though. But if you argue against the existance of the gap you are essentially saying that the Froglok King should drop items on par with those of King Crush (albeit possibly more of them) - after all better items are not fair to the casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">In effect, what you create is something along the lines of communism....<br />
<br />
Everyone earns the identical amount for the work produced.  <br />
<br />
( I think I have mentioned this before....)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this concept, while great on paper, doesn't work when applied to real-life due to humans being...... human.  As a species, we are remarkably lazy- and for the most part damn proud of it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But its just a game....&quot; <br />
<br />
It is.... but it still involves interaction with other players on some level.  Therefore, many of the same mechanics that apply to real-life also apply to EQ.  Just as a communistic society eventually topples onto itself, so would a game based on the same principles....<br />
<br />
If a group should be able to achieve gear on par with a raid unit, then the same logic can be applied to:<br />
<br />
I (solo) should be able to achieve gear on par with a group.<br />
<br />
This defeats the whole purpose of an MMORPG, and therefore is a faulty idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiders should raid because its fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
They would.... at least once or twice, then they would go back to whatever else they do.  How many players were having fun during hour 167 in BoT as they were finishing up their 212th aa?  The game has its horrible, excruciating, boring moments, but they accentuate the good times.<br />
<br />
Raiding can be a pain in the @$$ at times, life is much easier for me if I am &quot;just in a group&quot;- I can leave, take an afk and come back in time for the raid to move.  If I am a group leader, then I can't leave my seat because....<br />
<br />
1.  Raid Leader is telling me invites/disbands<br />
2.  Raid Leader is asking me why I haven't invited the invites.<br />
3.  I am explaining to the Raid Leader that my invites are afk.<br />
4.  Raid Leader is bitching to me about the invites always being afk.<br />
5.  Group members are screaming for buffs<br />
6. Chat channel leaders are telling me to tell my people to join channels<br />
7. People are asking me for buffs.<br />
8. I am tracking down buffs for my group.<br />
9. I am waiting for the buffers to come back from afk....<br />
<br />
Then the raid begins...... and in new content its normally a wipe-in-progress.  This event will continue the next night we raid.<br />

As you can tell, I like to raid- and I have very little to show for it, but I do not make up the majority of the playing populous.  Had other players had my track record with loots, they would have probably quit playing by now.  I still enjoy EQ, and I find other routes to upgrade my gear but I still feel that the current designation of gear distribution (pyramid scheme) is the best application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Not at all. It does not necessarily have to follow that raid bosses items have to be superior to that of grouping items. If you distinct the activities. For example, putting this into a fantasy context, dragons could drop  essences for killing other dragons, the nature of which is enhanced resistance/armour/bane damage to other dragons. Of course, the essence will be pretty useless in regular content versus say a lion.  But it allows both activities to exist without messing the other up. <br />
Though yeah the idea is unrealistic in that the way eq has gone it would be pointless to implement now, but I am sure that inflation and the disparity between groupers and raiders could have been avoided. The fix they've put in, only serves to have both groupers and raiders going for the same goal even though they are 2 different activities. - whats the point in raiding when I can get the items via grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">- whats the point in raiding when I can get the items via grouping.<br />
And here-in lies the problem. SOE has determined, rightfully so, BTW, that people are MORE likely to continue playing the game if it takes a bit longer to get the stuff they want. Why do I go to Time for the 50th time? Cause I want legs off Bertoxx and a shield off Quarm. If I could get those things in a single group, I would have them, and there would be a chance I would stop playing (and paying). <br />
<br />
Lets face it, a large part of these games are based on the economic model determined by the company providing the game. SOE wants us to play as long as possible. They want us logging into EQ day after day, year after year. If everything was obtainalbe in a single-group setting, who would keep playing? Thats Diablo 2. Start charging for Diablo 2 server access by the month and see how many customers you have. Not many, I bet. <br />
<br />
So they dangle the carrot, and we chase it. /shrug, I dont mind running through the maze, I know its a maze, I know I am running through it, but I am enjoying the run so why not. 90% of the &quot;EQ Sucks&quot; post are people who are SICK of running the maze, chasing the carrot, but cant stop, and it pisses them off.</div></div><hr />

Or that strategy can backfire when people become frustrated with artificial playstyle barriers and quit.  It's nice now that players can choose a MMORPG to match their playstyle.  I'm going to be unhappy if WoW goes down the same road as EQ1, but I'm not nearly so worried since I know there will be a game developer out there who wants my money so my playstyle will still be supported.

IINM Furor, the former GL from Fires of Heaven was hired by Blizzard. Now one can only hope it was to learn how NOT to communicate with people over the internet or with your playerbase, but hope is not a method.<br />
<br />
In any event I would wager that a large portion of WoW's playerbase is not from EQ1.  Hence, whether said portion will &quot;put up&quot; with the discrepancies found in EQ1 is debatable, but I come down on the side of &quot; no. &quot;<br />
<br />
 * IF * at level 60 there is only one path and that is raiding, then Blizzard will have failed. Not as a game company but they will have failed a portion (size debatable) of their playerbase.<br />
<br />
I also find it ironic that Sony kowtowed to Furor (Monk nerf) and his ilk (Thott) for many years, yet those people have left EQ1.</div></div><hr />

Or, companys that know how to market their product will create content to keep a large number of people playing instead of moving on. <br />
<br />
To be honest, WOW would be ignorant to create an entire new &quot;level&quot; of gear above what the average player can get, but at the same time, they are crazy not too. Can you people not see the Catch-22 these games face every day? One side thinks one thing, the other says another. And guess what. THEY WILL NEVER AGREE!!<br />
<br />
If there is one simple fact of life I have learned from this board, and indeed even this class as a whole, its that different people have different opinions and NO ONE IS 100% RIGHT!!<br />
<br />
So Iz, artificial barriors might make you quit, but might make 10 other people stay. Or Faearn, if there is only &quot;one path&quot; when you max out your character, then you, and those who agree that isnt &quot;right&quot; will move on, but some won't. <br />
<br />
Honestly guys, dont you get it at all? Do I have to bust out the &quot;Dream Barbie House&quot; or &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; model example again? No matter HOW MUCH you disagree with a certain games &quot;method, style, path, etc&quot;, there will be people who play it JUST THAT WAY. As a personal example, I dont favor farming Time for the 18th time, or killing Quarm for the 15th time, but I will still go, CAUSE THATS HOW THIS GAME IS PLAYED!!! I guess I cant explain it any more than that. I hope the game you guys are playing fits YOUR personal style of play, but if it doesnt, its REALLY not my fault, nor is it Furors fault, nor is the the 100K other people playing EQ1 who actually understand that &quot;raiding is the path&quot;s fault. <br />
 * IF * at level 60 there is only one path and that is raiding, then Blizzard will have failed. Not as a game company but they will have failed a portion (size debatable) of their playerbase.<br />
This is a portion of the above 2 statements I take particular exception too. What other games do you play Faern? I am deadly serious, I want specific examples of both physical games you enjoy and computer games you spend time playing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Failed&quot; is a NASTY word. If you want to say &quot;Failed my particuler individual idea of what the game should be&quot; then fine. Is &quot;Deer Hunter 4&quot; on your HD Faern? Did that game &quot;fail&quot; because YOU PERSONALLY didn't load it? <br />
<br />
Give me a break with this crap. At lvl 70 in EQ, there is ONE PATH, but that path has many sub-paths. I know this, cause I play Everquest and in EQ there are many sub-paths to the &quot;One Path&quot;. Gosh man, sometimes I actualy HOPE that you will get to the &quot;end&quot; of WoW and say &quot;Gee, this isnt much different from EQ&quot; and I will just sit here and say &quot;Gee, I told you so&quot;. DIALBLO 2 IS A BROKEN FORMAT FOR LONG TERM SUBSCRIPTION!!!!<br />
<br />
I am all done. Argue all you want from here, I am not going to bother anymore, except to come back here at some point and say &quot;I told you so&quot;. No sweat off my sac, honestly.</div></div><hr />

It's nice now that players can choose a MMORPG to match their playstyle.  I'm going to be unhappy if WoW goes down the same road as EQ1, but I'm not nearly so worried since I know there will be a game developer out there who wants my money so my playstyle will still be supported.  Vive le capitalism!<br />
<br />
IINM Furor, the former GL from Fires of Heaven was hired by Blizzard. Now one can only hope it was to learn how NOT to communicate with people over the internet or with your playerbase, but hope is not a method.<br />
<br />
In any event I would wager that a large portion of WoW's playerbase is not from EQ1. Hence, whether said portion will &quot;put up&quot; with the discrepancies found in EQ1 is debatable, but I come down on the side of &quot; no. &quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
I also find it ironic that Sony kowtowed to Furor (Monk nerf) and his ilk (Thott) for many years, yet those people have left EQ1.<br />
<br />
Guys, you are blaming guns for the high murder rate...  A baseball bat can perform the same job.<br />
<br />
First off, the goal of any game release by ANY company is to make money.  If it doesn't then its considered a failure- period.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is in this same position, and therefore, are after the same goal...<br />
<br />
Artifical playstyles and barriers.....<br />
<br />
Games were created to do two things: <br />
<br />
1.  Teach people something<br />
2.  Waste time (hence a time-sink)<br />
<br />
You don't want time-sinks- don't play games.... especially RPGs<br />
<br />
Time Sinks created by RPGs<br />
<br />
-levels/psuedo-levels (skill-ups,extra abilities)<br />
-gear<br />
-travel time<br />
-wasted dialogue/story time<br />
-mundane quests<br />
<br />
Every RPG has at least some of these time-sinks built in...<br />
<br />
<br />
-But Blizzard is different!<br />
<br />
<br />
Not necessarily, Blizzard is playing an entirely new ball-game now.  In the past, their only goal was to sell the software.  Now they have to sell subscriptions.....<br />
<br />
Things to worry about:<br />
<br />
-Hacking (kills total time played)<br />
-Quality Control<br />
-Third Party intrusions (kills market)<br />
-Time spent in-game by players and how it equates to progression...<br />
<br />
Now, the first three listed are no-brainers.  Poor software, Hacking, or Third Party invasions can all kill a game.  Game companies could really care less on how long you are logged in- you pay monthly/yearly.  They just want to make sure you are paying.  Now the other part is very important.......<br />
<br />
<br />
Time Spent vs. Progression<br />
<br />
<br />
There is someone at Blizzard that knows exactly how long it takes to get from lvl 1 to max level if one plays in the highest xp areas.  Why?  Because Blizzard, like SOE and everyone else, needs to determine a guildeline for how long their game/expansion will stay fresh.  This information will be used to determine when another expansion needs to be released.  Different variables are included to determine a final analysis like:<br />
<br />
-Travel time<br />
-Down time<br />
-Necessary gear/spell upgrades<br />
<br />
<br />
Invention of Raiding and why it came about<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in the early years of EQ, you had two raid targets: Vox and Naggy.<br />
While the gear was exceptional, it was not the end-all.  Most players chose to gear up solely on groupable loot.  <br />
<br />
The Problem w/groupable loot:  <br />
<br />
At the time, some of the best loot was available in Lower Guk.  This equated to long-loot lines, perma-camping, and a glorious absence of mobs in the zone.  I think somewhere in Verant's brainstorming they determined that creating a new groupable zone would create the same problem- just later on down the line.  So what do you do with the 50+ players all hanging out in Lower Guk that are cranky and accomplishing nothing....  Well, the answer has to be gear-related, otherwise no one will move from their current spot.  You band them together to go raid something.  <br />
<br />
Bonuses of raiding from a programmer's point-of-view:<br />
<br />
- The excess of the high-end continues paying for their subscriptions.<br />
- Players now have something else to grind at.<br />
- You can space out loot progression a little farther apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can space out loot progression farther apart?<br />
<br />
<br />
A group of individuals that have the time management skills of a top-end raid can max out their top achievable gear at a much faster rate.  I watched regular group leaders for GoD trials finish getting all of the gear drops with 3-4 months release of GoD.  Top end guilds are still farming Qvic+ today.  PoP set a standard for raid guilds, if they were working on progession events without any mistakes- they would typically have 20 gear drops per week.  Outfitting a guild of 70+ people and you are looking at a single individual upgrading his gear about once a month.  This changes when a guild hits a farm point in progression, but for most top-end farm points the number only doubles.  Add in specific class drops (high rot rate), and common, uncommon, and rare items and the number drops down further.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so why is raid gear so much better than group gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's based off of percentages- mostly due to mob dps.  Developer goals are to slow down a raid to a specific time frame.  This can be done by keys, flags, time, or gear.  The first three cause too many complaints from players- so the last one is used to determine raid progression speed.  In order to keep progression at a specific speed, you have to ramp up mob dps vs. raid dps.  Effects bumping up mob dps and lowering raid dps are used, but here is where the raid hp spike occurs....<br />
<br />
Raids are usually based on an MT controlling the target... and staying alive.  You ramp up a mob's dps too much and the MT dies as well as the rest of the raid.  If you do not ramp it up enough, you risk the chance that the raid will skip the content.  Players would not be happy if the MT was the only one to recieve upgrades, and the raid encounters would become dry if the only change was mob melee dps.... so items of near quality drop for all classes. <br />
<br />
Group content only requires, at most, six players.  It is also easier to tweak due to less players/variables.  Adding an additional 30hps to each player in a group will have a stronger effect than adding an additional 30hps to each player in a raid.<br />
<br />
So why don't we just add modifiers to raid gear to control the spike?<br />
<br />
What's the point?  Why would I want to get gear in a group if I get killed by an orc pawn running to said group because my &quot;shinys&quot; don't work.  The game is about progression, and getting new &quot;bane&quot; weapons every expansion isn't progression- it's annoying.  Why spend endless hours getting raid gear if it stops working outside of the raid?<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW won't do this to me, though- they know better! <br />
<br />
No one knows that for sure.  WoW IS brand new, and has many benefits of being a new game: top line engine, graphics, spaced out levels.  Five years from now, WoW could be in the very same boat as EQ, and suffer from the same problems that ARE going to happen:<br />
<br />
-Too many expansions<br />
-End game content<br />
-All players near or at the top level<br />
<br />
Raid content handles the logistics of maintaining a large amount of high level players without having them all packed into one zone.  If WoW avoids raiding- they are going to have to find another solution to the exact same problem that Verant addressed years ago.<br />
<br />
In the end, WoW- just like EQ, is in this to make money.  Their goal is to keep you subscribing, and they can't do that if people are not bogged down in the game doing something (albeit raiding, questing, grouping, soling.)</div></div><hr />
