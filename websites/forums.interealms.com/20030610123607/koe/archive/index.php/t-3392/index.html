This is dealing with Mish's real life person. As some of you may or may not have noticed I have been on edge the last month or so. Many things in my life have been hitting me hard and I've not really had any positive place to redirect this energy. So I've been going around tied in knots just praying that something in my life would change and release all of this tension and frusteration. <br />
<br />
Well it hit me today that it just was not magically going to happen and simply praying and standing by was not going to take care of it. So I've decided to put things back in my own hands. Starting with my job. For so long I've been having to deal with things which are out of my control and getting beat up for them from arm chair quarterbacks. I've delt with this type of thing in my career before but trust me this place I'm currently working is the WORST for it. I was kind of told today &quot;it just comes with our profession and nothing can be done&quot;. <br />
<br />
Well they maybe closed minded about it but I for one have had it. I know that it does not have to be this bad. If they are unwilling to change then I am. I didn't do something as stupid as tell them to stuff their job without having one lined up so I think I'm going to line one up and then tell them to stuff it. <br />
<br />
I have my resumee all updated and have my roladex out ready to give some calls. Then it dawned on me I have one of the biggest roladex's right here. I'm a computer programmer and specalize in database work. I have a backgroup in Informix, Progress, and a little SQL server. I have been working on projects for the past year on document imaging and paperless work environments so know this area as well. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any leads or know who maybe hiring in the Columbus Ohio area? I can go as low in salary as to the mid 30's but would prefer not to. <br />
<br />
I have been going to college here and would prefer not to relocate until that is finished about a year or so from now. If you feel more comfortable you can PM me here or drop me an email at freeman_de@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be hitting the sunday papers and online job centers like monster.com but wanted to post here as well.<br />

However they are right in some ways that bitching and moaning to us IT people comes with the territory.  There are some users that do nothing but as well as some management (bad managers in my opinion).  <br />
I hope you are able to find a better company to use your skills, having a happy work like if almost as important as a happy homelife.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being in the IT industry is a belessing and a burden. When everything is running, or they need some extra attention. You are their best friend, but as soon as something goes wrong. Bam!! on the old crap list you go.<br />
<br />
The first two years I was in the IT field I used www.dice.com  I would grab some leads off of them. Most are head hunters (temp work). But there are full time jobs listed as well.<br />
<br />
I have been wondering about my career path as of late. I have been with the same company now for 4 years. I am no longer technicaly challenged, as most of you notice I play about 80% of the time from work. I have job security and make a nice salary, but I just need more self satisfaction. So I am either going to look for a new job, or upgrade my cisco cert soon :)<br />
<br />
As long as it doesnt interfer with my EQ!!  LOL</div></div><hr />
