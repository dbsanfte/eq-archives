<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in the pit last night. <br />
<br />
Cleric died on a silly 2-mob pull. Went healer mode. Most of ya know the deal, chew, chew, q on MT, chew, chew, chew,  chanter mezzes one, you slow both of em, q on MT, Tnarg's on MT, chew, chew, Q on yourself, chew, chew, Tnarg's on MT (crit!), q on mt, chew, chew, Canni V, Q on yourself, dodge mob becasue your Virtue dropped and didnt notice, tnarg's on MT, etc, etc, etc. <br />
<br />
End of fight 5 min later, there I stood, FM. <br />
<br />
Hit me right then and there...I could not remember when I was last OOM. I asked around, &quot;dudes..when did I last whine about needing to medd/canni?&quot; Nobody could remember and the chanter called me a show-off as the cleric rezzed herself. <br />
<br />
Allrighty, focus items, improved healing power and the aa to max it, Q, Canni V....it's all coming together. It took a goofy pull and a even more goofy cleric to make me realize...yeah, this shammy business is still better than anything else imaginable if you like to play a caster. <br />
<br />
If yer 65, have canni V and Q.....be honest...<br />
<br />
When were YOU last oom??<br />
<br />
*shakes his head, having overlooked the obvious for too long*<br />
<br />
EDIT: And when I say OOM, I mean you can't even get a slow, malo or even a root off to park a mob!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not since... um... er... uhh... <br />
<br />
Gosh, and I don't even have the big Canni yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're right, we have the best mana recovery in the game, basically. Its borederline overpowered if it weren't for one thing...<br />
<br />
We cant do &quot;numbers&quot;. Meaning, we can't contribute to DPS, or heal well enough to be effective on raids. Our job is to slow and buff... never really things that require endless mana. if your slow bounces enough times for you to go oom, it's probably not going to land any time soon anyways.<br />
<br />
so yeah thats really the only reason we dont deserve a nerf stick beating imho... however when the **** hits the fan in group situations, our heals do get the job done, so yeah we're just that good.<br />
<br />
In my opinion for exp groups, if shamans weren't lazy and wanted to canni all the time and keep up mana regen, they could play the roles of over 3 classes traditionally required for exp groups... but that just doesn't happen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That should prove a point. The guy don't even have canni V and never worries. <br />
<br />
If a shammy says &quot;oom&quot; then you might as well go to the fridge for a snack, the CR is as sure as the sunrise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps I gave the wrong impression -- there are certainly times I'm working my butt off to make sure I have the mana to cast that heal, root, or slow.  There are a lot of times I've ended a very big fight (read: unplanned adds or trains) with about 3/4 bubble of red and just enough blue to Torpor, Slow, or Root.<br />
<br />
Well, short of &quot;LOADING, Please wait...&quot; that is.<br />
<br />
We have awesome mana regen even before our AA, but we pay a price -- we're constantly busy.  As I've always said, we are about sustainability.<br />
<br />
And yeah -- if I were to ever truly go OOM (and by extension I'd be out of hit points as well) things would be pretty bleak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i go god damn close to oom all the time, but usually its when i'm soloing and going all out dps, on raids if **** is hitting the fan tnargs drains my mana pool fast, but it comes back almost as fast ;x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I go OOM sometimes , but i certainly dont stay OOM i think is the point. Me i like to work when im in a groove. That means , im slowing and buffing and healing if needed. If im standing there looking at my mana bar telling myself how awesome i am cause im still pretty much FM , then im starting to cast DoTs and nukes.<br />
<br />
Now there is a opinion that our DoTs are the suck and our nukes blow and i certainly agree in the desire for change , but fact is if you slap on pox/breathe/BoN or BoS your adding to the DPS of the over all group. Yea they might not run the full course, but if your raising the DPS anyway why not go for it ? If you staring at your mana bar marveling at how much you have left, then something isnt right IMHO. Thats just how i play though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I go oom all the time at 59..<br />
<br />
usually it goes like this:<br />
chanter - burn all mana imbuing ore for armor<br />
Then steals all mine<br />
then I canny to 1 hp and he is stealing my mana all the time <br />
then we're done and I just run aruond gathering tradeskill items from around oggok.<br />
<br />
but in battle I keep up on mana</div></div><hr />

even when im healer and slower and kinda tank, when the slows make me get agro lol<br />
im usualy better off manawise than all the other casters<br />
usualy at the end of fights im 60m or higher and 50hp or so and there all omm and full hp<br />

In XP groups when i get very lazy and not canni caUSE I wana just relax after a day of raiding.  sometimes i get lom.   however if i start to cast canni its amazing how much i can do :)<br />
<br />
only times i get lom/oom is when there is like add after add after add in XP groups, like 8 mobs in camp or when having to chain heal wiht tnargs, god that spell can drain your mana sooo fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think it was in old Cazic around level 29 or so :)  Myself and the last melee I was trying to keep alive managed to actually live, but it was at the point where I was canni-dancing my ass off to get off a greater healing on a half bub health Pally :)<br />
<br />
When we killed the last mob I was OOM, 4/6 members dead and Pally was at just under one bubble health I think.  Ahhh the days.<br />
<br />
A well played Shaman shouldn't be close to OOM unless theres some serious sheet hitting the fan.  I usually keep a steady 75ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just tonight in POI... I (51 shammy with canni 1) just joined grp &amp; after first 2 mobs &amp; buffing grp with HOS &amp; STA cleric leaves &amp; puller says nps we got the shammy to heal &amp; before I knew it we had 2 in camp... 35m or so &amp; about 85% HPs (no KEI - now that was dumb!!!)... well I got both mobs malo'd &amp; slowed &amp; somehow all melee's managed to grab agro &amp; all taking dmg... man was I busy &amp; for the last half of the second mob I had about 5 or 6 insufficient mana to cast sup heal messages. Canni'd my ass down to just over a bub of health (I thought that was low). Well mob dropped &amp; we were in pretty bad shape, but no deaths.<br />
<br />
But I think that was just a bad example because I was in 2 other POP grps earlier all day &amp; even when KEI dropped I just had to canni a lil more &amp; found myself 85% of the time 80m+... malo, slowing, buffing, spot healing &amp; using JBB when all that was good... I hear life gets better with canni 3, 4 &amp; 5. Can't wait to find out cause life right now @ 51 seems pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, DPS in that group was off the scale for Poi, it was a relaxing chance to swap stories and re-connect with guildmembers split by the whole flagging issue.</div></div><hr />

2) After getting rez'd from trying to save the enchanter by slowing the add that no one saw. (Don't you just love it when you cast slow on a mob, knowing you're gonna die if you do, but do it anyways?)<br />
<br />
Shamen have to be the best class as far as mana regeneration goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Surprisingly, went oom last night.<br />
<br />
1 group in Valor, killing Guards for Sacred Water (3 of us in group are working on the Aid Grimel earring quest, and just waiting for us to stop screwing around and KILL RALLOS now, lol).  We're pulling the building with 2 guards in it.  The rare spawn, a Valorian Guardsman pops.<br />
<br />
Unslowable.  Max hit 731.  I'm the only healer.  Our 2 tanks are a pally and an SK.  They're both in good gear, mind you - more than a little VT stuff, but we don't have a cleric, and they don't have Virtue.  Go go chain Tnarg's.  One dead Guardsman - one pally at 60%, one SK at like 13%, and i am actually so oom i can't torpor before I canni V.  My lack of Q is still hurting. =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
My typical exp group is me, a SK, a Bard, and a Mage or two.<br />
<br />
Good fight goes: mob inc- malo, slow, fast heal on SK, big heal on SK, torpor self, canni v, canni 4, epic dot, blood of saryn, big heal on SK, torpor self, chain canni 4... mob dead, top off SK health, and end at 90+ mana.<br />
<br />
Bad fight: mob inc- malo, slow resist, slow resist, fast heal SK, slow resist, fast heal sk, torpor self, canni 5, fast heal sk, big heal sk, canni 4, torpor self, slow resist, fast heal sk... mob dead, torpor sk, end at 30 mana.<br />
<br />
Even after a bad fight, I can be fom again in a minute.  We are more likely to stop for the SK to med than for anything else.  I am a mana machine.  My contribution to group dps is minimal, pet+epic+blood.  However I slow and heal and buff.  I definately do my part.</div></div><hr />

I'm not some slacker who has a cleric or enchanter in the group most of the time though.  Just me and 5 melee (all guild).  On multiple adds, my mana regen starts to suffer 'cause I have to cast additional heals + roots, and don't have time to canni (as much) in addition to that.<br />
<br />
You're robbing your group of valuable DPS by not being main healer (except maybe in ele plains, haven't exped there).  And unless the chanter is charming, they're also robbing the group of a DPS slot...piss on kei.   :D  Boo on casters, boo I say.<br />

Just kidding about the boo on casters thing....sometimes it's nice to have a cleric and be lazy.   :D</div></div><hr />

If you have to chain heal with Tnarg you will go oom, even with Can5 and topor.<br />

<br />
I do go OOM on raids a ton though. On some of these elemental boss mobs I just spam heal until I am oom. Some of these mobs have insane dps and my group of shamans have found that it's worth the risk to empty our mana pools spam healing the MT rather than hope the clerics keep him up. If healing is solid then we nuke til oom. Blazzax is a great example...</div></div><hr />

last time I went OOM was a really bad situation that ended with me at &lt;20% and my warrior at 20% health. this was in dulak with a 4 mob train and me starting at 60% mana and 80% health.<br />
<br />
of course the downtime after that was bad because I don't have stoicism yet. but on a regular two or 3 mob pull there are no problems at all and downtime is a bare minimum.<br />

oh yeah, and I never get the enchanter super crack.</div></div><hr />

But really, alot of you guys replying are talking about haveing torpor or Q, and those are still pretty damn rare spells not everyone has.  Just using Cann4 I end up costing the cleric a good amount of mana while they heal me up.</div></div><hr />

Your statement is hard to believe, unless you or the tank are VERY well decked out (tweeked).  Maybe I'm just jelous (or maybe I'm a sucky shammy), but four mobs, with the roots, slows, heals for the tank ..... a dot or 2......  I dont see how you did that when you started at 60% mana, and no KEI.  Heck, you didn't even have you 49 spells or pet!!  I'm not calling you a liar, I just dont get how it was possible.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm being a bit critical, if you were tanking, you wouldn't have to root dot one of the mobs.  Is that how you did it?</div></div><hr />

Having to cast malos/slow (not necessarily in that order) and then hit some groupmates with a few heals (so cleric can keep tanks alive) takes a lot of mana.  Once that's done though, I'm usually gtg and will usually be able to recover that mana while even throwing a few dots/rain around. It is pretty hectic though and not how I'd like every pull to go. All that wincing gets tiring. ;) I can't wait until canniV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This wasnt addressed directly to me, but answering for all those who are playing similarly to me:<br />
<br />
That is a ludicrous statement.  If I were nuking instead of cannibalizing, I would be adding more dps, but the group would have to wait on my mana to regen before taking on the next mob.  It would be in no way efficient for me to spend my mana on nukes when for less mana the mage can nuke for 4x what I can.  The fastest way to stop any group is for the healer to be low mana.  <br />
<br />
I would agree with the &quot;minimal and lazy&quot; characterization if I were sitting doing nothing, but I find nothing &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot; about chaincasting thru every fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">In exp groups I usually don't get too terribly LOM.  Unless we have multiples...for a long time.<br />
<br />
On raids, I very frequently heal or nuke myself to OOMness, depending on what the situation requires.  No time for Canni when spamming the heal button.  I tend to use canni5 early so I can have it back again at the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Rhuine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">with cani5 quies and scm3 i dont even get lom when i mgb fo7 down to about 30% usually and just cani5 and im back to 80% in no time. as far as xp groups go I usually go with 4melees me and achanter or a bard, basically i heal and slow and the enchie or bard is on cc. and its rare that im every below 50% mana and then its only until i can cast cani5. I find it amusing when we have a couple adds in a exp group we finally kill em all and the puller asks for a mana check =)  I did however go oom in pov about 2 weeks ago the group was me war cleric ranger ranger rogue and the pull was 3 mobs, i try to slow one and the cleric chs the warrior, insta dead cleric. im trying to slow and root the other mobs and the warrior dies cause i didnt have time to heal him =) so then i got two rangers each tanking a different mob with the rogue running around trying to figure out who to assist and i was casting tnargs on one then the other was hilarious, we ended up killing the mobs but i had like 5% mana at the end of the fight and i cani5ed like 3 times during the fight was amazingly fun tho =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Each time you were chewing, you could have been nuking instead, or dotting, or somehow adding to the dps of the mobs.

<br />
That doesn't work.  If you are cannibalizing then you are regenerating your mana.  If you get to full mana and then stop and just sit there, then yes, you are being lazy.  Once I get up to like 95% mana, I nuke or dot, then start cannibalizing again.  My mana is never full, but it is usually very close.  If I were to go dot/nuke heavy on a few mobs in a row, I would be sort of low on mana.  Then, I would have to stop nuking and dotting entirely to work my mana back up to near-full.  I also try and time it so that I am around 60% mana when canni5 is going to pop, so I can use it immediately and be near FM.<br />
<br />
So, basically, you can either throw out a dot every now and then and keep your mana near full.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
You can dish out lots of dots and nukes for a while, then stop dealing them out completely while you regen mana.<br />
<br />
The end net result is the same in either case.  As long as you aren't just sitting there with FM waiting for the next pull, you aren't being lazy.</div></div><hr />

Xegony during the last 15% on healing MT (before I m usually busy and at 60% mana all the time)<br />
Fennin because I burn all my mana in heals instead of half my mana in nukes (Fennin die too fast for me to unload all my mana in nukes ...)<br />
<br />
either that, I m rarely bellow 50% mana.. Yeah we got a good mana regen.. well we paying a lot for it already.<br />
It's nice to have mana and a good mana regen and to brag about it.<br />
Too bad we don't have any spell that worth beeing casted to spend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">it is not hard to go LOM or OOM in fast killing group like Potactic pit, it actually more fun if this happen; because it mean your group kill too fast and you have to root/tank add or so, but you won't OOM/LOM for long since each canni5 will bring it back again; for most &quot;safe&quot; group(good tank, chanter mez), it hard go OOM .<br />
<br />
for raid, I ususlly go OOM when mob nearly die(chain nuke mob!) or we nearly wipe(chain Tnarg's heal !!) or MGB Fo7<br />
<br />
for solo, it is pretty easy become OOM before next canni5 pop</div></div><hr />
