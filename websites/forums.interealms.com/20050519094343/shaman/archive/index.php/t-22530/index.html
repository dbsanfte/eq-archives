<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, OK NO flaming please! I remember warriors griping and complaing about how much their taunt sucked. Truth is it did. Matter of fact still does. However warriors accross the board put their foot down and said fix it or we are gone. Have we as shaman tried this or even thought about doing it?  Just curious is all not in need of arguiing and all that  BS just honest opinions of whether you think it would work or not.<br />
<br />
In all honesty from what I have read on eqlive boards and what they &quot;are considering&quot;  will porbably not make a whole lot of difference. I mean look at the most recent patch they screwed up AA's and druids and shamans were healing better getting more crit heals and they had to patch that fricker fast.  My point is they don't and won't make us more useful healers.  Not sure where I read the post but someone went to E3 and asked about shamans and what they were planning on doing to fix them. I believe their reply was something to the effect of nothing they are fine. And then they bragged about a lvl 51 shamm they had on staff. What the heck can a lvl 51 shamm tell them that will help the high end game where they suffer? I don't get SOE they steal everything Blizzard and other companies come up with because they don't wanna loose their player base, and try this &quot;tell us what U think crap&quot; and then don't do jack.<br />
<br />
I have spent a crap load of time investing in fun and developing my character but if they do not do something I am going to have to change or quit because with each exspansion I become more useless.  Thoughts please post em<br />

Perhaps we could garner the support from other classes that Warriors did, but honestly, I think many classes are well aware of our shortcomings and are basically of the attitude explained by Catty, a &quot;Who cares, make a BL instead&quot; attitude.

Yet , on my server Drinal at least, I see the high end guilds loosing shamans in large numbers. Most high lvl guilds seem to be looking for them so I think there are some things we offer that others may go to bat for us over.  I don't know maybe I am a optomist or a bit of a loyalist in the fact I went to bat for warriors maybe they would go to bat for me.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget Druids were even more useless then we are now when they started making their stink about CH.  I think we have some say Maybe I am just up on the clouds but I think if we raise our voice someone will listen....... I hope...... otherwise kiss 350 played days good bye.  Kind of sad really. Why put a class in a game and then like that class enough to make a hybrid of it then make useless the very class u drew the hybrid from. Maybe we would be better off having Verant back at the helm instead of Sony.....shutters at the thought....</div></div><hr />

Dont go to raids or groups just either sit down in a zone (i was trying to think of a truely shaman zone... CoM is all i could think of) or dont log the shammy on altogether, and see if that makes any impact on the game.<br />
To see properly would have to be a weeks sitdown/log out thing<br />
<br />
but then you would need the entire shaman community not just a few</div></div><hr />

People see shaman as whiners, and we do whine, alot. But we've also had cause to whine, because all our polite requests were shot down with comments about 'but you can slow' and 'you solod Yeldema'</div></div><hr />

Only shaman in the guild at the time. (Main that is)<br />
<br />
They didnt get a new shaman. One guy that came back like 2 weeks before me did start playing his though.<br />
<br />
We would be missed. But it would be cause of our personalities Not our abilities as a class.<br />
<br />
As a class we are replaceable in every aspect of the game. And every facet except Alchemy.  Maybe not quite as good. But 5% aint much differance when healing wise we are at 47%<br />

<br />
It really depends. On older content you've already done before probably multiple times warriors are definitely replacable by appropriately geared pally's or sk's. On the other hand if your just breaking in and doing conent for the first time every bit of hps, ac matters and being able to use evasive/defensive discs really does help out. Having just started doing time there are definitely some gods in there that would be very difficult if not impossible for pallys/sks to tank with out needing gear from those gods and beyond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not debateable. A knight CAN NOT tank the vast majority (95%+) of very high end (Time+) raid boss mob content until such time as that content has already been fairly farmed out (if at all) and WARRIORS WILL HAVE IT NO OTHER WAY. Just read PoN or TSW to see the truth of it.<br />
<br />
I run a 65 210AA warrior and 65 235AA pally and play both daily. Pallys have uses (like topping off my DAs, occasional LoH and BSS) but thats about it beyond piddly DPS. In fact pally is getting booted from my 6box to make room for ranger (DPS/track). Level for level, gear for gear, the pally just cant handle the spike damage that a warrior can and that is ALL GoD is about....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have we as shaman tried this or even thought about doing it?<br />
<br />
Dont know about you, but I cancelled my two account after playing almost 5 years. Havent had any desire to come back either, because SOE has shown they dont care about this segment of the EQ community and our concerns. They also are catering to a different demographic than when I started playing EQ - and I'm not part of that demographic. I'll wait for the next roleplaying game to surface..whichever that might be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">even tho ive heard bout all the bad things bout a shaman.. that doesnt discourage me less..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mephista D'Monica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Only two shaman needed on any raid.<br />
One to MGB 7.<br />
The other to MGB 7 again if the raid wipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think that the plight of warriors is a somewhat different one than ours.  Warriors can't really solo in any real sense (well for VERY short stints using all their disc's) while we are all aware that except for the hightest content we can solo quite effectively.  I am not an elemental equipped Shaman and I can solo quite effectively at &quot;the tables&quot; in the Plane of Fire for instance.<br />
<br />
Our normal guild and RAID functions are to slow, buff and heal (let's not argue about whether or not it's patch healing or primary healing for this discussion).  The warrior's primary function is to keep aggro on the group/raid's target so the rest of the crew can concetrate on killing the monster and keep only the warrior's healed.  If they can't simply keep aggro they cannot perform this function and on many kinds of encounters his group/raid will simply fail.<br />
<br />
We argue that we're marginalized in high end content by other classes abilities and the design (high dps/low hps) of the encounters at that level.  That still leaves us with most of the rest of the game (including LDoN's, groups, Tier1-3 planes, etc..) where we are still a valuable addition to groups and RAID's.  If Warriors couldn't taunt effectively and survive under difficult circumstances than they were simply USELESS.  They can't solo so if they weren't group/raid worthy they were simply relegagted to tradeskilling ;)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that as healers we are not able to stand alone in the highest end content.  I personally believe that heal + slow for us should about equal DS/DoT/Heal on Druids and Heal/Buff on Clerics.  I disagree with SoE's insistance that &quot;We can Slow&quot; is somehow a vaild argument not to suppliment our healing when they make all the mobs mitigate it.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps a simple solution to ask for is to for one of our slows to simply &quot;break through mitigation&quot; so that we can heal more effectively.  I might see an argument that if we were given this ability AND we used it when there are Druids/Healers were around it would make the encounters trivial.  I haven't thought of a good counter to that but I'm sure this good community will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sony doesn't care<br />
<br />
EQ has to have warriors, it does not have to have shaman.<br />
<br />
if we all pack it in, then the only ones left are bots.  that would be fine with everyone but us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yup.  There are more than enough shaman bots around, and as shamans quit there will just be even more of them, to last the game until they finally pull the plug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I see the name Blarg is this same one from Drinal? if so Great seeing you big guy.<br />
<br />
I have to agree. With many posts on the need for warriors and why they were helped. <br />
<br />
I look at the spell Nihili and see a neg resist with  a 1.5 cast time, disease based and 75% slow (last I checked Lucy) Yet, many of the highest end guilds on my server have never even seenthis spell, or for that matter. half their guilds population ha snot even gotten their GoD spells but here we are already facing a new exspansion. I wonder if making Nilhili more available would quiet the community about bl's replacing shamans for slows.<br />
<br />
Second, I hate to think that I would walk away comepletely never to return to this game after so many hours. I know there are a lot out there who feel the same. I just honestly do not like any other class like I love the shaman class. Seems like, as I eluded to earlier in a  post, SOE is kicking themselves in the teeth. For example, The two highest guilds in EQ have left for WoW, CoH has knocked a huge gap into eq and when WoW is released, it is my humble opinion they are going to be facing closing servers.  Now they could make it possibly if they would simply listen to the community.  Shaman have been neglected for as many exspansions as I can remember.  I just HATE the thought of walking away. I love the competetiveness in this genre and this game at times but if my class is going to be made extinct, then like Blarg said......  Maybe it is time to pack the bags and walk away to something new once and for all.......<br />
<br />
LET us hope OoW does for shamans what no other exspansion has done for them... made them useful to the high end,<br />
<br />
Xan out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Interesting that people have bought warriors into it, as they have just had a nerf to defensive in the boss fights in Tipt and Ikkinz Chamber of Might. They lose aggro as soon as they /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
quote from a warrior posting on the Sony boards:<br />
Take a good look at the shaman class people, Slow was as the Knights would call it a &quot;game breaking hack&quot; so look how bad it got nerfed, just a few mobs to start in PoP and just about everything in GoD mitigates. This is only the start, our discs are dead now. But don't stand for this, we got changes once we can get them again. The knights complained enough to get us nerfed we can complain enough to get it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well, Shaman are still needed (in raid guilds anyway) I know my guild is hurting for them atm.  Blood of Nadox is a spell you're forgetting about, it helps a lot once you get into PoTime.  Shaman are still extremely good for slows as enchanters often times are busy with handeling adds.  Not saying in anyway that shaman aren't as useful as they were even back in luclin, but you are completely useless.  Although the dwindling shaman numbers in the high end speak it, shaman are getting bored with little to nothing to do all the time.  Druids used to be in the same boat for the most part, crappy heals that could barely help, nukes that did crap damage, and dots that did crap damage.  It wasn't all that long ago, so I understand how you guys feel, just stick around and Fight SoE for some upgrades.</div></div><hr />
