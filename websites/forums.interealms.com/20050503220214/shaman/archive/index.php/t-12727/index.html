<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 56 shaman in my 10 person guild that has nobody online ever....... has grown old. I needed a break from him and just thought I would go hack some mobs... I made a frog pally... and did the pauldron thingie to 24.... The pali boards I found suck...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a good pali board... or where to go after Pauldrons to get a group or easy solo.....<br />
<br />
No I am not giving up on my 4th Shaman... just thinking about finding a guild that has some ppl online.... in the mean time.... I want to IN THE FACE some mobs....<br />
<br />
Low levels are great fun....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 24 try South Karana, Neth Lair, or if your lucky Rathe Mountains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the same thing, my monk just wasnt tanking good enough to duo with my shaman (esp. in pop post nerf), so I made a frog paly.<br />
  I only stayed in pauldal until 21 (leveling is alot easier with a 61 shaman standing behind you) then went to DSP and killed in the shroom house.<br />
<br />
As for a good paly board, this one seems to be the most active and has some good info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also Crystal Caverns underneath Eastern Wastes is pretty good for a group. Problem is not many groups are down there.<br />
<br />
I wouls say DSP is your best bet. Lots of people and pretty easy to get a group and that will take you into your 40's</div></div><hr />
