<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just bought torpor in the bazaar last night.  On my server, it seems to generally sell for 100k.  When I saw it last night for 75k, I couldn't resist, so I snatched it up.  Since I just spent an absurd amount of money, the laws of &quot;just my luck&quot; would seem to indicate that they'll do something to make torpor as common as water in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
So there ya have it.  You can all take a break from scrimping and saving for it or camping it.  Seems almost certainl you'll have it within a couple weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shoulda saved for Q. It's been selling for 40k - 60k lately on Stormhammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You made the right decision.<br />
<br />
The road to 65 will be a lot better with Torpor than without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bought mine for 60k and the next day it dropped from jumpy.<br />
<br />
I had a guildie send me a tell asking, &quot;what just broke?&quot;.  I responded with, &quot;huh?&quot;.  He then asked, &quot;well, what did you just throw across the room? :)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mogug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL guildie got a deal on torpor for 25k ... I bought it from him ... 4 hours later it dropped.<br />
<br />
The dropped one went into our guild bank since I didnt need it anymore. I just sat there and stared at my screen and wished evil thoughts.<br />

On Brell.. you never see torpor in the baz unless for some ubsurd amount.  Have seen Malo a few times for 60+ with the occasional dip**** selling for 110k.</div></div><hr />
