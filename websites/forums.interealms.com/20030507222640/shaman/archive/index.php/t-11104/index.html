<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting a new shammy and I've got around 100kpp to play with.  I was looking for suggestions on what gear I should buy.  Should I go with a couple of big items, or spread it all around to all my slots?  Thanks for any help you can give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well for one, what race?<br />

fungi of course is the item for twinking.  that'd tap most of your cash if you don't already have one.  aside from that I just don't see much high end stuff to spend pp on because most of the higher end gear wouldn't be useful for some time now, ie any of the good JB pieces or some of the newer gear with level recommendations or requirements.<br />
<br />
other than that, go with focus items.  that would be my number one concern if I were to twink a caster.  get mana pres, maybe a healing focus, buff duration, and extended and affliction efficiency.</div></div><hr />
