<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems shaman are quiting in herds lately, so im wondering if we can put together a list of all the people and come up with a number of people that have quit due to shaman related issues or SoE related.<br />
<br />
I would like to make a nice short none combative post on the EQ site just to go...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is the cash you have lost&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just my idea and if you dont like it, move on from this thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont know about others but ofcourse the thought have slipped my mind to quit. I am still struggling as dumb as I am among the betatesting and cockblocking ala soe. Hmm, maybe this was wrong thread to put this in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The thing is ,  lots of accounts get sold, so the real impact on the SOE bottom line is hard to estimate.<br />
  A high end shaman is an handy additional account for farmers/plers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ free for 3 weeks now I think. ;)  It's harder to kick the habit of lurking various EQ sites than it was to quit playing... :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I cancelled my second account, full of alts, in protest to the God awful customer service, lack of attention to Shaman issues, horrid Gates expansion which I bought on the first day (silly me), and inempt responses by Brenlo.<br />
<br />
Hell, at one point I regreted deleting my second account and asked that they restore one of my alts so I could continue playing him.  Made it clear that I would need the character restored in order to continue using (and paying for) the second account.  I never even got a response except the auto response saying they got my e-mail.  In the past, 6 months or so ago, I asked for an alt to be restored and got both confirmation and the alt within a week.  Their current customer service blows donkey diks.  <br />
<br />
Still have my Shaman main and mule on primary (now only) account, but my not last long.  All my friends are now playing City of Heroes and I'm hearing a lot of good things about it.  Open beta now, goes live this month.  May be a better use of my time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ended billing last night. I posted a tongue in cheek &quot;Please include a disclaimer on any expansions where Shaman are going to be useless&quot; on Sony's new board, and it was deleted inside of 12 hours. Not sure why, but my response was to recognize that my input was not desired or required, so I ended billing. I almost expected to be banned which makes me wonder about the current mentality at Sony, when I am afraid of their customer service. Seems a bit oppressive to me. <br />
I shall probably continue playing until billing runs out, and see what shakes out. I have also heard some good stuff about COH, and am getting more curious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canceled 2 accounts this month.  My man also canceled his 2.  We finally accepted that EQ is very COMPELLING, even though it's no longer even remotely fun.  I'm pretty sad at the direction they've taken the game; I won't be coming back (yeah, that's what they all say).<br />
<br />
I think I can safely say that the marginalization of the shaman class is why I quit.  And agreed with above, it was easier to end billing than it is to stop checking the boards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I canceled my billing during a 3 week long fiasco trying to get a refund for accidentally order GoD.  I'll try to make the story as short as possible.  <br />
<br />
/begin long pointless story<br />
<br />
I send an email to customer service.  The customer service guy kept quoting bits of the EULA and how all fees are pre-paid and I already recieved the software so it couldn't be returned, etc..  I kept replying basically telling him he was full of ****, and that there is nothing in the EULA that applies to non-confirmed expansion downloads.  A couple weeks go by, and Brenlo posts a response to someone else on Sony's boards to forward his refund request directly to him (Brenlo).  I send Mr. Customer Service guy a link to that thread and the next day I have a reply from him telling me it was refunded.<br />
<br />
During this whole time I filed a complaint with the BBB and my bank (cause I had been using my bank card instead of my credit card) to try and get the refund.  I canceled the billing on both of my accounts so that they wouldn't have any active billing information and couldn't auto-charge me for anything like that again.<br />
<br />
The whole expeirence left me jaded by their lack of effect customer service.  I had been a customer for 4 and 1/2 years and they treated like **** the first time I ever had to contact their cusomter service.  <br />
<br />
Will I activate another billing cycle when the current time I've paid for expires?  I'm really not sure at this point.<br />

<br />
I'm proud of myself and enjoying RL.  I'm getting active, catching up on shows/sports, hanging out with friends, and getting sleep!  This is coming from a Shaman who had nearly 500 AA, raided nightly for 4 years straight (played since 1999), and has over a year of /played non-AFK.<br />
<br />
I basically quit because of two factors:  the lameness of this class in this expansion and the fact that it is time to wake up and enjoy RL.  If I can kick so much ass in this game, why can't I do it in real life?  That is the main reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I ended a couple weeks ago... should probably come up about the 30th. If they don't provide fixes, I'm out too. It doesn't even necessarily has to be shaman-related fixes, it just has to make it fun again... but I don't see that happening... 15 more days. I tried logging in yesterday, and couldn't move at all, so said &quot;Ok, whatever&quot; and went to be &quot;compelled&quot; in Enemy Territory (where it was smoother than a baby's butt).<br />
<br />
T minus 15 days, and counting. Tick. Tick.<br />
<br />
Include 2 friends of mine who are on their way out too, and only started around Thanksgiving. One of which works graveyard shift, in military reserves, and parties on weekends. The other working as a computer programmer, putting in 10 hour days. The former not having the urge to login at all, the latter just getting a headache by clicking the EQ icon, myself almost falling asleep in my chair by clicking the EQ icon, and the fact I'm starting school (for programming) myself in August and will be hurting for cash big time.<br />
<br />
Departing right before summer starts, definite plus... maybe check out some softball games or just hang at the park or something, just plain get out of the house between school and finding employment.<br />
<br />
Am I losing contact from anyone on Rodcet? Not really, most are too busy raiding anymore anyway.</div></div><hr />

I still hold attachment to it and sentiment to the game I used to play and still hold concern about the welfare of the shaman class.  I know I would definitely think of coming back if any major changes happen. Oh I didn't quit due to the shaman issue though, it was a continued lack of interest in the game, and my computer would struggle with GoD probably and balancing RL.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if it makes a difference, but my friend told me he loves my shaman and doesn't see why I hated it so much.<br />

I didn't quit due to shaman concerns though, was just boredom of the game concept in general.</div></div><hr />

I honestly am not sure what besides a crack-like addiction is keeping me here- I really despise SOE and the direction EQ has taken starting with the flagged content in PoP.<br />
<br />
Like my rl friend recently said when he shared his account info with an online friend:<br />
&quot;Eh, if I get screwed I'll just quit, no big deal.&quot;<br />

I quit mainly because you hit a glass wall of sorts, you can only go so far, then you need to join a raiding guild. Or spend endless amounts of time in ldon, at about 2 hours each adventure not worth it for my taste. If Sony came out with a not so timesinking way to play I'd go back....... but that will not happen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just to add my point of view. <br />
<br />
<br />
I just found about 7 friends that play FFXI and spent the last 2 days learnign and tweaking the controls and found its really great this time around.  If this pans out im gone from EQ1 and have intention of coming back for EQ2. Ill know in 2 weeks for sure, but really i cant see much more life in it for me. I love my shaman so much and ever other toon i have is just a weak second, but with the lack of communication and SoE simply not understanding what we as a shaman need and beyond even that, just not having a vision for the class. We are in limbo and they dont know what to do with us.</div></div><hr />

I have lived thru lots and lots and lots of game growth problems and the general feeling the players are beating their collective heads against the wall. Then something would come along in a patch to address the issues (somewhat) and get the game back on track.<br />
<br />
Now SOE is just patronizing and condescending with no clear inhouse concept of what the game was or where it is going. Too bad. Their loss is the quality of the people playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I really like it Litgruv. Combat are fast and even a defender like me can take 3 or 4 mobs of the same level (I'm lvl 13 right now). Just finished what they call a task force with some friends. That's 9 or 10 mission (a mission= a ldon) linked together where you gather information and stop evildoer's plans with a real story behind. Took us 3 night, you can log anytime but can't take another mission until you finish the task force or you you quit it.<br />
<br />
There are still some tuning to do, we had 4 mission in a row in a lvl 15-16 area. NP with the actual mission but getting there was not easy, a lvl 16 mob can kill a lvl 12 PC very fast and mobs are often in pack (Perez Park is horrible for this, group of 20+ mobs are not rare). Right now its laggy but the servers are overloaded, they want to see how high they can get before it get unplayable.<br />
<br />
One thing that I really like is that a mission scale not only on you level but also with the number of PC in the group. So a soloer will encounter maybe 20 mobs in his mission but doing the same mission with a full group of 8 will probably mean 150-200 mobs.<br />
<br />
And you can fly, what more do you want :)<br />

<br />
That doesnt mean I play regularly. Played Morrowing for most of February. Have loaded up classics like Alpha Centuri and Baldurs Gate to pass my time for large periods. <br />
<br />
I always end up back in EQ though. The game just offers too much, enough for everyone to find his niche and float there for LONG time, longer than any other game in history, at least on my machine. Whatever style you want to play, casual, raider, tradeskiller, merchant, loot farmer, twinker, you can get YEARS of enjoyment from EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Edit : The main reason I quit. No interesting 1 Grp dungeons with proper ADVENTURE! in expansions others than generic dull as dishwater LDoN.<br />
Exping sucks and raiding was like a job rather than a fun exciting game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to get frustrated and take 2-4 months off at a time back when you could never find mobs that were not camped.  For the past 18 months I had played regularly with obviously no problem finding groups, solo spots or the like.  Problem is that with the added content came the dumbing down and the gutting of the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
About 6 weeks to 2 months ago I got fed up with being dead wood on raids and stopped playing Sion.  Rolled up a Berserker but that is a worthless class.  Played Dungeon Siege for a few weeks single and played with the editor.  <br />
<br />
The more I read about EQ2 the less I like it.  SoE has really hurt themselves with this gamer.  I started off thinking it would be great but I think they are screwing it up now.  Vanguard does look good and I trust that group of designers more than any others in the industry but it is gonna be awhile before it is out.<br />
<br />
I may just continue to solo and LDoN with Sion for a year or so waiting for Vanguard to come out.  I hate to give SoE revenue, but not much choice.  I really wish I was more into Super Hero world.  City of Heroes looks pretty good.</div></div><hr />

You might look at the Warhammer on line game that is due to come out some time this year.  I agree with you 100% about the cartoon graphics in WoW, the game is going totaly emersive to get me to look past those pretty purple graphics.  But the Warhammer game has a much more gritty, dirty, bloody feel to it.  Granted I've bias as I've been a warhammer gammer for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I haven't end my billing yet, but I think I will be soon. I haven't play EQ in 3 weeks. I've been playing CoH as well. I imagine that my EQ days are finally over. Been playing since November of 1998. So it's been an extraordinarily long run. Not sure if I'm quitting because of Shaman getting screwed/SoE is crap and EQ is going downhill or I've been playing this game way too much and need a change.<br />
<br />
That's one of the great appeals about CoH. Totally different genre and playstyle. That's one of the reasons I'm not so excited about WoW. I'm looking for something else other than fantasy genre. Superheroes are a wonderful switch. The problem with CoH is that I can't settle on just 1 hero. I've made like 10 heroes and got them to the 7-12 level range. But it's lots of fun. They have a very solid base and good potential. The question of whether they will be able to add the play content and play features to keep people playing. But they seem very committed for now. First major addon is free and coming after a month or 2.</div></div><hr />

I have even activated my old second account to PL up a new main, if I can make it through the drudgery and that class doesnt become obsolete either. Rather discouraging to log on one day and have a wonderful time then for the next week every attempt at EQ seems dreary. I will say that thanks to the NHL playoffs and nicer weather passing on EQ has become much much easier these days. Now if only Dallas would get off their collective A$$ and play a full 60 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I think EQ is starting to feel the pinch of competition. A lot of other games are gaining people's interest. We've always known the EQ way wasn't the only way, but as more real, playable options become available, people will begin seeing other ways in action. Some will decide those ways aren't just different but better. EQ will have to improve or wither.</div></div><hr />

The game has lost its fun for me again.  I will never get the feeling of the first trip to freeport those first weeks of the game.  EQ nowdays is a sad shell of the game from 5 yrs ago, and i mean in fun terms.  The time sinks are too much for me.  I now play Black hawk down and JO beta.  I log on for afew hours kills some guys then log off.  Having a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I enjoy CoH Litgruv, but my disclaimer is that it's not EQ. That may be a good thing for you, not sure?<br />
<br />
Combat is exhilirating, gfx are amazing, when they aren't stress testing there is virtually zero lag. Character customization is the largest seen in any game so far I'm willing to bet. There are many many many different directions to take a single character, alot of your play time is in instanced zones so &quot;camping&quot; is either eliminated completely or reduced to nearly zero (outside missions).<br />
<br />
There is a great storyline that unfolds the longer you do missions, if your just taking the missions to level up or get new missions and don't pay attention you'll miss one of the best parts of this game. <br />
<br />
There is not &quot;loot&quot;. No bodies to look into. This scares alot of EQ players I think because it's the desire for that next shiny that seems to keep us going. The loot you get is money (called influence) and &quot;enhancements&quot; that fit into the slots of your spells (powers) that enhance a particular aspect of that spell, be it, reduced endurance (mana), faster casting, longer range etc etc.<br />
<br />
Enhancements automatically pop into your enhancement bar as long as you have an open slot, for unused enhancements you can either sell them to NPC for influence or trade them amongst your friends.<br />
<br />
It's a new genre brought to MMORG status and as such is in it's infancy. I expect much better things to come from Cryptic Studios in the way of expansions. Much like the EQ of old was fun but evolution of that game was paramount in keeping us playing such is the same with CoH. But for now they've got the basics in and it's quite fun.<br />
<br />
There are no trade skills.<br />
<br />
As a level 20, for instance, you can &quot;sidekick&quot; a person 5 levels or more lower and they can &quot;con&quot; mobs at the 20th level so their spells hit more often. They won't do more damage then normal but your late comer friends are not excluded from playing with you. The exp at sidekick status is reduced but it's close to what you would of got soloing stuff.<br />
<br />
About sums it up for the high and lowest points really, it's the first game in a long time that gave me even close to that awe I felt when loading up EQ for the first time in 1999.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sangori Sanspeur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I have played a shaman almost exclusively for the last 4 years.  I have gone from a very hardcore player to a very casual player.  I don't dislike the general concept of EQ, but I find my shaman to be so completely boring that I can't bring myself to log her on anymore.<br />
<br />
Initially I just didn't log on at all.  I have tinkered around with City of Heros and it really is a fun game, but it doesn't offer too much goal wise. (in my opinion at least).  Still craving the EQ crack I've been playing a necro alt non-stop for the last week.  I find I still like the game.  The problem was the character I was playing.  Who knows how I will feel after the necro becomes old hat.<br />
<br />
Will I quit EQ?  Yes, eventually, but I'm not as close to the door as I thought I was now that I've put my shaman on the back burner.</div></div><hr />

Poor people, you just don't realize how little your personal view matters. I learned this in relation to EQ back in 1999 with Verant.<br />
<br />
As for me, I always quit EQ. But there's nothing in it this time that seems to be able to draw me back. EQ is a terrible, unplayable game of mostly waiting and chattering.<br />
<br />
I'm playing Lineage 2 for the time being, but doubt I'l stick that one out once it becomes clan dominated. L2 would have made a superb single player game (yeah I'm getting sick of playing mmogs, it's you other people that make the games suck so much.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Hail,<br />
<br />
I recently found out I'm paid up to September.  :(  Guess I bought a 6 month block back in the beginning of March. :eek:  Doh!  Wish I hadn't done that now.  No way of getting a pro-rated amount back either.<br />
<br />
I gave away a Tactician's Bulwark &amp; some other items today, a few to a relative stranger.  I will be moving all but the best of my tradable stuff to my spouse's one account sometime this week.  Haven't decided whether to sell my account or just let it die.  Friends keep trying to talk me out of leaving. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I blew 75k today on Preserved Chokidai Vocal Cords just hoping for a little entertainment value.  Mildly amusing to see dogdog talk &amp; watch the reactions of my friends.  Goner says 'I love you Meatshield!  Can I hump your leg?' :p  ~300kpp left in the bank, maybe another 100-200kpp or so in mid-end junk to give away, and a few high ticket items (fungi, manastone, some Glyphed Runed Words, etc) to figure out what to do with before I actually quit.<br />
<br />
The biggest impediment to me actually completely quitting right now is probably my own laziness.  I played this afternoon for the first time in over 2 weeks, and I didn't miss it at all.  Didn't really have much fun today either even knocking out an AA or 2 (didn't really pay close attention).  I'd love to do GoD, but I just don't bring much to the table and even w/ almost 400 aa's I'm not really wanted there for those who are filling out their groups.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Lag is worse, collision problems, all coupled with longstanding little issues (dogdog won't shrink or dual wield w/o rusties, etc) in addition to our high end shaman woes just has sucked most of the life out of the game for me.  It has been a good run, but I think it is time to move on.  I'll miss the people though.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have to log on or even have EQ installed to cancel billing - just visit their website.  You can manage your subscriptions there - automated CS is one thing they CAN do!  ;)<br />
<br />
I haven't logged on to EQ for about 2 months and I'll likely cancel billing any time now (I haven't yet since I'm not fully decided and my wife spends way more per month on yoga so she can't complain about my subscription fee for a game I don't play!)<br />
<br />
I had no problems with the shaman class but kinda though the GoD expansion sucked and the flaws, exploits, latest rounds of horrific patches, and the often terrible attitudes and playstyles of other players finally got to me.<br />
<br />
EQ is a great game - but there are other good MMORPGs.  If you play any of the good MMORPGs they're addictive as hell.  If you can somehow take a significant break from them long enough to get rid of the addictive feelings you can look at them more objectively, see their flaws (of which EQ has many) and do without - or at least consider higher standards.<br />
<br />
For now I'm staying away from all MMORPGs even though the urge to make return visits to AC1 or DAoC or even to try FFXI for a while are strong.  I think taking a break for a few months will make my initial experiences with WoW, EQ2, or DnL even better when they finally ship.  The &quot;wow feeling&quot; and freshness will be stronger after going entirely without MMORPGs for a few months (after 5+ years of near constant playing).<br />
<br />
You see, I love the MMORPG genre, but even though there are some good offerings currently available I feel the genre could be SO much better...and rather than play the best of what's available and make due I'd rather not be addicted to something mediocre - I'm holding out for something that's truly worth being addicted to!</div></div><hr />

I did not quit because of GoD directly but more how the game future looks (same old same old now for several expansions) and the fact I have no real interest in EQ anymore.   Was fun the years I played (wow where the time go) but am glad now to finally, finally, finally say goodbye.  I think the biggest reason barring lack of original gameplay these days I left is how SOE treats players.  I don't take crap from salesmen or other companies and for some reason I did with SOE with EQ.  Nah no more for me.  I am not paying to be their beta tester for EQ2 or new game engines.  <br />

I parked my Trollie at the top of the DL spires, He always liked the view there, and there is the last fond memory I have from EQ. Competing with friends who can fall the most times and not die (trying to lev in mid air).<br />
<br />
After DX9 issues and raids being wiped and bugged, I was sitting last night in Barindu LFG for expedition 5. After a good 45 minutes of trying to put an expedition together and failing due to the fact the clerics and enchanters were already busy piggybacking others, I got a tell for an invite to an adventure, and that was my moment of clarity. I have wasted too many hours over the years waiting to play this game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Oh, I stopped billing in November on both of my accounts.  Some of the reason was frustration with the current state of the high level shaman, but frankly I was more irritated with Sony's direction with the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
I could go into my proposed fixes but what's the point really.  If there is one thing I have learned in my EQ career is that the developers - whether Verant or Sony just don't listen for the most part to their customers.<br />
<br />
I'm shaking my head at their lack of vision more than anything else.  It just seems such a waste to have a client base of passionate and loyal folks and to ignore (much less acknowledge) their constructive comments.  I don't know about you all, but I believe that the game is on the whole better than it was 4-5 years ago since many travel time sinks and camping have been eliminated, but I think that EQ has fallen woefully short of its potential especially in the &quot;immersive&quot; aspect.<br />
<br />
I won't even get into appropriate class balance which really should have been ironed out by now (one might think).<br />

<br />
The reasons   are mostly personal. Need to concentrate on more important things. Playing a shaman has allways been fun for me despite any shortcomings the class may have developped over time. If my guild and friends are still there when I'm once more in a situation where I have enough free time to nurture a video game addiction I might reactivate. However seeing how fast my friends are following suit and weaning themselves from eq.... we'll see. At any rate I enjoyed playing EQ for 4 years. Met a lot of great people along the way. Still get the occasional nervous twitch thinking of all the things I'd still like to do in game. <br />
<br />
Untill then that's 2 accounts canceled here. + 2 more since my brother only kept his active so we could play together every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">I was going to end billing, clicked through my account to do it, and saw what I had forgotten about long ago -- that just this once, the last time to be specific :P , I had clicked billing in six-month increments.  And, I had just renewed a few days ago!  Argg!<br />
<br />
So...I still have five months left of time.  <br />
<br />
Too busy playing poker online now to see what my friends are doing with Blarg these days though.  Most of them hardly ever play anyway, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was where I left him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Well, to tell the truth, if anything, Samanna's chart shows that Gates and other factors really isnt having that big of an impact at all (although we all know this isnt the case). Ending billing and just plain not logging in are 2 VERY VERY different things though. Remember that. But seriously, 50ish accounts ended? Of the how many 1000's of lvl 65 Shaman across EQ? Of the how many 100's that come to this board? How many shaman have REACHED 65 since Gates came out? <br />
<br />
Lets also keep some other things in mind. Accounts can be re-newed. Characters, even deleted ones, can be retrieved. If someone has posted here that then ended billing, then decides to give it one more chance, I hope he/she has the nads to step up and admit it so that the &quot;chart&quot; can be adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
I think most of this is just the simple fact that EQ is old, and its run its course for many many people. Even if huge positive changes were made, there would still be dozens of excuses to quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">This wasn't an argument post, Blazz.  Pull up your pants and peddle your posies elsewhere.  It's inappropriate here.<br />
<br />
I think the idea that one could take a post like this as indicative one way or the other of the drop-off of accounts is silly.  This is just people putting their names in a thread in case people they know were wondering, or to say so long or whatever.  The vast majority of EQ regardless of what the class is doesn't haunt message boards consistently, and for people who never heard of you or played alongside you, coming here to tell you they're leaving isn't exactly a high priority.</div></div><hr />

The point of this thread is to get some &quot;gauge&quot; of how many shaman are quitting the game. My point was merely as an &quot;outside&quot; (i.e. not quitting) observer looking in. People are putting up spreadsheets with numbers on them. They should be SOMEWHAT accurate, don't you think?

You are a very bitter person Blarg. I generally have nothing but respect for you on these boards, but this isnt like you. Are you annoyed that I have managed to find a balance in EQ that has kept me relatively happy playing the game as its designed?<br />
