Any tips from you veteran pvp shamans?<br />

this being my arena experience on a blue server, I'm sure the zekkies can chime in with much better advice than I have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should know PvP is entirely situational, there are some classes you just wont be able to beat. I took on both of my guild's best wizards and took em down no problem. Using only breath of ultor, pox, and plague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't bother fighting a bard who knows what he's doing.  Necros will own you most of the time unless your gear is way better.  If a wizzy gets a nice crit in you're done for.  Chanters aren't bad if you have crim pots.  SKs you can beat if you can keep your distance, if not HT wins everytime.  Everyone else you shouldn't have too much of a problem with unless it's like a main tank for a big time raiding guild or someone with ridiculous gear compared to your own.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Skilled pallies are a pain also, you gotta hope they blow their mana trying to root/blind/stun you or you really don't have much of a chance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a few general brief things, since my other post is extremely long.<br />
<br />
First off, how are your resists?  If you are resisting their spells as much as they resist yours, then you're fine.  If not you will probably lose no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
Second of all, your main strategy against casters and priests is going to be to just outlast them.  I don't know how my gear compares to yours, but with about 4k unbuffed HP, I don't feel there is any caster or priest class that is really a threat to me.  It will never be like &quot;surprise you're owned!&quot; because they burned me down.  Just heal yourself and eventuall they'll go oom, then its only a matter of time, because you get mana back quicker than they do.  Necros are an exception to this, but I don't feel like writing any more detailed guides unless you specifically ask.<br />
<br />
For melees, your main strategy is going to be to use a DS potion and nukes.  Against melees, as long as you have good MR (to avoid snare/root), you can just kite them.  If you are starting to go low on health, quiescence yourself and run away.  It takes forever but eventually you'll wear them down.  Paladins take the longest because of their self elixer and the fact that most of them have a weapon that procs heal, but shadowknights are the most dangerous, because they have near unresistable lifetaps and of course, a harmtouch that takes off 75% of your life.  To beat an SK you have to keep yourself quiescenced constantly and kite constantly to make sure you don't drop low enough they can kill you with a harmtouch.  Pretend 75% is really 0%, and you've only got 1000hp.  I've pulled off a few wins against SK's with full AA HT's, but it isn't easy or fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure about duels on blue servers, but on red servers necros can heal themselves better than anyone with their 2 second casting lifetaps.   It is extremely difficult to beat a smart necro.  I don't care if you have 6k unbuffed HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frogy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rabid Bear is the key to victory!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not to burst your bubble, but the Shaman class isn't even close to the pvp powerhouse it was back when lvl 50 was max level. I've been on VZ since the first week, so I have some pvp experience.<br />
<br />
You say &quot;High End&quot; pvp. On Vallon Zek Defiant is the top guild and has been for years. (I'm sure any VZer will agree) I'm relatively new to their guild due to the fact that they never accepted darkies until this summer. So I've spent the past 3 or 4 years pvping against some of the best on the server. <br />
<br />
Here is my opinion on how a shaman will fare 1 on 1 against any of the top 3 of each class in this &quot;high end&quot; guild.<br />
<br />
1. Paladin (No shaman in EQ stands a chance at killing these paladins. You just don't have a chance.)<br />
<br />
2. Shadowknight (No shaman in EQ stands a chance at killing one of these guys either.)<br />
<br />
3. Bards (consider it a victory if you can get a gate off.)<br />
<br />
4. Warrior (If you honostly think you can land a spell on a 10k tank with all their AA's and MR over 400 that can hit you in the 400's well good luck. )<br />
<br />
5. Necromancer (I suppose you could get lucky, but I doubt it.)<br />
<br />
6. Ranger (Maybe a 20% chance of a shaman victory)<br />
<br />
7. Monk (Again resists. These guys pump out some serious damage. If our resist message actually did damage then we would have a better chance.)<br />
<br />
8. Beastlord (These guys were made for pvp. Their warder will tear you up and they can heal.)<br />
<br />
9. Druid (Their crit nukes will drop you faster than you can Qui)<br />
<br />
10. Wizard (You have a chance if you can outlive their 6k crits and get a lucky heal to get your health over 75% before they MB you.)<br />
<br />
11. Magician (Again their pet can tear you up and too many people underestimate their ability to nuke. But they can't heal so drop them before they drop you.)<br />
<br />
12. Shaman (Well just be smarter than the other shaman. One has to win eventually)<br />
<br />
13. Cleric (If you don't mind a 2 hour battle, have at one.)<br />
<br />
14. Rogue (Damage Shields are your friend.)<br />
<br />
15. Enchanter (Unless you are able to break mez with a crimson potion, wave goodbye to ALL your buffs and ALL your mana. Ancient mez needs nerfed.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman have to face it. We are deadly in group pvp. We make it 100 times easier for the real damage dealers to kill everyone. We are hard to kill. Unfortunately we aren't at the top of the list of feared killers anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've dueled the best necro on my server twice (he has 4.6khp, 6kmana, 250ish AA, ft15, every focus effect, and EP legs which give him a manaless, nearly unresistable dot), who has gear that blows mine away.  Both times I have fought him to a standstill and after 20 minutes or so he got bored and gave up.  The first time, I was fighting for my life, but the second time, I felt like I was fighting a winning battle.  When he said &quot;I'm sleepy, gonna log&quot; and ran out of arena, I was at 80m and spriit call was just about to pop.  The last time that I had used spirit call, I was at 30m when it popped and I got him down to 25% health before I ran out of mana, so I feel pretty confident that I could have finished him off, but didn't get the chance.<br />
<br />
Just like any other caster, it is only a matter of outlasting him.  You can't run him completely oom like you can with most casters, but you can get him low enough that he doesn't have the mana to chain lifetap you.  Just heal yourself in the beginning when he's trying to burn you down, and he'll go lom before you do.  After that, just try to build your mana back up until you've got enough to burn him.  Spirit call really saves the day against casters, because they've got two choices:  Stand and get their asses beat (our pets will really hurt a caster, whereas they don't do much to a melee) while trying to cast on you (which in a necro's case means heal themselves), or run around and kite your pets while getting nuked (which means they can't heal themselves).<br />
<br />
Necro is definately a challenging and fun fight, but it is by no means unwinnable.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I don't really agree with what most of shinerbokk said.  You seem to be a little too pessimistic about or abilities, but that might just come from you being on a true pvp server and me being just a bluebie dueler :)  Druids, mages, wizards, for example, I don't see as much of a threat (assuming the wizard doesn't have manaburn up, of course.  No way to beat instant death at 75% &amp; lures).  Mage pet is annoying, but it doesn't interrupt the way that a beastlord pet does, so I have never really had any problems slowing it (or blind, or root).  They nuke very hard, but it isn't overly hard to resist.  Druids take forever for me to kill, but if you are dispelling their dots and cold/fire debuffs, there isn't really much they can do to hurt you.  My CR is only 152 unbuffed, and I haven't had much trouble with them.  Again, against wizards, it is a matter of resists.  If your resists are low enough that strike of solusek is landing, then yes, you are going to get reamed.  However, in my experience against wizards, they've used nothing but lures which wasn't too hard for me to outheal.  The biggest problem I had with wizards was actually killing them once they went oom, because they chain cast their epic rune.<br />
<br />
You've definately got the right idea about what makes fights against these classes challenging, but I think you underestimate our ability to overcome them.<br />
<br />
edit:  Shiner I took a look at your magelo and your extensive pvp experience, so I'd like to offer a second option for why my views are different from yours:  People on my server suck at pvp :)  Maybe you are right, hehe... you definately have about 100x the experience that I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think Shiner is a real shaman though.  He spent some AA on Alchemy Mastery. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As for spells to have up during PvP, what do you recommend (assume the shaman has all their spells)?  I usually have a root, dispell, malos, cure blindness, a DD, BoS, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For wizzys and thier epic rune the answer is simple. Dots. Runes do not absorb dot damage last i checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Check my post. My statements were in regard to &quot;high end&quot; pvp and I was using the top players of each of these classes from my own guild. <br />
<br />
The gear and skill of the players in the &quot;high end&quot; guilds makes them extremely difficult for a shaman to fight 1 on 1. Outside of the &quot;high end&quot; guilds, I don't have nearly the trouble killing other classes. <br />
<br />
Yes...a shaman can kill each and every class. Some are easier than others, but they all die. I've killed each and every class 1 on 1 more than a few times. <br />
<br />
I can go out and find a 65 paladin to kill 1 on 1 no problem. He will probably be in a smaller guild and lacking the gear of a &quot;high end&quot; paladin. So when I say No shaman in EQ stands a chance at killing these paladins. You just don't have a chance I'm talking about the paladins in the top guild on my server. <br />
<br />
I also wouldn't say blue server players suck at pvp. There are some very skilled pvpers on every server. Just like there are some pvpers on red servers that really suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">True high end PvP where people start running around in Time gear pretty much makes all spells useless. When you're running around in 400+ unbuffed resists and routinely resisting life-taps and lures, unresistable damage is king. The only effective damage is completely unresistable (pure melee, DS, SHT, MB) and beyond that it only matters how long you can continue to do that damage. Gets to be pretty hard kill anyone. All the &quot;healer&quot; classes become virtually unkillable because they have so many HPs can can just keep filling them up forever. Even trying to kill a Warrior takes forever and a day because they got like 8k of HPs. It all becomes pretty pointless because everyone is immune to spells and anyone with a heal can keep fighting almost indefinately.<br />
<br />
To get an idea of what it's like go try kill some newbie guards. The ones they use to guard towns that resist everything you throw at them. Or maybe something like Brother Qwinn/Zephyl. Only easily accessible immune mobs I can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm talking about the very high end, as well.  I don't have any trouble at all with people whose gear is on par with mine, it is only people from the top guild on the server, and casters with 1000 more HP than me that give me trouble.  I definately respect your opinion on PvP, with 4 years of experience under your belt (I respect your taste in beer, too, go texas beer!), but I have beaten all of these people that I supposedly shouldn't have a chance against, so it just kind of makes me wonder.  I like to think that I win because I am a dueling god, but this little voice in the back of my head tells me that might not be why :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i can't remember the last time i've lost a pvp fight that wasnt to a wizzies mb or a shk's ht.<br />
<br />
key to wins is lev39 blinding luminance, yessir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shaman is my favorit class to play by far but in the overal pvp shaman arent isnt the best class.<br />
<br />
Is sure that if a shaman jump on you and surprise you if you got low resistance in the high end you got some good chance to win.<br />
<br />
Well in general I,d say that shaman arent good at pvp but arent weak, But if your guild planing to do a PVP raid to kill all the citizen of keletin ( we did it often on tallons zek ) a good shaman that can cast molosi and slow is always a must to have<br />
<br />
If you really make your choice to find the bests pvp  char dont choose a shaman  but if you want a powerfull char that is good in pvp shaman is a good choice</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone knows that amazons is the top guild on VZ!  <br />
<br />
From my perspective as a shaman that is not in a top end guild and is kill on sight to the 2 top guilds on the server i agree with shinerbock we are not equiped for 1on1 pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Being on a PvP server for 3 years, I have seen everything.  Everyone that posted has the right idea.  We cannot PvP like we used to be able to.<br />
Spells...<br />
<br />
DOTS - TOTALLY useless now.  Since the average person resist (on a pvp server) is at about 200 now, forget about hitting someone with a dot, even with Malos.<br />
<br />
HEALS -If you have spent all of your AAs on healing spells, you can keep up with blasts from most classes, unless they critical. That is until you are oom.  Quiescence can and will be dispelled.<br />
<br />
PET - The little bit of dps it does on pvp isnt worth the mana it takes to keep your pet alive when it is attacked by someone.<br />
<br />
MELEE - A joke, unless you are after a pure spell caster.  But they can usually regain their casting and recast dmg absorbing shield on themselves.<br />
(I use the Sharkspine Club with a 125dd augment proc, and Dark Mace of Thought when I am lom) = not too bad against a spell caster.<br />
<br />
POTIONS - flame shield potions are very usefull against many melee characters until it gets dispelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only things we can do against classes = <br />
<br />
Melee class = let our flame shield potions do most of the work and hope we dont get interupted when you heal yourself. (rangers = you need to stay very close to them so they cannot use their bow)<br />
<br />
Caster class = melee them, bash them when they cast.  And try to keep up with your heal when you get hit with DD.<br />
<br />
TOTAL = shaman are not a very effective tool when it comes to PVP anymore.</div></div><hr />
