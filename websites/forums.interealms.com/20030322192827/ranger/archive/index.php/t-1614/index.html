<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pants the Ranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys. My guild is raiding Mistmoore in a few hours, and I just wanted to know if any of you know the best way to approach this? I've raided it a few times before, even lead a raid once, but never got as far as I had hoped. We should have at least 3 full groups of 35+, mostly 40+.  Any suggestions on the general raiding of the castle would be helpful ^_^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">probally too late boe but me and a few friends (36 ranger me 32 warrior and 51 monk; warrior and monk way twinked.  haha even the monk was twinked for his level).  we just wasted everything til we got the the ledge leading to the caste.  hung out there to heal up.  moved inside the castle and stayed in the main room.  from there we moved past the gates and went into some room with a table.  got some awesome bard weapon for a friend and some item for a quest.  easy kills and ok money there.  we didn't do the tomb thingy.  it should be easy for 30s + 40s seeing as how one 51 could waste everything almost no problem.</div></div><hr />
