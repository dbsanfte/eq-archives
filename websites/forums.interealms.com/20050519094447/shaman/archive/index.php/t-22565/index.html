<br />
My guild has downed Auliffe about 3 times before last night with minimal headache.  Easiest of the Towers to be sure.  Last night was a different story though.  Between 2 chanters and 2 Shaman, we could not get him crippled.  Each of us constantly casting.  We tried casting far away and we tried casting under him.  No luck.  We tried to raid him twice and got our collective @$$ handed to us each time, whereas before, not one person would have died.  Here was our resist debuff efforts:<br />
<br />
1.  Malos -- Applied immediately<br />
2.  Malosinia -- Resisted all 20-some attempts. (No big surprise)<br />
3.  Bard Resist Song -- Applied immediately and sustained throughout the fight.<br />
4.  SK resist recourse -- Resisted throughout the entire raid.<br />
5.  Tash -- Applied after about 3 attempts.<br />
(No Mages were present.)<br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed or know of a change to this?  Is there something else we/I could have done?  This is our first attempt on him since the patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah.  Coulda swore someone said &quot;resisted&quot; last night.  But no matter.  Thanks for the correction though.  I play a SHM exclusively so I often lack intimate details surrounding other classes' abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It might be just me but i'd give up after the 2nd or 3rd resist *shrug* Back up heal the MT, it will help a lot more than resisted cripples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He is rather super magic resistant, I just layed in with ice nukes on him or tossed some heals around. Wasn't much else to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Likely just one of those weird strings of resists that &quot;accidently&quot; happen. If you have previous successes and only one encounter of consistant resists I would hold opinion until after the next couple of attempts. See if there is a new pattern - and even then the results (small sampling) are going to be subjective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've killed him tens of times and I think I've managed to cripple him maybe 3-4 times total.  He's SUPER Magic resistant as others have said.  Maolsinia is the key to getting Cripple to stick, but to be honest if Malosinia lands I believe that Cripple would have stuck beforehand.<br />
<br />
As others have suggested, don't bother with crippling him.  Alternate between ice nukes and healing the DPS people on your raid.  The key to beating him is to keep the melee alive so that the DPS has time to run in/out between his AE stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having your Chanters charm the &quot;wind / flying&quot; looking models with C.O.D. greatly increases your DPS.  Said models can be Maloed and snared iinm and your Chanters can stand at a great distance so there is time to recharm.</div></div><hr />
