It works but gawd it's slow now.  My daughter's computer downstairs seems to be ok.  <br />
<br />
Is this a setting issue with my router? or do I holler at Roadrunner?  I do have cable modem access.  <br />
<br />
I did go to the forward tab and change that setting so EQ wouldn't crash every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

This is indication that your cable connection is fine, but your wireless link is giving you grief.<br />

Looks to be your wireless setup. Most mainstream wireless gear is 802.11a/b which runs on the non regulated 2.4gigahertz bands. Here's the most common reasons why you will have trouble with your wireless setup. Work these out and you should be golden.<br />
<br />
1. Configs- make sure your setup, configs, antennas and gain are configured correctly.<br />
<br />
2. Interference- This is the biggest problem with 802.11. Things that are the most common sources of interference: Microwaves (approx 15-20ft radius when in operation), 2.4gighertz phones, certain electrical devices, certain EMI emitting devices will get in the way, neighbors devices (mostly applys in aparment complexes) and building construction depending on the materials used in your building it might be very tough for 802.11 signal to pass through your first and second story.<br />
<br />
3. defective units/cables- the other problem is things like defective units, loose antenna connections, bad CAT5/5e/6 cables or jacks and loose connections.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

I've made some progress.  I called Linksys and their tech advised to go to 192.168.1.1, enter the password &quot;admin&quot;, and go to the Advance tab.  Then go down to MTU, enable it, and enter 1492 into the box beside it.   <br />
<br />
This all seemed ludricious to me, because how's a normal person going to know this stuff, but it did help.  She suggested I monkey around with the 1492 setting in increments of 30, but to not go below 1300.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes the performance is ok, and sometimes it really sucks.  For whatever reason it seems a bit hit or miss.  I do have a cordless phone nearby, so maybe I need to move that.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm configured correctly.  I just used the wizard to install and hit the defaults.  I am not sure how to check that, or change it.  There's not much offer in the way of information in the product materials.  <br />
<br />
Are all wireless routers like this?<br />
<br />
Chief complaints:  My browsing speed is really slow at times, including downloads.  The computer downstairs browses fine, but can't do things like play videos online - which I can do.  I made sure it's got Window's Media Player 9.0, but it just won't play that stuff.  <br />
<br />
Any more advise would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Routers aren't simple pieces of equipment, that is for sure.  There are a lot of people (including me) who pay money to learn to configure and maintain them, and there is a lot that can be configured wrong, and that can go wrong, period. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
For the most part, yep.  They all suffer from the same vulnerabilities to EMI (electromagnetic interference) due to the industry standards (that 802.11a/b the other guy referred to) and generally use the same configuration schemes.  <br />
<br />
I honestly am not overly familiar with wireless networking, so i can't offer any advice, but if they're anything like ethernet routers, sounds like one of your ports may be configured incorrectly.  Either that or it's just interference problems. <br />
<br />
In general, the basic rule about troubleshooting is:  it's almost always a physical problem.  That is, the problem 90% of the time boils down to wiring or user error.  Not being rude, just a simple fact of life =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also have linksys and a couple problems mainly w/ XP being stupid. Anyway right click your wireless connection go to properties,under advanced you should have a list w/ SSID,WEPS,Channel amongst others. Ensure ESSID (default is linksys) is the same on all computers, if not change it to the same(anything you want it to be).Then check your channel to ensure its the same(1-6). This should Give you an excellent connection and 11MBPS .If you have both of these and still get bad lag, or packetloss, it is probably your router (I had to have mine replaced) Hope this helps Gluck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grull, you lost me.  Is this under Control Panel, Internet Connections, then right click on my connection to properties?  I didn't see anything with SSID, WEPS or ESSID to check or uncheck.  <br />
<br />
How do I find this?</div></div><hr />

yikes. all internet traffic conforms to the same size MTU (maximum transmissioni size), which isn't anything more than the allowed size that a single IP packet is allowed to go up to, which at every single internet provider is 1500 bytes. By them having you tweak it lower its telling me a couple things here:<br />
<br />
1. they don't know how to troubleshoot all the possible EMI that could be interferring with your connection, so they.....<br />
<br />
2. .....assume you are shredding packets (a term used for when packets of internet data get warped, broken, or fragmented by degraded connections) and so they suggest.........<br />
<br />
3. turning down the largest size that your router will fragment packets at, so that you wont shred packets as badly.<br />
<br />
As you can see its a poor solution, and you will always be running at a 'degraded state'. <br />
<br />
My suggestion? If you live in a apartment complex, or anything like it with close neighbors and know you dont have any EMI interferring devices yourself (microwaves, ovens, some appliances, phones) and you still have problems, then drop a little money and have a wiring guy come and install ethernet in your house. Get a quote- it may be cheaper than you think to get just a couple runs from your upstairs to a central location (where your router is).<br />
