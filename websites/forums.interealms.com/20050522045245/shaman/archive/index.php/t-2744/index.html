<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in VL (I know I know) and I was leading a group of myself, a wiz, a war and a monk.  Obviously that left me with slowing quicking buffing and healing to do.  So I have just buffed the melees and am down to about 20m. I announce this.  But the monk pulls anyway.  I try to malo, resist.  Now I am pretty sure that if a mob resists malo in VL it will probably resist slow.  I am LOM so I decide to med and heal.<br />
<br />
The monk begins to demand that I slow the mob.  I only have 20m, It's try to slow or heal and kill the MoB.  I tell him this and announce that I am LoM and need to med.  But he procedes to pull again.  Well I have no mana at all now cause slow was resisted again.  Now I am angry because he is yelling that I should be slowing.  Course I am and 20m and announce it but I try to slow and am resisted, now 0m and the war is at 20h.  I had to tell him to zone cause I was oom and the monk is still telling me to slow.<br />
<br />
I am now very mad at the monk because he is telling me what I should be doing.  So rather than kicking him from the group I just gated and camped for the evening.<br />
<br />
It is even more complicated because he is a new member in my guild.  He also claims to have a 52 sham so he must me all knowing in all things shaman.<br />
<br />
Now I do not even pretend to know everything which is why I read this board.  I am also always receptive to comments that will help me become a better player.  But I will never allow someone to tell me how to play my class. <br />
<br />
I have played long enough to know what a shaman should and should not be doing.<br />
<br />
So, my question. If you were in my position what would you do?<br />
I have not made my irritation known to my guild but am thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) he's a gimp.  Very common to monks nowadays.  They couldn't hack it as their other class so go get a fungi, t-staff and decide they know jack about anything.<br />
<br />
2) any good puller follows mana reports.  Period.  Slow is grand, but doesn't do jack when you have no mana to cast it.<br />
<br />
3)  Personally, I say never invite said gimp again into a group again.  Period.  This wasn't your fault it was his, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Never invite him to a group and honestly, if he's dumb enough to think keeping you at the brink of OOM is how to do buisness he needs to get a clue.  Don't go off on him, just ignore him.  Bad players get reps for being so and word will get around. :)<br />
<br />
(reason I say do nothing is there are SO few good places to bury bodies now adays.. dang construction boom...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure what I would have done, but I don't think you did anything wrong. I know I can get from nothing to full mana in around 5 minutes, so if your monk had had the patience to wait 2 minutes, you would have had a workable mana pool.<br />
<br />
People who don't listen to other members of their group should be kicked out. But I'm spoiled, as I almost exclusively group with guildmates, and we are like a well oiled machine (haha)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well he was a jerk for sure. <br />
In a situation where I am the only source of heals and or haste then mana is at a premium. Buffs are &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Slows. So I minimize buffing to only the stuff that is really really useful. At 52 that might just be hps for the tank and str for melee and also dex for those procing/criting people. I do this because I would rather the group get to killing. If the lack of buffs slows them done so be it. We need mana to our job as much as they need hps. Having to haste on top of that is brutal. So with having so much on your plate prioritize and don't be afraid to tell the group what they are getting and why if they ask. <br />
Slow.....Heal.....Haste.....Buff. <br />
I am also assuming that you were canning your butt off while you where LOM. Many shaman don't understand to keep regen up and cann all the time. <br />
Also, I never waste mana on debuffs for regular mobs. Turgurs has a pretty low resist rate as it is. If you get alot of resists chalk it up to a bad day. It happens. It sucks blowing nearly 1k mana slowing one mob but it happens, even at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You had every right to be upset, personally I wouldn't have tried to slow or casted any spells until I was ready. Since you are the only buffer/healer/slower the group works at your pace. And if the monk dies, then so be it...its not like you didn't tell him you are LoM and need to med. <br />
Never let anyone TELL you how to play your class, accept critcism and advice. <br />
I would say just don't group with him anymore......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aah monks, most that I know, including hubby (love him, bless him) dont feel they are doing their job if the group isnt screaming lom at them, luckily for me I can reach over and slap mine...<br />
<br />
Be firm, if advice is offered, hear him out once and if you don't agree with it then say so. Something like 'Well I play this game for fun and have been doing so for 52 levels, I appreciate your advice but I dont play in that style'. <br />
<br />
And if he keeps on doing it, start telling him how to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your first mistake was, you were in Velks. <br />
<br />
Second mistake, you should have just let the monk die. Oh well, you had three people there, so that wasn't an option.<br />
<br />
Next time, just say &quot;sit your ass down for a while or you can go solo.&quot; You have to be assertive with people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If he is in your guild, you need to contact your officer or guildleader about this.  You have to deal with the fact that he may cause ripples in your guild because of the friction between the two of you that this incident will possibly generate.<br />
<br />
Tell your officer what happened, and be very clinical about it.  Then if the officer does thier job right, they will contact the other officers on the officers channel and tell them whats up.  Thats probably all that will happen, but they DO need to be informed.  This monk may be in a position to hurt a raid later.</div></div><hr />

I don't like a lot of monks anymore.  The class seams to attract cocky jerks in droves.  Every 12 year old with rushing hormones and a huge ego wants to play a monk and finding a guud, and tolerable one is very hard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I concur with the Gimp diagnosis.  Boot him from the group.  You won't miss him.  I have a gimpy monk twink myself, and when wearing my fungi he is so grossly overpowered that grouping feels like it is terribly slow and tedious.   It makes a person impatient and prone to getting groups slaughtered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found Monks to be one of the hardest team mates to deal with. They're buff hogs and will ask for several buff which will elve you broke in the mana department. I had a guildmate monk ask for STR, AGI, DEX, STA, Haste, Tuna, SoW, Guardian and Chloro and expect me to not only slow mobs &amp; heal, but to maintain those buffs. Well screw that noise.The best thing to do is give 1-2 buffs at best. I picked up some cheap JB gear just so I can cast mana-free STR, AGI, DEX, CHA buffs. I wonder if I can ever get the greaves &amp; breastplate?</div></div><hr />

My former main was a monk, and I daresay we monks did our job much better back in the days of old..  we knew our limitations, and we knew the limitations of the group/members; <br />
'course, this was a loong time ago, so I'm guess the twinking culture has bred some uber-killing-machine-wannabe-monks-who-have-zero-patience..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, he was a jerk.<br />
<br />
But, one thing that jumps out at me.  When you say 'med', please tell me you don't acutally mean sitting down and staring at the wall.  You do mean 'cannibalize continuously' right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are 3 monk twinks born every minute...at least it seems that way. I can't really complain, though, I made one too :) <br />
<br />
If you take Bergum's tale, switch out the Monk for a level 60 Warrior with primal and make the alt Shaman's level 53, you have one of the top 5 reasons I don't like Velks. Fortunately, my tale doesn't involve a guildmate.<br />
<br />
I would talk to a guild officer or class leader, however your guild is structured, and let them know exactly what went on. This could cause issues within the guild and that's the last thing anyone wants, more guild drama. Maybe the Monk can be told to tone it down or be given a lesson on mana status and pulling, sounds like he needs one :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, Megumi.<br />
<br />
Plus, it was a single mob and both you AND the wizard have root!  Root it, tell the melees to back up and regen some mana until you're ready.  Hopefully, the monk would bind his own wounds/mend to be ready for the fight.<br />
<br />
I've had 5+ pulls when I'm at 40 mana, managed to get it all slowed, back up heals, yadda yadda, and be canned back to 80 before the fight is over.<br />
<br />
Yes, he was wrong to pull when you said you weren't ready, but people are going to do that.  I don't gate out on fights and I would never gate out on a guildmate.  It would be a bad idea to get a reputation as someone that gates out when fights go bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">First, I may be wrong, so don't bite me here. But, you said Malo was resisted?<br />
<br />
Malo is unresistable as far as I know, have never seen it resisted before.<br />
<br />
Secondly, this monk is a Fing moron. I know it's best to just leave, but after I told him twice in a row that you are LOM and hold pull and he pulled anyway, then proceeded to yell at you, I would have told him that he is a Fing Moron.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, any new recruit to my guild that pulled this crap on me, and I would make sure he was removed from the guild as this is a sign that he will always be a Fing moron.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would do a /g OOM - STOP THE PULLS NOW.  One thing I like is the fact that you cannot see groupmates mana levels.  I always like to keep about 1b of mana as reserve incase the s**t hits the fan so when I am at 20m if I am with people I dont know I will say oom to give myself a couple of secs to get some back (canni3 is just not quick enough these days, roll on 58 :) )<br />
<br />
If he doesnt leave I would either boot him from the group or leave myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, if he's level 52 he was using another spell in the maloX line and said malo because if he's like me, he can never remember the names for the other spells (malosi?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Grin)<br />
<br />
Yall remember back at the beginning of the game. Necros were the end all be all with druids a close second. <br />
<br />
All you saw were a ton of lower level necros and druids. <br />
<br />
Then they got nerfed some. And rangers were the new gods. The people moved to rangers.<br />
<br />
Then Warrior balancing happened. Many moved to warriors.<br />
<br />
Then kunark and the new power thieves.  Boom thief twinks.<br />
<br />
And Iksar monks by the thousands. <br />
<br />
People begin to notice in kunark shaman are really really strong.<br />
<br />
The shaman twinks start. And the Only buff clarity on self and nuke till the mob kills them enchanters as well.<br />
<br />
Velious comes out. People are now seing monks are getting really powerful so here come the twink monks.<br />
<br />
Then Luclin and AA. <br />
<br />
Monks at 60 and gear can gather AA by the bucketload. The twinks of twinking past now powerlevel whatever class is the flavor of the month. <br />
<br />
The jerk druids of years past, the jerk Necros of many moons ago, the pickpocket in a group and steal blue diamonds ******* theves of last week are now the Ubah playa monks of today.<br />
<br />
All in the search of valadation of the sperm that thier daddy wasted so many years ago. <br />
<br />
/rant_mode off<br />
<br />
Through all of this I have consistantly played three charecters. Snoww(60 Bashy bear), Feather (Level 60 thief) and Pana (55th Enchanter)  They were all on the same account with no powerleveling till I recently moved Pana to a second account since the guild I created had 0 active Chanters.<br />
<br />
At some point in the future I may make a Ranger just to run around and do rangerly things. Hug trees, prance in the moonlight nekkid, Die in strange places that I have no buisness being in, and shoot myself in the foot with arrows. <br />
<br />
Sadly right now I am having too much fun with Snoww to bother playing the ranger. (Grins) here AA points, I am looking for You!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy bear E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">First at lom I would ask the monk to start binding wounds on me as I canniblized down - this would slow him up a bit and get you back some mana.<br />
<br />
Second in regular xp group I dont &quot;buff&quot; away all my mana  Monk starts pulling and I start slowing, I buff when I'm FM and stop at 60m.  I buff in order of haste (no chanter), regen, hp.  Dont let them talk you into full raid buffs for killing low blues.  <br />
<br />
Now if its still getting bad, hold back on heals.  I've been in groups where the only way to get the puller to stop is let him get down to 20 health then suddenly they realize they need to &quot;med&quot; :)  <br />
<br />
If they still dont get it  I simply say - hold all pulls.  Tell them you hafta' to go afk or need a pee break.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">But I will never allow someone to tell me how to play my class. <br />
<br />
Then why are you here?  That's all we do here at the crucible.  Stick our noses into other shamans' playstyles and hash things out to see what works and what does not.  If you refuse to take even the first step, how do you expect to become a good and knowledgeable shaman?  <br />
<br />
I guess it was just that one statement I was replying to.  In the case of the monk overpuller, I woulda just cannied harder and tried to keep up.  If I was truly 20m or oom I woulda yelled at him to knock off the pulls for a min while I get a bit of mana.  If he wouldn't, I would ask the warrior to please not engage the pulls the monk brings, let him solo them as you have no mana for either heals or slows at this time.  But do it in a /tell so the monk doesn't know this, doesn't suspect until he looks around and his life is dwindling and the mob's unslowed and he's like &quot;Guys?  GUYS?&quot;  By that time he should be pretty low on hps and will FD and the warrior will take over tanking.  You will have enuf mana to slow the mob and let the warrior finish killing.  Monkie boy will be too low on hps to pull anymore.  <br />
<br />
Use yer head, think of the TRICKY way to do something, the way that messes with THEIR heads, not yours.  This is a VERY social game, so social skills are even more important than gear, playing skills, or knowledge even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just to clarify.<br />
<br />
I was canning and was at about 20h at the time.  <br />
<br />
We killed the MoB before I left.  I dont leave people to die.<br />
<br />
I always take suggestions,  you can tell me what to do in such a way that I am not insulted.  Demanding something from me is very irritating.<br />
<br />
Yes I am taking about the lower version of Malo :)<br />
<br />
Only buffs on melee were HoS and quick.  I had HoS and regrowth.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not make a big deal about it.  I figure I just wont group with him anymore.<br />
<br />
Did yell to stop pulls several times.  <br />
<br />
O and the monk made sure that the war always had agro so he never got hit.<br />
<br />
Remember that a monk can FD if i choose not to heal him and the rest of the group dies while he lives.<br />
<br />
Just needed to vent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No offense to all the oracles out there, but I think a lot of people on this board forget that not everyone has torpor, and not everyone has a fungi tunic. The rest of us DO have to meditate! Of course when your HP are high a bit of cannidancing helps a lot, but us non torporised people do have to sit down from time to time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Meditating should be a last resort - even if you don't have Torpor or a Fungi, you should still have your best regen on.  Top that with an Iksar Regen BP (5k on CT), and you should be getting health up fairly well.  I'm one of the &quot;lucky ones&quot; with both Fungi &amp; Torpor, but I only bought my Fungi at 57th - so I fought in Seb, Velks, and many other places without either.  My usual method was to canni down to about 40% hp, then sit &amp; med/regen.  If the tanks aren't doing anything, they can bind wounds on you.  Good ones don't need to be told that. ;)<br />
<br />
As for leaving the group &amp; dealing with the guildmate...  As a guild officer, don't take that crap to them unless you absolutely have to.  EQ isn't the playground; we're all adults - talk to them, try to work things out.  If you can't, then take it to an officer.  That's one of my pet peeves, people coming to me over silly crap that could easily be talked out.  Heh, rant off, sorry. :p  Try to talk to him, and if needed, explain to him how much mana you need before he pulls, etc.  If he's an obstinate moron after that, then you can avoid grouping with him.  As for the various comments on buffs...  I tell the tanks what they need, and if they keep asking for something I can't waste mana on, I simply tell them &quot;No&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Grippa,<br />
<br />
He's 52.  That means a minimum of regrowth and bear regen.  If he's a troll add that, if they have an Ikky, add that.<br />
<br />
<br />
that's a LOT of regen.  With Can1/2 it's pretty easy to keep up w/ regen to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think Shjekai has the jist of it.  If you're cannidancing with the regen up and you can't get it back any faster, either he stops pulling or tell him to recruit a druid to take care of heals.  Its difficult to do everything when you're one of the few classes that can.<br />
<br />
For mana conservation where I play more than 1 role I establish priorities.  In an exp group my mana goes to slows first, heals second, effective damage third (I won't waste mana on a 42 second dot when the mob only has 20 seconds to live), buffs last.  If LoM and you're cannidancing (I usually just stand and Cann unless I'm the only healer and slower, cause I know I'll take a pounding) then he's got no legit beef.<br />
<br />
Other options would be get a pet to kill mobs faster and reduce heals, root (ghetto chant) adds/extras, and do not buff STR or haste (kill the pet too) to slow down pulls.<br />
<br />
Last option, screw the guy.  Let him die, boot him, whatever.  He sounds like a momo.  Take it up with your guild.<br />
<br />
EDIT: to correct a glaring grammar error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kunark saw an influx of Monk Twinks with all of the (then) awesome Monk weapons.<br />
<br />
The paradigm today is for a (large) guild to have as many Epic Monks and Rogues as possible to deal damage. <br />
<br />
Feign - pulling is a darned near lost art. Why split when a Monk can friggin tank mez certain MOBs (I did in Hate on an Ashenbone Drake).<br />
<br />
Pull 5, lock down 4, CH rotate on the one, rinse, later, repeat.<br />
<br />
Yes EQ is a social game, but that doesn't mean the Shaman in question bends over for the idiot puller. <br />
<br />
I AM a good puller, not just because I know zones, pathing or MOBs - but because I am able to keep a steady stream of incoming MOBs to the group without endagering the group either by: a) Overpull, b) Mana Drain.<br />
<br />
But I LISTEN. (I also don't ask for a million buffs - fektard needs the damn placebos it appears).<br />
<br />
Get out of Velks. It is the last haven of refuge for the LoIO &gt; FM &gt; OT &gt; DL &gt; KC crowd. Get to Seb or someplace on the moon, try kedge or solo in Traks.</div></div><hr />

I don't hate the guy. He just got me angry.  If I had a serious problem I would have called on a Officer to mediate.  But since it was a exp group and no one died I felt it better to just leave before I did something or said something to make matters worse.<br />

In my guild we have 2 excellent monks who are master FD pullers. They have that whole pull-tag thing going so I know a good monk when I see one.  Not to say this guy is a bad monk.  Just in this instance.<br />

i think he did the right thing by leaving AFTER the mob was dead and group was safe...especially after several warnings to the puller.  <br />
as no one died, i wouldn't make a huge deal out of it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">A good monk controls the speed of the experience..a good monk knows how much mana you have, without you saying it.  A good monk knows what the group can handle using x amount of mana.  <br />
<br />
Just to flip the coin, I played both a high level monk and a high level shaman.  As a monk, I jokingly said that &quot;if the casters have mana, I'm not pulling fast enough&quot;.  A good monk will call the mana breaks depending on spawns and timers.  Sometimes a monk will pull a mob or two to get an area broken up well, then allow you plenty of time to med.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying, don't get too down on the monk until you know him well.  I know i pissed off alot of clerics/shaman, until they realized everything I did was for their benefit.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it'll be a cold day in hell when I tell someone how to play their class.</div></div><hr />

I actually had a group where I was supposed to haste (alacrity, at lvl 44, on 3 people), regen everyone, slow every mob, and buff with everything I had.  Oh, and I was also supposed to be the main healer.<br />
<br />
It's getting to the point now where most damage oriented melees are of the mindset that if they aren't hasted out the ass and buffed to hell and back they arent gaining any real addition from having you there.<br />
<br />
I hate that.  Tell the monk to kiss your ass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hehe Qhan, I know a couple of those monks. They make life interesting.<br />
<br />
Wally ya messed up by buffing everybody at once. When those tanks see all the pretty buffs they get kinda mental and just want to kill stuff..NOW..not in a couple of minutes while you get mana back. They assume that your mana comes back magically from the mana faries or something.<br />
<br />
Buff yourself first (hos,regen,sta) get back that mana, then buff the warrior with the same 3. Get back that mana and sta the wizzie, then hos &amp; sta the monk. Get back that mana while the monk is pulling when it arrives slow mob and speed the warrior only. The monk is gonna whine, cry, beg, plead etc but tell him no. Our haste buffs last about as long as a krispy kream donut at a police convention and costs alot of mana. So your gonna be casting that alot. Sides you really only want the warrior to get hurt, plus healing the monk from pulls.<br />
<br />
Get that warrior and wizzie to bind your wounds when your below 50% health, unless the wizzie needs to med of course. The more hp you have the more mana you have via canna.<br />
<br />
If the puller dosen't listen to the healer in the group, it's time to find a new puller. Guildmate or not, I'd of booted his sorry arse out.<br />
<br />
Once you get 60 and Topor, all bets are off though as you will never have an excuse for being LoM. Unless you've just gfoc/gsta 3 groups back to back :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally,  i would have told people to not help him, whatso ever, and not healed him.  It was his idea to pull the mob, so why not let him fight it.  <br />
-<br />
Monks are an amazingly powerfull class...give a monk a fungi, get him a tstaff etc, and go watch him solo better then any other class (for the most part...).  Because of that, all the d00ds go play monks, and have no idea what they are doing, but think they are the best<br />
-----------------------<br />
On a side note, my personall gimp story:<br />
<br />
I join a group, so far just a bard and a warrior.  I buff them up, then go canni-dancing(this was pre-chloro, so my HP didn rise fast, god i love chloro).  Anyway, Im at 20m or so, and maybe 70HP, and the bard(a guy named Chisumo, on Saryrn, NEVER group w/ him).  Demands we pull...AND HE ISNT EVEN PLAYING MANA SONG.  hes not playing ANYTHING, whatso ever.  Anyway, i have 20m, so im fine, i say ok...we pull one, but i soon find out that the warrior appears to have enchanter like HP's.  Even after slowed, the war loses like a bub a second, so i have to chain cast canni in order to heal.  We finish the fight...the warrior at 10hp, me at 20, and chisumo of course at 100(if the mob even looked at him hed run around in circles until the warrior got it off).<br />
<br />
Well i sit, med etc, warrior starts binding wounds and all.....i ask for mana song......i yell for mana song....chisumo stands there....im like &quot;what the hell....&quot;, and he says nothing....then goes and pulls....I dont heal him, i send a tell to the warrior, telling him to zone, and i run.  Well, chisumo of course follows us, and eventually dies...the warrior turned out to be a nicer guy then me, and trys to help, and dies....Later im gettin him a rez, and the cleric asks for a donation...Now im not about to donate for the rez for this retard, so i tell him to donate, and i disband and go elsewhere...Run into the cleric later, chisumo gave him 1pp...thats all.  <br />
<br />
Yesterday, im grouped, and we are talking about some retard that was there earlier.  I mention chisumo as the biggest gimp ever, and the WHOLE GROUP starts &quot;lol&quot;ing and &quot;lmao&quot;ing and &quot;rofl&quot;ing.  Well, it turns out he had killed the main of the bard in my group, several times by bieng a gimp while the guy was helping him on a CR.  Too top it all off, he had seen this guy in OT before, and knew he was a bard too, and them demanded that the guy do the entire lambent quests for him.<br />
<br />

This Monk is in your guild and we all and yourself came to the conclusion he is an Idiot.  <br />
<br />
Now, if I was the Guild Leader for your guild I sure would like to know this because if this sounds like the type of Idiot that makes a guild look bad.<br />
<br />
So that said I would report him to the GL himself so he is aware of what type of person is in the guild, if you dont want to do it for yourself do it for your guild because I sure dont want that type of person in my guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">One thing I wanted to point out regarding malosi and turgur's. The turgur's line and the Malo line both resist against magic without modification. If you check the spdat they will have:<br />
<br />
Resist: Magic<br />
<br />
If you check one of the paladin stuns with damage, you will see:<br />
<br />
Resist: Magic +20<br />
<br />
That means they have a 20% chance to be resisted. EDIT: means they have an ADDITIONAL 20% chance to be resisted. <br />
<br />
If you look at the resists with an spdat parser, Malosi has the exact same chance to be resisted as turgur's does. If the only thing you are casting on the mob is slow, don't bother with any of the malo(x) line unless you have Malo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish Lucy showed the modifiers to resists like Vaslin's parser does. =\ I can't really check the spdat at work with EQCaster like I can with Lucy.</div></div><hr />

They knew their stuff when it was all said and done. By around level 30, we didn't even talk in group most of the time. We just knew what the other was thinking. Of course these two were real life friends too. Monks have the patience of a dog waiting on you to put his food dish down on the ground for him to eat. Good monks rock though. They just need to be trained well. Those punks where always sitting during down time too. Every bit helps! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously did not read the entire post Wildaar. He was doing the buffing, slowing and healing for the group. He had just got done buffing and was down to 20 mana. He does not have Torpor.<br />
<br />
I myself forget sometimes how spoiled I am with Torpor now. In early 50's there was a time you would have to hold pulls if you were the only slower, healer and buffer in group.<br />
<br />
There are limits to the game mechanics and without Torpor, a Shaman cannot do all of the above and magically replace his mana fast enough to keep up with nonstop pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Mren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Found it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than 100 mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana bar by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot comprehend this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Yeah, I've gone to soloing again.  I despise it only slightly less than I despise grouping with fools.<br />
<br />
It is awesome being in a group with folks that think.  Especially when a cleric comes by, sees there are 3 melees, a wiz, and me, and the melees don't want the cleric... because they haven't needed a heal beyond chloro or regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">A bit earlier in this thread I suggested that this should be thrashed out on the messageboard of the guild concerned.  A few aof the later respooses seem to disagree with my post: I will therefore clarify mine.<br />
<br />
If the monk is as bad as this post suggests then the guild needs to know.  The best way to do this - and one that lets the whole guild know, but gives the monk the chance to defend himself - is to use the guild messageboard.  Whether doing so constitutes harassing a guildmate really depends on how tactfully you write the posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">What I don't understand is, you cried for help and then turn around and just gonna wimper out and let it go.  This guy could make matters worse for your guild probably both inside and out.  Can start a bad rep for your guild if he does this same experience with other players not in your guild.<br />
<br />
If you're gonna ask for help, go with the suggestions.  Everyone here is suggestioning pretty much to talk to your officers atleast.<br />
<br />
Btw, those that think he can provide all this mana all night is wrong.  Don't think he's 60 was he?<br />
