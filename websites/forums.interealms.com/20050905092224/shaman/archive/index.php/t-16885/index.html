<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the only account i wasnt able to get back was my level 60 shaman so i have been PLing 1 on a new account.  I have spent from level 18-34 in Sol A and 34-46 in sol b and the exp was slowing down at 46 so i head to PoD for some Piggybacking with my level 65 druid.  My shaman was getting 1% per kill at 46 and the kills were not coming nearly fast enough for my likes at all.  I was wondering where u guys have been hunting for 1% per kill with nonstop pulls.  My thoughts were JPF which i have hunted before with my mage and there is alot of things to kill there.  My other 2 possibilities are DSP or Echo but i have never hunted in either of these.  IF anyone has any info or ideas please any help would be appreciated.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">echo is TERRIBLE and slow at this level..if you are PLing its just not worth it if you dont have the entire high level area to yourself.  If you get the whole area to yourself it might be worth it.<br />
<br />
DSP will be slow unless you do hoppers/sambatas, and if you need hides/acrylia for tailoring you might try it.<br />
<br />
JPF is my favorite zone for this level...you can get 51 doing the wolves and bears and NEVER EVER run out of mobs to pull.  Plus the wisps and griffs drop a tidy amount of cash drops.  I leveled my druid here and he could clear 300PP or more an hour with kei (of course he got a level an hour too, but thats another story..).  The area along the river is totally safe to pull to and the chances of competition are basically zero.<br />
<br />
Dulak or gunthak would be a good choice, and you should get a decent amount of loot here to make it worthwhile.  Dulak can carry you to 64 (would be slow of course, but the possibility is there :) ) with dark blues to kill~.  Blue diamonds and sapphires and diamonds and star rubies make for great loot; lousy drops off nameds though (except of course soulstripper).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">JPF is a sweet zone.  I did poachers up 50 and it was so easy.  I was getting 1% still at 49 and at 50 i probably was getting 2% per 3 kills.  This is a great zone u never run out of things to kill.  Now i'm in PoN doing Wolves with my druid grouped with Shaman getting 1% per kill.  It is alot slower then JFp but the loot is alot better too.  Saving up for that lizard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can do dryads up to 55 and gnolls up to 59 (solo, JPF).  Just be aware that mages and beastlords typically do the dryads.  Loot off them is pretty nice as they can drop an armor piece that sells for 70-100pp and they drop spell components and around 5pp each.  Just be sure to buff your magic and fire resistance and poison/disease for gnolls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Havent done those levels for quite a while, but West Freeport guards and Arena and a couple East Freeport guards, lots of spawns</div></div><hr />

Jagged Pine Forest - portal to it in the Half Elf forgotten village of um...I forget the name :P.  Basically go North of Qeynos into that half elf village/cave/forest thing.  Enter the cave system near the lake or pond.  And stick to your right.<br />
<br />
I think those are fairly good instructions but they could be better.  Haven't been in a LONG ass time to that place, and haven't evenr personally gone into JPF but I fought poachers in the caves there :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">City of Mist.  Since the zone revamp, mobs xp has been upped and HP lowered.  I PL'd my mage there today and took about 90min to do all of lvl45 (with KEI).  Only thing my shaman did was pull a mob with slow.  the Mages pet/nukes killed the mobs.</div></div><hr />

Agree on City of Mist. Took my rogue from 43 to 49 there. It's an outdoor zone with dungeon experience. You will also collect heaps of your shaman's epic pieces just from xping. <br />
<br />
People often come through and killed Ghiosk when taking out the BRs. So you should be able to get your 6 scrolls,  High Scale Icon, 3 books of Ghiosk while you are there.</div></div><hr />

I agree.<br />
<br />
I PL'ed my ranger in Sol A &amp; B .. I was quite surprised how fast I got thru 45 - 50 in CoM.<br />
Very fast exp here, mobs have very little in the way of Hp's.<br />
I got thru it in about an hour each level.<br />
<br />
An added bonus is you can work on your epic while you exp.<br />
<br />
Decent coin dropage too, but little in the way of bazaar loot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Septech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm PLing a rogue friend in Nadox atm on the elementals (zone in from gunthak)<br />
<br />
Each kill he makes 4-5% per kill and theres a total of 8 elementals. There are 3 ele's on land where you zone in and then 5 in the lava - all easy singles, they're on a 20 minute respawn I think. We can go through all 8 before they start respawning and in 20 minutes he makes around 40% xp and maybe more if the named spawns (corpse spawn) which gives 8% xp.<br />
<br />
I started PLing him there at 42 and plan to till about 49 as he'll still net 3-4 or 5% per kill till 49. I also did 50 and 51 in Nadox solo and if I remember correctly, still made 2 to 3% per kill.<br />
<br />
Link below will give you better details about the area...goodluck<br />

The little village/cave/forest thing is the starting home of all Half Elf Rangers and Druids, and is called Sure Fall Glade. :p</div></div><hr />
