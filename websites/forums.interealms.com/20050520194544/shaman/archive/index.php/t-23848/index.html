I bought this on Friday and spent the weekend using it in different situations.  Its been pretty useful and is especially useful after death to rebuff yoruself and others and let your mana come back.  Also when your doing alot of buffing at various points of raids.  I have to give this ability an &quot;A&quot;.  Its not quite the must have Cannibization is but its pretty darn useful.  Whats your thoughts/experiences with this so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have not trained this ability yet but it will be the first thing i train as soon as i ding 70 (grin).  Can see at low mana this would work great with trushar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my one problem with this aa, is that it doesnt really help shaman that much,sure in some situations like mana drain and buffing if only shaman, but i can already recover from death and have enough mana to mgb within a 1 min of death with canni and the new canni spells make this easier. i just think something esle might have been more useful.<br />
<br />
note i not saying its bad, just i think other things might have been perfered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what's the HP/Mana ratio used in casting spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The low down on the AA looks like this:<br />
<br />
It takes up a BUFF SLOT (so can be cliked off I presume) ....<br />
<br />
It last ~ 4 minutes, recast ~ 36 mins.<br />
<br />
The conversion ratio seems decent enough ... casts of Daluda's Mending can cost me anywhere from 558 - 778 HPs, so I assume its effected by Focus effects ... <br />
<br />
Would guess the ratio is somewhere between 1.8 - 2.0 for conversion ..<br />
<br />
As the first poster noted, its useful, and has many situation in which it is handy .... post-rez, post mana drain event (eg 3 unexpected mobs in camp), etc etc .... <br />
<br />
Its not a &quot; must have &quot; AA ... its more of a &quot; handy &quot; AA to have (a bit along the lines of the Puppy Zerg Force AA) ....<br />

i am curious how its 4 mins? last i checked it was 3 mins? or is it affect by other things?<br />
<br />
1.8 * mana cost give you the hp cost i belive is correct. and it does take a buff slot, which is bad as they will be in sort supply even with 5 extra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surely, if you're in a situation that warrants the use of spiritual channeling, you can find one buff out of fifteen (or twenty) to click off and make room.<br />
<br />
Edit: the duration is three minutes. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5932&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />

Clik the AA, put cursor over the buff spell, 4:12 remaining ....<br />
<br />
Quote Lucy to me all you like, but I use it AS A REFERENCE, not a given ... <br />
<br />
as another example of your beloved Lucy being wrong, Tell me (from Lucy) whether the Effect &quot;Vengeance of Eternity&quot; on the Item &quot;Symbol of the Planemasters&quot; effects our 24 second MR DoTs (Bane, etc) .... <br />
<br />
Lucy says no, whereas I have the item and say yes, I have seen crits of over 1000 on my Bane ticks ...<br />
<br />
So knock me all you like, and quote Lucy to me as often as you want, it don't mean squat compared to personal experiences (which is what I offered) ....<br />

PS. Yes, I have plenty of example where Lucy data is different from observed data.</div></div><hr />

Bane duration is 5 ticks so 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Since Spiritual Channeling is a buff, it is probably affected by buff duration aa's like other duration buff aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SCRM probably affects it.<br />
<br />
Edit: By &quot;It&quot; I meant Spiritual Channelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So when this aa is activated, keep the healing up with Q or mend = unlimited spell casting within that 3-4 mins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bane duration is 5 ticks so 30 seconds.<br />
Bane duration is 4 tics base. SRCM adds a tic I believe, which may put it into a category that allows it to be affected by other AA/Focus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's 5 ticks base duration...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SCRM doesn't affect DoTs...I'm sure Blazz just had a brainfart.</div></div><hr />

4:12 = 42 ticks<br />
3:00 = 30 ticks<br />
<br />
You don't have a magelo linked, but I'm willing to bet your buff duration extension is: 100% x (42/30-1) = 40%.<br />
<br />
Also from Lucy: <br />
1. Bane Duration = 5 ticks = 30s. <br />
2. Vengeance of Eternity Limit: Min Duration(30.00 sec).<br />
<br />
Looks to me like Lucy says Vengeance of Eternity should affect Bane, as your personal experience confirms. My &quot;beloved Lucy&quot; is right once again. Horay!<br />
<br />
Blazz, SCRM only affects beneficial spells, so Bane wouldn't be affected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes bane is 5 ticks:) with my time bp, i get 6 or 7 is i rem.<br />
also i took duration from the aa description not lucy for 3 mins , but as said it will be affected by aa focus likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The AA is currently bugged and not useable for mana drain fights, which was it's best use, I'd say. You need the mana to cast the spell for it to work.<br />
It's been a neat toy which I used the first 3 days after I got it, and then I put it on my second bank of hotkeys. Focus effects are now working with it in some way, but the ratio still seems very close to 1:2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Still, you can trushar yourself and basically not use any HP while its under effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Still, you can trushar yourself and basically not use any HP while its under effect.<br />
 yes but only if you have the mana there to cast that spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's 5 ticks base duration...<br />
OK my bad, I was thinking of the DOT I was proposing a long time ago, an under 24 second DOT so it wouldnt be affected, with a HUGE per-tic damage, and even a chunk of DD in the beginnning to make it less valuable in solo situations. <br />
<br />
Thanks to all that pointed out my mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You don't have a magelo linked, but I'm willing to bet your buff duration extension is: 100% x (42/30-1) = 40%.<br />
<br />
<br />
nup ....<br />
<br />
SCRM + Chrononostrum<br />
<br />
Fresh cast of Focus = Duration 140:00<br />
Lucy supposed duration = 80:00<br />
<br />
Anyway, have recast it a few times now, and Spiritual Channeling = 4:30 duration .... meaning its prolly effected by SCRM and not Chrononostrum ....<br />
<br />
and yeah yeah, Bane is 5 ticks ... am sure it went live with 4, my bad for being around way too long ....<br />
<br />
And there is still no way ya going to convince me Lucy is 100% correct .... and I still believe alot of spell data is hard coded, whether they appear on Lucy or not (aka BST slow compared to ENC / SHM slow, Rains spell resists, etc) ....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Every beneficial buff that leaves an iconon your character is affected by SCRM. <br />
No AA is affected by any focus item, because AAs are coded as &quot;class:none&quot; abilities(there used to be AAs that had a class listed, but this was corrected and any of the ones that need to be activated should have been changed by now).</div></div><hr />
