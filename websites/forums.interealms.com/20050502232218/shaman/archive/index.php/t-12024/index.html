<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jubershiro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally think I found a reason for me to get this skill but Iwanted to know from somebody who has it if you can MGB the spell Tiny Terror.  It isnt really a buff so before I spent the points jsut so I could MGB it in the nexus for fun I wanted to make sure that works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the spell has no buff icon, and therefore cannot be MGBed.  Too bad in a way.  And in another way . . people wouldn't wanna give up the buff slot to a shrink icon anyway.  Buff slots are too valuable on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">simple rule for MGB :<br />
if you can't use /tgb , then you can't use MGB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If SOE pulls it's head out of it's rear end and slaps a consent message on shrink then maybe one day Tiny Terror will have a use.<br />
<br />
I don't think the kids at Sony ever went to Ssra, VT, CoD, or the bevy of other zones that require raid sized forces to shrink up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wizzy have AoE TL to bind comfirm box no icon<br />
Mage have AoE mod rod no confirm box no icon<br />
I have AoE water (/hug VT staff in bag) no confirmation box no icon<br />
<br />
I want AoE shrink that works on people that are in the same raid than me without confirmation box and without icon.<br />
I also want grow to work on raid people too.<br />
<br />
If I can ninja shrink/grow people in my group, I don't see why I could not do it in my raid..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umbracite swarm orb should be changed to ae shrink that actually works, unlike when it first came out.  I would find that so so so amusing and useful.  Even better than AEing water!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Change spells that only work on people in your group to work on anyone in the raid window. That would mostly fix the problem while still preventing random griefing.</div></div><hr />

You use mgb on one spell pretty much. Group focus and i love it for that. Sure I can probably cast it normally and still be ready for clerics but this makes my life alot easier on me and is very handy after a wipe out, especially where we are facing respawn. 1 cast entire raid is focus and cann v/quiesence and i'm ready to go.</div></div><hr />

Well in my experiences i find it invaluable. im usualy part of a 3-4 shaman team. As the raid gets set to go we decide who does what and in 30 seconds a full raid is buffed and we are ready to go , plus if there is 4 or more shaman one or 2 people save it so when the raid wipes we can pick up and get moving faster. <br />
<br />
But most important reason for getting MGB among all others is at the end of the night when your heading to the bazaar or nexus to camp you can /shout MGB focus at center of the nexus/Nexus Stone and watch everyone gather in glee as you just made there night by hooking them up ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Waiting on clerics to be done buffing? AE Focus, AE Virtue... As only shaman on most of our raids, I can't imagine not having AE focus.  If we're all in place, buffing takes about 3 minutes to do. Everybody AE's, med up, move.  You don't have to worry about group change assignments either.  <br />
<br />
Already have to do sta on all groups up to 50-60 people, Focus too? Dream on.<br />
<br />
Anyone who doesn't feel MGB is useful as a shaman, doesn't participate in a high end raiding guild *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have used MGB regularly with:<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh<br />
Talisman of the Boar<br />
Talisman of Epuration<br />
<br />
and on rare occasions generally as a lark but sometimes for the stamina regen component<br />
<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura<br />
<br />
I think I have even done a group regen MGB here and there :)<br />
<br />
I have had MGB on both my enchanter and shaman since shortly after it became available, in my guild my alt shaman was the first active shaman to have it, it is quite useful.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">MGB is one of the best aa's I have got so far. On raids it is VERY useful.<br />
<br />
MGB Focus<br />
MGB Virtue<br />
MGB Fire/Cold Resist<br />
MGB Sta<br />
MGB Haste<br />
MGB VoQ<br />
MGB Magic Resist<br />
<br />
Do this and raid is fully buffed in less then 30 sec. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">MGB saves the most time in wipe recovery, hands down.  Lit have your guild wipe and see if all 3-4 shamans can focus the raid in 30 seconds, then say its invaluable :)   All 1 shaman would need is can5 and maybe a couple can4's... mgb up, spell up, presto... raid buffed.  Case closed ;p</div></div><hr />

I think you misunderstand what invaluable means.<br />
<br />
in-val-u-a-ble<br />
adj.<br />
<br />
1. Of inestimatable value, priceless.<br />
2. Valuable beyond estimation.<br />
<br />
Then again maybe im not reading you right cause im so tired =\<br />
<br />
So to make clear either way, its the best AA next to can5 ive ever spent</div></div><hr />
