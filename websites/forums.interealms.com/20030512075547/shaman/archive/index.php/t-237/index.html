<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had really good luck with the mushrooms in Fungus Grove.  They chain cast and hardly do any damage.  They tend to be camped though - but if they are not you can pull them 2 at a time.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the lotus plants, they are tough and a challenge even with Turgurs and Torpor.  Be careful when you run into the main area in Fungus Grove, there is one just to your left...</div></div><hr />

Not an experience camp for an oracle really, but an interesting challenge for a solo shaman is clearing the TM vampyre castle.<br />
<br />
The named have a lot of HPs, they lifetap for 200, they flurry and they can gate if you pull outside the castle. If you fight inside the castle, you risk getting repops, or named adds. Takes a bit of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find the toilers to be excessively difficult to solo at 52.  What level to they become cake?  They have way too many hit points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oops my bad. I never tried em at low 50's, toilers are cake for 57-60 that i know of. I was doing em at 57, but had epic, fungi, fungi staff and jbb. Didnt think to clarify that. Epic and jbb make em easy, fungi cuts down on downtime, fungi staff eliminates downtime. <br />
<br />
Try sun revanants in scarlet desert, they are somewhat easier, and it takes ages before you become kos to them, so single pulling is easier.<br />

<br />
Yeah, those might be good things to mention. At Level 56, with none of the above equipment, I can't solo Toilers.</div></div><hr />

Skels in The Grey I find to be anoyingly poison resistant.<br />
<br />
Shrooms are good exp but cannot be single pulled if you are under 60. <br />
<br />
Gorangas (not including Goranga Hunters) are not too hard to solo but have alot of hp.<br />
<br />
Havent tried Toilers. Shouldnt be a problem.<br />
<br />
Sun Revs are cake...though some of the reavers can be a pain. One reaver I had to gate out ... the fight went<br />
<br />
Malosini - resist!<br />
root - resist!<br />
root - resist!<br />
slow - resist!<br />
root - resist!<br />
slow - sticks....whew<br />
bane - resist!<br />
then it feared the pet which ran off...and feared me too. When fear wore off I was at half health and I gated. Just not worth it.<br />
<br />
The plateau is camped ALOT on Veeshan and there are not alot of revenants. One person and its camped.<br />
<br />
Soloing in Luclin at 58 I find to be too much trouble to be worth it. I prefer grouping anyway.</div></div><hr />

I was gonna try and think of another solo place to keep the thread on track, but I've never tried any places without either fungi+fungistaff or torpor, so my ideas are likely to be bad for a few players. Akheva ruins is good tho =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Soloing in Luclin is great exp.  I find it to be well worth it.  I soloed toilers in ME and sun revs in SD from 55 up to 60.  Before I got epic and JBB it took a lot more work, but it wasn't too difficult.<br />
<br />
I used same tactics for both.<br />
Cast pet (most mana efficient dot you have if you keep him alive - stay in melee range to keep pet from getting hit unless you need to back off for heals.)<br />
Pull with slow to where you have pet parked.<br />
Malise if necessary (yes, level 19 Malise.  It's low mana and makes enough difference on these mobs to be useful)<br />
Stack VoS and Ebolt (re-apply when needed)<br />
Melee that sucka down (channel heals thru as needed - it's not that hard with Chloroblast)<br />
<br />
I used a LOT of bandages doing this.  Worked bind wounds up to 210 so I could bind to 70%.  Downtime consisted of cannidancing and binding until I was 70 mana, 70 health.  I would then med until 80/80 and then pull again.<br />
<br />
Once I got a JBB, I replaced the melee portion of the battle with chain casting JBB.  Just channelled it right thru the beating.<br />
<br />
Soloing was better exp than groups a lot of times, only thing really better was partnering with a monk or rogue.  With a rogue partner, we were tearing up toilers and the only time I had to stop for a bit was when buffs wore off and needed reapplying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I thought we were limited to something gay for our bind wound skill. You mean to tell me we can BW past 200??<br />
