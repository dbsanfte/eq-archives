<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you do that?<br />
I got the castle key from the captain but how do you activate the lift inside? Still need a rog after the revamped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only one you can solo is the one right up front. Found that out when I went poking around the other day much to my displeasure. The only thing they added a key for is the front door, none of the other doors are unlocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The key for the lift is NORENT and drops from Neh'Ashir. Go kill her first.<br />
<br />
Being able to AE slow reavers is cool btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how do you pull her without a rouge to open her door?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can easily pull the first reaver inside the locked door of the castle without a rogue.  Shrink and go bear form, or get on your mount, and shrink, can't remember which.  But you will be able to &lt;F8&gt; target the black reaver inside.  If your high enough level, only he will come when you cast on him, I did it at 61.  Since they are pretty much magic resistant, I put the pet on him and healed pet.  Took quite a while to kill.  Have pet push it right back against the door. Stay back out of range, once it dies, you or pet won't agro the next reaver or Lord Ghiosk.  This will give you time to rebuff and get mana for next pull.  Lord Ghiosk is much tuffer than a reaver.  I actually made a level 1 ranger and got him outside the locked door and bound him there.  He can track all the reavers from there, if he dies, he's bound there, so no matter.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The very first one isn't an issue anymore because a key drops for the castle now. Neh's reaver though while I've managed to get it targeted from outside the room, I can't cast any spells on it because it is above the floor on the platform and can't get LoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To pull NehAshir, stand in front of her door and type &quot;/pet kill a_black&quot;. The pet will charge the door - get stuck for a moment - then &quot;pop&quot; into the building and start attacking. When this happens hit &quot;/pet get lost&quot; and the reaver will come charging through the door.<br />
<br />
Of course, now you have to deal with a very mad reaver and no pet, but that should be easier for a shaman then a mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could sit as soon as the pet attacks, too.  Sit is great aggro and that way you don't have to nuke your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">that or if you have trained up susspend you just pop out your susspended pet and there you goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Or not sure but spamming the PET BACK off command always seems to work for me.  If you had the Hold command then that would work even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Woot thanks for the suggestions, back to CoM soon for me. I spent a lot of time in that zone and eventually me and my little group will kill everything there on our own :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read a post somewhere in here earlier about camping while facing walls repeatedly causes you to eventually appear on the other side of the wall. Yeah it's a cheat I guess, but it raises some interesting possibilities doesn't it.  If you wanted to get into somewhere, say a specific room in a building, but didnt want to fight all the mobs along the way.....then just face the wall near where you want to go and camp repeatedly until you appear in the room.  WELL!! that would be something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can also put your nose on the door and then cast eye of zomm (clickable off stalking probes).  It will appear on the other side of the door, and then you can use that to target the reaver.  Then send pet, let him aggro, and spam /pet back off.  Eventually the reaver will come through the door for you.<br />
<br />
Of course, this works even better with summoning mobs, because they will just pull you through the door without having to bother with /pet back off, although fido has to live long enough to get the mob to 98% or whatever it is for them to start summoning.<br />
<br />
Be aware that this could also be considered an exploit, although I have never found any hard data one way or the other.  &lt;Shrug&gt;  If it is, I am not sure what else eye of zomm would be useful for, though, so I am guessing not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A warrior I know used to pull the first Black Reaver by pressing his nose through the wall, taunting the goo the other side, and the reaver would come with the goo.<br />
<br />
This, and the pet trick, and camping to try to come back in a different spot are all exploits though.<br />
<br />
How you can tell an exploit - Are you doing something that is obviously not intended?<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's hard to say, but using &quot;tricks&quot; to pull mobs through locked doors, to warp to other places, those are obviously exploits, use them at your own risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Reavers MR has been slashed since revamp, I soloed several reavers with ease just after the patch.  I could also slow all the named mobs including Rak, I got him to 50% solo before he punched my card.  Think he could be soloable now with a bit more thought put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You don't need eye of zomm, just type<br />
/target a black reaver<br />
<br />
The camp and re-camp exploit to move through a wall was fixed, that doesn't work anymore.</div></div><hr />
