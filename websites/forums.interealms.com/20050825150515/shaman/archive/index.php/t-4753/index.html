<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cuivien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been thinking....  Supposing (and that's a big IF) the new CH spells go live, in their present state (which seems to be a 0 sec. recast delay, 400 mana for up to 1950 HP), isn't this a fairly viable alternative to Torpor?  It costs twice as much mana, but actually heals more HP.  Granted it's NOT Torpor, but to my mind seems to be a poor Shaman's alternative.  Thoughts?  Am I missing something crucial?  I'm not saying it is an equal to Torpor, but certainly something that could make do.<br />
<br />
Cuivien<br />
<br />
EDIT - I mean this more in the context of soloing.  It has obvious group uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torpor with right AA skills is very powerful. Plus it can be affected by focus items. CH can't, and first indications of new healing spells say they are going to be flagged &quot;CH&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not better than torpor, but better than &quot;mini-torpor&quot; which what do lots shaman asking for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not torpor cause it costs twice as much mana, and has a very long casting time.<br />
<br />
granted torpor is good and great cause you canni 1200hp's down, then torpor yourself and your good to go.  But its expecially good for allowing yourself to take hits and be healed in the middle of a fight.  Against a hard mob, the shaman solo'r is always torpored.  While torpored, they can cast while being healed...IF you use CH instead, you cant be constantly CH'd, and you run into trouble w/ channeling through the hits recieved during its very long cast time, and also cant cast between Cheals as easily as you could torpor.<br />
<br />
example: Mob_01 is hitting you, you cast torpor, and then cast dots/JBB etc.<br />
<br />
wash, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Example2: Mob_01 is hitting you, you cast Cheal.  You now have enough time to JBB once or twice, before repeating, and hoping you channel through, or your dead.<br />
<br />
these are w/ hard, challenge mobs.  W/ normal exp mobs you dont have to keep torpored constantly of course.<br />
<br />
Cheal is a downtime heal if you solo, not a middle of the action thing like torpor.<br />
<br />
Instead of this CH, i would rather have a mini-torpor...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cuivien <br />
- Root the mob, back off, CH, rinse repeat if needed. It will definitely help solo shamans, especially if that shaman has Cannibalize 5. Cannibalize 5 without Torpor is not the best, because you are going to have to regen the HP, but with this, it's an alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One other difference I haven't heard mentioned- the new heal spell has none of the negative Torpor effects (snare, slow, etc.) and can be cast out of group.<br />
<br />
My brother is the main tank for my guild- says Torpor-shamans he groups with always think he has a million HP because Torpor doesn't make that much of a dent.  He doesn't tell them that he clicks it off since the negative effects mean he can't hold aggro.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In all honesty, this is a good thing - for shaman without Torpor.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd much rather see them increase the drop rate of Torpor, versus adding this spell.  (Even though I am lucky enough to have Torpor)<br />
<br />
Torpor vs 75H<br />
Grouping: Torpor sucks more, because you are slowing/snaring whoever you heal, which cuts down the DPS, and the aggro the tanks draw from doing damage.  If I were grouping, I'd use the 75H to heal (assuming I'm the main healer) - but only after I had mobs slowed/debuffed as needed.<br />
<br />
Soloing:  Torpor is better, as has been said - lower cast time, you heal while being free to do other stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From looking at all the posts here on the Crucible, I don't think it's fair to compare Torpor to 75H.  Torpor is a level 60 spell.  75H, from what I've seen, is level 54.  What a NICE thing to have going from 54-60.  :)  If they implement this, along with the XP from high level mobs thing, I'll be hanging out in Chardok for all of 59 doing the Bridgekeeper/Ancient Guardians.  I can't do that duo with Chlorblast.  I betcha I could with 75H. <br />

PS - This could also suck really &quot;beyond the valley of suck&quot; bad if other classes figure out we have it.  I don't know about you, but I HATE being the main healer in an XP group, prefer to have a cleric/druid for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agreed.  I like the idea of a better heal, but (a) I don't want to have to mem 2 heal spells, and most of all (b) I don't want xp groups deciding they can forgo a cleric because theres a shaman in the group.  I'm busy enough as it is, and I DO NOT want the clerics job too.<br />
<br />
For xp soloing though, (2k hp for 400 mana+cannibalize) sounds pretty nice for those of us without torpor.</div></div><hr />

I only really hate it because we are expected to heal/slow/buff/haste when we are main healers.  <br />
<br />
I think this 75H will be good for times when you have a few friends to group with, and dont have a cleric handy, even though that never really stopped me anyway, it will certainly be a nice addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Unfortunately, everyone else will know this is out there too.  Now, we'll be EXPECTED to keep this spell up.  And I don't know about the rest of you with it, but I don't intend to unmem Torpor for this.  And I have no idea where I'll come up with the slot (maybe piss off the necros and drop Regen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soloing, torpor &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 75h<br />
<br />
More efficient, less cast time (3 sec if you have quickbuff 3), and it's not like you expect to do a lot of melee damage.<br />
<br />
Besides, would you rather channel through a 6(3) second spell or a 10 second one? Also, 75h only heals up to 75%, which means you need to have ~2700 hps for it to be useful if you drop down to like 2% health. If you heal at 40% health (to avoid low health agro or an unlucky round), that means you'll need to have at LEAST ~6000 (!) hps for it to achieve it's maximum efficiency. If you heal at 20% (1 bubble) you'll still need to have ~3900 hp for it to achieve maximum efficiency.<br />
<br />
Grouping, torpor &gt;&gt; 75h<br />
<br />
Sure, torpor slows down melees, but it's shorter cast time gives you time to canni at least once. Again, less time for you to channel, and again, if you heal someone at 40%, they need to have ~6000 hps for the 75h to achieve it's maximum effectiveness, and if you heal at 20% they'd need to have ~3900 hps.<br />
<br />
For raids, group only, torpor &gt; 75h<br />
<br />
You should be healing someone at 40% minimum to prevent low health agro, so that means your target needs to have ~6000 hps else you are not healing the full 1950 points. Only wars, extremely well equipped monks and hybrids can reach that.<br />
<br />
For raids, out of group 75h&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;torpor<br />
<br />
Since torpor can't be cast out of group, this is a no brainer... but still, your target needs to have ~6000 hps for full efficiency. However, since when it's time to spot heal nobody cares about mana usage, 75H's going to be a hellovalot more useful than Chloroblast in most raid situations when healing out of group.<br />
<br />
Of course, this only goes for level 60s who has torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Umm Boinshar you misunderstood how the spell works.  The spell does not heal them up to the 75% mark. It heals 75% of their total health or 1975 whichever is less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Are you sure about that? <br />
<br />
Iif that's the case it'll be a little bit more useful since all it takes for it to achieve maximum efficiency is for the target to lose 1975 hps, but it doesn't change much of anything else.<br />
<br />
It's still less efficient than torpor, which makes it less useful for exp groups. Usually how fast a group  can pull is directly proportional to how much mana a shaman has, wasting mana is bad.<br />
<br />
It'll still be useless for soloing, since you need to lose 1975 hps  first for it to achieve maximum efficiency AND you have to channel for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
It'll still not be that effective for group healing on raids. First, for end game fights, shamans are usually torporing the mages, because torpor is more efficient. Even if you are not grouped with mages, you want to be efficient so you use torpor on grouped casters. With melees, you have a choice. Either torpor them like before (since you have to have torpor memmed anyway) or you can try to guess when they'll take 2000 damage so you can start your 75h 10 sec before, during which you cannot canni. <br />
<br />
For out of group heals on raids, it'll be a lot more useful since it's pretty much a garanteed 2000 heal on just about anybody as long as you time it right. Certainly more useful than chloroblast in most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm betting CH/canni is faster than medding... so it isn't useless for soloing, just not good in combat... especially for those of us who can't canni/torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm busy enough as it is, and I DO NOT want the clerics job too.<br />
<br />
Strange, i've been doing the only healer in almost all the exp groups i've ever been in.<br />
<br />
It's still less efficient than torpor, which makes it less useful for exp groups. <br />
It's got almost the same mana/ratio as torpor. And also gets better if you max SCM. And it doesn't take out the DPS of a tank for 24+ secs. And getting mana back fast has never been a problem for shamans.<br />
<br />
May only complaint about this GREAT spell is that i'd rather pay 500 mana for 3k, compared to druids 400 mana for 2k. It's often a question of magnitude of effect than efficiency. If we get penalized because of cannibalization, then it should be a mana penalty, not a size of heal penalty. Particularly if both spells take 10 secs to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you're usually the healer in your groups, you've been missing out.<br />
<br />
In an XP group where I am healer, I typically have time for...<br />
<br />
Slow Mob<br />
Epic<br />
Heal<br />
Cannibalize mana from Slow/Heal (if I'm lucky)<br />
<br />
If I have even a druid healing, I can...<br />
<br />
Slow Mob<br />
Epic<br />
Bane<br />
JBB<br />
Cannibalize back the mana from Slow/Bane...<br />
<br />
... and do roughly 3000 more damage per mob.  <br />
<br />
My groups get significantly faster XP and have much lower downtime when I'm hurting stuff instead of healing.  If I didn't have JBB to do manaless damage, I'd probably feel differently, since there wouldn't be much to do while Epic/Bane worked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am 60 without torpor.  I do alot of 2 boxing, duo'ing and small groups as main/sole healer.  Shaman always shown their value in that type of scenerio but now I will able to actually get the main tank back out there pulling much (emphasize much) faster with the new ch.  This clearly has astonishly high utility from 54 to 59 and is a welcome addition for 90% of the shaman community. <br />
<br />
Sure at 60 torpor would be better in virtually ever situation, but for L54 this is amazing and fills a gap in our utility.  Would I prefer a mini torpor with comparable ratios from 54 until the gods bless me and grant me torpor?   yes.  Mini torpor would help more in soloing.  But I also understand Verant does not want to encourage soloing, so i am not surprised that they found a to address this creatively that supports their vision of the game. I applaud them this time. <br />
<br />
I find it odd that people are comparing these spells as if they were equals. They are not.  At 60 those who have access to both will find they chose one over the other based on the situation and role they are playing.  Both will sit on page one of their spell books.<br />
<br />
We have other situations were we have to choose between a higher grade spell and a lessor one.  Turgors/Tirgirs; dot or ae rain; Malosini and Malo.  Which is better?  Depends.  60 reduction or 40 reduction without resists?  Clearly Malo is but it is a 60 spell and should be better. I am sure there are situations however where malosini is still useful and it has not gone to the back of the spell book of those who have both. <br />
<br />
Yes, Torpor is better for most situations but those who say they wont use ever the new CH at 60 other than in raid situations are simply wrong. They will discover a situation where the utility of it is preferable.  That is what defines us as a class, our utility.<br />
<br />
I am also grateful in an odd way, that is does not do 3k healing. This may save us from the dreaded &quot;cleric&quot; role. We can continue to argue for a primary healer in groups.  But I am intrigued with the damge output of a group with me, bard and 4 melee/damage dealers.  I expect I will be more than able to keep up, buffing, debuffing and acting as sole healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well, we can do dmg, yep, but.<br />
if you can handle an area solo healer, you're saving 1 spot=more xp per kill, or alternatively 1 more dmg dealer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But I also understand Verant does not want to encourage soloing<br />
<br />
Hehe, and here Verant specifically and intentionally improved the cleric soloing ability with their new spells :)<br />
<br />
<br />
That is what defines us as a class, our utility.<br />
<br />
Well, I think I would use the word versatility as opposed to the word utility.  This in the context of all forms of playing be it grouping, soloing, or raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Healing a high hp melee without slowing them for 30 seconds (I have some SCM) would be worth it if I get stuck as the healer in a group.  <br />
On raids this spell will be invaluable.  It's something we've been asking for for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yeah well they improved cleric soloing to offer them more options.  I don't think it is an issue of soloing but soloing better. I don't mind seeing clerics have more options.  But there hammer does sound nice, and since I worship the Tribunal.  It would be cool to have hehe :)</div></div><hr />
