Has anyone else seen same thing or am I just being paranoid?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't MH the way i normally do LDoN's  :(  However I normally like to pull them, and i have this problem of comming back to the camp w fewer than about 5 mobs a pull.  Doing it this way is more fun than all single pulls which is cake to heal for.  That and it gets things done quite a bit faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You dont need a cleric,druid or shaman for easy. Many times we have a paladin main tank and be healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done it for years. Even in some GoD Content. (No not the trials but Riwwi and Such)<br />
<br />
But man does it suck. I get into the Do I slow or do I Tnarq's chain an awful lot on a resisted slow.<br />
<br />
Last night I was trying to duo a named In Riwwi. And of course pulled with Malo and Sicced mutt as a speedbump so I could get slow off. <br />
<br />
My hotbox SK darked the mob but slow bounced. So the Mob is picking mutt off its teeth and Tearing into the SK full speed ahead. I am waiting for slow to pop back up and notice SK is at half life. So in the immotal words of Dennis Hopper.<br />
<br />
What do you do?<br />
<br />
I popped off another Slow attempt and Lifetapped with the SK. And as soon as started lifetap started spamming the heal button With shaman as well.<br />
<br />
Sk luckily got a crit on the lifetap of 1014 critical healing as he dropped to 6% and I got tnarqs landed on him. Oooh. 1 round of damage healed. And it is still unslowed. Popped off Disc for Sk to lifetap meele. And started cussing under my breath.  Finally got another slow attempt off after two more tnarqs. and one crit heal from it gave me time. <br />
<br />
Slow finally landed. But I was at 40% mana. The SK had been chain tapping to keep up. And had proptly lost his self lifetap proc spell and SK only kei (Deathly Temptation) at the same time. (Damn 20 minute buff duration spells) So he was at like 20% mana.<br />
<br />
I pop off Canna 5 and with my buffed 5100 hp ass bleeding from the early lunch I get an Add. A 9 and half foot tall add with a reach of Andrea the giant. <br />
<br />
So I VP the add. And Fire off a speed slow. I cant spare the mana or the time for malos.  Well Slow bounces and I am a red headed stepchild just looking for a beating now. I fire a Q off  on myself and Qint. (The SK) and buy myself a second of beating. Finally get out of range of Mr add. While Qint is geting smacked around like a cheap hooker.  And get a slow off on the add. Good Gives me a sec.<br />
<br />
So I get a little upset when I realize finally that Mana on Qint isnt going up and see that his mana proc and buffs are gone and with this stinking named on him he doesnt have time to remem. So I Disc HT the big fella. 9226 Crit and the named is mad but still coming. (was at like 15%)<br />
<br />
Well about this time I am at little mana. and Qint is oom. And Qint keels over dead as I don't have the juice for another tnarqs. I spear dot the named who now that frenzy is off is trying to run. And pet swarm the add. Then dot em both and start looking for a rez for the damn punk SK. <br />
<br />
Named guy dies. And the Add dies. And then I realise a necro could just Root rot them in 1/4th the time and zero risk.<br />
<br />
Pretty damn fun fight. But frustrating as hell. <br />
<br />
<br />
(I watched the necro root rot one about 10 minutes later. While getting rebuffed and ressed and such.<br />
<br />
Disgusting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i see just as many people with buff-bot alts of other classes. enchanters, clerics, and druids are just as common to see used in that way.<br />
<br />
i do notice that most people seem to prefer to have shammies as alts rather than main chars, but i think that a lot of the reason for that is just the playstyle that most people seem to adopt when playing a shammy. most of them treat the sham as a 3rd row, stand-cast-sit type of character, and that's obviously not how it has to be for us. <br />
<br />
i think that the main reason for this isn't that shams are being turned into bots by people who want to play other casters, i think they're turning to melee types (most often dps seems to be the popular choice. i see a lot of monks with sham bots).<br />
<br />
doesn't bother me, though. i'm already a popular guy, and am proud and happy to have a 65 sham main char. i'm always wanted, always busy when i'm on raids, wanted in xp groups, and am able to duo and solo all day long when i choose to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
if people want to make shammy bots, let them--less people to roll against when something you want drops :)</div></div><hr />
