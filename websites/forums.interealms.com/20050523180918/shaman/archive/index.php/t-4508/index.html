<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo there!<br />
Well, this is sad, but I have a level 52 shaman with 170ish defense skill :( Don't ask, don't flame -- been two-boxing and grouping with good tanks, didn't get to get hit too much. But now it's starting to hurt.<br />
So, would anyone be able to advise me as to what's an easier way to build up my defense? I wonder if there's any mobs that hit fast and for somewhat less than average damage, so I wouldn't have to slow them down to tank...<br />
Thanks for any advice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I would advise getting hit more :)=..BUT...try soloing.<br />
<br />
Low blues to light blues for a bit. (CoM comes to mind).<br />
<br />
Also, when grouped slow EARLIER to get a bit of aggro. Nuke some, piss the MOBs off.<br />
<br />
Just don't piss off Velketor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure about the weak mob thing- but I'd imagine you'd want to find some old-world mob.  In general, the mobs in each expansion hit harder at the same level than mobs in the previous expansion.<br />
<br />
Also not sure if it still works, but I know you used to be able to duel a pet class and let the pet beat on you.<br />
<br />
One note- you definitely get defense skill gains faster the tougher the mob is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tougher mobs do not guarantee faster skill gains. Remember to buff up your dex to help with defense increases. I'd recommend you go to OOT and solo some seafuries for a while. They hit very lightly for their level and should be good xp for you still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent! Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've read posts about duelling friends (not to the death of course) to increase weapon skills.  Wouldn't this also work for increasing defense skills?  Get a hard hitting friend (warrior or sk), speed them up and try it.  Just a thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can't get direct melee skill raises from pvp (at least on blue servers anyway).  Easiest way would be to get the weakest bluecon pet you can find beating on you (55 sham pet might be dark blue at 52?  I can't remember).  Failing that, aye com is good, mobs are weak as anything there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 52, Seafury Clops should still be blue/light blue to you. They would be perfect, they hit for about 80 max. Good to practice lagging melee skills on as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe agility is the buff for raising defense; dex helps weapon skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I raised my defense on seafuries as well.  They're complete wusses and you can make some mad cash and a little exp while you're there.  As for the dueling thing you dont get skill improves from duels BUT I have heard rumors (unsubstantiated sorry) that dueling a players pet that cons blue to you can give you improves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree on the seafuries.  They're great big one-eyed balls of hit points that hit for next to nothing.  I've actually talked to a friend who soloed them without ANY offensive spells, just buffs and heals for himself and puppy, all damage was melee.  The only thing to watch is when they run, you might want to be ready to root em to prevent adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Roxxanne is correct.  You need to have your agi buffed, and your defense will rise faster(not dex).  Get it as high as possible--maybe buy a couple of rings.  Find a light blue mob, take it to a zone line, and let it beat you down to 2 bubbles--then zone, heal up, and come back.  You can practice channelling and heal yourself in battle if you like, but you can get dead that way by accident.  Better safe than sorry!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Any suggestions on a mob on the moon instead for in the old world, to raise defense?<br />
<br />
My second shaman is having the same problem as Vedun- playing on Sullon has made me much less inclined to solo, it seems... :) With Mums I never even knew this problem existed... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Defence just takes ages to rise, no matter what you do. I'm soloing 38-40, not because I can't get groups, but because I want to work on my defence. I've maxed peircing, almost maxed offence, and am now working on maxing 2hb.  But I only end up getting 1-2 defence gains per session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This sounds familiar.. when I started play I played with two friends - one druid, one warrior. Needless to say I never got hit so I decided to balance raiding, grouping and soloing to ensure my skills got maxed out.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest if you're still worried by 54-55ish then start tanking drolvargs, or go to Sol B and solo.</div></div><hr />
