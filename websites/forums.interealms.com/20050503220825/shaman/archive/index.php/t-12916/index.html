<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading some posts, and have been trying to figure in how specialization and SCM3 equates to manna preservation.  I read a couple passing comments that lead me to believe that specializing up to 200 in something gives you something like 10% manna preservation, kinda like an obulus death shroud.  Having SCM3 adds 10% manna preservation on your specialization (for 20% total), and gives you the full 20% manna preservation on non specialized skills?<br />
Is this right?  Anyone know, or know where I can look?<br />
---<br />
edit: I just wanted to quote Nytmare as it seems to be the general concensus of this post.  Hopefully this will save future folks using the search feature some reading.  <br />
<br />
I just got SCM3. It has two benefits.<br />
<br />
After test casting Khura's several times, I see it uses the same amount of mana every time. My Magelo profile tells me how much mana I have.<br />
<br />
Without SCM,<br />
Alteration spells save about 10-12% mana due to specialization in alteration.<br />
Non-alt spells save 0.<br />
<br />
With SCM3,<br />
Alteration spells save about 20-24%.<br />
Non-alt spells save about 10-12%.<br />
<br />
So SCM3 seems to save a flat 10-12% mana on all spells - on top of your chosen specialization (Alteration).<br />
<br />
In addition, spells that used to fizzle a lot even at max casting skill - Torrent of Poison - now have minimum fizzles with SCM3. The fizzlefest is gone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been wondering this too...as far as I can tell, scm3 gives you a 30% better chance to make your specialization checks - a succesful roll of which would give you the 10% mana saving or whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Serbitar - there is no specialization check. Specialization is a 100% of the time effect. Always has been. Probably always will be. The savings is the same on each and every cast. The savings is a flat rate based on your skill - 10% at 200, 2.5% at 50.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having SCM3 adds 10% manna preservation on your specialization (for 20% total), and gives you the full 20% manna preservation on non specialized skills?<br />
<br />
1st half - yes, 2nd half no.<br />
<br />
With SCM 3 you get ~20% savings on your primary spcialization.<br />
<br />
Spec 50 gives a 2.5% savings, which when comined with SCM3 gives ~12.5% on your non-primary spec spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Short answer:<br />
<br />
SCM3 is as good as an Obby for Alteration spells, and only 1/4 as good as an obby for non-Alteration spells.<br />
<br />
Long Answer:<br />
<br />
Despite Zyphyr's claim that there are no checks, Caster's Realm (http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/pages/special.asp) thinks differently.  According to it, specialization involves checks!<br />
<br />
However, in this case Caster's Realm is just repeating Verant's line (explained at fan faires and in posts to various non-shamanic boards where the developers don't just lurk) , so I recommend checking out Graffe's Wizardly FAQ at: http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/library/wizardly_faq.htm .  Scroll down through section &quot;2. Spells&quot; a bit until you get to the question on specialization, and then read up on the wonders of what packet-sniffers can uncover.  Or, if you are lazy, just re-read it here:<br />
<br />
&quot;Q: What is 'Specialisation' ('Specialization')<br />
A: This is an interesting one. Its an example of Verant's description having little resemblance to reality. They claim that you have a percantage chance when you cast for this skill to kick in and save you some of the mana cost. The chance is meant to be governed by you skill in specialisation for that given discipline of specialisation.<br />
<br />
Q: What are the 'Specialisation' skill caps?<br />
A: One discipline may be up to skill level 200 dependant on your level, whilst the rest are capped at 50.<br />
<br />
Q: So what really happens with 'Specialisation'?<br />
A: You save a percantage of the spell cost on every cast, the amount contingent upon your specialisation skill in that discipline.<br />
<br />
Q: How do you know? Thats not what I heard!<br />
A: Because someone used a packet sniffer to check it out (See ShowEQ).<br />
<br />
Q: How much do I save per cast with a 'Specialistation' at 200?<br />
A: 10%.<br />
<br />
Q: And at 50?<br />
A: 2.5%. (Can you see a pattern? &lt;grin&gt;)<br />
<br />
Q: What should a wizard choose as his primary specialisation?<br />
A: Evocation of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
After we ammend that last one to say Shaman/Alteration, we should prolly add this or some paraphrase thereof to our &quot;Tips from the Shaman's Crucible&quot;.  But I digress.  The point is normally you save as much on your primary spells from specialization as you would from an obby shroud, and a quarter of that on your non specialized spells.<br />
<br />
Now the explanation of SCM according to Verant is the following (taken from Caster's Realm):<br />
<br />
&quot;[SCM ] increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization roll.  For a full explanation on specialization read our editorial here.  The first point increases the chance of specialization by 5%, the second raises the chance to 15% and the third to 30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
So there are two possibilities here.  One, Verant secretly fixed specialization to work the way they always said it did, and they did this back just before SoL (when SCM was introduced).  There's a good chance that the person who did the research for Gaffe's FAQ did it pre-SoL, so this isn't an entirely impossible theory.  However, the second possibility is that VI is full of it, and that SCM just increases the amount of mana you save from specialization.  This is how it works according to Zyphr, and by his account it works out to be 20% total for SCM3 in your primary skill, or in other words:<br />
<br />
SCM 3 + Spec(200) about= 20%<br />
<br />
Now, if VI is telling even half the truth, SCM3 should involve a 30% somewhere, but without using really random formulas I can't make 30% change 10% to 20%.  So what seems far more likely to me is just that SCM follows the same progression as most other AA skills, at least purportionaly.  By this logic, SCM3 (30%) should be twice as good as SCM(2) (15%), and six times as good as SCM1 (5%).  So applying that back to are previous formula, we can interpret that:<br />
<br />
SCM 1 + Spec(200) about= 15%<br />
SCM 2 + Spec(200) about= 11.66%<br />
SCM 1 + Spec(50) about= 5%<br />
SCM 2 + Spec(50) about= 3.75%<br />
SCM 3 + Spec(50) about= 2.9%<br />
<br />
So to answer your original question:<br />
<br />
Obby (or any other Mana Preservatio item) = Spec(200) = 4xSpec(50) = SCM3+Spec(200) = 2x SCM3(50) = 10%<br />
<br />
Or in real words, being level 40 and having your skills maxxed means you save 10% on Alteration and 2.5% on everthing else.  If you pick up a mana preservation item on top of that, you get to save an additional 10% on all spells, bringinging you up to 20%/12.5%.  If you then go get SCM3 you'll save an additional 100% on Alteration spells, and additional 2.5% on your other spells, bringing you up to 30%/15%.  Alternatively, if you just have SCM3, level 40+, and maxxed skills, but no Mana Preservation item, then you have 20%/5%.<br />
<br />
So, SCM3 is as good as an Obby for Alteration spells, and only 1/4 as good as an obby for non-Alteration spells :)</div></div><hr />

Without presenting any facts yourself you are pretty much just being guilty of what you accuse Loramin of.<br />
<br />
In fact Loramin never said this is the truth. He just refered us to information given. Unless you can disprove it or come up with something better dont bash posters.<br />

And also remember. Even if you cant prove something it can still be true.<br />

I was saving AAs for SCM.  I had 11 AA saved one day and was close to my 12th.  I stopped the pulls and cast MGB Khuras (don't have Fo7) when I was at 100% mana.  That used 51% of my mana leaving me at 49%.  Not too long later I got my 12th point and went from no points spent into SCM to SCM3.  When MGB popped later I cast MGB Khuras again.  That used 44% of my mana leaving me at 56%.<br />

One or two sentences.  Great write up btw Loramin.  You put some good thought into this.  I hope you are wrong about the 10% reduction in specialization skill, and 2.5% reduction in other skills.  I like the straight 10% across the board idea!  Thanks for your posts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Verants description of SCM is wrong.<br />
<br />
Pretty much everything Loramin quoted from casters realm is wrong. Gaffe's has it right.<br />
<br />
The numbers he runs at the end are also wrong.<br />
The base numbers for 50/200 specialization are right.<br />
SCM is an additional 10% savings on top of that for both.<br />
A MP item is a random amount of mana saved UP TO 10% NOT a constant 10%.This is easy to see using a affliction efficiency item since its up to 25% and you can see the difference casting the same spells and watching your mana.</div></div><hr />

I am one of the people who did all the parsing Flargly mentioned....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, I need to explain a few things.  First off, I never meant to portray anything as &quot;truth&quot; unless it was widely regarded to be such by the Everquest community.  It is accepted truth, for example, that Verant's standard line on specialization is that it involves checks.  My point wasn't to say that Verant was telling the truth, I just wanted to give all sides of the story, ie. &quot;VI says this, but most people believe this&quot;.   As I explained in my post, Caster's Realm is frequently incorrect about things, and they tend to err on the side of old info or official Verant info.  This is why I quoted the &quot;truthful&quot; information from Graffes, which as I admitted still had the possibility of being out of date.<br />
<br />
At this point, I departed from accepted &quot;truth&quot; and went off on my own speculations.  The fact that these were merely my speculations must have escaped you Jharassik, but I appreciate the support of people like FilurGlamrist, who understood that I prefaced almost all of my statements with cautionary warnings such as &quot;the second possibility&quot; or &quot;by this logic&quot; or &quot;if that's true&quot; or &quot;seems far more likely&quot;.  However, I admit I maybe should have included such a warning before my &quot;short answer,&quot; or perhaps not given it at all.  However, I've noticed people tend to like to have a short answer given first, with an explanation of why the author thinks it afterwards (BTW, I got this habit from academic journal papers, which begin with a summary paragraph explaining the gist of the paper's argument).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, now that more people have posted, we have a lot more data, and some of my original ideas have been shown to be incorrect.  /Shrug.  Glad someone else was able to do in-game research, I had to rely on the web because the server was down and no one I knew who played EQ was on AIM.  Still, I stand by my assertation that someone should compile the information that is considered to be true, and put it in the Crucible tips.<br />
<br />
Since I'm a someone, I'll start a first draft:<br />
<br />
&quot;How does specialization work?<br />
<br />
Well, there's two school's of thought on this: Verant's, and the correct one.  The school of thought proposed by Verant, and outlined/explained at &quot;http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/pages/special.asp&quot; is that specialization is a set of skills, one of which is invoked every time you cast a spell (once you've reached the appropriate level, 30 for shaman), and depending on which spells you cast the most, one school will eventually reach a higher skill (200) than the others, which will cap at (50).  So far so good.<br />
<br />
Then we get to the incorrect part.  Verant claims that when you cast a spell the computer makes a roll, and depending on your specialization skill you may or may not &quot;succeed&quot; at the roll.  If you do succeed, then your spell will have reduced mana cost, and fizzle rate.<br />
<br />
However, many dutiful parsers and users of ShowEQ have diligently run tests to determine how specialization, and the conclusions they came up with are summed up nicely at &quot;http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/lib...izardly_faq.htm&quot; (under section &quot;2. Spells&quot;).  In brief, they determined that there is no roll for specialization, and in fact that it simply works all the time.  For your primary (skill 200) specialization, you save 10% mana on all spells you cast from that school.  For your secondary (50) skills you get a 2.5% reduction in mana cost.<br />
<br />
To their credit, Caster's Realm does have a few useful points on Specialization:<br />
<br />
&quot;Specialisation does not increase chance of recovering after interruption.  This is based purely on Channelling.  Specialisation does not make spells cast faster.  This is a fixed amount.&quot;<br />
<br />
But what about Spell Casting Mastery (SCM)?<br />
<br />
According to Verant, the AAXP skill Spell Casting Mastery works as follows (borrowed from Caster's Realm):<br />
<br />
&quot;[SCM ] increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization roll.  The first point increases the chance of specialization by 5%, the second raises the chance to 15% and the third to 30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, as we already know there are no specialization checks in Everquest, so how does this ability really work?  Well, according to reports from The Crucible, SCM:3 adds 10% reduction to all spells cast.  However, one report from Hannduvdeth showed that for him, one casting of Khura's Focusing MGB style 51%, as opposed to 44% after SCM3.  This would only seem to indicate a savings of 7%, so assuming Hannduvdeth has his specialization(alteration) maxxed at 200 (a fairly safe assumption) there might be as much as a 3% loss, possibly only on MGB spells.  Then again this 3% difference might have come from equipment changes in Hann's gear in between his getting the skill as well.  The moral of this story is that SCM3 probably gives 10% to all castings, including MGB, but your mileage may vary :-)<br />
<br />
Now, what about SCM2 and SCM1?  We don't have any hard figures on this, but if you assume that these skills follow the same progression as Verant claims they do (5/15/30), then SCM1 gives about 1.7% savings, and SCM2 gives 5%.  However, to date there have been no tests done (on the Crucible, that I know of; if anyone knows of info from another board feel free to post a link and/or quote it).&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit/Critique/Review/Criticize away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So to answer your original question:<br />
<br />
Obby (or any other Mana Preservatio item) = Spec(200) = 4xSpec(50) = SCM3+Spec(200) = 2x SCM3(50) = 10%<br />
<br />
Or in real words, being level 40 and having your skills maxxed means you save 10% on Alteration and 2.5% on everthing else. If you pick up a mana preservation item on top of that, you get to save an additional 10% on all spells, bringinging you up to 20%/12.5%. If you then go get SCM3 you'll save an additional 100% on Alteration spells, and additional 2.5% on your other spells, bringing you up to 30%/15%. Alternatively, if you just have SCM3, level 40+, and maxxed skills, but no Mana Preservation item, then you have 20%/5%.<br />
<br />
So, SCM3 is as good as an Obby for Alteration spells, and only 1/4 as good as an obby for non-Alteration spells<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, that certainly looks to me like you were presenting it as fact, and not speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">However, one report from Hannduvdeth showed that for him, one casting of Khura's Focusing MGB style 51%, as opposed to 44% after SCM3.  This would only seem to indicate a savings of 7%...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That would indicate a savings of 7% of his mana pool.  Reducing the cost from 51% to 44% is a reduction of 13.7% in cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Turley: Heh, you caught me, I'm a literature major by nature, and I only do math when its related to the CS stuff I randomly study.  If your numbers are right (and I'll assume they are, though I always like to see formulas so I can educate myself on what I did wrong, if you don't mind explaining them that is) then again Hann's results are off by a bit, 3.7% instead of 3%, and in the other direction.  This would seem to indicate SCM works even better when you cast MGB.  But then again since Hann didn't keep tabs on his gear, it could just be that.  Until someone does something similiar, with the exact same gear before and after, we won't know for sure.<br />
<br />
Jharassik:  You're right, all the qualifying statements (&quot;by this logic,&quot; etc.) came before that one line &quot;So to answer your original question:&quot;.  I guess I can see how you could think I was trying to present this as fact, if you just kind of ignored the paragraph before it.  I still prolly should have written &quot;So to answer your original question, I think:&quot; or something like that.  But I'd like to assume some basic intelligence on the part of my reader, and therefore hope that they could remember my qualifying statments from earlier in the post, thus saving me the time of having to keep repeating them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">7 is 13.7% of 51.<br />

Operating under the assumption that you are Alter spec'd...<br />
<br />
MGB Khura's, 200 spec, no SCM, no Mana Preservation = 2500 * .9 = 2250. Using 51% of your mana means your mana pool is around 2250/.51 = 4411 (4500 to 4326 depending on UI rounding).<br />
<br />
With SCM3, 44% used is somewhere between 1980 and 1903. Those would represent savings of 21.8% (1- 1980/2500) and 23.88% (1- 1903/2500). <br />

MGB Khura's, 200 spec, no SCM, no Mana Preservation = 2500 * .9 = 2250. Using 51% of your mana means your mana pool is around 2250/.51 = 4411 (4500 to 4326 depending on UI rounding).<br />
<br />
With SCM3, 44% used is somewhere between 1980 and 1903. Those would represent savings of 21.8% (1- 1980/2500) and 23.88% (1- 1903/2500). <br />
<br />
Consistent with the commonly accepted values.<br />
<br />
I was not counting the savings from specialization into the %.<br />
<br />
The difference between having SCM3 and not is 13.7%<br />
<br />
The total saving from specialization + SCM3 is (51/.9)-44)/(51/.9) * 100% = 22.3%  which is what you calculated.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to make clear to the other posters, both calculations are correct just represent different things.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ok, I'm not even going to try to fully summarize all this, because I know I will F*** up the math.  But here's a proposal for a revision:<br />
<br />
But what about Spell Casting Mastery (SCM)?<br />
<br />
According to Verant, the AAXP skill Spell Casting Mastery works as follows (borrowed from Caster's Realm):<br />
<br />
&quot;[SCM ] increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization roll. The first point increases the chance of specialization by 5%, the second raises the chance to 15% and the third to 30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, as we already know there are no specialization checks in Everquest, so how does this ability really work? Well, according to reports from The Crucible, SCM:3 adds 10% reduction to all spells cast, SCM:2 adds 5% reduction to all spells cast, and SCM:1 adds 2.5% reduction to all spells cast.<br />
<br />
While we're on the topic, does SCM stack with Mana Preservation and other focus effects?<br />
<br />
Yes, SCM will stack with focus effects.  Keep in mind however that focus effects don't stack, so even if you have Mana Preservation IV AND Affliction Efficiency IV, only one of them will work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just got SCM3. It has two benefits.<br />
<br />
After test casting Khura's several times, I see it uses the same amount of mana every time. My Magelo profile tells me how much mana I have.<br />
<br />
Without SCM,<br />
Alteration spells save about 10-12% mana due to specialization in alteration.<br />
Non-alt spells save 0.<br />
<br />
With SCM3,<br />
Alteration spells save about 20-24%.<br />
Non-alt spells save about 10-12%.<br />
<br />
So SCM3 seems to save a flat 10-12% mana on all spells - on top of your chosen specialization (Alteration).<br />
<br />
In addition, spells that used to fizzle a lot even at max casting skill - Torrent of Poison - now have minimum fizzles with SCM3. The fizzlefest is gone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If the fizzles are less, wouldn't that indicate that there IS some type of &quot;check&quot; involved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Not another hijack (or is it? ) but I just gotta say this one thing.<br />
<br />
Loramin, its good to see another Liberal Arts guy trying his hardest to stay out of the mathematical head hurting.  Hopefully, we will always have someone close at hand to correct our Anti-Calculus mistakes ;) as we attempt to write well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">yeh turmoil, maybe a fizzle check if the spell fizzles or not, but the mana savings is directly based on ur spec skill on a flat rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So since we're trying to nail things down, the one &quot;Variable&quot; we still have is mana preservation, which is between 1 and 10% mana reduction and Affliction efficiency which is between 1 and 25%.   Most people that I've talked to thought that it was flat 10/25% savings.  But on *average* mana preservation is 5.5% mana savings, and AE to 13%.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's my logic behind it since I'm bored at work :P<br />
<br />
User casting 1 spell 10 times.   First time the MP item reduced the mana usage by 1, second time by 2, third time by 3 etc etc.<br />
<br />
Adding up the percentages of mana saved, you get 1+2+3+4...+10 = 55<br />
Divide by the number of casts to get the Average Percentage of mana saved   <br />
55/10 = 5.5<br />
<br />
While this scenario will rarely be true for any 10 casts, when averaged out over a long period of time it should become statistically equivilent  (or something like that).<br />
<br />
Assumptions:<br />
- Amount of mana saved by the MP item is not weighted, as in 1 will occur as frequently as 10 over a large enough sample.<br />
- I didn't make any typo's while entering my numbers :P<br />
<br />
This doesn't nail things down as it's an average, but it gave me a much better picture of how much my MP item was helping.   5.5% of a 4k mana pool is around 200 mana saved when going from FM-&gt;OOM.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Does the process of 10+9+8....+1 Have a name?  It's not factorial which is 10*9*8*7..*1</div></div><hr />

This is the best way to play the game... number crunching just takes all of the fun out of the game.<br />
<br />
All I care about is that the AA saves mana... why stress over the nitpicky details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My shaman has been basically parked in the Bazaar for about a year. A month ago, I pulled him out and got him his last 5 levels, and another 55 aa.<br />
<br />
The first thing I did AA-wise was get him MC3 and then Cana 5. Awesome ability. I got killed the other day by repops while we already had 2 mobs in camp. I got a quick rez, looted while cleric and pally rebuffed me, summoned my lizzy mount, cast Quie on myself, cana 5, turned around and slowed the 2 mobs that had killed me. Try that without cana 5. Even the group was laughing about the &quot;no down time shaman&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
The next aa ability was SCM3. I had known from my playing over a year ago that SCM was uber. When SoL first came out, I had gotten SCM1 and could see the difference in my mana with that, and later got SCM2 as well. SCM3 is the difference between me having enough mana for that one last heal to win the tough fight, or loosing due to being OOM.<br />
<br />
Cana 5 and SCM3 together are almost godly. I dont sit here and nit pick through the numbers, but I can see when something is working. And SCM3 works. And is obvious. SCRM is also a *HUGE* difference.<br />
<br />
We get some nice AA's... maybe too many... :lol</div></div><hr />
