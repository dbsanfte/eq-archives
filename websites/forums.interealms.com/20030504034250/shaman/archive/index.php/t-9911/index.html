<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best site out there for Nintendo Gamecube Info on current and pending releases and accessories?<br />
<br />
SOOO many sites are horribly outdated and others are sketchy with info at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buku1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found that www.ign.com had some wounderful reviews for my Gamecube. All I can say is Madden2003 is awesome!!! Anyways they do reviews for all platforms and very detailed.</div></div><hr />

As for dates... it is hard to find accurate numbers as release dates and such are pushed around frequently.  For dates I used to use Gamespot but I cant find my way around there anymore.  Otherwise you can look up the major games and such at ign or gamers.com</div></div><hr />
