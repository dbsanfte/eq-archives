<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing HG's for a while..but I saw a Druid dual quading HG's (8 of 'em) so I left...I may have gotten an HG once every 10 minutes...when I could be doing one once ever three  minutes. I tried the Guards in HHK...10 people camping them and 3 were above 55. I tried the Geo camp in CC...had a 20 person waiting list...does anyone know of any place a 39 highly twinked Shaman can go to earn pp and exp? If you ask why I want PP being twinked, it's because I play on the FV server and need 10k more to buy a Chestplate of Vindi. :-P Any help would be loved...and yes, I looked on other  boards before I posted this,  so please don't flame me. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at your level you can farm in CC, or if you dont care about exp you can farm the giant for in warslik woods, it has a high drop rate of forest loops which vendor for 300pp. i got 1 per clearing pretty much with my 20ish necro when i was exping there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chestplate is no drop, unless they are taking you to the raid how do you get one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chestplate is no drop, unless they are taking you to the raid how do you get one?<br />
<br />
Almost nothing on FV is Nodrop (Only epics I think?), its incredible to be able to walk into the bazaar and buy REAL raid level gear =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just to give you an idea...I bought my full suit of ToV armor, Earring of Solstice and a Lodi Shell Shield for 110k at level one, and since then I've bought better equipment. You can buy every piece to your epic in Bazaar and turn in your epic...well...most pieces...I think one per epic is no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im moving to FV! LOL<br />
<br />
In regards to your question maybe you should try the newly upgraded Nurga? Exp is pretty good there I think since there is a bonus in that zone and the goblins drop resonable amounts of coins and sometimes gems, skins and salts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe try the Seafury Cyclops in OOT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you might want to try dulak, mobs in zone are ok exp (not great, but its steady) plus every mob has a chance to drop gems/cash loot also you can do the quest for stoicism as well so you have that ready to go when you hit 44 a good set up spot for lower level killing would be the southwest corner, you can pull random mobs from the 4-5 houses on your left, the row of houses in front of you, including a lighthouse, wandering guard mobs, and the dock on the right can spawn vurag, drops either a crap belt, or a haste necklace (21 percent)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sows McBuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">seafuries are too high for a 39, they gave pretty good xp up to 53 iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes all those good spots are always taken, I gave up on HG's a long time ago, and camping anything worth more then a few 100 pp is near impossible since it seems there is someone perma camped there all the time. Dulak's harbor has been my fav place so far. You can still sell iksar blood for a decent amount, although I've noticed iksar blood price dropping quick, still a few 100pp a piece isn't too bad at all. Everyone drops random gems, they use to at least, it seems to me that they only drop blue diamonds and diamonds now.. and every so often a piece of vendor jewlery. None the less.. you can still make a few 100pp a hour not quite as much as quading HG's /scowl druid. BUt pretty decent and at your lvl good exp if you get a group, boats are camped alot so try the armory pretty good spot with a small group at your lvl invis and go near the back end..  theres 4 iksars total that spawn there and a guard as well that is iksar sometimes. Well I hope that helps... check it out before it gets too busy.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I had heard the loops dropped there, so I went there back when I was 30 or so...camped it for 2 days, and never saw a loop drop. Grrrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In Gunthak, move tho the first town (your first left turn in the tunnel) and kill the marauders, etc. in there.  Considering these mobs are high 30's, they will be good xp and about 10% will drop gems.  Good gems like fire opals, mithril amulets, etc.  No blue diamonds, but what did ya expect.  Once ya hit 44, do the stoicism quest asap and then hit Dulaks near the Oceancrasher boat.  Stuff there do drop diamonds and blue diamonds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe try the halfling guards along the wall in Misty Thicket.  They always drop a spear worth 10pp, a shield worth 1pp and 0-3pp in coin. <br />
<br />
There are 7 guards there.  2 right in the gate and 5 along the wall.  Here's a quick summary:<br />
<br />
Standing outside the wall (Runnyeye side) and facing the gate.<br />
<br />
2 inside gate:  ~6 minute spawn<br />
Left side:   Deputy Asler<br />
Right side:  Deputy Keld<br />
<br />
5 along wall:  ~20 minute spawn<br />
In front of gate on right:  Deputy Eisler/Poohl (they switch spawns)<br />
Along left wall:  Deputy Felp<br />
In tower by gate:  Deputy Drebo &amp; Deputy Budo (Budo has no spear)<br />
Along right wall:  Deputy Looh<br />
<br />
I don't know how they will compare at level 39, but at 53 I can chew through them as fast as they spawn and get 250-300pp per hour.  Be careful at your level though as Budo might be too tough for you.  He's still dark blue at 53 (all the rest are super green).  Also, be careful of Ella Foodcrafter - she paths to the gate every ~5 minutes.  Don't fight near her or let her see you if KOS.  You'll be dead in no time flat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why does everyone like to farm plat?<br />
<br />
Its so time consuming.<br />
<br />
Farm items.<br />
<br />
Go get a soulstripper - it sells consistently for 6-8k<br />
<br />
At 39 there are ways to make good money as well.<br />
<br />
Sorry I'm not going to share them.<br />
<br />
Cause it took me a bit to learn what sells for what at my level that I could attain. The soulstripper at my lvl takes 2 people, but heck I dont mind splitting 8k.<br />
<br />
Let me let you in on a little secret....<br />
<br />
The people who farm plat are the ones who pay me to farm items - and yes I'm getting rich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ahhh FV  must have conveniently overlooked that part.  dayum im on the wrong server.  then again im poor barbarian trash anyway so it wouldnt help me a bit :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tiorr,<br />
<br />
It's hard to say what the economy is like on FV.  If he bought ALL of that stuff for 110k, I doubt that the items you're referring to could garner that much coin.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
I can't remember exactly, but you might try the bottom area of Dalnir at 39.  I recall it being decent.. but can't remember the soloability of the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;b&gt;YES !&lt;/b&gt; So the mystery of walador is solved ! lol me and some others wondered how the heck you had so many hp AND wis at your lvl lol. Still wanna see that magelo so i can drool :D. And btw I vote for dulaks too. Was doing pirates for the flask and got some star rubies off the other mobs in the cabins. Got a mantle of stealth too from a kill i did on a train which should be worth some pp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Zone into Felwithe and kill a guard.  Sell the 2h sword that drops every time.  Then walk around town and notice there's 9 other guards on a 20min spawn cycle...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Calling bull**** on this one. Yes I play on FV. Lets see here. Vindi will run you 60 to 70K. Lodi shield is about 13k, solstice earring is 6k. ToV legs will run you 30k or so. BP will run you probally close to 40K if you ever find them for sale. Been in CC the past week powerleveling my monk and the most people i have ever seen is 4 others. No camp on FV has a 20 person wait list. We are one of the least populated servers there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">OK, pretty funny. Next time you try telling folks how easy FV is try telling the truth. Tonight in PoK you shouted for peoples opinions on whether you should keep your brown chitin leggings or buy RUne Etched legs. When did brown chitin start dropping in ToV?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to agree with you here. Rarely see Vindi, recently been one for sale at 75k, cant imagine it going much lower than that. Correct on the Lodi at about 13k, saw the bp for sale ONCE in the past 3 months (and for ****s and giggles I do check just about everyday for SS and ToV stuff) for 80k. I think I saw the legs once a good while ago, 30k sounds about right for them.<br />
<br />
The point is, IF a full set of ToV gear was available for sale, certainly would have cost you more than 110k, BP and legs alone that much (granted the other parts are no where near as expensive)</div></div><hr />
