<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sony's customer service doesnt always suck... Heres my story from today.  <br />
  6:30 EST my lvl 65 warrior was hijacked.  I found out when i crashed on zoning.  I tried to log in but couldnt.  Got something to eat tried some more and still couldnt... password was wrong.  Go to EQ website password still wrong.  annoyed that it appears i cant use my current password i log in on an alt character.  My shaman logs into fire to see my warrior standing there and my corpse popping to gy... which he promptly loots without rez and zones out.  At this time i start calling and getting on line with teech support... horribly pissed at what happened.  It takes about 20 minutes and i see my warrior running to a few different zones (namely adventure camps.  Thats where it becomes obvious hes stripping augments from my gear.  Out go my augments from blade of carnage, earthshaker, Tae ew pants, Crystallized bracer, and a few other items... and he starts logging on other characters.<br />
<br />
Finally i get a hold of a person on the phone.  I talk to him for a while give him name of info... managed to dig up 3 of the account keys i used registering expansions... get the address on account right after a few guesses :D.  The state i was born in is totally wrong... dont have email account used to register anymore.  but he works with me and we get enough info across.  To end With my trader character in bazaar waiting at zone line for i assume the trade off to someone else with my bag full of gear... my trader goes LD :D.  Gm had forced him out of game and i am able to log in with my new password (thief had changed it) about 1 hour after it was first stolen.  THANK YOU whoever the annonymous person was on the phone.  Made my day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Five-plus years of EQ, and they still can't solve this problem, Astounding! Glad they were able to help you. I suspect they've had a lot of experience at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To note.... i lost nothing of value.  My gear was all still on my trader in the bazaar /dancehappy.  And i dont thing sony is responsible for my account getting stolen... accounts will always be stolen in any game, im glad they were prompt  at resolving the situation and helped me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can you possibly think of anyway that your account was hijacked?  Be honest please.  Did you got to any suspicious websites?  Do you post often on EQlive website?  Did you download any outside programs for EQ?  Did you give your account information out at all?  I have a friend who's account got stolen and he didnt get his back.  I am trying to find out how this could have happen because when I ask him he just goes silent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats on getting stuff taken care of so quikly.  Same thing happened to one of my accounts about a year ago.  Got onto my shaman to lvl.  Tried to log into an alt account to get a trader up for some money, pw was wrong, tried a few more times (being REALLY precise on my typeing hehe) still no luck.  did a /who all for my chars and saw my monk in the bazaar.  Sent him a /tell asking if he wanted t grp, just to see if there was someone behind the comp or if i was glitching up.  He responded, and so i knew. I watched em strip all 8 chars on that server including 2 mounts.  Called SOE and 1 week later i had my account and gear back.  Dunno how it got stolen, only other person that had info on that account was my brother and he was sitting there with me while it was happening (hes a hermit too so i know he didnt give the info to any friends) :)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I found a few trojans on my computer... 1 guildy i trust had info and 1 RL friend i trust even more also had info.  Key word was had.  Ive heard that some map sites include keylogger trojans with programs... but im 99.9% sure that they were .zip files.  And the trojan was a more generic type email worm.  God knows what it let in.  Im sure ill never find out the details but the trojans are gone and my info is different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info.  I suspected he downloaded something that recorded his key strokes for logging into EQ.  I sent him to a few website to remove all spy ware and trojans or viruses he might have had but he didnt understand what I was talking about.  I tried to help.</div></div><hr />
