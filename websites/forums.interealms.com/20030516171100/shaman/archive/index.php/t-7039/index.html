<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all. I have returened from a few year hiatus. Back in pre kunark days I used 1hb exclusivly. spears only just came out for us back then. Well now I am at level 3 and I am thinking of going pierce and 2hb. I don't want to take the time to raise all 3 skills. I figure peirce for the spear and a shield and 2HB for a lil more dmg. Is this a viable strategy? Are there many awesome 1hb weapons that I cant live without? thanks. <br />
<br />
I am a barb shaman on FV.<br />

**EDIT**<br />
<br />
I have serched these forms for this same question and only found one other thread on this. The advice was to train all. My question is of the three what 2 would you most recomend. Also what stat controls how often our melee skills rise? INT or WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Peircing is the best single skill since your epic is peirce,  2hb does offer the highest damage weapons though.<br />
<br />
Melee skills rise based on either str or dex (depends on skill, offense is str-weapon skills are dex) not int or wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd pick pierce and 2hb also. There are not very many good 1hb shaman items out there. If anything its worth keeping 1hb up for when you get a Jstick. (journeymans walking stick, tash proc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the tips! I think, as I level up I will train spear, then 2hb, then 1hb. At lower levels it is hard to keep all the skills up but, if memory serves me correctly, by 8 or 10 I should be able to get all those up to par. Its good to be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I neglected 2hb for 54 levels - I couldn't seem to justify the drop in AC and wisdom from losing the shield spot. But this weekend that all changed!<br />
<br />
I got a granite face grinder for 2135plat (which, on a PvP server, I think is quite cheap). I love it, I cannot tell you how much fun I am having.<br />
<br />
I buff myself to the max, don't bother with anything for dogdog, except haste, and pull dark blue mobs with slow and then just go toe to toe and melee them to death! I have ghetto gear and no epic/jbb etc, but I have been having a whale of a time solo melee-ing Ice Giants in Everfrost and gnolls in jaggedpine - only spell I cast on mobs is slow!<br />
<br />
Evan at my low skill (I have managed to get my skill up to about 130 in 2 days), I am already hitting for up to 102! As my skill gets higher, I can actually see my damage output increasing - whee, but its fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well I am level 8 now. piercing is at 32 and 2hb is 28. Some nice soul gave me a vellium spear. I think the delay is 27 so the skill goes up quick. I am still using a worn great staff so the 2hb is comming up slower but should be able to max it this level or next. Then I can work on 1hb. someone gave me a nice lil hammer but I have been busy raiseing the other 2 skills first. It is hard to get some skills maxxed when you level pretty fast at the low levels.</div></div><hr />
