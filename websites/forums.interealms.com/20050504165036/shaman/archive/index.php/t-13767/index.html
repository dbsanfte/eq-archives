<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering who played on MT, just thought maybe we could hang out or group together or soemthing. My guild doesn't have many chars around my lvl, mostly 10-20 lvls above or below me.ty for replying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt;----------- On MT, not sure what lvl  you are, but I'm 54 atm.  If you find me on at some point, feel free to send a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe, you're 20 lvls ahead of me, although Ill ding again tonight. Maybe you can lvl an alt with me or we can do start some progressive shm quests together. At least I should lvl pretty fast now that I have dogdog and found Sol A :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody else that you know of on MT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't think of anyone lvl 34ish atm, but I'd be glad to say show you around the cudgel quests if you're iksar.  I really enjoyed those quests myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MT here too<br />
<br />
I have a 30 monk and ranger also 30 if you need a partner :)  Monk is decked out pretty descent actualy, only others that level are my 34 wizzy, but he just started soloing in EW when you get around 40 let me know , my SK is 46 and kinda lonely ( such is the SK life)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I would LOVE to lvl with that ranger if he's decently equipped. I'm doing Sol A atm, would be wonderful exp for him and he could track the rarer spawns for us to kill and roll for loot. (EXG is IMPOSSIBLE to find for me. I've walked the entire range of where he's supposed to be for an hour and didn't see him).<br />
<br />
To Kiisekai: oooh I already did the first cudgel quest, and I have the lore skull for the 3rd or 4th one but I could definately use some help, ill try to give u a tell some time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im on MT, took 4 months off but Im back  :D<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask me any questions thats what im there for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actualy im going to PL a druid up then maybe ill catch ya there cause i plan on taking my monk and druid and duoing them together there =)</div></div><hr />
