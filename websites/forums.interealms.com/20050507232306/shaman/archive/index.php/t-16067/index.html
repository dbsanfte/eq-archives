<br />
  Was with a group of 5 of us, led by a 65 shaman who I am in awe of his power, I went in as a 53 enchanter and came out as a 55 in one night. That is rediculous, PoD I think.<br />
<br />
 I can see why now people still play a shaman, the crap I see this guy do is just sick, unbelievable power.<br />
<br />
level 65 and PoP makes such a difference.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phoenixone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm, where was this?<br />
<br />
I went into PoN as a 54.15 and came out after 4 hours as a 54.45. Not quite the level of experience you were getting. Care to share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are sooo many factors that affect the speed at which you make exp that just going to the same place wont mean you make the same amount of exp.<br />
<br />
And not all shamans of equal level are of equal power.<br />
<br />
If at all possible for you contentrate on having fun and dont worry too much about getting exp.<br />
<br />
And not all good exp is in PoP at level 54. I bet a place like Nurga would be very decent exp too at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the mid 50's I can usually get close to 3 blues an hour hunting rats and goos near the zone in (by the spiders actually...just off the zone in past the graveyard).  <br />
<br />
I know the courtyard mobs give better xp, but I haven't been in a group good enough to handle the mobs effectively yet, so we usually get better xp on the yard trash - rats and goos.  Still, if we had a really good group and it wasn't too crowded, 1 yellow an hour doesn't seem out of the question in the courtyard.  (and having a 65 shaman around goes a long way towards making a great group)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A skilled level 65 shaman with all his spells and good gear can be amazing. And yes, there is a reason PoP is crowded and older zones are not. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, PoP exp can be quite rediculous.  Just wait til you get to PoTac, that's even more silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At lower 60s, my favorite was always Innovation, once you get out of the zone in area (can we say trains?) and into a room somewhere (or Factory-really good xps here) there was no one else around and the mobs are all packed pretty tightly (really fast pulls without having to move anywhere).  Xps flew, now I see low and mid 50s there a lot.<br />
<br />
I definitely think xps in PoP are too high, took 3-4 nights in sebilis/charasis to get through 60 in Kunark days, now its one night in PoP.  And I think I recall 2blue/night in 59.  Kunark was too harsh, but PoP is too much in the othe direction, people leveling too fast imo.  It may not kill the game, but I think it will drive people away from the game faster when they get filled up on levels/aas and there is no reason to play anymore except raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, Mill, you think we make this stuff up?<br />
<br />
The other night, after a raid, I wanted to make back the 1% real XP loss I'd suffered, so I ran out to PoValor (a tier 2 zone) and pulled a golem (level 62).<br />
<br />
A few minutes later it was dead ... and I was at full HP and mana.  That's when it struck me how absurdly strong we are.<br />
<br />
Of course the downside is my wife, who hasn't finished her VT Shard camping yet, insists I come to every single camp, since she doesn't feel safe otherwise.  I love my wife, but I've already finished this quest and ... well... (vomits)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You find it absurd that we can solo a tier2 exp mob easily with (I assume) full raid buffs, horse, etc?   I don't think it is absurd at all and I bet the other classes, like druids, wizards, necros, enchanters, bards, rangers, etc that can do the very same thing don't think it is so absurd either.  Everyone got more powerful in POP and in my opinion, shamans are much weaker soloers in comparison to their abilities in previous expansions.<br />
<br />
... but yeah, even with the so-called upgrades, POP exp is far better than what you can get elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

So true... One of my guildmates (a wizard) used to quad-kite there.  He would kite a quad along the wall, and then when he was oom, come sit with my group and chat with us while he regained his mana.  He could have joined us, but he got better experience solo.   Given the right circumstances and buffs soloists do well.  Shaman can solo, its just not the best method for us (and its boring as hell).<br />
<br />
But yah, PoP exp is good... very good.</div></div><hr />

it's hard to demonstrate actual raw power when nearly every mob in the zone has a &quot;slightly effective&quot; message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Soram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it only gets better.<br />
<br />
in the elemental planes, even with a lazy group, you can get amazing amounts of exp.<br />
<br />
my personal record was on an off day, a group of 6 of us went 12 hours in pofire.. got 20aa total for that amount of time.</div></div><hr />

except for the pure melee's such as warriors, monks, and rogues. A level 65 warrior/monk/rogue would not be able to solo the lowest level mob in plane of innovation, no matter what gear he has..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?  lets see<br />
Rangers, Necros, Druids, SK,Shaman all can solo in PoF 16% per kill, Bards.. I dont want to think how much AA they can get here.<br />
<br />
With in 1 month  of Pops release, Druids, Wizzies quaded to level 65 in Tier 1 &amp; 2 zones (zone changes made but damage done on Pvp servers)<br />
<br />
BoT Enc, Mage solo'd names mini nerf on charmed but still viable.<br />
<br />
Bards in HoH.  Seen them kill 20+ mobs solo at the same time.<br />
<br />
IF we get hit with the nerf stick I see other before us getting it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a twink (never power levled) was 55 when they made the groupage changes.  Till then I only solo'd.   I went to PoD got me a group that Thursday and hit 56.  Friday I hit 57(pod castle)Saturday  hit 58 Factory in PoI(did go out to dinner and a Movie), Played all day Sunday and hit 59 and 60(PoV inner and outer groups) .   All within a long weekend. Did not play all that week after.<br />
<br />
I wont tell you how long it took me to get 65 but I did hit it in 19 days played.<br />
<br />
Get a group, park ya butt , dont pass out.  Simple  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
....I can solo a tier 3 exp mob easily with just self buffs and leezard(who uses horses these days?) and finish with full health/mana...and I'm not even 65 yet.<br />
<br />
I would feel overpowered, if only most casters didn't do the same(without the mana/hp at end) 2x as fast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rignack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Its totally dependent on the group makeup.<br />
<br />
Yeah at 53 and being a caster its not a big deal and you had a 65 shammy which really means just a lower chance at resisting slow.  If the rest of the group is 53 or 55 exp is sorta gona blow because you won't kill at a good pace to make it worth while.  <br />
<br />
The is the problem with pop yeah you see a big jump in your exp bar to kill a mob but it takes you 3 minutes to kill it.  Why not go to Velks or Seb at 53 to 55 with the same group makeup (exception of the shammy at 65) and you will get better exp because crap dies in unbelievable speed and there is like zero risk of dying unless someone does a 12 pull.  A group at 53 or 55 getting 3 in PoD is pretty much certain death.<br />
<br />
What has happen is that too many players are spoiled and the good exp zones of the past go to waste (Seb, Hole, Howling stones) and what is sad is they are still good exp zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will commonly see mostly effective and partially effective results, or a full slow. And even partially slowed has a significant effect on the mob.<br />
<br />
rogue may not be able to but I'd be willing to bet a monk given the gear could lay a total rompin down right at the zone in to PoIA very well equipped rogue, with the right toys and buffs could probably take out one mob at the PoI zone. But I think even then it would be a challenge. Rogues just are not that great at soloing, and they lose ~35% of their damage when they cannot backstab.</div></div><hr />

LOL you're just joking right? i watched a warrior (65) kill two mobs in POI at the same time..and he was at ~80% hp when he was finished...seems you need to be careful what you tout as pure truth</div></div><hr />

What gear are we talking here? elemental? time?  My monk in velious/ssra gear couldnt solo his way out of a paperbag.  Although i could duo with another monk to kill trash in PoI, but you can imagine how hoss that xp was hah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Melee's have typically never been able to solo, from day one in the game.  It was always like that.<br />
<br />
I certainly didn't roll my rogue so that I could go solo mobs.<br />
<br />
It makes me cranky when I see yet another post complaining that every class in the game can't do everything.  Pure melee classes aren't meant to solo.</div></div><hr />

My warrior friend can easily solo an archaic.. my monk friend solos pod just for fun when he's bored.. rogues I've never seen one try =( I'm sure tier 2 a rogue can solo one of those lb mice..</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoD is ridiculously easy for a 65 shaman to provide all the support a 6 man group needs for constant pulls.  It's really not even hard in the slightest.  The problem lies in getting a 65 shaman to go here, as they can gain faster exp almost anywhere else.  <br />
<br />
I'd say u got lucky Mill, in getting such a shaman in your group.  Groups without people like that can be risky and hazardous, specially at 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">PoP pretty much made solo exp fun again.<br />
<br />
I gotta disagree with this.  Root, rotting is flat out boring.  I had much more fun soloing in chardok or sebilis before PoP came out.  I almost exclusively solo in old-world zones now even though it is worse experience because i just can't stand root-rotting PoV golems or Tactics pit.  Also loot is almost nonexistant for soloers in PoP as opposed to old world zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have to completely agree with you there. How anyone can stand to solo now is beyond me. Staring at a mob for 6 minutes waiting for it to die is flat out boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You haven't seen PoP exp until you have seen PoE with several wizards being botted outside. PoE is 3-4% group exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beg to differ.  My Monk soloed the old LoIO &gt; OT route, went from 19-35 or so iirc. (It's been awhile).  No Fungal tunic I might add. Lots of bandages, an emphasis on hitpoints and AC and occasionally a buff or two from a nice passing caster. (Rare - the buff - not the caster).<br />
<br />
Nowadays at 61 he can't solo for squat. There are PoTime Monks tanking in CoD, but that is more of a Guild / Equipment function than a class ability.<br />
<br />
Melee (imo) have gotten weaker comparitively to casters and MOBs each expansion post Kunark. <br />
<br />
Trust me the grass is NOT greener over in melee land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well my main is a 65th Rogue with Inny dagger in main hand, Ifir offhanded, 8k buffed HP, 250 in attack gear and I can barely solo a PoI trash mob.<br />
<br />
On Pumyr I can solo in PoFire easily.<br />
<br />
Yes Shammies can solo effectively, but as pointed out its hellaciously DULL, and compared to a decent group its slow too.<br />
<br />
ALL casting classes got a major hike with PoP with spells, focus effects, HP/Mana/AC gear and to a large extent pure melee got very much left behind. I am routinely equalled and bettered in DPS by wizards while playing my rogue with the absolutely best dagger in the game, this is somewhat wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">...Root, rotting is flat out boring...<br />
<br />
Of course it is.  Tank.  Root-rotting, in addition to being boring, robs you of your dog-dot.<br />
<br />
Poi is almost all tankable mobs (let dogdog tank the archaics once you've crippled them) and should now be dark blue to 62+ with the xp range increase, and there's a number of tankable mobs in both PoV and PoS that are dark blue to 65.  <br />
<br />
Turgurs and cripple make almost any mob you can land a full slow on tankable, including PoP ones.  Even Tactics pit is soloable, at least until the adds kill you.</div></div><hr />
