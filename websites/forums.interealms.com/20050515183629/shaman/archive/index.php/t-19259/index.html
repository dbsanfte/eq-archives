Wristmat's are one of the greatest inventions ever, IMO, so very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Word.  Believe it or not, but i have a wristbrace that I use while playing.  I even use it when I type alot (I do legal research for a living, so I am constantly on the internet typing).  I don't play more than 3 hours a day 4 days a week, but with all the other typing I do, if I don't wear the brace I notice by the end of the day.  It hurts something awful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jaruden, I believe it is repetitive strain injury... usually caused by excessive strain placed on the tendons in the arm due to improper placement of the hands while typing for extended periods of time. It's the tech equivalent of tennis elbow, and can be painful to the point of debilitating.<br />
<br />
mcroc, I hope you feel better, that sucks..</div></div><hr />

hope it gets better. Had a co worker who had a strain injury, his tendon bunched up on the base of his wrist making a little small nob on his rist. he couldnt move his hand because of it, but it was easily fixed. gotta go all out on the ergonomic keyboards/mouse/wrist pads etc if you are heavy typist/gamer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RS is not the only problem, I have a very good RL friend (he got me hooked on EQ) who typically played 4 hours a day .<br />
Then his GF went on a 3 month holiday and he got a contract working overseas, in a town where he knew no-one, he took his comp and he suggests his playtime probably went up to 6+ hours a day and 10 plus on weekends.<br />
<br />
He put on some weight, and after 2 months of this he started to feel a little short of breath when walking up the stairs to his apartment. <br />
<br />
Two days before he is due to fly home (at the end of his contract) he almost passes out  outside his apartment after walking home from work, I am speakign to him often online during this whole period and try to convince him to go see a doctor, but he refused.<br />
<br />
So he gets on his flight back home (4 hours), arrives home and moves back into his house...alone as his GF is still a month or two from returning.<br />
<br />
Two days after he returns I ring him in the morning, no answer, later that afternoon his brother rings me and tells me my friend is in hospital in critical.<br />
<br />
He very nearly died, as a direct result of sitting in a chair at work all day, then sitting in a chair all night at home he developed Deep Vein Thrombosis, otherwise know as a Blood Clot. This typically happens when flying for extended periods of time, so you can imagine platying EQ non-stop and sitting in from of a comp at work was even worse.<br />
<br />
The clot started behind his knee, its worked up to his lungs (hence the breathing problems and light headieness) and on the day he was admitted to Hospital it entered his heart, its dropped him like a stone. He likened it to a heart attack, he thought he was dying and collapsed hitting his head on the way down. He lay there bleeding and steadily failing dure to the clot until luck went his way and his Grandmother rang, she got no answer for 2 hours so went around to say hello (knowing he had been unwell) and rang an ambulance.<br />
<br />
It took him 2-3 months to recover, the surgeon says he should be dead, his heart and lungs are permanently damaged.<br />
<br />
He doesnt play EQ anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And thats not the worst case, 2 months ago another friend to both myself and the guy with the blood clot did die. At his keyboard, while grouped with friends, due to an aneurism.<br />
<br />
The whole experience was pretty horrific for the friends, as they knew something was wrong when his avatar stopped chatting/moving in the early evening. The rang him an got no answer and finally went to his house (one lived nearby) to make a sad discovery.<br />
<br />
He also had put on quite a bit of weight, played quite a lot, and had a sedate career.<br />
<br />
He was only in his early thirties as was the first guy.<br />
<br />
 I should note that there is no proof at all that the aneurism was a result of playing EQ or sitting around, or increased weight. But they are health risks in and of themselves.<br />
<br />
Myself, I average about 2 hours a day, I am an IT Professional so sit in front of a PC all day, I know I am a risk too, so I am sure to get up and move around a bit on long sessions at play and at work.<br />
<br />
Also I make a very concerted effort to balance my lifestyle, I swim 40 lengths, run 10 k's 2-3 times a week and watch my weight. My doctor agrees that its a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's pretty creepy, especially with how much I play, as well as how much I am on the internet when i'm not playing EQ.. <br />
<br />
I am on a diet, though (the adkins diet - it's horrible.  You never know how much of the good stuff you ate has carbs until you cut them out..) and I'm in a Judo club.  <br />
<br />
I dont have too many problems with typing.  I learned how to REALLY type.  My instructor was VERY strict about people using improper wrist placement.  <br />
<br />
Heres another thing I would add to suggestions.<br />
<br />
If you have the money, put $250 into a good chair.  If you work at a desk for a living you know what i'm talking about.  Your biggest expense for a computer area isn't the desk, or even the computer (on a part-by-part basis.  The whole thing will cost more, but no one piece costs as much as my chair does)<br />
<br />
If you're in a chair for LONG periods of time, and very often, make sure it's a good one, preferably that helps your posture.   Dont get the smooth leather covering (rips and discolors easily), cloth lasts longer.  And make sure it's metal, or a REAL word (oak).  Or you'll end up buying a new one in a couple years.<br />
<br />
This may seem like it's just advice to keep playing EQ - when if you are in the conditions that the people mentioned before are in, you should take more breaks from it.  But a good posture , and a comfortable sitting place (that doesn't put pressure on any specific place for extended periods) is a good thing.<br />
<br />
It's hard for some people to believe there are actual physical dangers involved in playing computer games, and whatnot, all the time, but they are there.  This has been pretty eye-opening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get off Atkins, it's like all other fad diets, all the crap will just come back.<br />
<br />
Best diet I've found is to not eat fast food, only eating sit down meals and excersising/work out every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get off Atkins, it's like all other fad diets, all the crap will just come back.<br />
<br />
Best diet I've found is to not eat fast food, only eating sit down meals and excersising/work out every day.<br />
<br />
Maybe so, but I dont eat fast food anymore,  and i've always exercised/worked out periodically.  <br />
<br />
I dont think it's a BAD thing to cut out all the sugared pop that I drink anyway.<br />
<br />
The fact is, i'm not grotesquely fat or anything.  A bit chubby is it.  I'm not looking to lose half my mass. :)  And I got chubby by EATING at home.  A lot of steak, potatos (Deserts!),  sugared cereal for breakfast..or pancakes with syrup.<br />
<br />
Cutting out fast food is a good thing, yes, you're right there.  But alot of my problem was all the sugar I was ingesting.  The only reason i'm NOT very overweight was because I do exercise some :)<br />
<br />
I'll admit it's probably a fad diet, but the basic principals are sound.  It's not just a &quot;if you eat only grapefruits for a year you'll lose weight!&quot; thing.  <br />
<br />
Granted, I didn't read up on it, but I think the basic premise is that the body burns sugars first, then fats from your body for energy.  Cutting out most of the sugars gets it to work on the fat faster.  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to do this permanently (god i couldn't take it), but i am confident that once I lose the weight I can keep myself from gaining it back.  (I love sugared pop so, but I will admit I drank WAAAY too much of it.  Hell, just cutting that out should drop me quite a bit ;) )<br />
<br />
Well, enough of a rambling.  This isn't a diet thread. :)  I'm going to troll/lurk some of the others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're stiff and sore after playing EQ, you're either playing too long, or you need a better chair. What Detton wrote is right on the money. Take an AFK every couple hours and stretch. Also don't play in a dark room with the computer monitor as the only light, that's a great strain on your eyes. Keep the room well-lit. Junkilo is right too -- ergonomic equipment will help immensely, *especially* wrist guards or a wrist pad. I've even got a wrist pad on the mouse pad, it's built right in. Go easy on the soda and snacks, and exercise regularly, and you're good to go IMO. <br />
<br />
Thanks for an eye-opening thread, all. Too easy to get wrapped up in Norrath and forget that you've still got a body to take care of.<br />
