<br />
Is it OK for you if I publish it then at www.der-zirkel.org ?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since the epic walk-through doesn't BELONG to anyone, you can do whatever you like with it.... <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it is common courtesy to give credit to those that did all the hard work.... <br />
<br />
Now that I think about it ... WHO did create the walk through .. and who ACTUALLY completed the quest first?  Hehe .. just useless EQ trivia ;)</div></div><hr />

It was fun reading about Forthyr's fights in Hole.  I think he had a faction bug and he had to do like 4 Kirn raids at a time when those were tough raids.</div></div><hr />
