<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How dangerous is it to make the run to the pots? Im thinking of doing it with my shaman (lvl 30) to get the convenient bind point. Also, does Faydwer stay up long or does the slug go down fairly quickly when he/she/it pops. Thanks for the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is pretty darned safe.  I recently escorted a level 14 shaman friend.<br />
<br />
SoW, lev, invis up...and then avoid type of island, shipwreck until you see the wizard spire.<br />
<br />
I still haven't seen Faydwer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool beans :) thanks much Glori, ill probably make the run today :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe Faydedar paths by the red to 60 guy on chessboard island and the 60 guy kills him.   This is usually within 2 hours of spawning.   If he's up once a week for 2 hours theirs a good chance he won't be up when you head to pots.  <br />
<br />
I've never seen him, except the spawned version when my druid completed her epic, and I have several characters bound at the firepots  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wooohooo, one more firepot bound shaman 8-) thanks for the help all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My lvl 15 wizard is bound there for running errands and he's NEVER once even heard of someone getting killed by the dragon, it's woth the risk IMO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He ate me :(<br />
<br />
When I was based in FV I used to swim to the firepots to travel around the world, and I only saw him once in all that time. So I'd say it's fairly safe to travel there, but not totally. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Within a week of allowing us to bind at the firepots, I was bound there and was really trying to get a fellow shammie to bind there.<br />
The first night she bound there she died to Faydedar 6 times in a loop.  And some poor cleric had 8 - 10 corpses on the spires and down in the firepot room when I ported in that night.<br />
<br />
I, on the otherhand, have never seen Faydedar.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyoen else see the new MOB in the pots room? Some old traveler (Skeleton model) who when you hail him talks about getting whacked by the Water Dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that new npc in the firepot room, is good for training weapon skills that u neglected. hes similer to what the soulbinders used to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I haven't SEEN Faydedar, but my necro who is bound on top of the spires has been attacked by him. I managed to live by Feign flopping my way down to the firepots then porting. Only once in the years I've been using the firepots has this happened. So the odds are very much in your favor of never running into him.</div></div><hr />

that new npc in the firepot room, is good for training weapon skills that u neglected. hes similer to what the soulbinders used to be <br />
<br />
By that do you mean that he doesnt attack back or what? I never did anything to soulbinders so im confused :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rypt makes a good point. <br />
<br />
Bind on top of the spires and not in the room itself. Otherwise if you actually want to go to TD you have to go to Oasis and ride a barge. Other than using a pot or porting there is no way to get out of the firepot room if you are bound there.<br />
<br />
I need to do that myself. Thanks Rypt... never thought of it.<br />
<br />
PS. I have been using the pots for 2 years and have never seen Faydedar. However, I once was in zone when he was spawned for epic, the raid was wiped out and I still visited the pots safely. I was told he despawns in minutes if he is spawned in this manner and the raid is unsuccessful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When the world was just Old World / Kunark I had missed the window for fire pot binding, and since I did a lot of traveling(alchemy, item transfers, soloing, etc) I bound on the FV docks and would just run to the fire pots.  Only once when I went and decided to go visit the wizard quadding raptors did I get hit.. I went a bit past the raptor islands.. 'Fayed hits you for 225' etc etc<br />
I might actually have a screenshot, I'll look later and host it if I find it.  <br />
<br />
I died, then called my necro friend to just summon and rez(my 47 halfling warrior took another exp death!).<br />
<br />
Quite a headache when it happens, ex getting a cleric or finding your corpse at the bottom of the ocean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaylim_Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok does someone have an actual loc for the room in wich you bind in.? I would love to bind myself there for easy porting when it is needed. Ive never ventured into TD so I am unsure of where I'm spose to head. Thanks in advance.<br />

Faydedar is a myth, I don't believe in him :D<br />
<br />
Pot run is entirely safe provided you can keep your newbie butt off the islands!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a different version, that is spawned on demand in the hidden oasis. The other one is very rare and once spawned (near the firepots) runs to the Iksar greandmaster at the chessboard to get his arse kicked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was part of a raid that wiped to the spawned Faydedar and he camped our corpses for a good three or four hours before despawning.<br />
<br />
I changed my bind to the firepots this weekend and to my dismay, saw a couple of corpses belonging to a high elf sticking out of one of the spires.  I decided to bind below next to a safe firepot just in case I need to get out in a hurry.<br />
<br />
I saw three other shaman come through in the space of a minute.  :)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if Faydedar will aggro on you in the room below if he swims by?  Aggro though water has always been buggy.<br />
