<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Funny, but kael armory is pretty good xp...I can kill all the mobs leading to the throne, and spawn the cycle, and then kill the first 3 giants...rinse, repeat.  The cash is fricking awesome, getting the blood (1500-2k), shammy spear (2-4k), all sorts of MQ's (1k-20kish), plus tons and tons of toes / helms which can be used for faction or sell for 9p each.  Not to mention the fact that every giant has a sword for 3p.  I highly suggest this spot if you are able to 2box.<br />
<br />

I believe this area is also known as Iceshard Keep.  The duo in question is a 57SK/57SHM with average equipment.  We went and peeked at this last night, tempted by the words of Kinadafz.  The SK single-pulled the mobs outside the armory with ease and we quickly dispatched them.  Note the roamer who conned green at 57.  <br />
<br />
The mobs which drop the MQ pieces are behind the throne area and are spawned by the ring event, correct?  From what I've seen in research on alla's and illia's, the pieces won't drop from anything that is of lower level than 50.  The loot tables are just not listed on anything lower than 50 unless it's a specific named mob. (not sentry XXYY)<br />
<br />
My buddy and I have duo'd frequently through many a nasty situation for about 30 levels.  I've grown to trust his judgement as it has served us well in the past.  Given his ability to FD, he is typically the scout.  After clearing 2 more mobs just inside the building itself, he goes invis to take a look.  It looks less than easy, to say the least.  There appear to be several see-invis casters which are dark blue, melee giants in the 50's, and walls through which who-knows-what will aggro.  At first glance, we could see no real spot to pull to with relative safety.  From what I've read, the pieces drop from the ring mobs and after those three are dead, more will spawn.  I'm assuming this means you are pulling to somewhere safe and out of the way of the additional waves, waiting for it to reset.  We halted our progress there favoring further investigation.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping to gather more information about the doability of camping the mobs that drop valuable items in this area with our particular duo.  Please share with me the details of your experience if you are so inclined.   :D <br />
<br />
Given, we're pretty new to this zone.  I have ran through here squealing like a girl on my way to WL a few times and have participated in a single Vindi raid.  According to what we've heard, this is primarily a mid-50's solid group target.  I'd very much enjoy spending some quality time here as a duo if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I 2 box a shammy and necro, lvl 51 atm. Would this be viable for my duo after we get a few levels? How is the exp at this spot? I would rather not camp here if it is solely for loot, but nice exp and loot is always welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm the SK in question above.  I just thought I'd clear up what the place looked like inside and what my specific questions about the camp were, since I had asked Orgak to park outside the keep for safety.<br />
<br />
We made our camp at the top of the circular ramp from the second bridge coming from EW zoneline.  There is a single Watcher mob (green) standing at the top of that ramp, which we left alone as we were out of aggro range when we moved toward the front of the Keep a bit.  Outside the keep are two dark blue sentinels on the balcony surrounding the front of the building, two light blue sentinels in the pit below and two green wandering watchmen that path from the ramp to the pit up and past our camp site.<br />
<br />
We buffed up at the EW zoneline, ran back and parked, then pulled all six of those mobs.  All single pulled with no issues what so ever.  I then moved inside, where I proximity aggro'd a dark blue sentinel mob single, pulled him out and killed him.  From here, I went into the door directly in front of the small bridge to the keep, kept to the right wall and pulled a dark blue Iceweaver, then another dark blue sentinel.  The three mobs in that room cleared, I went into the door on the left from the small bridge out front and pulled the Oracle standing between the hall from this door and the hall to the throne room.  Next was the Iceweaver in the room directly across from the hall to the throneroom.  At this point, we paused and I went on to scout a bit.  Inside the throneroom were three dark blue mobs (that I could see), a Chanter, an Icechanter and &quot;a Frost Giant Lord&quot;.  All mobs up to this point had come singly, but were fairly close together at their spawn points.  None hit particularly hard, all were slowable by Orgak and I did not have to FD off anything in the pull.  However, I've had bad luck with enchanter mobs, and wasn't sure that &quot;Chanter XXYY&quot; and &quot;Icechanter XXYY&quot; were not in fact enchanter types, so we stopped there in favor of more research.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I'd like to know where the above mentioned Monk and Shammy were camping.  If you made your camp outside the keep, I'll presume you killed all the way into the throneroom, cleared it, spoke the phrase to begin the plate cycle and then pulled three of the spawning giants out to kill and left the others to despawn as you dealt with the repops outside.  If this is the case, then Orgak and I simply do not have the DPS to do this yet, as we had a repop soon after I went in and looked at the throneroom, and I know we would not have had time for 6 more mobs.  I'm fairly certain we could take two of the giants at a time, but three would be pushing it and four would be death for at least one of us.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for anyone to give away hard won tactics, but there has to be something that I'm not seeing, and I'd really like to be able to go get some of the Thurg plate armor, as what I'm wearing at the moment is tantamount to rags compared to the gear I see on most toons my level, and I know Orgak could use some MQ cash for upgrades himself.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your help.<br />

Well amazing if you can do this.  I have done it with 1 group .. but even that was tough .. might be lower lvl dudes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've seen on Illia's Bestiary, the mobs we were killing were in their mid to upper 40's or very low 50's.  They hit about as hard as the Oceancrasher mobs, but seem to have fewer hitpoints, and really aren't that tough.  I don't think we ever saw a mob that could drop the armor though.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm pretty proud of our duo, we've been duoing even con planes mobs just fine for quite some time, and I think we're able to handle just about any situation if we can get in there and see the lay of the land without biting it too many times.  I honestly think we could probably handle the cycle mobs (at least a few of them) provided I didn't have to pull them back out from the throne room to outside the manor past see invis caster mobs.  It could probably still be done at that point, but there's not a whole lot of room to FD even out there, and it has the possibility of becoming a very nasty situation when I'm taking 400hp nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The key is casting Stoi on the SK mid-battle.  Of course, you then mention how &quot;These fights are taking too long, don't you have a better weapon or something?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So if I spawn the cycle (after clearing the throneroom) and we pull the first 3 giants outside and fight them. Then the 4th giant despawns and the 5th and later are never spawned at all... Now if I do the plate cycle to completion and let the little dwarf run off without killing him I bug the cycle and cannot start it again for 2 or more hours. If I let the 4th giant despawn will the cycle be bugged? or can I spawn the cycle again each time I clear to the throneroom?<br />
<br />
I duo this alot 60 sham/55 war it would be nice to add those first 3 giants to our pull routine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think u have to kill all the giants or they will kill u =) .. they walk out I thought ... are they pulled from behind the doors?  I guess we normally just kill eveything and I never thought about it.  I believe all the cycle dudes will wander out so I dont think you can just let them despawn.  You do have to kill the dwarf 100% sure of that.  Killing all the guys in the room are easy enough and can be single pulled .. I thought you were doing the cycle dudes ... even at higher lvls I know one of the cycle guys is like 100% MR and takes a long time to kill .. which means adds.  Not saying its impossible but it would take a very skilled duo ... like 2 real people not a boxer .. way to much can go wrong when you start the cycle.  Hey pick up a few more people and make some friends =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would be really interested as to wether or not this is doable with a 56 ranger with a 54 shammy. The rangers not a gimp, I've got 2700 hps unbuffed with over k ac unbuffed, with mine and the shammys buffs can easily get to around 3300 hps and probably 1060 ac, the shammy can get to around 1 k less and 100 ac less than the ranger. Also the rangers got epic haste with a SBoZ, so dps would be so much better than an sk as to probably offset the difference in damage mitigation. Would be really nice to get some cash saved up and max my faction.</div></div><hr />

The ranger has about the same AC and HP as I did when we went there, so I'm sure that for what we killed, he would be fine, and the DPS upgrade between him and Groff would probably make it cake.  As far as the Giants cycle, we need to hear from kinadafz60 about how he did it and what it looks like in a duo situation.  As Orgak and I said, we didn't actually even clear the throne room, as we were unsure of duo tactics for this area.  It's possible that once you start the cycle, you have to finish it or it won't respawn.  It's entirely possible that you can't separate the cycle giants, or that they wander out of the keep.  I don't know.  From what I've read on other resource sites, they spawn in groups of two after you attack the gnome (/say &quot;the dain must be slain for the peace we must obtain&quot; to spawn him).<br />
<br />
  The accounts are less than stellar, but it looks like once you kill one of the first two spawns  (which should be in their low 50's), a new giant spawns.  So essentially, the way I'm imagining it is that you'd spawn the two,  FD pull one of them out, kill him, go back and tag the second giant of the first round (call him 1b) FD pull him out (to keep Giant 2a inside) and kill him.  Then go in and pull Giant 2a, leaving 2b inside to (possibly) despawn and break the cycle.<br />
<br />
The accounts I read had the cycle spawning two low 50's to start, with a higher level giant spawning upon the death of one of the original two, then an even higher level giant spawning on the death of one in the second round.  The levels were estimated at low 50's (51-53) for first round, mid 50's (54-56) for second round and high 50's (57-59) for third round.   But as I said, we don't know.  The original purpose of the post was to try and figure out how it is done and get some feedback from someone who says he's done it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Getting there would be easy for me, pulling anything difficult would be tough since rangers can't single very easy indoors. I've done the cycle before with my old guild, the mobs hit hard and have alot of hps if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />
