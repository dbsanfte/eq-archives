<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cuivien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
First time posting, just wanted the Shamanic opinion on a piece of gear.  I picked this up a couple days ago in The Grey.<br />
<br />
Golem's Jawbone<br />
+5 AC<br />
+8 Wis<br />
+8 Int<br />
+10 Cha<br />
+25 HP<br />
+50 Mana<br />
<br />
I assume most of you would take this over Crystal Spider Eyes, in spite of a small AC loss?  I have both, and am going to loan one to a lowbie Shaman in my guild (I'm a Bard).<br />
<br />
Also, any ideas on price?  I'll never sell it, but am kinda curious.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Cuivien</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I parted with one I had (from hunting in the Grey) for 18K (pre-bazaar days), in order to buy a JBB.  I miss the stats and AC, but my JBB makes up for it =)<br />
<br />
I haven't seen it in the bazaar since then though, so I imagine about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every time I go there, there is either some damn druid camping the named or some necro/sk fear kiting using the goofy pathing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not worth the huge price for a shaman imo. would be nice if you had it drop, but it's got less ac/hp than crystal spider eyes/enshrouded veil, and wis isn't useful enough to grant spending like 15k on it. spend the money on an earring of the solstice or a spell you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Orakul<br />
<br />
It's a nice shaman piece, but definitely not worth the price compared to other available shaman pieces.  I'd liquidate it, buy some crystal spider eyes, throw the excess plat in a pile... and roll around in it- giggling hysterically.<br />
<br />
That's just me, though.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crystal Spider Eyes have 10 extra HP and 3 extra AC. I would them instead of this. Oh wait ... it has CHA on it. I'll get extra ticks with Torpor on this one, 10 CHA owns. Nm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dunno why this thing costs so much, I don't find it that great. I gave mine away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its the mana on it that bumps the price up, nice for druids/clerics. Sell it and buy two Crystal Spider eyes, they nice for bards too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cuivien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the input all.  To reiterate, I already own it, I'm not buying it.  And I have I think 3 Crystal Spider Eyes on various characters (one on my main - bard).  So it was just a question between the two for a lowbie shaman (either piece will be really nice for them).<br />
<br />
So the consensus seems to be leaning toward the Eyes?  Thanks a bunch....<br />
<br />

PS - maybe I'll sell it, can really use some upgrades myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sell it if u need upgrades.  Your noob shaman pal will be please as heck with the eyes and will probably have close to the same benefit in the long run.  The bone is quite a bit better for a newbie, since the huge mana bonus would really jump their mana pool up, in addition to key stats like wis.  But if the noob has it too nice with twinkage, they don't appreciate the game as much.  So give him/her the eyes and sell the bone and get yourself something nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its price is due to lower drop rate, plus the fact that it is probably the best dropable enchanter Mask, and a very good mask for other int casters.<br />
