<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what exactly happened to the &quot;great&quot; PoP raid % deal that allowed a certain number of unflagged people to come along for a raid with the flagged majority of their guild?  Sure, you had to remake the raid about 20 times to get everyone in, but at least those people who missed a key flagging event because they were out donating organs to to dying orphan kids could come along and have some fun anyway.  <br />
<br />
In GoD, if you miss a flag, you might as well bust out one of those 10,000 piece puzzles that you were saving for a rainy day and mess with that while you wait on a lockout timer.  The joy of watching /gu spam roll by fades so quickly when you are trying to find things in-game to occupy your time while your guildies are off dying in new exotic ways in new exotic locales without you.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure why SOE is unable to follow precedent EVER and decides to make up entirely new rules for each expansion, but I just don't think allowing a certain % of unflagged to come along for the ride ala PoP is going to break the game.  A &quot;flag system&quot; is a &quot;flag system&quot; no??</div></div><hr />

Yes, you cannot bring alts inside to loot rotting loot, but all in all, i find that more comfortable than the pop-version.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but for someone that hasn't even reached Qvic you can't understand.  Come back and say that when you are in Txevu and have to go back and reflag every new recruit or returning member for Ikkinz, Uqua, and Inktuta.  It has nothing to do with the alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">@jaradis: i didnt say it is exactly what i wished for, no way, i despise reflagging as much as all others that experienced it (i did nothing else for approx 1,5 years ...).<br />
<br />
and for the &quot;not even in qvic&quot;-note, i am one step away from  qvic, so i think i do have at least a good idea of understanding, thank you for your concern ...<br />
<br />
but what i see positive here is, that first of all, you dont need more than 2 raids to flag recruits for qvic (getting KT is not easy, granted, but its a possibilitiy to measure how much a recruit wants to join you), and i was really sick of that calculating **** and the huge delay in raidforming it brings with it. and spending 2 hous raid-reforming in solro chamber isnt exactly fun either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaradis thats a bad attitude to have man.  For someone who IS in Qvic I like this way better as well.  EQ has been dumbed down enough.  <br />
<br />
If you can beat a mob once you can beat it again.  NO ONE likes back flagging.  But it is a way to ensure people show up for raids, learn the encounters and better themselves and the guild they are in.<br />
<br />
When you have 109 people to flag thats a minimum of 3 Uqua raids, nearly 3 weeks and that is granting 53 already flagged people after the first raid to come back and help so each raid you can bring almost half your already flagged members.<br />
<br />
Barxt is a very interesting encounter.  Please don't be so &quot;high and mighty&quot; its just a game.</div></div><hr />

First off, no where is that &quot;high and mighty&quot; but you can't understand how aggrevating it is to have to constantly redo GoD zones every few weeks for every new recruit that comes along unless you are there and have had to deal with it.  I'd like to move FORWARD, not constantly going backwards every week or two for a new recruit because of SOE's retarded flagging system.  Ask any of the guilds in Tacvi.  I'm sure they all just love having to go back and flag that new recruit in Uqua, Ikkinz, Inktuta, etc.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down EQ?  The 15% rule didn't &quot;dumb it down&quot;, the flagging system made it stupid.  We never had flags for every other zone during Velious or Luclin.  Unfortunately the glory days of EQ during Velious and even Luclin are long gone, where your progression was only based on your guild's abilities and not a bunch of hoop jumping through a rediculous flagging system. It was great bringing that new recruit to NToV on their very first night, or to kill HP or Arch Lich, or pretty much where ever. Now we either have to stop our progression and constantly go back and reflag, or we have to tell those new recruits &quot;Sorry you need to just sit and do nothing as we go raid a zone for a month that you can't get to&quot;.  And ST/VT wasn't that big of a deal to key them for, far better than all the rediculous stuff you had to do with PoP (we were far into Elementals before the 15% thing) and now GoD. Hopefully OoW will bring that back with having only one keyed zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the new system, but I think that most of it is because of the relative what can be done quickly.  Meaning, KT flag can be easily gotten in non-raid times.  Then, you just have to have the Destruction icon and Uqua icon to get to Qvic.  After that you just need the Inktu'tu one to reach Txevu.  It's really a hell of a lot easier now to be fully flagged than it was back in the days when you literally had to spend a week pre-elementals to get someone elemental flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, it is easier now that it was when we first did PoP (pre-15%) or even now in PoP.  But its still just another time sink to keep guilds from progressing because they can't/won't create the amount of content needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do like the simplification of flags in GoD and, more importantly, that flagging content is in$tanced.  It is just odd that one of the elements introduced to give guilds more flexibility within the artificial confines of the flag system was dumped.<br />
<br />
If you are going to put in an artificial timesink, at least be consistent. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMO either change it to keys or let the 15% rule apply! At least give me some consistency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I recall parts of PoP are keyed, not flagged, so the 85% rule didnt apply. Earth B, Time and CoDb (?) for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How about VT or Emp? No 85% rule there either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Those are both keys, 85 rule just works on flagged zones. I think any flagged zone should be 85'able. Was a great idea they just went and abondoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Flagging in the new expansions play the same role as boats in the old game imho. It slows progression down allowing SOE time to screw something else up ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hope you do know that the 85% thing wasn't always in the game during PoP.  Another aspect of the game pussified by sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, they put the 85% thing in because it was less annoying than sitting on your hands all night because you missed a flag.  <br />
<br />
The entire game is super sugar-coated at this point and backflagging is an irritation, not an obstacle.  This especially holds true in the cockblock-free land of instanced flags.  Not having the 85% rule in GoD just means more quality time running through the same frikkin Ikkinz map till you go insane followed by pull madness to get at Barxt Teh Lockoutmiester.<br />
<br />
Maybe I've just seen too many baldies and golems in Tron suits??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">85% rule into Kotd, Qvic, etc sure as hell wouldnt hurt anyone.<br />
And it would be nice to reduce the amount of times you have to backflag.  You wouldn't eliminate backflagging.  You just wouldnt have to do it until you got enough people to be above 15%<br />
<br />
someone here mentioned Sol Ro, misery.  But gimme a break.  that was one zone which had a double flag check.  I've seen my fair share of flag issues there<br />
<br />
Personally, they should fix it that all zones are 85%able.<br />
Even time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The 85% rule was not without its problems, it got bugged a lot in the day. There were times in the old days when we used it a lot when we would literally spend more time trying to get people into the raid than actually raiding. In a way I'm glad there isnt that rule in place in GoD, we dont need to waste time with that crap any more. Most of the people who are flagless are new recruits, and they can just wait for that once a month backflagging day. Most guilds at the level who need to do backflagging dont let new people in overnight anyway. It was hard to do that in PoP because there were so many flags to be got, but in GoD they are few in number. Its much more manageable.<br />
<br />
The real solution to the problem is to eliminate backflags alltogether, by giving a guild flag to any guild that has completed a flagging encounter 2 or more times. That way anyone who was wearing a guild tag could get entry to those zones through the guild flag rather than a personal flag (people would still get those of course).</div></div><hr />
