<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the many reasons why I do so love being a shaman.<br />
<br />
Last night. Dropped 2 more guardian wyrms. (Numbers 81 and 82) Still no shaman spells. Bastards. After that the tank had to leave. <br />
<br />
2 hours till it is time to go to bed, Decent crew, but no tanks on.<br />
<br />
So I speak up. Lets go to Chardok. We can go into the pit, and Ill tank.<br />
<br />
Now we have a new fella in the guild that doesnt know me very well. A thief. Level 52. He laughs and says that I can't keep the mobs off him and that would be a bad idea. <br />
<br />
(Tumbleweeds float by, and stars are birthed and die in the silence that followed that statement..)<br />
<br />
I point out to him that I have a 1007 AC and regen 42 hitpoints a tick. That I also have 3498 hp when Buffed. (I know it is sad compared to many here, but heck I do okay)<br />
<br />
He replies with a so, you can't do enough damage, and if you do you will have no mana anyways.<br />
<br />
(More stars die, and people start backing away from him)<br />
<br />
I simply laughed and said lets go. Everyone else trusts me, and you will see something that you have obviously never seen.<br />
<br />
At this time It was me (Level 60 Bashy shaman) a level 60 Dorf cleric, my hot boxed Enchanter (Level 55) and the thief. While we were running there a buddy of mine hops on and joins us. A level 58 thief with ragebringer.<br />
<br />
He sends me a tell in a sec saying the lower thief said we were gonna die. A shaman can't tank for two rogues. Especially that deep into chardok.<br />
<br />
(Grins)<br />
<br />
He ask who is pulling. I say I am.  He says you will not have any time to med. I laugh and say I don't med. (Wince) (Wince) (Wince)<br />
<br />
Then I start pulling. Single pulls at first to see how he handles it. Root taunting so they Always have a back.<br />
<br />
Then Once we settle into a pattern I switch it up a bit. I break out the two handed Barb Spiritist hammer and start in on the bracer.<br />
<br />
Root is breaking alot more due to the DD, but the hammer is proccing nicely due to the 255 dex I have when Voiced. (thanks 14 dex at creation) But Most of the time a quick evade brings it back on me, or I toss a envenomed breath to taunt it on me (Nice low mana) Or just root again.<br />
<br />
By the end of the night I made a believer out of him. (Not that it is an amazing thing, just was a fun little story)<br />
<br />
We killed a bunch of Bridge keepers, Watch captains, and loads of normal mobs. Non stop for the 2.5 hours Till we fought out and left. (I was having fun so stayed up late)<br />
<br />
Also at one point I tossed a Torrent of poisen  and got two crits in a row with only Spell casting fury 1.  I like. Alot. And freaked out the Thief. Was 2 720 DD blasts. Mmmm then a 540. <br />
<br />
Plus I got 2.5 yellows of alt xp. Not bad.<br />
<br />
Shaman can tank. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dis be a nice story Bashy bear.  <br />
<br />
Dank joo for it mez do.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh, you're funny Snoww  :)<br />
<br />
Glad you had a good time and made the guy a believer.   Generally I prefer not to tank myself *grumble cazic thule* but I certainly can if the situation warrants it.  I'd prefer to be a chain puller and I can't do that if I am forced to tank.<br />
<br />
I'm always proud of myself though, when we do stuff like Hate with 1 grp and I pull us through a bad LD with my tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1000 AC / 3500 HP buffed sounds about right for a level 60 shaman with a mix of Velious and Kunark gear.  After this point, it's a very steep slope to upgrade.  It was an entertaining story.  I enjoy reading about it almost as much as I enjoy doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Turgurs + regrowth + Fungi = Tank for anyone just about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I am kind of interested in how you keep agro. It seems I have been tanking a lot lately and I just want it to file away as I sometimes lose agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eclectik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice Story :)<br />
<br />
And 2hawks, if i read the thread correctly, i think aggro was help by rooting the mob and standing as close as possible while the rogues stand at max melee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cough snare necklace is uber taunt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh yea, while your sitting around snaring mobs, us barbarians are... um... summoning.. hammers..... yeah....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">insiduous decay! wow thats a taunter, and fast recast too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I lovedoing the same thing, even at my lowly level =-)<br />
<br />
Sometimes when im duo'n w/ my monk friend ill simply root the mob and standon it, just to prove i can tank it.  Her main twinked me tobe a shadrood, but im changing that ASAP =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Under the right circumstances (i.e. high enough HPs and AC) anyone can tank, but obviously some classes do it much better than others.  Luckily shamans are not too far down on that list, as we are basically the Swiss army knives of Norrath.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, after getting my epic, I've found myself jumping in the fray more, BUT only after I do my shaman duties :)<br />
<br />
Only thing keeping me from taking bolder tanking steps is my low(ish) AC for the things I am fighting.  Currently have around 920 fully self-buffed (closer to 950 with cleric/pally buffs), but would like to push the 1000 AC someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rodahn:<br />
 but would like to push the 1000 AC someday.<br />
<br />
Definitely a good goal.  Something very simple you can do toward that end would be to get rid of those jasper rings.  Replace them with 6/65.  You won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i love people without faith in the shm class :)<br />
always so amusing to show them what we REALLY can do if needed.<br />
<br />
no class can tank better than shm if you look isolated on it.<br />
75% reduction in dmg output is amazingly helpful :)<br />
(of course, you could argue fearkiting would be similar, but somehow.. i dont : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, reminds me of a rogue I know. Always telling me it has to be done this way, or we cant do this, and we (my guild) always prove him wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Back in the day when I was fighting bugs in the karanas, I used to partner with a rogue, and I would use my blinding spell to get agro.  It worked incredibly well for getting agro (mobs hate being blinded), used up virtually no mana, and I was able to get my divination skill up as a side effect.  I haven't had to tank (well, except when soloing of course) in a while though, so I don't know if this strategy would work on higher level mobs, but if someone wants to try it and let us all know how it goes, that would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep some poeple can't believe shamans can pull and tank until you prove it to them. They think we are druids with a spear. <br />
<br />
I had to prove an ex-druid wrong one time myself. He was playing a warrior. He just killed a mob and I saw another one way out there. So I ran and got it. He said *** are you doing? You can't pull. I laughed at him. Then I let him know I could tank every mob in the zone easily.<br />
<br />
That's how I solo anyway. Tank, cast, tank. Great way to build up skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I pull all the time in Chardok.  It is a great strategy for keeping the mobs coming at exactly the right pace.  I fetch one with Turgurs, Root it at the group, Spear-dot it, and run to fetch the next while they finish it off.  I can almost always have the next mob slowed, parked, and dotted, all set for them to hit as soon as the previous one was dead.  <br />
<br />
The only downsides are that the chanter is usually bored as hell and the warriors occasionally whine about not getting to pull. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You know you're pretty blase about being beat on by a mob when you keep canning!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love tanking for xp groups! The most was was in FG with a 60th chanter.. had VoG and Garou on top of rage on using the barby hammer. Had 0 problems keeping aggro so the 2 monks and the rogue could beat on the shrooms arses. Group regrowth kept everyone full health.. I would just canni back mana while tanking em heh. <br />
<br />
Sometimes I break out the hamma and people snicker and laugh and tell me I should be medding.. till I proc it 4 swings in a row. and am still able to canni back all the mana I need heh.</div></div><hr />
