<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Taken from the Everquest Live website...<br />
<br />
Upcoming for July 9th<br />
 <br />
<br />
By now, you've probably heard that we're working on our next expansion, The Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  We're attempting some interesting new technology and some awesome new design ideas.  Keep your eyes open for website updates about that.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But, this column isn't about expansions, it's about upcoming Live features, and we have plenty of them for you this month.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We've been working on a lot of zone revamps, both partial and more complete.  Nine zones were updated this month for Live servers, and Legends will be getting a new revamp as well.  That's a lot of zones!  We're addressing issues in those zones that players have had concerns about, with the intent to make them a little more interesting and desirable to play in.  Check them out; we think you'll like what we've done with the zones.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Oh, and for those of you that celebrate Independence Day, have a safe and explosive 4th!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers.  Droga and Nurga will be moving from Legends to the Live servers with our next update.  Along with those zones, we have completed partial revamps of several other zones:  The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth.  We chose these zones to update based on feedback from players, and have implemented changes that will make these zones more entertaining to play in.  If you haven't been to one of these zones in a while, you may want to go back and revisit them after our next update.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Grieg's End changes going to the Legends server.  Grieg's End is one of the more interesting zones in EverQuest, but the original design made pursuing the content in this zone a bit complicated.  The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group.  These changes will revitalize this zone and should make it one of the more popular places for characters of the appropriate level to visit.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Tradeskill trivial failures will be reduced.  Obviously even a great master can make mistakes.  EverQuest players, however, have expressed that they feel master tradeskillers fail on trivial items too frequently.  We have reviewed the trivial failure chances and have made a change to the way they work.  The greater the skill of the character relative to the skill needed to complete a recipe; the less likely he is to fail on a trivial recipe.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Damage Over Time Spell Foci update.  We have implemented a change to focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells.  Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast.  Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some focus items affected.  But the nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be.  To correct this, we have changed the Extended Affliction line to Burning Affliction, which cause DoT spells to do more damage, instead of having a longer duration.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells will be introduced.  Certain trade skill recipes rely on magic spells used to make normal items into magical items.  To make creating these magical items a little more convenient, we will be introducing new Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells that create five magical items rather than just one.  These spells require five components and take longer to cast and use more mana, but they should make creating these items much more convenient.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Newbie quests will be added for Erudites, Trolls and Ogres.  New characters, especially if played by new players, need some time to get acquainted with the area surrounding their starting city.  One of the best ways to get those characters out into the world is to send them on quests.  We have been introducing new quests for new characters to each of the starting cities.  The next update will include quests for young Trolls beginning in Neriak, Ogres in Oggok and for Erudites starting out in Erudin, completing the updated newbie quests for all races.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Area of Effect spells that do not affect your group in PvP will also not affect your Raid.  Taking on large tasks on a PvP server can be complicated by the fact that Area of Effect spells damage your own raid and not just the monsters.  It makes sense that since these spells do not affect your group on a PvP server, they should not affect your raid.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We've updated character creation descriptions.  Players will now be able to right-click the class, race or statistic buttons during character creation to see a detailed explanation of the item clicked.  This will help folks when making decisions about what they want their character to be.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />

I wonder what they mean by ... explosive..  <br />
<br />
<br />
edit:VERY poor taste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Howling Stones revamp, eh?  Guess I better do my 8th cudgel quick.  Not that SOE would overlook updating the quest to work with the revamp :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />

Offensive, and in bad form Kowalsky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Hole and Howling Stones are already great dungeons.  Other than changing the one way nature of these zones, I hope they don't do much.  <br />
<br />
Same with Kaesora.  That was a bad design theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do agree that HS needed a revamp, besides the 8th cudgel raid, shaman trying for his dusty skull, and the odd Necro/SK zoning in to kill Druesala the zone was deserted.<br />
<br />
The CoM and Hole raid is shamefull IMO, both zones were fine as is (Ok maybe the hole needed a LITTLE tweaking, definatly not a revamp as they put it) but CoM was an excellent zone.<br />
<br />
Maybe with all the upgrades going into these zones they might beef up the epic a bit, seeings how they will make it more difficult to obtain. (Lets go clicky snare/dot :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm with Hibbert on this one. Will be heading down there ASAP, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just hope they don't &quot;dumb down&quot; any of these zones when they revamp them.  HS is one of the better places to exp for it's level and it is a pretty unique zone.<br />
<br />
Gart, I love Kaesora!  How many other lower level zones can you watch full groups of unexperienced L60+ players go barrelling into and end up with a long CR? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ack well i hope they dont change Hole/CoM to much because i dont have my epic yet, and it might be hard to find High Scale Kirn/Neh'isharr with the zone revamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes but HS is rather difficult to play in unless you have a rogue along.  That was always annoying because if the rogue had to go, the group was over.  An entire zone's content shouldn't depend on one single class.  Specially when that particular class is very popular for groups already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree Shavedman.  The next part of my epic is heading to the Hole for Kirn, and I really hope that they dont accidentally remove him from the zone, or change his loot table so that he no longer drops the piece that I need.  Not that Im expecting to get my epic any time soon....guild is to busy trying to get into elemental planes to worry about an epic...  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a concern about the change to extended affliction -- namely that they could make it do 20 times the damage per tick and it would make no practical difference because it is extremely difficult for the average player to get an item that has the extended affliction 4 effect.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, there are 2 items that have Extended Affliction 4 (there is also a ShadowKnight only item, which is not significant to this disucssion).  One is a drop from Saryn, in Plane Of Torment (which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly puts that item out of reach of any but the very high end guilds) and the other is a player made pottery item which may or may not exist.  It is not listed on Allakazams, anyway, but IS listed on Lucy (which simply means that it could exist in the game somewhere).  The pottery item apparenly requires putrescent blood, which is (again, apparently -- correct me if I am wrong please) a drop in a scripted event in Plane Of Torment.  I've never actually seen the blood for sale, so I'm inclined to think it is very rare, or very hard to get.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is -- it would be nice if at the same time they made the chnge to the nature of the effect, they also added some more realistically obtainable items to the focus effect list.  <br />
<br />
I do suppose I could add my coldain military wristguard back to my backpack I carry around, which would somewhat improve bane/pox, except that I never use bane or pox anymore anyway (because they break root, and lets face it thats very annoying).<br />
<br />
The change itself is shown on lucy, btw:<br />
<br />
It increases spell damage by 20 percent.  <br />
<br />
So, assuming you were using blood of saryn, instead of 320 a tick you would get 384 a tick (for a total of 2688 damage instead of the usual 2240).  To boil it down, instead of 53dps the spell would do 64 dps.<br />
<br />
With bane of nife, you would get 256 a tick, for a total of 1942 (256 * 7 + 150).  This would be a dps of 46dps.<br />
<br />
With breath of ultor, you would get 157 a tick for a total of 4082 (157 * 26).  This would be 26 dps.<br />
<br />
With pox of bertox, you would get 133 a tick, for a total of 2484 (133 * 18 + 90).  Thsi would be 23 dps.<br />
<br />
What does all this mean?  <br />
<br />
A non-root-breaking shaman would do 90dps (bood of saryn/breath of ultor).  <br />
<br />
A poison-dot only root-breaking shaman would do 110dps (blood of saryn, bane of nife).<br />
<br />
An aggressive root-breaking shaman would do 159dps, but that would require keeping all 4 spells up which if often more trouble than its worth.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the DPS on the epic works out to, so I didn't include it in any of my calculations.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this seems like a positive change but I wonder how many will ever see it with their level 60+ spells (not just shaman, but necros, druids, etc.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, it is a sad state of affairs when there are more &quot;elemental&quot; BP/Robes in the game than there are putrescent bloods. If any zone in the game needs a revamp, it is Torment. That place just SUCKS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The extended affliction 4 pottery item DOES indeed exist.  It has only been made on a few servers, though, because it requires a retardedly rare drop from an event in PoTorment that no one ever does.  You need two bloods from torment to make the item, and you need a third blood in order to make the imbue nightmare spell required for the gem.  The blood only comes from 1 place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/disagree Plane of Sky is in a greater need of a revamp than any zone in the game.<br />
<br />
Sorry, POMischief needs the revamp the most, the damn zone was never even finished.  GRRR I wish they would just fix it, I spent weeks up there to get my boots and I really woulda liked to try to do the big quest with the CT doll but still to this day they havent fixed it  :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frosten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;The next update will include quests for young Trolls beginning in Neriak, Ogres in Oggok and for Erudites starting out in Erudin, completing the updated newbie quests for all races.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually iksar had newbie quests before the other races...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes but HS is rather difficult to play in unless you have a rogue along<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so, you merely have to know what you are up to. For instance, There's a big fat bear coprse at PoK book in OT that has keys on it for south and west wing that I keep handy. The benefit with HS is that you really don't have to worry about other groups even being close to you in there(and there are two or more groups in there on busy nights).<br />
<br />
I will be rushing to do my cudgel as well, 1 dusty skull and the final encounter to go. It only took them 2 years to finish putting the cudgels in game..probably take them take them 2 more to fix them and the other iksar quests they're messing with with all of the kunark zone revisions(droga/nurga/com).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yes, PoTorment is worse PoP zone ever, extended affliction 4 pottery item is soo rare every guild avoid raid at this zone after get flags<br />

<br />
That's exactly why it needs to be worked on.  You shouldn't have to keep corpses laying around just so you can visit a zone, then when you're done, make a new corpse.  It's the same reason they made soulbound keys (and then the /key thing), because it was a royal PITA to get around by killing yourself and rezzing and leaving corpses here and there.<br />
Unlock most of the doors (or make the keys to them go on /key too - then you only have to do the dungeon once), and up the level of mobs (south/east/maybe west ones, the entrance / north are probably fine), and you'd have an awesome dungeon again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally, Leave HS as it is. <br />

Nice having the whole place to myself. Actually, think it's time to head back there, and check the /con of mobs since the patch.<br />

<br />
Anyway, I agree with Naagruz that Kaesora is pretty cool.  I had a whale of time working to the bottom with a group right after Kunark opened.  <br />
<br />
But on the whole, one way/hard to access experience dungeons are a bad design theory.  <br />
<br />
Chardok is good, Sebilis is ok, the Hole is less ok because you need evac to get out basically, HS is way too rogue dependent, and Dalnir and Kaesora need a better way out.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a great dungeon.  <br />
<br />
How about Runnyeye or Paw?  Runnyeye is not usable, and it's never really been usable - except for groups scrabbling in portions of the 2nd floor and farmers.  It's much much bigger than that.  If you ramped up the 3rd floor to level 60 mobs, that would be cool.</div></div><hr />
