<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that there are different Augmentations you can purchase from each Theme/Camp.  What I don't know yet is if the Augmentations dropping in the dungeouns are dependent on the theme.  (Example: Dex Aug = Ruj Theme only)<br />
<br />
I have seen the following drop from the Ruj Them so far and seen about 10 or so drop so far.  Now the only ones I have seen are Dex, Str, Agi, &amp; Fire Resist.  I'm just curious to know if they are theme related for the Augments.<br />
<br />
I'ld really like to see if I could find some HP, AC, Sta, or Wis Augments.<br />

Well as appears from what everyone is saying the type of augs are purely random in each dungeon.  I'm been concentrating on one Theme and one set of dungeons.  (Theme: Ruj  Dungeon: Oasis ) maybe that is the reason Str, Dex, Agi, and FR are the only ones I see.  Had another blasted dex Aug drop for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We had some disease and mana augments drop in a Guk dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Didn't notice where the others dropped but I wouldn't be surprised if it was totally random. Anywhoo, need to do more missions to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive seen +6 sta drop in MM 3 times so far in 7 adventures there...iirc a few +str as well.</div></div><hr />

Guk had hp, pr, dr, agl, fr.<br />
Mir had cha and dr.<br />
Mis had wis, str.<br />

This is all I can remember right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm pretty sure they are random in any theme. We found a stamina, agility, fire resist, and mana in one run in Takish. I've done all the themes at least once, and I see some of the same augmentors regardless of where we are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think what augments drop might have something to do with what classes you bring along.  I say this because one night we did a mission and didn't get any augments.  Then, our wizard left and we picked up a 62 chanter (the rest of us were 65).  We had 4 augments drop during that mission.  Three +6cha augments, and one +6int augment.  She was the only int caster, and the only person that used charisma.  Might just be coincidence, but it is a little wierd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There might be something to the drops being geared to the party members.  In one of the same groups to Rukarkian Hills, we had arms and a H2H weapon drop there were monk/beastlord usable.  I hadn&#8217;t seen anything like that before and we had a level 65 beastlord in our party.  If this is true I think its great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not very interesting for shaman, but I've had a +6 INT drop in a level ~63 average adventure in Mistmoore.  As I'm a wizzy, I was pleased :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All my gear sucks, so I'm not sure what to augment - since I'm these faint hopes of replacing it some year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I'm seeing, there's a lot of Veksar equivalent drops for upper 50's groups, so I expect all of us with non-uber gear will be able to get replacements from ldon drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've mostly adventured in MIR (what can I say, I like it even though it is harder than the rest) and I have seen:<br />

+6 dex<br />
+6 int<br />
+6 cha<br />
+6 sta<br />
+6 fire<br />
+6 cold<br />
<br />
I did one adventure in MMC and saw a +12 hp item drop (which I ended up getting).  Now +12 hp is not alot of HP, but I'll take it.  After 5 or 6 of those, my HP will have taken a fiarly noticeable jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So far I have seen:<br />
<br />
MM: DR, PR, MR, Sta, Wis, Int, Cha<br />
Guk: PR, Int, Sta<br />
Tak: MR, Str, Cha<br />
<br />
I have spent most of my time so far in MM and would bet that all stats can be found in all zones.  The only difference I have seen is that the augment stat values are higher in harder adventures.  Aug's in &quot;hard&quot; are +7 and in &quot;normal&quot; they are +6.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I believe I've seen fire resist, str, sta drop in MMC. Dex, cha, HP drop in Ruj. I don't think there's a pattern to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm maybe you have a point here. 3 (yes three  :D ) WIS and 1 resist augment dropped<br />
in TaK recently from a normal collect mission. We had 4 WIS using characters in party,<br />
so that could have been some influence.<br />
<br />
Of course everything could be a extremely lucky RNG as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">guk: agi,dex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just quick update to the locations up top.  Its my best guess as of right now based on what people have posted up to this point.  Looking at it bit closer the attual dungeon for the theme might be the desiding factor on the Aug drop as opposed to the theme.  Well just look at the first post as I have most the information there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Jinheim might be right, every adventure I have been on with a monk there have been AGI augments drop.

Words of Apparition are dropping like water in LDoN, making the only difficulty the Yaeths page, which has a couple known locations. I cannot see spending 800 APs for this spell, which I will use MAYBE a couple times a week, when I can now get the research for it easily.</div></div><hr />
