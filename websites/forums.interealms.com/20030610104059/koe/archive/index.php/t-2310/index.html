<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We started off with myself, Zelfani, Aliera, and Mishlan. Zelfani had a problem with her keyboard and had to camp. We added Falino and Trelgar (thx Zelfani and Trelgar for all the tp's). We found thr quest mob for the enchanter. They charmed it,  turned in their gems, and we dispatched it. Next we went to the NE corner and started fear kiting the bigger mobs. We did great until somehow we aggroed a guardian wurm. Yuk. The first time this has ever happened to me. Trelgar bit it when it hit him for around 500 a few times. The rest of us made it. Aliera lined him up a res and we went at it again. Mish and Aliera were replaced by Moebeus and Jlove. We got some spells and some exp.<br />
<br />
We ended up getting:<br />
<br />
Evacuate: Wizard lvl 57<br />
Tunare's request: Druid lvl 55<br />
Form of the howler: Druid lvl 54<br />
Dementia: Enchanter lvl 54<br />
<br />
Adelrune says he might need Evacuate. If he doesn't it is open for grabs.<br />
<br />
Grats to Trelgar on both Druid spells.<br />
<br />
Dementia is unclaimed.<br />
<br />
There are many spells to be looted up there. Random drops off all classes. I have seen almost all lvl 51 - 54 spells in zone, but a lot of 55 - 58 spells drop up there from the bigger mobs. Would love to do this again. Razma and I were talking about doing this again tonight if you are interested.</div></div><hr />
