<br />
I don’t mean to sound bitchy about this, honest, but it really has been a problem for me and I’m guessing for others as well.  Sites like this are an invaluable resource.  I can’t count the number of times I’ve had questions about things in game that could only be answered by more experienced players.  And I am truly grateful that people have taken the time to answer those questions.  But even the best advice in the world is useless if the person reading it has no idea what’s being said.  <br />
<br />
This is particularly true for people new to the game.  One popular question is where to go: for the best loot, experience or whatever.  It doesn’t help to tell someone to go to BB or EC if they have no idea what those letters stand for.  After two years of playing I’ve gotten better at deciphering most location abbreviations but there are still a few zones I’ve never heard of and I still find myself replying to a post asking what zone was being referred to.<br />
<br />
And zone names are nothing compared to weapon and armor names.  At least there are a limited number of zones.  To this day I’ll read posts about gear upgrades and have no idea what gear is being referred to.  It might have been exactly the type of weapon or armor I was looking for, but with only the abbreviation to go by even a search of Allakhazam often proves fruitless.<br />
<br />
As I said, I’m very grateful that people are taking the time answer questions.  But it would be extremely helpful if whomever is making a post would refer to the place or item in question by its full name first and then use abbreviations.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorgeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to feel the same way, but then i realized that the people nice enought to help are always willing to tell you what an abbriviation is if you ask</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Leads to a lot of clutter, though.  Post your question, get 15 unintelligible replies, post again asking for definitions of 10 or 30 acronyms, then try to paste the definitions that are later posted into the original replies in an attempt to decipher them...  ;)<br />
<br />
I never really thought about it, but the people who need this information the most are probably the ones with the least experience with these acronyms and the least ability to decipher the coded speech...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up, I'll take the time to spell stuff out.  It's useless posting &quot;helpful&quot; stuff if the only ones who can understand what I'm saying are the ones who already know it.  Reduces this board to an exercise in mental masturbation, huh?</div></div><hr />
