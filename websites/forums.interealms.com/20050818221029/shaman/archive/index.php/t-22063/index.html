<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a little confirmation here on something I just learned:<br />
<br />
Does healing summoned pets really give absolutely no agro?<br />
<br />
Reason I ask is that I gave my $.02 about whether a cleric should box an SK or Necro.  Hands down the necro won since no matter how many mobs the pet was tanking the cleric could heal it with no chance of getting agro.<br />
<br />
I've googled this quite a bit and can find no on-line confirmation.  In the same thread I was informed that this feature of the game is regularly used by a cleric/mage combo to take down big mobs.  Mage sends in pet, cleric moves to stand under the mob and then heals pet from there.  The cleric can even sit down and doesn't agro the mob during the fight.<br />
<br />
Ran it by my roommate who was the MT for a time-enabled guild (now focusing on GoD), and he had never heard of this.  Indicated that he would consider it an explot if true.  With the 10 years of EQ experience between us having something this major slip by us has me feeling skeptical.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I know that's the case if the PC is attacking the mob or has aggro, but if they have no agro I've been assured that the mob will not attack.  Thus the cleric's ability to stand directly under the mob and sit during the fight.<br />
<br />
Again, I am skeptical of this but I have it on a very reliable source that it is done regularly.  I'm at work otherwise I'd fire up a new cleric, get it a few levels and try it myself.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not necessarily gummox.  IF healing the pet generates no agro, AND the mob is not naturally KoS to the cleric, then it could sit right next to the mob while the pet kills it.<br />
<br />
That being said in PoP or higher I can't see this playing a major role becuase most of the mobs are KoS to people, but I haven't heard about it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guess I should put the reasons down for why I consider this such a major feature if it does work this way.  If you duo with a monk or SK and they pull a few mobs you are faced with the issue that if you heal the PC the mobs not adequately aggroed will come for a piece of you.<br />
<br />
Now, if a Necro, BST or mage does the same and has the pet tank you are free and clear to heal the pet as much as you want without worrying about agro.  Your partner works on the CC and once things have calmed down you can focus on killing.<br />
<br />
Obviously this doesn't help much for mobs that will eat the pet.  But there are many instances where this provides a significant advantage over having a PC tank.  There are still plenty of old world zones that provide plenty of opportunity for drops and xp where this could be a good tool.  Droga comes instantly to mind.<br />
<br />
I don't see this as something that totally imbalances the game; but could be a very useful tool.  If you know you will get a few mobs focus healing on the pet while the CC has some leeway to do their work withoug having mobs run amok.<br />
<br />
BLs would probably benefit the most from this feature if true.  But it also affects shaman significantly since it gives a lot of weight towards duoing with a Mage or Necro over the standard Monk/SK choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Healing summoned pets will not generate any agro at all.<br />
<br />
I 3-box with an enchanter and mage.  I can heal either my pet or the mage pet (usually the mage pet due to better agro) and not ever draw the ire of the mobs.  It's extremely handy to have just pets tanking, in situations where they can hold up to the beating.  With shaman slows, a mage is a VERY powerful duo partner.  I imagine a necro would be, for the same reason.  <br />
<br />
Two pets outfitted with mage-summoned gear can do respectable dps and be reasonably durable.  If you're careful about when you toss in a slow, the mage air pet can hold agro very very well, even with poison DOTs.<br />

p.s. I believe this is due to the fact that summoned pets of all varieties are factionless.  They were put on beta-neutral faction years ago to prevent AFK-ing with pets.  So healing a &quot;character&quot; that has no faction results in no agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One other thing to remember is if you send in the pet and it's getting beat on 3' from it's friends you can heal it all you want.... but the second that pet dies all it's friends are Agro on you.  There was a big post on this also because of the pet pulling techniques you can use.<br />
<br />
But the main points to remember are:<br />
1- You can heal your pet all you want w/o gaining agro.  Ever see a BL play Pet Cleric?  They jump in and beat on something and then quickly duck out of range so their pet tanks while they regen up and CH the pet then they jump back in for more damage later.<br />
<br />
2- If the pet ever dies you will automatically draw the agro from any mobs with in agro range even if you are using the low level pet pulling tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is different than the pet pulling technique that is detailed.  In the pet pulling you have to use a lower level pet since a mob's friends will join in on the fight if the pet is blue to them.  The idea there is to pull a single mob from a cluster back to the group.  In this case you want to use the toughest pet available so that it can adequately tank the pulled mobs while it is being healed.<br />
<br />
If the pet dies the pet's owner gets all the agro but the healer doesn't.  If they are far enough apart the mobs should rush the pet owner and the healer should be left alone.  If the owner can feign then the mobs should go back to their spawn point as long as no-one else gets agro.<br />
<br />
I can see where this can be useful for breaking spawns or packed rooms.  For a single target you do want a tank to have agro, but for multiple targets this feature gives you the ability to break a cluster of mobs without endangering the entire group.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was always under the impression that healing a pet DID give you a little agro. If pulling a single mob with a pet, and just healing that one pet (no slow, no pet buffs, etc), but standing far enough back that you wouldn't normally agro the mob, it will still attack you when the pet dies. That must mean there is some agro from healing. If there were no agro from healing the pet, when the mob died, I thought it would go back to what it was doing.<br />
<br />
Again, just my perspective of things. <br />
<br />
Theoretically a good way to test this would be to have your pet attack a normally non-agro mob. Con the mob before your pet attacks, while your pet is tanking, then again once you've healed your pet. I would think there would be some noticeable differences in the consider text message. As I am at work, I may try this when I return home today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No aggro from healing a pet.  But lock the thread before SOE sees it :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How do you explain the agro then when said pet dies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If it is *your* pet, then yes, the agro will bounce to you.  I have never really paid attention to the non-agro from healing someone else's pet.  If you want to try it, get a friendly mage etc to use their pet to attack a non-KoS to you mob, and then try healing the pet and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Playing around with a mage pet tank in ssra just last week, I found that I could stand within melee range of mobs without getting aggro as long as I didn't have my pet attack it, or cast any spells on the mob. This was with the mage pet first attacking the mob and then I would walk up within melee range. I don't know about the pet heal aggro though, I just dumped a Q on it when we were fighting slow immune elites on the second floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do remember reading that in a patch message a few months after PoOP came out.<br />
<br />
Although castersrealm keeps old patch messages, or at least did when I used to hit that site, their search utility rarely gave me results.<br />
<br />
So AFAIK SOE does know bout this, and in fact put it in.<br />
<br />
Though, I think there was a small change to this in regards to healing CHarmed pets bout the same time they nerfed the exp you get when charmed pets do the majority of the dmg.</div></div><hr />
