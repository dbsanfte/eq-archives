<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone could clear this up for me. I was in a group in BoT last night and had the group fully buffed except for haste. The enchanter was casting Vallons so I thought we were golden. The main tank sent me a /tell haste please if you get a chance.<br />
<br />
I responded that I was happy to do so but thought the enchanter was hasting (I had vallons up in my buff window). He responded that he was, but celerity stacked.<br />
<br />
Two things pleased me about this interchange. <br />
<br />
1) The tank was cool for sending me a tell and helping me learn something I didn't know without making me feel like a true noob.<br />
<br />
2) The tank was cool for sending me a tell and helping me learn something I didn't know without making me feel like a true noob.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
The celerity icon did indeed stack with vallons.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? In months of trolling on the boards here I don't recall seeing a single post saying that these two hastes stacked?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They stack as far as buffsigns/slots go, BUT the EQ engine then ONLY uses the highest haste buff you got and ignores the lesser haste buff, they dont go 80%+60% = 140% haste.<br />
<br />
IF you got a lesser haste buff with some AC/STATS/REGEN or whatever adjustments on it, those will still work, but not the lesser haste that are part of the buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The haste doesn't &quot;stack&quot;. Vallon adds additional benefical effects (agi/dex/attack).  Both icons will be there, the highest level haste will take precedence and any side benefits will stack.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the only &quot;haste&quot; that truly stacks with spell haste is bard song haste.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hastes from the same version will not stack, but you can mix and match haste groups<br />
<br />
<br />
ie<br />
<br />
V1 haste is worn/innate haste.   (FBSS, RBG, CoF, etc etc)<br />
<br />
V2 haste is cast haste (Celerity, SLTW, Vallon, etc etc etc)<br />
<br />
V3 haste is the bard overhaste(Rizlona's, Warsong of Vahshir, etc)<br />
<br />
you can stack V1 + V2 + V3<br />
<br />
you cannot stack multiples of V1, V2 or V3*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Bards have a goofy line of spells (ervaj) that is kinda v2.5 [allows you to stack with V2, but won't break the haste cap like V3]<br />
no bards ever use them so just ignore them =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">tikker has things right.<br />
<br />
v2 as he put it also include any clicky hastes, including the monk epic clicky and the marvelous visons clicky on some melee's ornate gloves. This also includes most bard songs and things like the proc from bard epic and tunare's bard sword. It is possible to have multiple or even several of these buffs up at once but only the best % haste is used. All others haste components are just ignored. Stats like attack in bard epic proc etc still apply but haste does not.<br />
<br />
There's also a v4 sorta. There are a couple aa's that provide a haste benifit that stack on top of the others too. The one that comes to mind off hand is the ranger aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kinda correct, item haste is different from v1, v2, v3 haste, it is worn haste.<br />
<br />
v1 haste: most haste spells and bard songs<br />
v2 haste: ervaj line of bard songs, will not exceed haste cap<br />
v3 haste: Vah Shir line of songs, Rizlona's, Call of the Muse, ranger AA. Will exceed haste cap.<br />
<br />
You can stack Worn, v1, v2, and v3 haste and effects will be cumulative.  Two or more V1 hastes (eg SLTW, Vallon's, Warsong of Zek) will only use the highest haste.<br />
<br />
Monk epic haste is also v1.  Monk epic haste stacking is a very common misconception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks very much everyone. I appreciate the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya, both ICONS show, but only the higher haste takes effect.</div></div><hr />
