<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My local computer store in town and I sat down and drew up specs for a computer to do mostly gaming and normal wear and tear things. Please offer any suggestions you think might be better. However I do want to stay with the p4 3.4 chip.<br />
<br />
Case: PSI Clio w/ 550w 24pin ATX<br />
Mainboard: MSI 925x Neo Platinum<br />
CPU: Intel Pentium 4 3.4GHZ (775)<br />
Ram: 1.0GB Kingston DDR-2 533(2X512)<br />
Video: Nvidia Geforce 6800 Ultra PCI-Express<br />
Sound: Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS<br />
Network: Onboard 10/100/1000<br />
Harddrive: 120GB 7200RPM Sata<br />
First drive: 12x Lite-on DVD-RW<br />
Second drive: 16x DVD-ROM<br />
Floppy: 1.44MB<br />
Mouse Logitech MX510 Optical<br />
OS: Windows XP Home<br />
Generic keyboard and 2 speakers.<br />
3yr warranty<br />
System cost $2999.99<br />
<br />
Some notes....<br />
I looked everything up on the list best as I could at tomshardware.com and found all of it except the case and video card. Even new egg didnt have the videocard so I assigned it a price of $500. I guess the pci video cards havent made it past the boutique dealers yet. The case I gave $100 for though I know it could be less.<br />
<br />
Any hoot if I were to try and put this system together it would cost me $2300 not including shipping and handling charges. I wouldnt have a 3 year warranty though that they give me. I also have never put a system together so do not know how hard it is to do. I could add another gig of memory as well(2 gig total) but dont know how needed that is.<br />
<br />
Buy or build I guess is the main question. Any suggestions on the hardware would be welcome as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, in about 2 years, all those top-end parts will be really really cheap, if they're not discontinued.  The first year, each part will probably be covered by the manufacturer's warranty, IF the local shop doesn't offer at least that much of a warranty on parts.  Which they should.  Else I'd find another shop, because all the ones around here do.<br />
<br />
I'd say the chances are slim to none that you'll cash in on $700 worth of pain and suffering from that warranty.  So it really boils down to whether you're one of those sickos who gets a charge out of personally putting your kit together (like me).  I'd definitely do it for $700, I don't charge THAT much (yet).</div></div><hr />
