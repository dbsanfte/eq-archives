<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Ill start...The meanest thing ive done to a play was a newbie......(You know how newbies like to beg) I was level 29 and he was begging.....so I handed him the potion where it takes life and gives to mana..and obviously he killed himself =/ <br />
<br />
[Boogahz]<br />
We had a Monk repeatedly going afk in Sebilis with us without announcing it. We ended up having to evac, so once everyone else was out of range I ported him to Tox and headed back to Sebilis.<br />
<br />
[Varrix]<br />
BUWAHAHAHAHAHA....what potion was that...like the necro spell dark pact? ohhh....that's too funny.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmm...the meanest thing...I don't believe I've ever done anything wicked. But...hehehe, about a month back I was in WC and charmed me a Kodiak cause I was killing Giant spiders for the silks for a friend. Anyhow, this Gnome warrior started buggin me to let him kill my pet. I told him at least a dozen times to bugger off but still he buggerd me to let him kill my pet. So... I told him, that the next time my charm wore off... he would be welcome to try to get the Kodiak off me. Mind you, this Kodiak had Skin like Diamonds, Chloro, Storm Str, Savage Spirit, Resist Magic, Sow, AND, Shield of Thorns. Needless to say...the Kodiak tore him up. Since I'm a druid, I love the animals ;) and I would not help this little pest kill my beloved pet. After the noob was dispatched he proceeded to /tell me for 15 min what an ass I am etc etc... so I finally got tired of him and zoned.....well...this monkey was still hunting Kodiaks, and guess who he ran into....MUWAHAHAHA...my UBER Kodiak....LMAO, killed him again. Some people never learn.<br />
<br />
[Sherazad]<br />
Mean oh yeah... that would be telling a newbie Level 1 To go ahead on into crushbone.... he did and was slaughtered... oh well at least he didn't lose XP!<br />
<br />
[Valfaroth]<br />
Back in beta when enchanters could use illusions to turn into anything at all...towers, houses, bridges.....ANYTHING ....I went to kelethin and turned into a bridge...in illusion form though, as we all know....peopple just pass right through you.....all the newbies in kelethin plummetted to their death.....it was rather funny....<br />
<br />
also went to west karana and saw someone meditating in front of tower two...me and 4 or 5 other enchanters made a circle of towers around him and he couldn't figure out how to get out...he didn't even try to walk through....except the one time he tried to walk through the REAL tower...didn't work so he didn't try again....he shouted for a good 20 min i think ....hahahah<br />
<br />
then they changed the spell...didn't understand why .....<br />
<br />
[Suka]<br />
well it wasnt me but i was there.....<br />
<br />
an old friend from the lazarus days by the name of ludah (an ench) was with me collecting beads one day in misty thicket. some newbie came up and started to harras the both of us and challenged ludah to a duel. after a few moments of trying to tell this newbie that he would die he accepted.<br />
during this time he loaded up charm....as soon ashe hit the duel buttom he charmed the newbie tobe his pet and sent him off to kill gobs for us. think this lasted a good 20 mins....finally it broke and he died while in the middle of a nasty fight. he never bothered us again hahaha.<br />
<br />
[Nindalf]<br />
/em Imagines the things she could do with Translocate<br />
<br />
<br />
A newbie is bugging me in G fay, I need a bind I'm bound in Nfp. Translocate.<br />
<br />
Someone is being an ass on a raid. Translocate.<br />
<br />
You walk up to someone you don't like and invite them to a group, Translocate.<br />
<br />
[Jlove]<br />
Gfay is my most hated zone. All the rediculous spamm, the beggars, people inspecting me all over (personal pet peeve), port requests, and that garbage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, one day it was particularly bad, with 13 tells for ports before inside of a minute (forgot to go /anon before porting in), then a bunch of begging, and one guy spamming in shout for money. I /ooc him to try out his new begging skill on the PoD - 20 seconds later we all hear the PoD shouting about some fools meaningless death. I was a minor hero in the zone as I did my banking and took off <br />
<br />
One thing I thot of but never had the cruelty to do is tell a newbie beggar to target me and type /d to get a donation, then accept his offer to duel and drill him. Doubt I will ever do that, but i bet it would work :P<br />
 <br />
[Aliera]<br />
The first one is similar to one above.<br />
<br />
My mage on Luclin was just chillin in Qeynos Hills, when a bunch of loud annoying newbies started getting really loud and annoying. So i loaded up summon mod rod and started giving them to random mobs in the newbie zone. (this was back when you could still trade via a mob) Needless to say several newbies found the new toys and tried using them....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The other is more specific. When I was around 39 and trying to get my Illusion Iksar spell, I was at the Exiled Iksar camp in the Swamp of No Hope waiting for a Froglock Ton Warrior... a VERY ellusive spawn that was know to come thru the area now and then.<br />
<br />
At level 39 the iksar were green and would not agro despite Scowling. Well.... along comes this 29 high elf chanter lookin for a Ton Warrior as well. No sooner did he arrive then one wandered thru the Iksar camp... He knew I had been waiting a while (i actually had been waiting several days), but jumped it anyway. Well the frogs are easy greens even to a 29, but it ran... it ran right thru the Iksar camp, agroing all 6+ on the other chanter.<br />
<br />
Well he ran back toward me with them wacking at him, his pet still chasing the Ton Warrior would not help him. He shouted for help over and over, but I just stood and watched him die. When he died, his pet poofed, and the ton Warrior was still alive, so I killed it. Unfortunately that one did not have the item I needed. When the chanter got back he was slightly upset I didn't help him, so I told him he deserved it for trying to KS, and that the Frog HAD the totem he needed just to piss him off some more.<br />
<br />
I then left (I was tired anyway) and went back a few our later and manged to get my totem quickly and luckily.<br />
<br />
[Rizz]<br />
Hehehe boy oh boy.<br />
<br />
Well I despise beggars, I was in North Freeport with some friends from the guild, don't remember who at the time, when a newbie bard, level 4-6 or so was asking me for platinum or equipment.<br />
<br />
I told him to leave me alone I wasn't interested and he would not relent, finally I gave in and said &quot;Ok, target me and type /d for donate.&quot; He did and was going Uhm, what the? Then I accepted duel and whacked him a couple times before he ran off. He ran to the zone line and I didn't bother chasing him, but he came poking his head back through the entrance to the &quot;Market&quot; area of North Freeport, when I nailed him with a well placed arrow from the other side of the market place. <br />
<br />
After he finished loading up from his death he sends me another tell. &quot;Uh man that was not cool, so can I still have some stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rizz mumbles &quot;some people never learn&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Another time Samani needed a port so I loaded up Zelfani and ported her into Common Lands. Some twinky newbie kept bothering the both of us &quot;ladies&quot; for buffs. I was not in a mood to be pestered (I would make a grumpy druid) so I charmed the next Kodiak that came along, Gave it SLN, Feral Spirit, Sow, Chloroplast, Thorns, Samani put a Symbol and Shield of Words on it and then Atoned it when the charm ran off. I then camoed the two of us up and we followed the UberKodiak around the commons when our favorite beggar happened to stumble across it and was quickly dispatched. It was cruel but I howled like a banshee following that bear around while camo. A twinked up bard in Singing Steel and Plate mail ran across it and had the sense to run from UberKodi when she realized after 2 or 3 minutes of fighting that she was not making a dent in it.<br />
<br />
One of these days I want to change 20 pp into copper and go stand somewhere away from the banker, the next newbie that comes along for coin, I will hand him a chunk of change and watch them try to figure out how to move while carrying so much copper coin  <br />
<br />
Of course I love to do crazy things with emotes.<br />
<br />
For example /em loots a Sebilite Berserker Cloak. I remember getting Sunmoon with that one  <br />
<br />
or /em has been slain by a Froglok Bok Knight while in the middle of your group with all of the casters sitting and medding.<br />
<br />
[Vailex]<br />
teehee im evil but here goes<br />
<br />
I was in Oasis and well we all know how much people are bastards there. Well i did a similiar /d thing that Rizz did to trick him into a duel. Well he saw the duel text and started taking off. I was playing my wizzy and I happened to have sow atm. He ran to the first pillar which is slightly in the water. Soon as he ran into the water I enstilled his KSing ass and watched him drown while laughing with glee !!!!!<br />
<br />
My friend Agdarr had a brilliant idea with his pets. hes a SK. He too was tired of beggars and at this time (not sure if this still happens) if you go LD and you had a pet the pet would become an NPC. Most newbie beggars didnt check what they were killing so they attacked his pet and got stomped. He placed them in Key locations and brilliantly named them &quot;Newbie Bombs&quot;<br />
<br />
Gotta love that guy<br />
<br />
[Bobcats]<br />
My favorite evil thing to do is to lock people in rooms  <br />
<br />
The best one....I decided to have some fun in NFP and sttod hidden near the bank vault, picking the lock on the door and watching people walk in and back out real quick. One guy didn't back up quite fast enough and ended up stuck in the room. I sat there for a good 5 minutes listening to this guys /yell, /shout, /ooc, /say, and everything else he could think of yelling for someone to let him out of the room. Eventually he started offering money, and when he got up to 50pp to let him out, another 50+ rogue did...don't know if the guy actually had the money, but I was laughing so hard I really didn't care anyway<br />
<br />
[Ryptagudn]<br />
Hmmm...<br />
<br />
I had a beggar harrassing my (now retired) rogue Hoen for some platinum, so I told him I could give him 10pp if he'd meet in West Commons because I was meeting someone there to sell an item. He agreed. In the meantime I got a strength buff and stripped down out of my armor, because 1000 COPPER pieces is awful weighty (especially to a halfling -- but in retrospect probably even more so to a newbie wizard). I made sure he met me out at the 2nd inn (you know, where all the kodiaks and plains cats live) and gave him the 1000 copper. I don't think he knew the /corpse command because I saw him running by several times to get his body.<br />
<br />
Of course, Rypt LOVES it when people run up to him and say &quot;SOW PLZ.&quot; I have a variety of responses now. They vary from the usual &quot;/em hands you a pig&quot; to &quot;Joo want me to SoW your pulls? Me dunn unnerstand&quot; to my (now favorite) &quot;Me don't have da mana but maybe Ganer will SoW joo. Ganer is grumpy so ask him nice.&quot; I've had people stand around and beg my PET for a SoW (now if only shamans would get Voice Graft). Of course, the REALLY evil thing to do is give him Spirit of Scale, which really won't do much good if you aggro a giant.<br />
<br />
I'll go to South Ro and shout &quot;Hey, could somebody get the AC away from my corpse?&quot; That one's always fun.<br />
<br />
I have Befriend Animal, so I'll have to try the &quot;buff the animal trick&quot; some time.<br />
<br />
[Galin]<br />
hmm... I umm.. Tested CH on a ranger??<br />
<br />
No seriously I actually coulndn't ever think of the cruelest things cause well.. I can't remember them all  <br />
<br />
But one that sticks out..<br />
<br />
Unrest I'm lvl 18.. Group was doing fine but the tank had to run to BB and sell cause he was several encumbered.. So he took off. The rest of the group sat and waited and we were just talking.. The Necro decided that he would go out and pull and demanded that Galin heal him... Well... The War-Cleric at the time did not like being told to do things and he warned the necro along with the rest of the party not to go out and pull.. But the poor little necro went out and pulled.. Well I invised the rest of the party to undead and when he brought incoming we all sat there and waved goodbye to him as he demanded heals.. Not to long after that we all decided that it would be a great time to head back to neriak to sell and laughed are arses off..<br />
<br />
[Samani]<br />
Galin you wouldn't heal or couldn't?? What Rizz negleted to say about that animal charm thing is the fact that I also gave him resist EVERYTHING (cold/fire/poison/desease/magic) so it was pretty much the Kodiak from hell. I wish clerics could charm because I don't think Rizz or myself have EVER laughed that hard before or since that night. I've also been known to fear SG into the docks for accuracy in Oasis. You all secretly thank me for that one. /shout Need healz at the dock /shout Can I get sow at the dock? /shout Need cure disease at the dock! /shout Can someone buff me at the docks? so on and so forth. Oh btw I atone the SG right after fear to make sure he agro's on something other than me<br />
<br />
[Bemidian]<br />
My son Harryfooty and I were around level 20 playing in Unrest. Now you know all the stupid death beetles that aggro on everything once you start fighting. So here we are ghouls and stuff out of the house to the front yard. Well this Dwarf Warrior comes up several times asking for heals (he is soloing) a couple of times. Please heal me, puleeeeeaaaase!. So all right I heal him twice. Then while we are fighting the undead crud, he starts yelling MY BEATLE! because we were killing off the 3 or 4 that aggroed us and I guess he thought they were all his. So this kept happening about another 3 or 4 times. MY BEATLE. MY BEATLE. We of course we said take a chill pill, etc etc. Well about 5 min later while I am medding after a fight, he runs over and says HEAL ME! I get up, see him with about 4 death beetles on him, he is low on health, and both of us say at the same time YOUR BEATLE! He looked so peaceful there lying on the ground with all of his beatles around him. <br />
<br />
[Sinda]<br />
I generally don't do mean things to anyone in the game because well, it takes all types.. But one time in Howling Stones I was grouped with a rather aggrivating person who simply couldn't or wouldn't listen to instructions. Once this person died my first thought and strongest desire was to drag the corpse over one of the false carpets and then give them their res.<br />
<br />
Granted I didn't, but jeez did I want to. I laughed for a long time anyway as I thought about it.<br />
<br />
You have been slain by a Sepulcher Skeleton!<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
You have entered Firiona Vie<br />
&gt; Incoming res..<br />
&gt; AnnoyingPerson says to the group, &quot;Ok&quot;<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
You have entered Howling Stones<br />
You are hit for 986 points of damage.<br />
You have fallen to your death.<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
&gt; You say, &quot;Uh..&quot;<br />
<br />
And if the fall didn't kill em', the sepulcher harmtouches would have. =)<br />
<br />
[Atokal]<br />
Haha just found this old thread. <br />
<br />
I was in BB at crossroads when a newb pally came up and asked for help to find her corpse. Yes it was a she. I asked where she had died or what had killed her. She told me she had no idea.<br />
I then suggested that she find a bard or necro to help as running around in BB for days was pointless. She didnt recognize that the Grape armor indicated a level far above her and she said &quot;Bastage I ask for a little help and you say no?&quot;<br />
She actually challenge me to a duel.<br />
I responded that she had better run along before I got upset she continued to send me tells so I got up to walk away when someone shouted that Zarchoomi was up so I ran to Zarchooomi with the little naked Pally still following and hit Zarchoomi once and stood there. <br />
<br />
The pally drew close laughing the whole time hoping I would meet my demise. I quickly accepted her challenge Rooted her and Zarchoomi and stepped back to watch the fun.<br />
<br />
She died and sent me a tell calling me some of the foulest things you can imagine. I replied Hahaha have fun locating two corpses now LOL.<br />
<br />
Laughed till i cried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I, too, despise beggars... I don't mind as much if they ask nice one time then piss off but the ones that follow you poking, telling, jumping, etc...  one followed me up to the top floor of the warriors guild in Cabilis (I was going to Cabilis Forge) so I turned around and jumped off the balcony... bout 120 points to me... he followed.<br />
<br />
Had one at the Cabilis bank, kept begging and inspecting so I jumped into the reservoir and swamp to the center of the bottom (I have 200 swimming and about 110 STA so I can stay down there like 5 minutes).  He followed so I swam to the back of an underwater tunnel that leads under the shaman guild.  Not a wise move for him.<br />
(Next time this happens I'm making a note to have 6000 coppers on me to hand him when we get back there)<br />
<br />
A friend I used to group with extensively would shout in newbie zones like Field of Bone &quot;Hey Cool! You can see how much experience you need to level by typing: ' /quietexp off ' ... Hilarious to see almost an entire zone go LD at once.  a gm eventually asked him rather sternly to stop that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm - never heard of /quietexpoff<br />
<br />
What does it do?<br />
<br />
Edit:  NM, it's just /q  i guess -- didn't know that /q with anything behind it would work, but now I see - me slow sometimes :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anon_Idiot_01 shouts, 'Hey, did y'all know that if you type /ex, it shows you how much Exp you have?' <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah...I fell for it.<br />
<br />
Bastard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have one for ya<br />
<br />
I had a Mule named Honeybugger that I created to get... I think Honey Mead for the Moggok quest (back when they cost 800pp a pop:) )  well I turned in my PK book so I would have the cool red name.  well I had some realy ass bugging me while I was in Rivervale so I challanged him to a duel and sat next to the bank gaurds.  He was like level 20 and I was level 2.  he accepted the deul and took a swing.  Well every Gaurd in Rivervale I think beat him to a bloody pulp.  I died after the first swing but I didn't care I didn't lose and EXP :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL Grinny!  <br />
My husband did that to me once!!  He was playing a lvl 10 alt and Grayeyes must have been in her 40's.  He challenged me to a duel, casted Divine Aura and told me to swing.  <br />
Lucky I'm a bard and those short legged guards couldn't catch me  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will admit I stoll this one but it was funny.<br />
<br />
I was heading to NFP dont remember why but par for the course someone was begging at the West gate.  Well this begger would not stop and was shouting in zone for coin or equipment.<br />
<br />
So I told him I would give him some money but I had to go to the bank first and would be right back.  I bnd at the gates ran to the bank got 10pp and droped it in my Copper spot, the gated back.  Gave the begger what is now 10000cp, he said WOW thanks.  I said you are welcome and ran off, a couple of seconds later he sends me a tell asking what I did to him he cant move.  I told him that was because he now had to much money.<br />
<br />
And that if he gave some of it away to others to lighten his load he would be ok, this way not only did he get the coin he asked for but also learned the joy of giving...I then added newbie begger to my elit ignore list....heheh</div></div><hr />
