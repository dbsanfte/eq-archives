<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay I just have a question about this because it seems to not go up with all my other skills. I usually though skills were (Level *5) + 5, except for defense and offense which I belive is just (level * 5). Well I am a 29 troll shaman and well things don't seem to look like that. My piercing is at 120 and it's not moving. Is there a different way to calculate my piercing skills or something? I have been meeleing for like 2 hours and not a single skill up. My str is at 173 so I thought it would go up but does int effect it too? My wis is at 138, but I thought that wis had nothign to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the priest classes it's Level x 4 + 4 for our weapon skills, so you don't get max 200 until 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">increasing Dex helps you learn weapon skills faster btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so does increasing int</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't worry about it. Our melee sucks anyhow. <br />
<br />
Can't remember who said it, but it cracked me up all day long and the guys at work laughed too. <br />
<br />
Can't remember who Shammy here - &quot;This is what our melee looks like: whiff, whiff, whiff, 84, whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff 23 whiff whiff whiff whiff 2 whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff 34 whiff whif&quot;<br />
<br />
Or somethign to that effect. <br />
<br />
With 1400 attk, beastlord and ranger buffs, FA, you name it, ...I cant stab for beans. <br />
<br />
Want dmg? Load Blood or Bane, and sic a hasted mutt on em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes, our melee sucks, is to low skill cap, and now if you are in a group with 2 clerics in the 50s one will melee and one will heal.  then they switch when they get bored.<br />
<br />
at 52 my pierce and 2blunt is maxed at 200<br />
<br />
i got a hammer of rage as soon as i could for the skill ups, due to it being a great ratio.<br />
<br />
the min i could started the Barb Spiritist hammer, with inproved damII item it procs for over 300.<br />
<br />
bought the Blight for work in Kedge.  they resist cold in Kedge but not scourge.<br />
<br />
currently use the REIF or the Hammer of Spiritcalling.  <br />
<br />
if you tank with the dog, you have to have a weapon.  if you root/dot look at some wis/mana equipment (i have it for the times i have to play cleric too) like the no drop pestle from the grimling chieftain.<br />
<br />
i would love to see shaman go away from Necros and closer to Rangers when it comes to our melee skills.  at least at the higher lvls, it is embarrassing to be out melee'd by a cleric with a summoned weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman melee does NOT suck at his level.  I used an REIF to deal substantial damage until around level 50.  It rivalled the JBB for straight out DPS until then, and stuns didn't cost you a whole 8 seconds worth of DPS.  It all depends on whether you like to root-rot or tank IN TEH FACE.<br />
<br />
The 'whiff whiff' quote was for post-60 shaman, and I certainly agree there.  I recently picked up a couple of primal weaps in ST, and with Avatar and a good weapon, I can do maybe 10 DPS on most of the mobs I fight these days.  I'm better off canning and nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">a note on dex and agi and raising melee skills:<br />
<br />
My understanding is a higher dex increases the chance you have for an attempt at a skillup, and agi increases the chance of actually getting a skillup...so they are both important for melee skillups.<br />
<br />
I haven't done parsing to substantiate this, but I've read numerous posts to this affect on the SteelWarrior site, and this seems to be the case for my 54 warrior.  (ex:  without dex/agi buffs I got about 3 skillups in 5 hours...with about 50 or 60 added to dex and agi I got about 15 skillups  in 5 hours)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;so does increasing int&quot;<br />
<br />
Landragon, what's your source on this?  I was under the impression that Int/Wis only helped mental (tradeskills) and not physical skills.</div></div><hr />
