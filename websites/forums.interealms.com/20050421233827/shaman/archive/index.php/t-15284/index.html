<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gherrent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This may have been asked before, in fact im sure it has, but where would be a good place OTHER THAN PALADUL to get from lvl 16 to lvl 25 or so?<br />
<br />
ive leveled many of my characters from lvl 3 to 25 in paladul, but with this recent character ive begun to notice more and more immature twinked out punks that dont know how to play their class, taking more spawns then they can even handle alone and leaving nothing for me to kill, so, even with the godlike experience in this zone, ive decided to try and find some place else.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone have any suggestions? ive tried EK, and didnt have much luck there. any help is greatly appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Colbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might try Lake of Ill Omen, it should last til level 30. Also, aviaks in Lake Rathe (if you can take the hits, start with the aviak at the diving board and work your way up) last til level 20/21, then move to South Karana aviaks til around 24/25, then group at the spires. Being evil, you could also kill treants in South Karana (they are good coin at that level) around 27 with a partner. Highhold Keep is good, also - kill orcs in a group to get faction up for evil races (also good xp). I wouldn't try EK, myself, til around level 20 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best place for 8 to 30 is DOUBTLESS Unrest. Undeads dont run, so make some damageshield potions and let em hit you til they die. Since they hit like babys you can pull up to 6 mobs and watch ur exp fly. took me 2 days from 8 to 30 in there with a druid healing me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm to level 30 theres tons of alternatives to PC. LOiO is doable, but not great exp. I would say upper guk spiders in your low 20s, then at 24 I'd suggest MS (no loot, fast pulling smarter groups that PC), or crocs in upper guk (pull to shore in AC room), possibly the warrens. from 27 onward to 34 I much enjoyed solA. no crowds, great loot and plenty of room.<br />
<br />
just some ideas-</div></div><hr />
