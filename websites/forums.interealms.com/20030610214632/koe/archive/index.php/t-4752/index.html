<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to Dexail and Canelek for your acts of kindness the other day.<br />
<br />
Dex walks up to me and says i got my epic and dont need this anymore and hands me a FBSS :)  WOW<br />
<br />
needless to say i was pretty pumped!!<br />
<br />
then later the same day while grouping with Cane he walks up to me and starts looking at me.. &quot; im think oops what did i do??&quot; so i handed him his sword back that he let me swing a few times thinking he wanted it back...<br />
<br />
then i see scoll through guild chat ..GRATS to redtree on SBS (sarnak battle sheild)<br />
<br />
I was shocked - - I tried to make him keep it, but he wasnt giving!!<br />
<br />
<br />
So redtree got PL'ed and tweaked by his friends over the hoildays... lol<br />
<br />
Just want to thank you guys again :D :D</div></div><hr />
