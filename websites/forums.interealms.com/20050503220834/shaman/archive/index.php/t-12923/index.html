<br />
** Tip of the Day ** <br />
<br />
When you first log in you will be presented with a Tip of the Day window. We've added this window to provide helpful insight to new players, and perhaps a few tips for experienced players as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Gameplay ** <br />
<br />
- Any character 10th level and under that attempts to attack a 'red' /con NPC will receive a warning about the danger of such an action. <br />
- Low level characters now memorize and scribe spells much faster. <br />
- Guards in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport should be less likely to run through the newbie zone destroying the wildlife <br />
- Improved the respawn rate for monsters in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport. In these zones they were respawning less frequently than in all other newbie zones. <br />
- Added food and bag merchants to the newbie yards of Steamfont, East Freeport, West Freeport, Butcherblock and Nektulos. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing damage shields to assign the credit for their damage to the wrong person. <br />
- Fixed a bug that caused a short delay in the hit point updates from healing spells. <br />
- Removed Beastlords from the list of classes that can use Strength of Stone. They were never intended to get it, as they have a better spell of the same type at the same level (Furious strength). <br />
- Pets will no longer disappear when the pet owner casts a cancel magic type spell on the PC that the pet is attacking. <br />
- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC controlled pets (in non-PvP situations). <br />
- Talisman of Alacrity now works on the group and not just the caster. It also has the proper icons now. <br />
- Modified the text messages on many stun spells to prevent some confusion with their effect on stun immune mobs. The message has been changed from &quot;You have been stunned&quot; to &quot;You are struck by a sudden force.&quot; <br />
- Torment of Argli no longer overwrites Torment of Scio. <br />
- The Lich series no longer conflicts with other DoT effects. This affects Dark Pact, Allure of Death, Call of Bones, Lich, Demi Lich, Arch Lich, Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, Ancient: Master of Death and Seduction of Saryrn. <br />
- The Flame Lick line of spells no longer overwrites hit point buffs such as Valor and Skin like diamond. This affects Flame Lick, Immolation, Breath of Ro and Immolation of Ro. <br />
- Changed the name of the druid spell Fury of Ro to Immolation of Ro to avoid confusion with the focus effect Fury of Ro. <br />
- Changed the icon for Kragg's Mending to a heart icon to match other Heal spells. <br />
- Froglok illusion now changes the character's perspective to the proper height. <br />
- Night's Dark Terror has regained its Scarecrow illusion. <br />
- Added sounds to several spells that were lacking them. <br />
- The cost of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Acrylia Caverns, Hollowshade Moor and Grimling Forest have been revamped. We have updated the content in these zones to more accurately represent their design intentions and to address concerns voiced by players. <br />
- If you have had an issue with your Plane of Earth B keys, please speak with Muzzrap again and he should be able to straighten things out. Please make sure that you have the raid group that you want to get keyed set up and by your side when you do this. <br />
- The Trial of Fire event will be much less likely to damage people not actually in the trial. <br />
- We've made a pretty extensive pathing update to the Lake of Ill Omen and Beholder, along with several fixes to specific cases in several zones. <br />
- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in Plane of Air. <br />
- The spires in the Dreadlands are once again sending folks to Luclin. <br />
- Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again. Beware. <br />
<br />
<br />
** The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk ** <br />
<br />
Do not destroy the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk! Due to the revamp of the Acrylia Caverns, this key will no longer serve its original purpose. We do understand the difficulty of obtaining this key, and we don't want to see that effort lost. We will be looking into a way to allow this key to retain its value, so don't destroy it. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Items with recommended levels now display any reduced AC component value in red. <br />
- Changed the usable race to Froglok on several of the Shin initiates armor quest intermediate pieces. <br />
- Giant Field Rat whiskers are about twice as common as they were. <br />
- The Ivory Hilted Cleaver can now be used in the secondary slot (for those that can dual-wield). <br />
- The Ornate Broadsword is no longer listed as usable in the secondary slot, since it is Paladin only and can't actually be used there. <br />
- These items can no longer be worn by Frogloks (they were never intended for use by Frogloks): Fright Forged Helm, Mundane Helm, Mundane Shield, Mundane Mask, Dread Forged Shield and Terror Forged Mask <br />
- Murph's Minin' Pick no longer lists Clerics as a class that can use it, since they could not. <br />
- Bone Bladed Scimitar no longer lists Beastlords as a class that can use it. <br />
- Cracked Bone Shinguards now have a visible graphic when worn. <br />
- Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now &quot;worn&quot; rather than &quot;combat&quot;. <br />
- Stone Etched Mace now displays +135 mana instead of 1135 mana <br />
- Extended Affliction III now works on spells with a 30 second duration (lowered from 36 seconds), so it now functions with Sermon of Penitence. <br />
- Fireworks have casting sounds and Gnomish fireworks will no longer cause zones to crash. <br />
- Compasses once again display the direction you are facing when you right-click and hold. <br />
- The Hammer of Exoneration can now be used by Erudites and Dark Elves. <br />
<br />
<br />
** NPCs ** <br />
<br />
- Half-Elf bandits are no longer treated as merchants (so they will now leave corpses). <br />
- A Feral Amalgam is now a plant. <br />
- Now only one Natasha Whitewaters can exist at a time. <br />
- Bloodmaw is a little more attentive to his surroundings. <br />
- Pets no longer attack Tylis Newleaf when he teleports your group. <br />
- Corrected a bug with AE rampage that caused it to not attack everyone it should. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest. <br />
- The Planar Projections for Bertoxxulous and Terris should no longer be able spawn in a location where they can't be reached. <br />
- Fixed several issues with the 8th cudgel quest. <br />
- Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement Abilities ** <br />
<br />
- Made the Servant of Ro AA pet much more potent. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Hit points gained from items are now display with the right value, and should help to prevent a few deaths from Cannibalization <br />
- Bind Wounds no longer uses up a bandage for attempting to use the skill when it is not available. <br />
- Fixed a bug that was not allowing players to link to containers unless they linked to something else first. <br />
- /book with no arguments again closes the spellbook as it should. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note: We have also made several spelling and grammar corrections and fixed a door here and there. <br />
<br />

Anyone know anything about the changes in Acrylia?  Is there any high level content left there?  It looks like they removed the ridiculous key quest for the &quot;uber&quot; part of the zone, and made it accessible without a key.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any information about what is available there and whether it will be worth exploring.</div></div><hr />

Great, I finally get to a level where I can make some loot and gain exp, and Sony takes it away from me.  It's not like it was easy in there, either.  As a new 58 shaman, I had to be on my toes to take down the mobs in here.  It was fun, too!  <br />
<br />
Thanks Sony... Get bent.<br />

Only someone from an 00ber guild would say something like that. What about the few Shaman who just want to make some plat?...yes lets impede the little guys game.<br />
<br />
Besides, those PoGs are not gonna stop the two or three who want to zone in. Overall I think it was a dumb regression, PoG was always dead to begin with; now it will be even more so.<br />

<br />
You know... you may be right.  But, and I'm not conceding anything here, why was that a bug?  If you define the old Planes as &quot;raid&quot; zones, does this really prevent a single group of 61+ characters from coming in and still using it as a loot zone?  Granted, it's not a break zone like Hate/Fear (I could understand it if they did that... the whorl just sits there like a lump to invis), but it's not like my lowly 58 could walk in and clear the zone.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I know I'm a bit on the whiner side of things right now.  It's just bitter irony that the day that I can finally go there for some really gratifying solo fun, with the added bonus of getting some items that might refill my bank with plat, it becomes a &quot;no-Moniv&quot; zone.  <br />

It seems everyone is too obsessed with the planes and outdoor zones.  I would be interested in knowing if they changed the zone levels or xp bonus.  I've always wanted to explore around in there but the mobs have always been too high for a single adventurer.  If anyone gets any new info on this zone, let me know.<br />

There are a hell of alot more people who do loot side than raid side, how often do you zone into PoG and see a raid force and how often do you zone into PoG seeing a group or two hunting on loot side?<br />
<br />
This change benefits the high end minority far more than it does the majority. You guys actually want to clear the loot side trash to move to the raid mobs?<br />
<br />
Class envy? ...Perhaps. But perhaps its simply frustration at losing one of the few zones available for earning plat off of mobs that aren't green.<br />
<br />
Somtimes those who admin this game don't make it clear as to what are &quot;bugs&quot; and what are &quot;features.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yea. I'm ticked all to hell about this. PoG was one of the few FUN zones left. By no means was it a cake walk, getting a res is damn near impossible up there, and the reward was great. I had a lot of fun up thre, even if it did takle me 6 minutes to solo a mob :P<br />
<br />
I'm going to feedback when I get in game today. I suggest others do the same. My guess is 1 or 2 raiding guilds bitched and whined like crazy. If hundreds of us bitch and whine now, we might be able to get it changed back.</div></div><hr />

Sure I do, my question is simply the percentage of players this change/bugfix will benefit vs those it will hinder.<br />

The change was a very ***BAD*** one in my opinion. The zone is empty all the time ...very rarely does anyone raid the zone anymore. It was being used by a group of 1 or 2 now it will be a hassle and not really worth it unless you are killing Tunare. Seems to me there are ALOT more things that are worthwhile fixing.<br />
<br />
Funny how I haven't been back there since November or so ...looks like I won't be going back for a long time now ...a waste of a zone ...all I went there for was to rez Kongming and he has said several times that he doesn't need the money vs time there anymore.<br />

Is Kael just a raid zone cause it has some boss mobs?  I think your answer would be yes, but alot of people go there for faction or armor or (!) exp.  Raiding guilds have fun their way, other smaller guilds or groups or soloers have fun their way.  You don't gotta like it, but you should acknowledge and respect it.<br />
<br />
And yes, the protecters have been bugged for awhile, and most people were happy about it and not because they felt they were exploiting something.  It opened another zone with diverse mobs and decent loot to alot more people because the lack of the reoccuring 20 min annoyance.  <br />

More zones available to more people = G O O D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't going to change groups of 4+ killing in PoG, it's just an annoyance that will slow them down and detract from the fun (note: tedium != challenge).  Now instead of 2 boxing there by myself, I will be forced to bring my friend w/ his chanter/monk to CC the stupid PoGs.  End result- half the zone will be dead at an unknown time.  Now if only I were on your server so I could time this on a scheduled Tunare raid for your guild, you elitist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">- Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again. Beware <br />
<br />
I've raided PoG dozens of times before and since the Protectors were denutted.   Without protectors &quot;protecting&quot; PoG this was just another outdoor zone.   Now it's back to being a raid designed zone which (history wise) was the objective for early God planes.   <br />
<br />
Dev's have a revamp for Hate (coming to regular servers) and certainly Fear, PoM, and PoA revamps are in the works.    Quite frankly, I hope PoG has a major revamp as well.   It has been sad to see these zones become &quot;Farms&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sure I do, my question is simply the percentage of players this change/bugfix will benefit vs those it will hinder.<br />
<br />
I don't know about other servers, but on BB there are still several guilds who kill Tunare, and theres about 5 or 6 regular PoG farming soloers and a couple of regular groups who go for pp.  Theres still moderately frequent small scale multigroup raids that go there for armor (Usually 1 or 2 a week), and of course theres the weekly ~4 to 6 group raid that takes out Tunare and whatever else is up at the time.<br />
<br />
Dealing with PoGs will be challenging for the soloers, some will be able to do it, most probably won't bother.  If a farming group can't take care of 2 pogs these days then they don't deserve to be in PoG imho.<br />
<br />
This helps to give PoG back to the people its intended for, those there for armor or fully blown Tunare raids.  The original planes were never intended to be plat farms imho, just EQ's progression with expansions made it that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Sony changed the PoG's a while back to NOT have zone wide aggro. It was right in the patch message. If I were more inclined I would find the message.<br />
<br />
So it was in fact a &quot;feature&quot; and not a &quot;bug&quot; as described by other posters.<br />
<br />
If this is in fact true, can you really blame those of us who did the loot side for being frustrated? <br />
<br />
Consistency is the problem, or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
The exp argument is moot, nobody went to PoG for exp, they went for loot and gear. PoG is also used by guilds of lesser power to equip their members with needed gear upgrades to compensate for Kael Arena's sorry drop rate and the force required for these guilds to raid there. In fact, I am still wearing my Spirit Weaver's Vambraces I looted from a PoG loot side mob.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how you can fall back on the argument of the zones &quot;original intent&quot; when The Vision (the epitome of &quot;original intent&quot;) has long since been buried, especially with the implentation of things like port stones.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think its a way to justify the mentality that PoG is a &quot;raid only&quot; zone, because I highly doubt any of you want to go back to using boats for travel.</div></div><hr />

. If a farming group can't take care of 2 pogs these days then they don't deserve to be in PoG imho.<br />

But, then again since PoG was actually challenging for some of us, I suppose we didn't have any business being there /boggle. Amazing...<br />
<br />
As far as sharing goes, I can speak for those I go to PoG with and we never went on the weekends because that is when guilds raid there and often reserve the plane. We don't even check to see if its reserved, we just have a &quot;no PoG on the weekends&quot; rule out of courtesy to those who raid there.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the courtesy doesn't seem to be reciprocated, and is quite telling IMHO.</div></div><hr />

The true test is whether this results in more use or less use of the zone by players.  I think it is very clear there will be a lot less use of what has become a popular zone.  Big mistake.  To fix it, why doesnt Sony just repopulate an underused existing zone with PoG yard trash type mobs?  It was a great risk vs. reward challenge to hunt there.</div></div><hr />

Elitest, rotfl! Seems to me, sir, that you are the one wanting teh phat lewtz to yourself in this senario. Egads, the horror, having to share. <br />
I play at odd hours and hate LFG, so 2 boxing is what I do.  I play w/ rl friends whenever possible and occasionally guildies, almost never w/ pickups- I am not now, nor ever, going to try and get a real group together to hit PoG.  Instead, I will continue to do what I do now- go there myself when sk is high enough to tank 2 PoGs at once when my friend isn't online, or go there w/ him when he is.  This has not changed.  As for the phat lewtz, which of us is a Prophet in a high end guild, hmmmmm?  And yes, anytime you think that a zone should be reserved for 1% of the player population (e.g. 90% of PoP zones) you, sir, are an elitist.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to see some of the cross agro incidents that will likely happen whilst the chimp squad try to solo here for the first night, I'll be watching with my track bot =) <br />
More Prophet elitism.  I'm quaking in my boots at your l33t skillz- taking care of not one, but TWO L55 mobs! Holy crap! You'd have to be in Fires of Heaven or Afterlife to do that!<br />
<br />
Funny thing was, just last week we zoned into PoG and only the PoGs were up- we had druid split, then beat them down in no time.  This adds to the tedium of PoG and restricts soloing/duoing, but will not slow farming at all.  Mudflation saw to that and this change, while sucking, won't change that one bit.<br />

Why is having loot/gear groups deal with PoG adds a no-brainer but having raid forces deal with trash adds unacceptable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly what the pog change will do since I'd never really raided there before the protectors got modified, Something about them aggroing from anywhere in the zone ? Do they transfer aggro to other mobs on the way to get you, resulting in a train ? Do they allways show up all at the same time ? How many are there total ? Does this mean you zone in and get immediately jumped ? <br />
<br />
Personally I did enjoy going there to hunt since it was like any other outside zone only with blue con mobs and decent cash drops. It did strike me as odd that a god's plane was so easy to solo or duo.... I know a 52 necro that successfully soloed there on occasion.... At any rate on xegony the zone was perma farmed, don't bother going unless it's 5 minutes after a server repop or you're wasting your time... Basically Rath mountains without a respawn. Planning a raid there was next to useless for lower level groups/guilds. Is the change good or bad ? Jury is still out untill I see what use people make of the zone now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About the cudgel, I've done the 8th but can't really remember anything that was particularly annoying or problematic while doing it...Was a while ago though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Hollowshade.... They probably just made it so the wars can't be bugged anymore. Personally I just wish they'd do for wailing substance what they did with screaming substance.... Allow the higher level bears in tenebrous to drop it as well.... Sitting around waiting for grimy owlbears to respawn on the off chance they might cough one up or bottomfeeding in a 10 - 20 zone for materials just blows when there's similar, tougher mobs in other zones that could serve the same purpose.<br />

I could be wrong, wouldn't be the first time.  But when was this patch message?<br />

As for the change in general, the zone was built with the PoGs considered in the difficulty of the zone.  Obviously having them absent (basically) made the zone easy, as the posts about the change indicate.<br />

Now, several people are annoyed because:<br />
<br />
A)  VI eliminated their favorite solo spot<br />
B)  The change adds tedium for everyone (raiders, groupers and soloers unite!)<br />
<br />
To group A) I say &quot;:p&quot;.  There's millions of solo spots out there with good loot, and if I had to pick one of them for Verant to nerf the first place I'd pick would be an old school plane that's been made too easy by SoL+PoP.<br />
<br />
That being said, I still dislike the change because of B).  Quite frankly this game is tedious enough, and I don't think it needs more tedium.  However, I have a solution!<br />
<br />
....<br />
....<br />
....<br />
<br />
Add a graveyard to PoG!  It is a plane after all, and adding a graveyard would reduce the tedium of CRs in the plane.  Since I personally think CR tedium &gt; tedium of having to kill an extra mob or two, at least for the people who I feel the zone is designed for (raids, well-prepared groups or especially tenacious soloers), I think this would ultimately result in less tedium overall (good!) while still keeping the zone the kind of place you typically need other people's help for (like most planes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I leveled a froglok Wizard from 1-52 in about three weeks (name Gikkis on ayonae ro, basically i just quadding spirocs once i was high enough, quadding is cheating essentially heh..) this new wizard being my highest level character in EQ made me excited to see some of the high level stuff. A guildie invited me to go and fight with him and 2 others in the Plane of Growth. I was shocked, I thought we needed multiple groups, but i went eager. After a few hours of killing some tough mobs, I seen the gems and armor that dropped were awesome! <br />
<br />
Well i got bored of my wizard, he just does sit/nuke/sit/nuke/sit/nuke etc.. and leveling by quading gave no real sense of accomplishment, i basically cheated my way through the levels. So, I went and created another Shaman (I have several on diff servers. This one is named Kreskk, who is currently level 38). I was looking forward to getting to level 50 and getting some of that great armor that dropped in PoG. Everything in the bazzar costs way to much.. I dont know how people can afford things that are 20k etc.. I think the most pp ive had total is like 2k or 3k. My wizard was level 52 with a flowing black robe, cloth sandals, jin initiae leggings, a blue diamond bracelet, black tome with silver runes, etc.. <br />
<br />
Plane of growth had armor that I was going to actually be able to get and it was good armor too. It was armor with great stats that i didnt have to camp some god or kunark dragon to get. I just had to kill some wolves with a few friends.. I wouldent have to try and save up 10k for one item.. just level high enough to fight in PoG. Well im very dissapointed that apparently I will not be able to do this. I wish they made this change in another month or so, then i could have already made off with my shaman PoG armors.</div></div><hr />

They generally make everything a pain in the ass.  There are one or two (iirc it's random) mobs that have zonewide aggro - anyone that comes in KoS they are on like white on rice. Also, it's been a while but I think theyre unrootable, unslowable, unmezzable etc.  The only way to get rid of them is killing them...and then you get to do it all again in 20 min.<br />

So it takes the avg shammy about 6 min to solo one mob there (what I've read...havn't actually timed myself)..so given a little downtime/search time, you get to do 2 *maybe* 3 mobs before the PoGs are back on you, disrupting your peacefull little solo stint.<br />
<br />
So...basically they have added the stress and irritation of one or two unslowable ebil ebil mobs come after you in the zone no matter where you are...making it just pointless to solo there.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cent :p<br />

<br />
Last I checked Tunare wasn't a casual guild hit, at least not on my server.  <br />
<br />
The PoG armor is actually an upgrade for me and saves me the even more frustrating Kael arena/ToV camps after which you still need gems/faction.  I get a ton more satisfaction out of killing and looting my own gear than just bazaar camping it, but hey, it's the SOE way.  Is there any doubt that this was inspired by the Tunare farmers bitching that the spawns were killed at odd times inconveniencing them, the poor souls?<br />
<br />
Oh well, I think this will still be doable.  Just another SOE inspired PITA due to people having fun- sorry SOE, I'm so sorry- I'll go &quot;raid&quot; in those inspiring PoP planes like PoN, PoD, etc... Those were soooooooooo challenging after all...<br />

&quot;As for the change in general, the zone was built with the PoGs considered in the difficulty of the zone. Obviously having them absent (basically) made the zone easy, as the posts about the change indicate.&quot;<br />
<br />
And what value does this hold? So a 2 year old zone was designed in a specific way so the design is still a good idea today?<br />
<br />
If you bothered to read what people are actually saying you would see that many many people appear to have been enjoying an otherwise worthless zone. So now you decide that the zone should only be for raids of level 65s that farm a god (probably to twink their 2nd or 3rd character). How brilliant is that?<br />
<br />
If you are trying annoy people - except your oh so precious uber guilds - enough so that they eventually stop playing then you are doing fine.<br />
<br />
(and even the uber guilds dont seem to happy right now)<br />
<br />
PS. I dont know why I even bother to write this because I am pretty sure that Absor wont be back here for atleast a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Try breaking it solo at a full pop with a see invis whool sebazy. It adds a new level of difficulty. The zone wide aggro is stupid. Noone raids PoG except for tunare. By making the zone raid only you are ensuring it goes unused except for maybe once a week. Its a stupid change.<br />
<br />
Been there, done that, want one of the spare t-shirts?  When Tunare was a prime target for us (Before pog farming got popular), I frequently started breaking the plane myself, usually an hour or so before others came along.<br />
<br />
As for no one raiding pog, I disagree, there are still a couple of armor runs a week on BB (Multigroup armor runs).<br />
<br />
Without the zonewide agro protectors, pog was little more than DL with a little more risk occasionally, naff xp but massive cash drops/respectable armor.  The RvR was horrifically out of line, even beyond the stupidity of UP Elysian's for druids imho.  If you cannot see that, I can recommend you get some glasses sir =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in other words, it was like every other gimp PoP zone but substituting cash/velious armor instead of ridiculous ZEM xp?  I love people putting down a 2+ year old zone as &quot;too easy&quot; because it's a plane- I really, really hope you haven't been xping in PoP then.  After all, those are planes too and we wouldn't want xping to be too easy, right? Right?<br />
<br />
*crickets chirp*<br />
<br />
I checked out PoG last night again post-change.  Took roughly 2 min for pogs to get to us on west wall after we dealt w/ see invis whorl.  You know I actually wouldn't be half as pissed about this if the pogs actually had a chance to drop armor/loot instead of just being an annoying road bump to slow down the non-uber-Tunare farmers who were enjoying an otherwise deserted zone.  And yes, there was no one else in the zone now at prime time where there used to be people quite frequently. On the upside, I checked KC and there were 40+ people, so it looks like it had the intended result. :P<br />

Wrong, This is FANTASTIC for the mid 50's smallish guilds that have outgrown Hate/Fear, but can't quite tackle ToV yet.  PoG is heaven for them, its a training ground for ToV with a really nice progression in difficulty, THESE are the people who are getting there zone back, I'm fairly sure we won't see Triton/FoH/AL monopolising the fatplats in PoG due to this.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to be uber to kill Tunare, she really isnt that hard you know.  And some of the loot is just downright incredible for the toughness of the encounter, the challenge is clearing the plane.<br />

Edit:  Regarding Hollowshade &amp; Shadow scream:  I truly wish that shrieking/wailing substances dropped off of more of the critters, and hope that the bears and wolves in Hollowshade now drop it without having to win the south camp first.  <br />
<br />
Ceno's sour grapes about making it easier for folks cannot in any way compare with my sheer anger at having the trivial levels drastically reduced just as I was finally able to afford to smith again.  Heck, they can make these common drops and shadow scream would still be a royal pain.<br />

Yes, I have noticed the difference between PoG mobs and PoP mobs- PoG mobs actually summon and have high resists.  In addition, PoG mobs are frequently casters unlike the vast majority of PoP melee yard trash that people are killing like mad.<br />
<br />
Having 2 boxed both places w/ a monk tanking (yes, a gimp, nerfed to bits monk) I found PoG more challenging from an aggro standpoint alone due to the summoning, casting and insane Velious era mob resists.  In tier one, I can go full burn and if the mob gets pissed, root and back off and nuke/dot to my heart's content.  Fights actually take less time in PoP because aggro control is such a non-issue, at least in tier one (yes I know higher tier mobs change this, but there's no tier 2+ PoG equivalent).<br />
<br />
BTW, big congrats to the shaman who went back and solo'd post PoG change- I'd love to give that a shot when I get my epic. :)<br />

Wisps, Pumas, Thriftlings (because of the density of them) and to a lesser extent treants are balanced risk vs reward, they actually hit moderately hard, tend to have resists worth debuffing etc and are a hassle to pull/kill.  However, your forgetting Gale wolves, Rolling planes steeds, sanguine kodiaks, Spirit flux wolves, Glade stalkers, Feral Amalgams, Sylvians, and to a lesser extent Cullers/entoilers.  These are all mobs which were stupid Risk vs reward, the only risk was being daft and overpulling.

Okay... so PoG has great plat loot and piss poor xp for the risk v. reward.  PoP has sick xp and crap loot for the risk v. reward.  This is unbalanced how exactly?  I keep wondernig when PoV, PoS and BoT are going to come down because the xp there is ridiculous for the risk- THAT is why PoP needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Same logic, makes as much sense in both cases.<br />

Great plat w/ low-moderate risk for the 55+ player = BAAAAAAAAAAD.<br />
Great xp w/ low-moderate risk for the 55+ player = GOOOOOOOOOOD.<br />

Sebazy, I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one.  <br />
<br />
I find it interesting that you bring up BoT as an example of risk vs. reward when this was, in fact, the zone farmed to death by CoD enchanters w/ little risk v. reward making hundreds of thousands of plat prior to the veritable deluge of nerfs on charming in general and BoT in particular.  Belittling PoG as &quot;Dreadlands&quot; is rather humorous considering that the vast majority of xp zones in PoP are little more than a higher level version of Dreadlands themselves- endless single pulls requiring little skill but yielding incredible xp (and in some cases, such as BoT, loot as well).<br />
<br />
As someone who will never see the higher tier planes, never wear elemental, probably never wear SS and most likely never scribe any L59/60 shaman spell unless the gwurms give them up, I am hoping that someday w/ a 2 boxed SK I can return to PoG and give it a shot once more.<br />
<br />
I hate nerfs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">i agree with izmalis - sebazy, please don't even bring up risk vs. reward in everquest in its current state, this game is so unbalanced its ridiculous.  think about it, sure they nerfed charm, but only after the chanters/mages/necros that were already top-end before PoP came out had AMPLE time to farm BoT/Tactics minis for runes and ornate which they can sell for whatever they want becase they have the spawn times down to within 5 minutes of mob popping, thus having a stranglehold on the market like ****ing LexCorp.  same old thing, the rich get richer while the poorer get so frustrated because there is absolutely no feasible way to get money OR go out with a single group to get the items/spells they NEED to survive against PoP raid mobs, so they just quit playing altogether or go on playerauction and buy a few hundred thousand plat.<br />
<br />
the argument that PoG is a raid zone and shouldnt be farmed for plat - this one makes me laugh.  wheres the risk vs. reward here? the only risk is that people will get so god damn bored with killing 5000000 trash mobs that they will all log and your guild officers will end up 6 boxing tunare.  a guild that has the levels/equipment/member dedication to clear PoG and kill Tunare would be MUCH better off spending raiding time in other zones on other targets.<br />
<br />
the only reason i can think that sony would change an obsolete zone from and old expansion is either:<br />
<br />
a) they were bored<br />
b) some guild complained that the 1 necro/shaman soloing up there was <br />
    screwing up their beloved weekend Tunare raid<br />
c) they are trying to piss people off so they can drum up support for a <br />
    game where everyone has to start from the beginning again (EQ2 <br />
