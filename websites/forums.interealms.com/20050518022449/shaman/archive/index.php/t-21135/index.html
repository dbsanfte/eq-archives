<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, please no &quot;search is your friend&quot; responses.  I have a 58 Shammy main.  I have inherited a 65 Druid with 20aa (buddy jumped ship for City of Heroes).  We used to duo a lot in PoD where he would charm kill and I would assist by slowing target mob and buffing charmed pet.  I also helped with adds using root parking, and when he got into trouble (charm would always break at a bad time) I could keep him alive by healing and rooting.  Even used doggy as a speed bump a couple of times so we could succor.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I now have this second account (third really) and was wondering if any of you have suggestions on how to PL the Shammy with the Druid.  I have a general idea, but since I've never actually played a Druid, I'm looking for any insights I can get.  Not really interested in leveling the Druid, although I'm sure having Dire Charm would be a blast.  Not sure I could handle 2-boxing and charm killing, could prove to be high drama.  Really just want to help the Shammy get to 65.<br />
<br />
Advice, comments?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not much into the PL aspects of the game, but I would think that at 58 the shaman would be hard to PL...and with the zones he can get into you have 2 of the 3 main components you need for a group(Slower and Healer).  If it were me, I would hit PoV, gfrab a tank, and fill out the group with 3 others, and just grind.<br />
<br />
But that is me =)</div></div><hr />

As a 65 druid who boxes a 60 shaman I inherited, I have a few thoughts... :-)  The quickest way to PL the shaman would be to charm the forest frogs in PoS.  Park the shaman on a hill, and hunt with the druid.  Use the shaman for extra buffs and healing, while you learn the druid a bit.  Alternative sites include the forest in the plane of mischief and the plane of nightmares.  You could also try quadding with the druid, perhaps the otters in CS, but it won't compare to the XP from charming.  <br />
<br />
I've also found Droga to be decent experience for my shaman - granted, my primary focus is loot, but the XP is a nice bonus.  In this case it's root, slow, dot, dot, dot, and tank with whoever has more aggro.  <br />
<br />
2-boxing and charming isn't too bad, particularly since you can essentially ignore the shaman.  Once you get it down, though, you are pretty powerful, in areas with lvl 55-60 animals.  If you have any more questions about charming druids, we probably ought to take this to the grove or eqdruids.   :)</div></div><hr />
