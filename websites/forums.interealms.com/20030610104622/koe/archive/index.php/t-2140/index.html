<br />
Just wondering how you are all doing, since you are shepherding the old man (Adelrune hehe) and a lot of the old crew I used to XP with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Ya Jice<br />
<br />
Been a long time, actually too long. Anyway we are just plugging alone trying to get levels etc and spending a little more time in TOV.<br />

Hope to see you soon.<br />
