<br />
Anyhow I've been playing for about mebbie 7 months, got a couple chars 30+ and my fav is the shaman.<br />
<br />
Being Iksar, I was wondering what factions should I worry about. At one time I was working a bit on my FP faction, but then the expansion came, and the Bazaar is really nice to have around, being in a central location.<br />
<br />
Now that I've hit 41, I'm starting to think epic soon. In small moderation. I was wondering which factions should I start on now, while I have spare time here and there, so I don't get burned out doing it all at once.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly apprieated, and if this was asked before, I'm asking it again cuz I'm new to ur boards. :)<br />
<br />
Thx in advance!<br />

<br />
Don't think you need any factions for the epic except truespirit, which is gained by doing the quest in the right order.<br />
Just check the guide at EQShaman: http://www.eqshaman.com/ for the full quest details.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do, is start hunting in CoM to get your pages and also the ghiosk books.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, with the SoL expansion, faction is more of a choice than a necessity. I have an iksar monk, and the only place i have tried to faction is Katta. <br />
<br />
You may also want to work on one or two of the Velious factions. Large guilds seem to focus on giant faction (kill dorfs and dragons), smaller guilds seem to focus on dorf and dragon faction (kill giants).<br />
<br />
Apart from that, the rest is up to you.</div></div><hr />
