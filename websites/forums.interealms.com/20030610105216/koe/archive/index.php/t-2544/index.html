<br />
THREE REALMS AND NEW SERVER ARCHITECTURE READY TO GO IN MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE ROLE-PLAYING GAME<br />
<br />
FAIRFAX, VA – AUGUST 20, 2001 – Mythic Entertainment (www.mythicentertainment.com), creator of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), Dark Age of Camelot(tm), has entered into its fourth stage of Beta testing, leading toward a mid-October 2001 launch. This stage includes Hibernia – the third realm – and a series of major new additions and improvements. Dark Age of Camelot is developed by Mythic Entertainment and published by Abandon Entertainment (www.abandonent.com), and will be distributed throughout North America by Vivendi Universal Interactive (www.vuinteractive.com).<br />
<br />
Dark Age of Camelot, Beta tested by over 2,500 gamers worldwide to date, has received consistently positive previews throughout the media including GameSpot (http://www.gamespot.com), Games Domain (http://www.gamesdomain.com), and IGN PC (http://pc.ign.com).<br />
<br />
“Stage three of our Beta test was a complete success,” explained Mythic Entertainment President Mark Jacobs. “Now we’ll really turn up the heat and several thousand more people, who are already part of our Beta program, will find the doors of Camelot open and ready to admit them.”<br />
<br />
Dark Age of Camelot: The Game<br />
<br />
Camelot takes place after the death of King Arthur, and breaks new ground for online play with three realms in conflict – realms that used to be peaceful and united under Arthur’s rule. The players assume a character from one of the three realms: Midgard, Hibernia, or Albion. Each realm is based on the mythologies of Viking-era Scandinavia, ancient Ireland, and Arthurian Britain, respectively. While retaining and enhancing the traditional appeal of MMORPGs (monsters, treasure, loot – lots and lots of loot), Dark Age of Camelot adds the additional challenges of protecting the player’s realm’s powerful relics and to raid enemy territories to steal their relics and bring them home. Dark Age of Camelot is a next generation MMORPG and features 3D-accelerated graphics with movable camera, multiple class and race combinations, Player vs. Player and Player vs. Environment action, a robust trade skill system, and the most comprehensive player Guild system in any MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Dark Age of Camelot: What’s New in Beta 4<br />
<br />
The 5,000 new beta testing slots are being filled by existing Beta applicants who were selected from nearly 34,000 applications received during a one-week period in June when the Beta 3 testing was announced. No additional Beta applications are currently being accepted. Here’s what’s new in Beta 4:<br />
<br />
New Server Architecture. The fourth Beta includes new server architecture in preparation for the game going “live.” The installation of the new architecture also results in an increase in available bandwidth speeding player downloads and updates.<br />
<br />
New Chat Interface and New Account Creation process.<br />
<br />
Improved Dynamic Colored Lighting System that adds more immersion and beauty to the game.<br />
<br />
New Guild System that features selectable guild symbols that can be placed on guild members’ cloaks.<br />
<br />
Improved Sound and Music support including regionalized soundtracks.<br />
<br />
New Trade Skill System with thousands of items that players can create in the game for sale to both merchants and other players.<br />
<br />
Jacobs continued, “This stage of Beta testing promises to be our most exciting to date. With all the new features that we are adding to the game, our Beta testers will have their hands full testing them all. Plus, the best is yet to come.”<br />

If I were Wolfie, that little aggro smiley would say &quot;DAMN ME AND MY TARDINESS ON BETA APPLICATIONS!!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know, DOKU.<br />
<br />
But since Traz doesn't use the aggro smiley here, I think of Wolfie more than Traz when I think about the aggro smiley...err....that makes no sense. Ah well :P</div></div><hr />
