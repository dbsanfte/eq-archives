<br />
I have heard that exp will be left alone and that first kill you will ding 61.  Heard that is what happened with Kunark when they raised lvl 50-60.  Can anyone confirm this.<br />
<br />
Also heard that they will take half of your exp into lvl 60.  So if you are full 100% in, you will now be 50% in on day one of PoP release.  Could just be a rumor, but wondering what you all know about this.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully it wont happen with PoP, but then again, it wont affect me!   WOOT :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not unless your friend didn't exp for a few weeks before Kunark.  About 3 weeks before release they modified the amount of exp needed to get through 50, so everyone needed more exp before release. But most people were 1 kill from 51 when it was released.<br />
<br />
They have already adjusted 60 (they just ended up adjusting it back) so you should be 61 the first time you kill a mob after release.</div></div><hr />

Seems like I xp to 100%, turn xp back to aa and pretty soon I am at 99%....no deaths, it just reverts ot 99%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a few guild  members who have made 61 today though I am not going to do it for a while.  It would raise the level of those mobs that I need to kill for xp.  To many easy mobs out there still and still have AA to be spent on stat buffs.</div></div><hr />
