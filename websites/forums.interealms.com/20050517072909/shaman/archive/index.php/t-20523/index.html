<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Farming Vxed seems to be the best way to go for spells. This is how we did it:<br />
<br />
Shaman (you)<br />
Druid<br />
Enchanter (A good one who knows how to charm and isn't afraid to haste his pet)<br />
Cleric<br />
Warrior (highly geared hybrids might work, but I don't recommend trying it)<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
Get the adventure, or if you're not flagged, have someone who is to get it for you. Have the Bard or Druid zone in to check on names. The Trickster and Umbiki are close to each other, both drop spells and some pretty nice loots. If these names aren't up, wait 5 minutes and get a new adventure. Other names, like the Ukun Bloodbeast and 1 other one, can't be pulled to the zoneline and are considerably harder for the bard to pull. I recommend getting adventures until either the Trickster or Umbiki are on track. <br />
<br />
Once you get an adventure with a named or 2, set up your group at the zone in and have your bard start clearing up the right side. The second pull will usually be a pooka for the chanter pet. Once you get your pet, you'll be killing faster than the bard can pull. <br />
<br />
About 10 mobs or so later, you'll get to Umbiki or his placeholder. The Trickster is in the cave to the right after Umbiki. He's surrounded by pookas, all of them are lullable, and he will come single if you lull the two on either side of him.<br />
<br />
When you're ready to pull either named, have the bard pull with HoS/slow. If his slow sticks, your job is to spam heals. If it doesn't, have him re-HoS, you malos and your slow should stick. The tank should use defensive disc on names. With the hasted pet, the named should go down in about 15 seconds. <br />
<br />
Umbiki rampages, so you should concentrate on healing whoever's on ramp. The Trickster doesn't ramp, so just spam heals on the MT, although you shouldn't need it with a cleric and druid healing.<br />
<br />
So far, we've gotten about 4 plate legs, 2 earrings, 2 enchanter spells, one BL spell and one Daluda's Mending. Once you kill the names, you can either wait for repops and hope for another named, or zone out and get a new adventure. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just as a side note - you don't need a tracker necessarily to check spawns.  A rogue or bind sight works great too :D<br />
<br />
Also - a lot of clerics don't know this, but it's a good idea to have a stun loaded for when the chanterpet drops.  It buys them time in remezzing and often saves the chanter's life.  Torpor/Stoicism is a great tool for keeping the pet slightly subdued during downtime. It snares it (if you're snarerererless) and slows it down a bit, buying the chanter even more time to recover the pet.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Last time I did vxed we did quite well so I heartily recommend vxed for spell farming and experienc. I managed to get Balance of the Nihil off Umbicki (woot!) and then a few moments later got a Daluda's Mending off a trash mob. We were actually working on getting a friend flagged so were pulling to the first platform when both these things dropped. <br />
<br />
Was a very nice day and the team gave me both the spells ... :)<br />

<br />
non-named trash mob?  Do you recall what type? Noc/Pooka/Mite/Cragbeast etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have a hard time believing what you just said winterfury, you able to back this up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like cheese.<br />
<br />
Cheese is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just so people don't think this is free spells with ease... We've spent about 15 hours in Vxed, both farming named and clearing to finish the trial.  We got 2 bard spells and a paladin spell.  Those pants and earrings are real nice for plate classes though, too bad there isn't much for nice shaman loot on the easy named around GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is almost exactly what i did. We had a maxed AA chanter that charmed and pet and wasn't afraid to haste. The dps was insane.. and since she boxes a paladin and just stuns when charm goes down she didn't die once. We took down 2 named but neither dropped any spells :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
got my chain legs in vxed from a named.<br />
<br />
also a very nice mask (115 hp/mana, extended range focus) droped from trash mob at ZI.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a shaman spell drop but got wiz(3), ench, bst, cleric, mage(2) as confirmed drops there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I must have bad luck.  Did that last weekend for about 6-7hrs and ended up killing in the neighborhood of 30named with only 5 spells drop.....all the same stupid bst spell.</div></div><hr />
