<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got this idea off the Test server board and remembered we've discussed how &quot;shaman&quot; is pronounced many times here...but what about the imaginary words we've all said for many years now. We all play the same game, but since there is no speech in EQ, there are many possible pronunciations for some common things in this game...we don't all go to the same &quot;Qeynos&quot; so to speak.<br />
<br />
Im -really- interested how some pronounce the fantasy elements in EQ.<br />
<br />
These are the starting ideas from the test board:<br />
Tunare<br />
Qeynos ( as I understand it theres alot of inside jokes and tributes for names)<br />
Iksar<br />
your character's name/nickname<br />
Luclin<br />
<br />
Heres how Ive always pronounced them....<br />
Tunare= TWO-nair<br />
Qeynos= QWEY-nos (I know logically theres no reason for the 'w' here, but its how Ive pronounced it since beta...cant break the habit haha)<br />
Iksar= ICK-sar<br />

Want to add that Cazic Thule does not have the ee sound either.  Don't see why it would.

<br />
Actually, as Hoeju said, Verant has stated Luclin is pronounced with a hard 'c' sound. I always say luck-lin, but I think they actually say luke-lin. There's no s in Luclin.</div></div><hr />

Player names are so hard, sometimes we pronounce them so differently we can't figure out what the others are talking about have to type them.<br />
<br />
Anyways, here is how I pronounce some of the things on your list.<br />
<br />
Tunare - TOO-nair.<br />
Qeynos - KAY-nos<br />
Iksar - ICK-sar<br />
Luclin - LOOSE-lin -- though everyone else says LUCK-lyn and I get made fun of ... I cant help but pronounce it that way.<br />

<br />
<br />
Henora, actually I pronounce it the way Krup does.<br />
hen-NOR-ah, but when said outloud it's rarely more than just Hen.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tunare = Two-nar-ee <br />
<br />
thats how I also say Tunare, I was suprised by all the people saying Two-nair or whatever... it seemed like a 3 syllabic word for some reason.<br />
<br />
And I also pronounce luclin with a soft c... loose-lyn as some other people have said. As some of you have said verant supposedly said that it's with a hard C but Lucklin just sounds ugly as hell. Looselyn sounds much much better in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I also say Kaynos for Qeynos.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone else say HoS and FoS: &quot;foss&quot; and &quot;hoss&quot;, much like the name &quot;Ross&quot; but with a different letter? I do.<br />
<br />
And SoW = So/sew, same pronunciation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Does anyone else say HoS and FoS: &quot;foss&quot; and &quot;hoss&quot;, much like the name &quot;Ross&quot; but with a different letter?<br />
<br />
The only acronyms that I actually speak the acronym instead of what it stands for are SoW and afk, because they have been around so long and everybody knows what they are. Most others I say the actual words when I'm speaking. But for some things I only say part of it, i.e. just Focus rather than Focus of Spirit.<br />
<br />
That reminds me, what is the actual proper pronunciation of aegolism? I suppose I could look it up, but I find myself saying it a couple different ways. I think it is actually ay-go-lism, but a lot of times I end up saying ay-joe-lism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">haha yes!!  how many people out there pronounce acronyms when saying them?  I never pronounce acronyms.<br />

what about this one? Ssraeshza<br />
<br />
I refer to it as &quot;s-s-r-a&quot; or (srah)<br />
<br />
I knew this kid once who pronounced primal as &quot;preemal&quot;... drove me nuts.. it's Primal, not preeeeemal<br />
<br />
How about &quot;uber&quot;? is it &quot;oober&quot; or &quot;uh-ber&quot;<br />
<br />
and pwned.. I say it's &quot;powned&quot;, hiding the &quot;o&quot; as much as possible, but my friend says &quot;pee-owned&quot;<br />
<br />
how about &quot;Tolampuj&quot;? Tol-ah-m... .. hmmm tol-am-puj?<br />
<br />
as for my name... i got into the habit of calling him &quot;Ast-ee-ain-ee-axx&quot;... don't ask me why... but i looked at it closely and began to call him &quot;Ast-yan-axx&quot;, which makes a lot more sense really.. but i was in the latin class not to long ago and i guess &quot;Astyanax&quot; was the son of Hector or Troy or whereever... and my Latin teacher, who i've never heard pronounce anything wrong, pronounced it as &quot;Ast-aye(like the letter i)-an-axx&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most cases the e is silent at the end of a word, but not always. Proper names dont always follow grammar rules, and I think in this case many of us pronounce the e because Tunare is female. Tunar sounds masculine, Tunar-ee sounds feminine. I dont know how Verant says her name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">This is kind of funny out of an english perspective. Where you have no rules for pronounciation and hardly even any discernable patterns. In most languages however the way you write a word strongly indicates the way it should be pronounced, in some cases (french) there's only one way to pronounce 99%+ of what's written.<br />
<br />
German isn't on either extreme, but uber most definitively is a word with one single proper way to pronounce it. This means the other ways are wrong, in english not pronouncing something like others do isn't necesarily wrong. But uber isn't english.  <br />
<br />
uber is EU-berr<br />
<br />
That is the one and only way to pronounce it.<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty much up to your own discretion as english has no rules. WEll with some exceptions, Seru and many other parts of the game have strong latin influences in naming and therefore you'll need to use rules. Same with Vex Thal and hebrew.<br />
<br />
Incidently I'm also one of the nonsensical people who say Y in Ykesha as a consonant and has an amost mute wovel sound before the K. J(uh)Keshah, there's no real logic behind that but the beauty of english is that you don't need any to explain why you pronounce something a certain way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Laproaigh, english does in fact have grammar rules. It's just those rules arent always consistent in every case, and change over time as new terms are incorporated from other languages. I think most languages are this way.<br />

American english differs from U.K. english, just as both differ from german despite both being heavily derived from german. The Brits would say what we speak isnt 'The King's' english, but I would say the language spoken in the U.K. today doesnt resemble proper english anymore than our dialect does. <br />
<br />
Likewise, even though I studied german for 5 years in school, I would probably have a hard time understanding a german person speaking on the street because of colloquialisms and slang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">There's a problem with the actual word &quot;Sow.&quot;  It means two entirely different things, and each thing has a different pronunciation!  <br />
<br />
1) Sow like plow or cow means a female pig!  <br />
<br />
2) Sow like sew or mow means to plant seeds!  As in sowing your oats!  <br />
<br />
Since you can be sowing someone or sowing your oats, but can't be female pigging someone, I pronounce it sew.<br />
<br />
Can I get a (female pig)?  Hold on, I'm (female pig)'ing someone else!  <br />

Generally, to make the hard C sound, the english language uses the letter combination CK.  (as in the work LUCK itself)<br />
<br />
the letter C takes on the sound of the letter S quite often unless it it is followed by another consonant. Such as CK or CH.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how the devs intended it to sound, what they spelled says &quot;loose-lyn&quot; to me. If they intended &quot;luck-lyn&quot; they should have used the CK.<br />

edit: and landragoran, SoW is an acryonym, it shouldent be pronounced. And if you do SAY it, rather than spell it, your interpretation is as valid as anyone elses... Do you SAY &quot;FBI&quot; or &quot;fehbi&quot;? come on now :)</div></div><hr />

Actually, that's not accurate. In general, the only times the letter C takes on the S sound is when it is immediately followed by the letter I, E, or Y (As in Lucifer, acid, ace, ancestor, ancient, ice, icy, etc).<br />
<br />
In most cases, the letter C takes on the K sound or CH when followed by any other letter in the alphabet (As in acclaim, accompany, account, accost, accuse, ache, acre, acoustic, acquaint, acrid, acrobat, across, actor, acumen, acute, adjective, advocate, affect, agriculture, alacrity, alcohol, alcove, anchor, apocalypse, apothecary, application, etc). And those are just some of the A's. <br />
<br />
Can you find any word in the dictionary where the C takes on the S sound, and isnt followed immediately by I, E, or Y? I couldnt.<br />
<br />
lucid (followed by i)<br />

ace (followed by e)<br />

German isn't on either extreme, but uber most definitively is a word with one single proper way to pronounce it. <br />
<br />
uber is EU-berr  <br />
Oh great, now I'm really confused.  By &quot;EU&quot; do you mean long &quot;OO&quot; (as in woot!), a &quot;YOU&quot; sound (as in cumulative, twice!), or the correct German pronunciation of &quot;EU&quot; as &quot;OY&quot; (as in Deutchland)?  Or are you using German pronunciation rules (on a generally English-speaking forum ;) ) which would infer the &quot;ü&quot; sound (&quot;U&quot; mit ein umlaut) which is a different beast altogether?<br />

Don't look at these boards too often. Kind of figured there'd be others who could answer questions.<br />
<br />
Yes english has a few very very loose grammar rules, however it does unlike most languages not have pronounciation rules.  This malleability is probably part of it's success as a world language allthough the primary reasons are of course political.<br />
<br />
The EU was probably not the best way to put that, that's more how that sound is spelled in french. I don't think the sound which U in uber takes is too common in english. I can't at the moment thing of a single word that has it. It's a hard Y sound, and Y as a hard wovel doesn't really exist in english. Well at least I can't think of a single word with a hard Y, but if anyone else can please write it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Tunare... the important part is the NARE.  The TU doesn't modify the NARE at all, although the opposite isnt true.  If NARE was a word in the english language it would be pronounced NAIR I believe.  Think of any word that is consonant - vowel - consonant - E (Cake, pole, dune, even words like phone apply)and I think you will see what I am getting at.  The vowel takes the sound of the letter (a has an A sound etc) and the E is silent.  <br />
<br />
Now everyone please stop adding an EE or AY to the end of Tunare... It freaks me out.</div></div><hr />

Shur, if it were English, it wud probly be TU-NAIR, but we on Norrath, not Earth.

It's been a while since my German-speaking days, but I believe I was once told that and umlauted &quot;U&quot; (Ü) was pronounced by shaping your lips in an &quot;oooooo&quot; shape, but try to say the letter &quot;E&quot; at the same time.  Makes that rich, throaty, sound that comes from deep down.  Is that what you're trying to say?<br />
