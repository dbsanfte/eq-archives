<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started hydra with my shaman monk and chanter (lvles in the subject line)  Aside fromm the Forgotten Halls off nedaria(which is where i've been hunting  for the past week) where is a good  &quot;safe&quot; place so to speak  for me to get some good xp up for all of us? I'm currently working on VP with the shammy (just got vp1) and working HoTT atm my shammy gear you can check out in my sig monk gear can be viewed here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1196393) and chanter's can be viewed here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1196392)  Monk will be etting teh back item I have on the shammy as soon as I trade outthe aug I have on it to my new Fabled Sebilite Scale Cape (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=35083)  I got in Seb tonight in a raid so aside from that where other than  the Forgotten halls can i go thats not gonna get the triumverate killed too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few of the places I liked to hunt:<br />
<br />
Droga:  Easy place to hunt and decnet xp, plat and loot.  Most of the items from here sell in the few kpp range, but also make for excellent tribute.  Faction is nice also.<br />
<br />
ChardokB:  Once you get enough faction you can easily start hunting in ChardokB (Halls of Betrayal).  This will be a hotspot starting next patch so will likely be very decent XP.  Some good drops in here, with the FT2 neck going for 30kpp in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Bloodfields:  I setup in the 2nd field (the one closer to RCoD) and kept pretty much all the wanderers and some of the static spawns down for hours at a time.  Very good for Loyalist faction and named drops in the 10kpp area.  CC is necessary since you will get more than one in camp sometimes.<br />
<br />
Harbingers Spire:  I was here forever getting the belt quest done for 2 characters.  You can do very well in the 1st floor up to about level 68.  Easy pulls, lots of easy mobs, and some decent drops.  Just watchout for any of the named dogs.  You'll need RGC or the RC aas to reliably take them down.  For a bit more fun go upstairs to where the girplans are.  Hit for 600 but once slowed your monk may be able to tank.  Wouldn't recommend this until he is at least 68 though.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief:  This place is good for all your characters.  Decent XP up to 70, easy mobs, decent plat, and great spell research drops.  Fight the haflings on the castle wall and into the castle itself.  Get a good map since this place has many traps and pitfalls.  Your only zone out is a tree that will take you to CS, so have some way of gating on your monk.  One major benefit is the page for RGC drops here which will get you at least 35k itself, or 45ish if you use it to create RGC.<br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway:  There are a few spots where you can do well here.  Things can get ugly fast so need to be on top of your game.  One place I liked at lower levels was the Pixt Trent camp.  From the DS ZI head up the path to the 1st bridge on the left.  Follow the trail to the 1st arch.  There will be 2 mobs there, and a wanderer just beyond.  The wanderer is the PH for the named.  The path between the bridge and the 1st arch is safe as long as you aren't too near the arch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say Sol Ro is hands down the best thing for you. I've been helping PL a 60 warrior friend here with another monk, and I'm getting pretty decent xp myself. (Much better xp than WoS) It's fairly empty most nights on Zeb, and you can pick up 20-30k worth of sellable ornate patterns every 3-4 hours as well. I think if you spent a few hours getting all three the quest access, you'll find it to be well worth your while. The only hitch is that it's so easy, and everything looks so similar, that it could put you to sleep =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off get your monk LR5 and a SoE.   Untill your monk has some AA your not going to be tanking with non 2hb weapons.  Secondly keep his weight below 24 stones. WR bags and such are a must.  Start upping his HP as much as you can it will make it easier to do stuff with just Q. <br />
<br />
I have BoT and a semi-nicly geared monk so I do fine in Sol-Ro (and there is a DC mob up the stairs).  Until you get some AA on your monk I would spend either root-dotting with him in group untill he gets some def aa or fighting in some lower zones (that will kill your shammy xp) but let your monk and enc be potentialy more productive.  You can also fight out of group with shammy to pl the monk and enc.  Tier 2 and low 3 (HoH) can be nice XP for the sub 67 crowd.<br />
<br />
(just looked at magelo's and i need to update them )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The safest place for that trio is probably Grieg's End or the Deep, where mobs hit for close to nothing. ZI mobs in GE will be light blue to your level 70 Shaman, but they will dark blue deeper in, where they hit for 210ish (the horror!). The XP is so-so, but you can kill them fast. Poor-to-mediocre cash and gem loot and occasional minor named drops.<br />
<br />
Droga should be decent XP around the King's castle where mobs are level 60ish and you shouldnt' have too much trouble from adds what with the Monk's lull and the Chanter's mez. Decent cash and good named drops.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, I would really really advise getting your Monk better gear, a 2HB weapon and some defensive AAs before venturing to higher level zones. That gear is vintage 2002 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the advice guys.<br />
<br />
I have been playing sporadically as of late due to my work schedule (being at work by 9am EST and getting home by like 9 or 10pm EST every day (Sundays included) and will beon that work schedule till maybe mid month so I'll have to try all yer suggestions when i know I'm not gonna have such a hectic schedule (in other words Be at work by 9am Mon-Sat home by 9 or 10 Mon-thurs nights or by 5 or 6pm Fri and Sat off on sundays (this is my normal work schedule btw being an assistant manager for a carpet and air duct cleaning company suxors sometimes))<br />
<br />
But teh little time I've gotten in when I can has Yielded the chanter a new level ( Ding 62)  Haly 2 laa away form HoTT (finally) and the monk dieing more times  and losing reg xp than gaining LOL in the Forgotten Halls.  Can we say extreme casual player here? =P<br />
<br />
<br />
