<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to cause quite a rift in the group when all the bard is singing is warsong of zek for haste and I ask if he has any of his level 60-65 overhaste songs (Ervaj, Vah Shir, Forpars, Rizlonas, or Call of the Muse). Then the group chimes in that celerity/SLTW stacks with bard haste and then it starts to get ugly.<br />
<br />
The Bard feels challenged from his throne of the 'King of ALL HASTE' and chants of &quot;my haste &gt; than your haste&quot;, folllwed by twisted logic saying Warson of Zek stacks with all spell haste, and other people in the group who think it does as well. Egos are challeneged and a power struggles rears its head as a class' role is challenged. It normally erupts into chaos, or the group resorts to utter silence.<br />
<br />
/em sigh.  The straw that forced me to post was right after getting rezzed in bot once a named was pulled not long after I had gotten my clothes back on. The Bard singing zek again, and I hear a &quot;HASTE d00d&quot; yelled in group say. I politely tell him it will have to wait.  Then I realized that this crap has to come to an end, or possibly I need some divine wisdom to help me through it. <br />
<br />
I know that skilled Bards are out there and that know their beans, perhaps I'm just part of the fresh newbie crowd in bot/hoh and its just part of the passage.<br />
<br />
Is it best to not even ask? Thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the bard wants to be the big bad haster, let him have all the glory. Put your mana to other uses such as nukes or dots. Have fun without having to worry about the buffs.<br />
<br />
The downside of bard haste is if s/he has to twist in mez or slow there will usually be a good 6 - 10 seconds of no haste in the group. If your group has buff room for it just toss in Talisman of Alacrity (if ya got it) and let the bard do his thing. Benefit is that the best haste will take over and if the bard has to drop his haste for any reason yours is there as a backup. Warsong of Zek is better than our haste because it is equal to the SLTW haste but it has a damage shield and raises attack. I would definitely let the bard get carpal tunnel and sit back and watch the xp fly in.<br />
<br />
And bard overhaste does stack with their regular haste so I would have him do both. Warsong of Zek is NOT an overhaste song and will not stack with spell haste. If you feel like the bard is a noob and doesn't understand what his songs do, send him to www.eqdiva.com or www.dotnetdiva.com<br />
<br />
I speak from experience here as I play a bard as well. A bard and a shaman is a great pair to have in a group together. Don't let this haste issue tear you guys apart. :)</div></div><hr />

Divine Wisdom #2:<br />
<br />
People don't understand haste, but they think they do, and they sometimes feel very strongly that their particular misunderstanding is The Truth, with capital letters.  If you run into one of these types, don't try to educate them.  It will drive you insane and they won't believe you anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only hastes that are stackable, are the hastes in lucy listed as &quot;v2 or v3&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Note how Lucy lists the haste as:<br />
Target Type: Group v2 <br />
<br />
It will stack with your v1 haste.  If you want to exceed the cap, you need v3.<br />
<br />
One v1 + one v2 + one v3 = maximum haste possible.<br />
<br />
There are some bard songs that are v1.  <br />
<br />
Since you were either doing Swift Like the Wind (60 percent), or Talisman of Alacrity (50 percent), and not everyone has a 40 percent haste item, it is a decent song to twist in.<br />
<br />
As to what song are &quot;best&quot; to have twisted, what composition was your group?  To a point, it can be subjective, and also can depend upon what sort of tasks you're having the bard do (just buffing, meleeing, pulling, crowd control).  Sometimes it's best to just let people do their thing, and not get too irritated by it, esp in pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spite -<br />
<br />
You're right about the haste stacking (v1 vs v2 vs v3) but your lucy fu needs a little booster.<br />
<br />
The Group v2 in lucy's Target field doesn't mean it's haste v2.  It means that the allowable target is Group v2.<br />
<br />
non v1 hastes in lucy look like:<br />
<br />
Melody of Ervaj<br />
Increase Haste v2 by 5%<br />
<br />
Warsong of the Vah Shir<br />
1:  	Increase Haste v3 by 25%<br />
<br />
Warsong of Zek is v1 haste, so the haste component will not stack with shaman hastes.  The STR, ATK, and damage shield components will.</div></div><hr />

good points. I understand all the different types of haste, just it seems like I've just wronged the bards mother if I ask him to sing some overhaste or stacking haste (v2 or v3), instead of their v1 haste songs. I agree, and I love tactics for the reason that it isn't bot, but then there's the drops.... thanks for the wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">v2 hastes are basically useless. They stack with other spells but don't go over the haste cap. They are also only like 5 or 10%. Any bard with have a clue doesn't use them. Rizlona's or call of the muse on the other hand is total win for a bard. v3 haste (stacks with other versions and goes over haste cap) and improved spell dmg (muse works for dots too). I know alot of bards that use warsong just for the other stats. The attack ds combo is very nice but rizlona's or muse is really hard to pass up in any situation.<br />
<br />
I 2 box a bard on raids but i don't usually twist much with him on raids. He's ae mana or resists bard while our main bards do other things but on a ldon run or any single group run my normal group songs would be warsong, rizlona's and mana song. Don't need warsong for the haste at all since I have clicky swift bp on my shaman and bard also has epic and tunare sword for thier haste clicks/procs.<br />
<br />
People are often very confused by haste tho. There are alot of people out there that think just because they can both have icons up that the haste must stack. See this with all sorts of things. Monk epic gloves. The clicky haste on ornate rogue warrior gloves. Bard songs.<br />
<br />
Personally I've avoided all the zones they opened up pretty much since they opened em up. Used to be if you where in bot or hoh you had a clue or at least some good friends who had a clue but now any idiot that can sit in a group en pov or pos can get to 65 easily.</div></div><hr />

My main is a bard.  I always have zek playing even if i have another haster.  Why? screw the haste... the +Atk and DS from it.<br />
<br />
<br />
like 30something points of DS and around 100 atk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really isn't hard to sing Rizlonas or muse on top of Zek.<br />
<br />
Sorry you met a dip**** bard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally the Bard is pulling and leaves with mobs at 15 or 20%, so I can't get out of hasting anyway.<br />

true, but most bards I group with dont seem to have the song amplified.  100ATK/100DS is pretty good. That said though what is better? 100atk/100pt DS or 25-30% percent more haste?</div></div><hr />

Assuming the bard is level 65 and has either epic or troub mace, woz is 66str, 32atk, and 27ds.<br />

Correct, that was not including any AA at all. <br />
<br />
Even then, a bard such as I with IM3 (AT is not relevant as this will not break the mod cap) and a 2.0 mod will only put out 96/46/39. A bard with IM3/AT3 and a 3.4 mod will put out 144/70/59. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out that it will not up the atk/ds by 100 in any case. :)</div></div><hr />
