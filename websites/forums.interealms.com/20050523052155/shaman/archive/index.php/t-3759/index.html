Very useful for chain pulling groups in areas like VL, FG and Chardok where you don't have CC. I also found it useful a bunch in the Coldain ring/Shawl quests, everything from Peffin to the 8th Shawl crawl.<br />
<br />
Good buy, tho it's pretty common off Reet/Juggs now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tigirs rocks.<br />
<br />
This spell rocks for the best mini ae duo in game...shaman+mage.  Not sure about Crashem's technique but Shaman/Mage works awesome.<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye<br />
<br />
Shaman grabs toilers with slow keeps Tigirs up for the ones that resist. Grab 8 to 10 toilers and bring them back to mage who uses his Scint fire ae. Keep both torpored and enjoy. <br />
<br />
1.5 blue per ae.  Mage/Shaman has at most 1 min of downtime between aes. Torpor+poop sticks nuff said.<br />
<br />
The only limiting factor is running out of toilers =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I usually load it in chardok.<br />
<br />
Makes a pretty big difference in the royals area since the pulls there can get pretty big.<br />
<br />
Turning a 8 pull into a 4 pull worth of melee damage output in a couple of casts isn't too shabby.<br />
<br />
Also helps to keep aggro off of the finger wagglers since you piss mobs off 4 at a time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">50% slow with a reasonably high chance of resist, with no way of knowing just which ones you actually slowed but you still taunt, no thanks :) nice suicide spell tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">not suicide spell. I thought that too, but the aggro is FAR less than turgur. also it is resisted less.<br />
<br />
It is a great spell for pog/chardok raids, and a great pulling spell for AE groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This spell certaintly doesn't have that much use in everyday situations, but it isn't worthless by any means.<br />
<br />
Several months ago,  my guild was doing royals raids, with no level 60's and only 1 55 enchanter for crowd controll.  We really didn't have much business being in the zone, and we had a bunch of wipeouts.  One day we brought a shaman that had tigirs, and it changed the tide of more than one battle, when we got to the castle area.  <br />
<br />
At level 60 with torpor, mana normally isn't an issue, especially in raid situations.  Often times you get a resist, you don't know what is slowed, you need to reslow with tugurs anyways.  But who cares?  If the spell slows some of the mobs, and diverts their attention enough for the cleric to heal themselves or the enchanter, or keeps a MT from being stunned so they can establish aggro, or give the druid enough time to get off evac, then the spell has done its job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Malo was on sale for 10k Nerun.........unfortunately you are right. That's the only time I've ever seen it for sale so the seller can ask pretty much what he wants. Torpor seems to be a lot more common. <br />
<br />
(Yeah I picked Malo up and it rocks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This spell is godly if you are pulling in howling stones. just pull a room with this spell, it's great :D</div></div><hr />

(Tigirs) Tigirs is your friend - it's always nice to hear the raid leaders tell the puller - &quot;dont come back with less than 4 mobs&quot; and people in the raid say &quot;wow - AE slow rocks!&quot;... also nice to hear the other shaman in our alliance say &quot;I'm gimped without tigirs&quot; heh<br />
<br />
learn it!<br />
love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tigir's is a great spell.  Sure, it's a bit situational, but so is everything else almost.<br />
<br />
It gives breathing room for enchanters and clerics to channel off spells.  And gives you time to turgur mobs if necessary.  <br />
<br />
I love Tigirs.  And it is certainly not a suicide spell.  That's why you always have root loaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tigir's is great for clearing the junk in fear.  I use it when doing Wwall break-ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nmok Soulblighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Amazing spell, great for AE pulls in FG when grouped either with an AE group or with an insane DPS group.  Last night was me, my monk, 2 60 rogues, 60 epic bard and a 54cleric.  One of the rogues had a pocket 60 chanter along for KEI, VoG and such.  We kicked absolute ass.  Tigir's a patch, bring it to the group...bam, very dead shrooms, no healing, no medding..pull more.  Only problem was we were running out of mobs.<br />

<br />
I find that very hard to believe. You have NO way to know what you have slowed and what you haven't. Other then retargeting a different mob and hoping for the best. <br />
<br />
Because it has a small AE range,  and is limited to 4 targets, it is very situational at best. I wouldn't give more then 5kpp tops for the spell. Nice buy for 1kpp tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh my. A pull of 6.. Eeep.<br />
<br />
I can cast Turgurs 1 at a time. And watch the Tank Lose aggro on 4 of them as 1 stays on him and 1 comes to me. (And 4 beat on the cleric who will have healing aggro.)<br />
<br />
Or I can drop a Tigirs on the mass. Pulling 4 to me (Hopefully slowed) 1 still on the tank (Maybe) and Mayeb one headed to the cleric.<br />
<br />
Now 4 mobs on me in a location where a 5 pull is a regular thing, should not be a problem. Rot Step back three steps, root again, Step back, (By then even the most clueless chanter will have stopped watching Anime porn and started messing, More than likely the unslowed one on the cleric, (Unless I ignore the 4 pathetic ones on me and Turgurs the one on the cleric) Getting 5 on me (Whee!!!!))<br />
<br />
Mass is controlled and I get slapped around a little. Big deal.<br />
<br />
Now What if one resists. How can you tell? <br />
<br />
Hit the escape key after they all hit you once.  Guess what the one that resisted is 50% faster. He will hit you first. (And thus be targeted) Slow him. Root him. Back up and Real slow and root the rest. (Then wander over and smack the Chanter who has his nose in the latest Jay and silent Bob Comic.)<br />
<br />
If the escape key has been broken off due to a bad night with the Rum and cokes and some happy pills then you can go to the last resort. <br />
<br />
Open your Flippin eyes. 50% slow is noticable. Root back up and Look!.<br />
<br />
It is not that hard to see the unslowed one out of a mass. The hard part is targeting them. That I leave up to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I wish it were pbae, and had a slightly bigger range, but I just spam cast it a few times on a clump of mobs, hitting the front and rear - and middle if the clump is big enough.  Then I start slowing, rooting, etc.  There's enough mana for that.  <br />
<br />
It's the beginning of a fight that's most critical.  You must establish control as fast as possible.  Tigirs helps there in many situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What do you do when 2 resist Snoww Silverhammer? You start to turn into Bashy bear mush because you are now getting hit on by 4 mobs, 2 unslowed and the tanks have no chance to taunt them off of you and you can't root because you can't channel a cast through? :confused:  Can go both ways with the roll of the dice.<br />
<br />
Nice for easy blue exp mobs, but not something you do on larger harder multiple targets.<br />
<br />
The problem with Tigir's is the 4 mob limit and no way to easily spread the targets out, otherwise it would be amazing in combination with PB Stuns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I had that happen last night.<br />
<br />
In Cazic thule. (ow)<br />
<br />
I hit escape, Got one targeted And channeled a root. Backed up.<br />
(got a heal from my Buddy cleric who knows when 4 come tearing for me to pop me fast with a heal. (Who didnt get heal aggro because Of tigirs mind you. Rather than healing the warrior who was taking the beats of 4 unslowed one if they were not beating on me.)<br />
<br />
Hit escape again and slowed the Fast hitting one after he popped me once. (Ignoring the other two Tigir's slowed lizards) Then slowed the rooted one while the chanter freely mezzed them.<br />
<br />
Sure it hurt. So? It was faster. And safer than letting the chanter or the cleric take beats. And Since our warrior doesnt have area taunt much better for them to beat on me than peel off and smack the cleric on the first heal aggro.<br />
<br />
I am far from uber but hell I have 3575 hp (Buffed mind you) If something that you are getting a 4-5 pull on can kill you that fast then invest in a monk puller.<br />
<br />
Oh and vis, Tigirs isnt that much aggro, Dirgrin (My main groups tank) can pull them off with little trouble, and you dont need to taunt off a Glamoured Lizard just clean your boots from his drool..<br />
<br />
It isnt perfect. It isnt going to make your life a garden of curious virgins and rose petals. But it can be effective. And being a shaman is all about moving from one thing to the next making everything work smoother. Tigirs can allow that. (And if Stuff goes wrong and the cleric is surfing anime porn it can get you killed faster than a ranger at a drolvarg convention)<br />

<br />
Correction, tigir's isn't that much aggro on targets that don't resist it. If it's resisted, it acts just like the goofed up other slows we have. Thanks tweaking with the disease counters.<br />
<br />
As for a chanter mezzing them etc, etc. <br />
IF he's paying attention, he can take them all out of the equation on multi-pulls and no one has to tank them unslowed for very long anyway or bother with rooting them. AND he can do it faster then tigirs.<br />
<br />
I get what your saying, and yes it's an ok spell, but it COULD be so much better.<br />
People missing the spell in their book aren't missing much. You can get close to the same or better results casting Turgurs and Togor's back to back. It's more of a fun spell then a practical one.<br />
