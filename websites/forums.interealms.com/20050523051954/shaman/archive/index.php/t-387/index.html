<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After having a conversation with someone recently about their unbuffed hitpoints (and them being 600 points higher than my self-buffed total), I became curious if I was the victim of some kind of freakish bug. My hp are also WAY lower than my caster's realm profile says I should have.<br />
<br />
Next time you find yourself dead, please note your stamina and hp, and post. I'm curious to compare.<br />

Edit: Try plugging your naked STA into Magelo and see what it thinks your HPs should be. Its calculator is right-on for me.</div></div><hr />

Self buffed (focus, RH), I'm at 2246 hp. I couldn't fathom how this guy said he was at almost 3k unbuffed. I was surprised, in taking off my hp/stamina gear just how many pieces I wear had it. Earrings, face, helm, JBB, range slot were about it.<br />
<br />
Magelo not an option for me...no matter how I try and access the site, it gives me a javascript error and crashes. I've tried netscape 4.7, 6.2, and whatever crappy version of IE came with the machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've tried netscape 4.7, 6.2, and whatever crappy version of IE came with the machine. <br />
<br />
Maybe that's cuse netscape sucks.  IE is what magelo is designed to work with.  I don't know what version of Windows you're running, but unless it's windows XP, goto windowsupdate.microsoft.com or download.microsoft.com and get the newest one.  That simple bit makes magelo an option for you now =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">833 at lvl 31 fully clothed no buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sta 105, 1220 hitpoints naked, 1777 hitpoints with gear, can get to about 1900  by switching some gear but I'll lose some resists and Ac while  at it. <br />
 I have About 2400 hp with all self buffs. Can get to about 3700-3800 and 1100ac with raid buffs, and I do pretty well with  those stats.  I just finally got myself steady 1050ac  self buffed and 1100ac raid buffed with decent resists, which was my goal for a long time.<br />
 So concentrating on getting more hitpoints next...  I'm pretty happy with my  stats as they are considering that few months back I never would have thought I'd ever be even this well equipped. I have a  fair deal of resists, mediocre Ac and Hitpoints in my opinion. In exp groups I'm happy with the stats as they are, but once I get canni IV I need some buffer hitpoints so I can click he button and survive few hits before Torpor gets me back up.<br />
<br />
 Would be nice to know what to upgrade to keep the current stats, or close to it, but still get at least few hundred more hitpoints. Wont happen before we hit Ntov I think.  That wont be soon:(<br />
<br />
 If you look at my magelo profile there's the &quot;short terms goals&quot; link where I've tried to list some items that would help me. If someone has time and wants to see the effort I'd love to hear some more suggestions... I'm not quite sure if I'm too well updated about all the new SoL loot.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more question. Does anyone know any decent headslot item that does not have graphics? I hate the looks of the barbarian helms, so I'm wearing a Froggy crown just for fashion. Would like an upgrade to it. I will be getting my chain coif as soon as it drops but even tho the stats in it are nice I cant stand the looks in it.  I'm probably also wearing the Jb bp as long as I get the Vindi bp, because I dont like the chain Bp look at all. What can you do, I'm a fashion slave...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you talking shaman to shaman?  No shaman is going to have 3k unbuffed other than a select few in the top uber gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yer, 3k unbuffed sounds unlikely to me too. 2.5-2.6 in the very best gear and a large race perhaps.<br />
<br />
Delirios, the +15 sta and +6 to resists bracers from Umbral Plains are great, lose some ac but it's a huge sta boost which adds around 40hp for a priest. They are ac 12 so the heavy tanks dont tend to want to wear them. They drop off the mini bosses in the zone and theres one for each stat, the +cha ones seem to be the most common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Korhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">dont know my unbuffed offhand, but my raid buffed is 4295 atm, thats with blessing of aego, khura's focusing, talisman of the brute, primal essence, and brell's mountainous barrier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Right around 1200hp, level 60 Barbarian naked.  Clothed, without buffs I have 1919 or so (which is very annoying since I need 1924 to use c5, and after deaths c5 would be particularly useful =)<br />
<br />
I find it really hard to beleive that that shaman had 3k unbuffed as well.  I certainly don't have uber gear, but I have geared for HP/stamina even above AC in many places, with hp jewelry and some nice pieces, including Vindi BP and OIV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have 2993 hp unbuffed, can break 3k hps easy if I break down and upgrade a couple slots. However atm im just waiting to see what all items are out there and what crappy items may be upgraded....thats the down side of point systems. You have to manage your points :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">my goal is 3k unbuffed, but atm i'm only at like 2400 =/<br />
<br />
4408 in standard raid buffs, 3k unbuffed would put me right about 5k in standard raid buffs.<br />
<br />
i've got a lot of upgrading to do still</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">3k unbuffed is definitely possible but that would have to be a very well equiped shaman with alot of hps gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, 3k unbuffed is possible. Being in a guild farming NToV is required to do it. It takes some of the best drops in the game to achieve it.<br />
<br />
I've slowly been working that direction. I expect to hit 4k buffed by next month, and 5k buffed by the end of the year. Just got Dains head last night, so I should get the belt within a few weeks, then its time for Tormaxs head for the boots from Yelinak. Those two items alone will give me over 200 more HP, which will put me every close to 4k buffed.<br />
<br />
And who knows what the expansion will bring with it.</div></div><hr />
