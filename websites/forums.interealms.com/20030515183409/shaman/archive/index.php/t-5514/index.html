I'm impressed, for a 55-60 group this makes a good xp group that's something more interesting than just awaiting for the next mushroom pull (because someone has just pinched it).<br />
<br />
We had a monk, bard, enchanter, necro, mage, shammy (me).<br />
<br />
The pulls just keep coming, and there are nice little rests between cycles for you to med up :)<br />
<br />
I think I shall be doing this again :) Perhaps it's not the most uber xp on the planet but it's damn fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree wholeheartedly.  This cycle is tons of fun, and hasn't gotten dull after doing it 3 or 4 times.  I'm trying to get more and more of my guild into this, since it's so much more friendly than static camps.  Too many people showed up and now the exp is crappy?  Start the faster cycle, or split a group off and have them start another cave.  I think it's fantastic to be able to tailor the amount of mobs you have based on how many folks have showed up.  I'm just surprised there's nobody ever here when I bring people back.</div></div><hr />
