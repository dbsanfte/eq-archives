<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished getting the canni 5 skill a few days ago, and been doing exp mobs since then. Kicks ass. I love it. <br />
<br />
Havent had a chance to raid since I finished it, and would like to know what everyones thoughts are on it. <br />
<br />
First of all, the term, &quot;low health agro&quot; - is this a percent of max health remaining? <br />
<br />
On mobs you have slowed/debuffed - anyone been had any problems being summoned if you wait until the mob is 50% dead or so before canni 5? <br />
<br />
On mobs where you are just an assist healer/nuker/dotter - what are your experiances there?<br />
<br />
If you torpor yourself right before it hits, will that negate being summoned?<br />
<br />
Just wondering how this is going to pan out tonight in NToV  ;)<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think its 20% of your health.<br />
<br />
I've been summoned when the mob is slowed and at 10% health if I get low enough or I slowed too early.<br />
<br />
And I had torpor on me when I was that low (thru reg can 4, not can 5) and still got summoned.<br />
<br />
Can't comment on NToV as I haven't been yet..:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its roughly 1.5 bubs of HP left.  Drop below that magic number and you basically get a MASSIVE boost to your position on the hate list, effectively your going to be tanking it till either you die or get healed above that frenzy line.  Easiest demonstration of that is on a multiple mob raid encounter when an MT drops below the 1.5 bub mark and goes beserk, you can nearly always guarantee that every injured summoning mob in the vicinity is going to say his/her name =)<br />
<br />
Now I pretty much always torpor before I cann5 and preferably wait until I'm very close to being at full hps before I hit that button.  Nothing worse than cann5ing and getting hit by an aoe that just tips you below the 1.5bub mark resulting in a quick summon to a pointless death =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Basiacly the best answer is that you need to get more hp gear so when you canV you wont be frenzy.  However with the proper buffs I dont think it sould be a problem, just make sure to get full buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just looked at your profile and saw that you have pretty low HP at this time, so I can understand why you are so concerned hehe. I believe that you don't wind up on low hp aggro unless you drop to like 1 or 1 and a half bubbles life and have aggroed the mob in question. <br />
<br />
Only suggestions I can kinda make for you to up those hp would be like ditch that shrouded medallion and replace it with a velium black sapphire pendant (65hp/mana) and maybe see if there is an iksar smith on your server that can make you some of the fearsom skyiron legs (important part being that it gives you 40hp/mana on the legs till you can get a better set, then resell them hehe). Another possible option JUST as a holdover till you can get better would be grey flesh leggings. 35hp/mana but only ac 7 =/ . Or you could hunt in CT for the Tae Ew Hunter and look for his leg drop which I dont recall the name of hehe. Another option super easy for you to farm out as a temporary solution would be some enduring pants. Ac 10 Sta 10 Hp 30 and a few other things. Any of these would be a nice holdover until you get some better stuff like a NToV drop, and in NToV I think that dropping that little bit of ac would be paid for and more with the amount of HP you would gain. Another possibility would be try borrowing some coldain skin gloves from a friend and put them on. See if it gives you more HP than your current setup which is not bad. The coldain skin (if the 20hp and 9 sta add up to more hp than current gloves) are not too expensive, and also add straight mana as well. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, just some suggestions, but if you check the web you can find there are lots of cheap HP upgrades you could get, some of them that you could farm out yourself easily (like enduring pants since those come off of a level 35 mob in twilight hehe). ANyhow, best of luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At half health, you're still good, but going past that, has the possibility of getting agro, especially with such an instant degrade of HP Can5 does.    <br />
<br />
On raids, just be sure you get &quot;the works&quot; when it comes to hp buffs.  On long fights, it's good to be able to Can5 without the worry of drawing unecessary agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is rather funny, one of the clerics in my guild bitches incessantly about low health aggro on Dart.  His SK is usually the main tank and he is quite used to keeping aggro at all times.  Until Dart cuts a Can V a bit too close that is :P<br />
<br />
Scenario, Dart took a beat is down to about 2000 hitpoints, cleric starts a cheal.<br />
<br />
Cleric: Cheal inc on dartanian<br />
5 seconds passes by<br />
Dart: Can V incoming!<br />
Dart winces<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Judicator says 'You will not evade me Dartanian!'<br />
a Tigerclaw Raptor says 'You will not evade me Dartanian!'<br />
<br />
Dart is completely healed<br />
Cleric: goddamn it!<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Dart has been slain by a Tigerclaw Raptor!<br />
Cleric: Hahahaha!  Rat bastard, when will you learn!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think you are surely safe down to 2 bubbles health from low hp aggro. Even on emperor ssra fights where he really really loves me (thanks Plague of Insects hehe) and rampages me whenever i get too close, I still dont draw low hp aggro from him if i C5 and still have at least 2 bubbles health. Anyhow, good luck again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Runja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Low health aggro is a percentage of your total health.  As soon as you drop below 20% health (one bubble), you automatically become the most hated target for all mobs that have you on their aggro list.<br />
<br />
Even dogdog obeys this rule.  Try it.  Go to a place with lvl 35-ish mobs (so dogdog doesn't kill them too quickly).  Pull two.  Tell him to attack one while you attack the other.  Epic yours and nuke it down.  As soon as your mob drops below 20% health, dogdog will run over to finish it off.   Its fun to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yah exactly 20% and dogdog does it too.<br />
<br />
Note that there is one more danger with frenzy.<br />
<br />
Caster mobs, in particular wizards will stop trying to do retarded stuff like rooting you and try to finish you off. Even if they normallt would be no danger to you at 21% they are a huge threat at 19%.<br />
<br />
Frogs in Sebilis cast Lures maybe one time out of three hundred if you're over the frenzy line but if you're below it nine out of ten spells will be lures. Killed myself a couple of times with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">looks to me, at worst with resist gear on, you'd have 3k hps all buffed up.  Just make sure you're torpor'd up to full health before you Can V.  You shouldn't have any probs then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yup, I've found the magic &quot;low HP agro&quot; number to be around 20 - 30% HP as well. Low HP agro isn't much of a problem at all when you're XP'ing solo, or even in groups fighting in easy zones, but when you're grouping in CT or raiding NToV and already high on the mobs hate list from malo and slow, it can quickly lead to death. Damn flurry drakes &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it's excactly 25% or 1.25 bubs of health. good thing about the new UI is that you can see your hp in a percentage and when you're abou to enter the 'danger zone'.<br />
<br />
a few mobs have a different agro limit though, klandicar seems to eat people when they go below 40%. can't remember any other mobs that go by this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dozekar summoned me yesterday the INSTANT I dropped below 40%.  I didn't last long from there, even though he was Turgur'd.  ;)<br />
<br />
Old thread I know, but I wanted to look it up because of what I just had happen.  Basically if you want to stay &gt; 40% you'll need 3206 or more HP before hitting the Can5.<br />
<br />
Edit: typos sukc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've found anywhere below 2 bubs to be my danger zone.   Most of the time I can get away with 25% but I have had some surprise deaths from getting in the summoning blender from going just slightly below 40%.  This isn't too hard to achieve in raid buffs, even for the non-uber shaman.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have had some desperate fights where I had to have another heal and have dropped down to about 200hp or so without getting agro.  Guess it helps when the entire group is under 1 bub of health heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It seems to almost vary by zone.  I've had mobs out of aggro range for normal stuff aggro on me when I canni'd too low.  <br />
<br />
In UP I was canni'ing a ways off from the fight and I got down to about 40% and the mobs all ping-ponged onto me.  Seemed me be one of the more extreme zones for that.  I wonder if I could pull using low-health aggro and proximity? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">40% seems to be that magic safely line to avoid the bloodlust of mobs.  This will vary per mob but better safe than dead and slowing up a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aye, safe call is 40%.  looking at your gear in raid buffs, which i hope you have for Ntov should be close to 4k hp.  so if you cann5 at full health should not get aggro, but as said its a good idea to have torpor running when u cann5, especially when AE mobs are around.  i am one of the few and proud to never get summoned from a canni5, killed myself once. but not summoned. its a fun skill and real fun for the clerics =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You know, at just about any raid there's going to be downtime. I wait for this to use Canni since I'm usually not hurting for mana during fights. I have had trouble in the past with things wanting to beat on me if I canni down to far. The solution is to not put yourself in that position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Any Easily gotten hp upgrades i've missed anyone? i'm still way short of cannib 5 with only self buffs and no low health agro.<br />
<br />
 I know about the hiero cloak.. but that's all I can find that's decently easy to get..<br />
<br />
I'd rather not lose too many good stats ac/wis for a small hp gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off hand with out dropping some focus effects there are a couple upgrades i see.<br />
<br />
Grey flesh sleeves or something close to that from the grey are pretty good on the hps/sta if a little low on ac.<br />
<br />
A hierophant cloak would obviously be good for some more hps.<br />
<br />
Cultural or barbed rubi belt would be nice or if your willing to build giant faction for a while the girdle of reflection is good too.<br />
<br />
Talisman of beni would be a little bit more hps and alot better other stats all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">not really easily gotten upgrades, but not that terribly difficult.  <br />
<br />
If you have the time, do the chardok quests and get the regal band of the bathezid, and if you are more determined, the spirit wracked cord.<br />
<br />
Look into one of the necklaces from CT.  You can swap in the amulet for when you are buffing.<br />
<br />
barbed rubicite girdle from CT is nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">oh and don't forget stat food and drink.<br />
<br />
I gain 50+hp from eating food like halas meat pies and drinking grobb liquidized meat or kaladim constitutionals.</div></div><hr />

Chardok faction I have been wanting awhile, but seems i'd be better off just waiting to get full member on my more than NToV capable guild. I'll look into the grey flesh sleeves.</div></div><hr />
