<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What level did your shaman get PoS/PoV flagged? <br />
I was just trying to get an idea of what level people are completing their PoS/PoV flags with thier clerics and shamans. As my shaman I couldn't even come close until 61. I was able to do it much much earlier with my cleric. <br />
<br />
I have posted the same poll on eq clerics to compare the results. <br />
<br />
What was your experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only level 56 here so I havn't even tried yet. I know that anyone who would let me in their trials group would just be wasting a spot. I know a 59 cleric in my guild who was flagged recently, and I dream of being able tog et flagged that soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">62. Getting the upgraded focus and patch heal REALLY helps your chances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I totally agree with Aselus.  Tnarg's Mending let me take most of the healings while the cleric just did little heals until the Prime Executioner.  We did it the DS way so between mage, bard, and my DS potion, the mobs were coming after me for healing and they were taking 116 pts of dmg everytime they hit me.  By the time we were down to the last mob in a wave it usually only took 2 shots to kill it.  Also Torpor helps out tremendously.  By casting it on me as soon as I started getting hit, I could keep up with the damage I was taking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">61 here, was one of the people pushing for a guild effort towards getting people flagged, went on 3 trials myself though, testing various stuff and other trials, quickly realised shaman are comparitively weak in them and resigned myself to buffing guildy groups till we had a team of 5 that could basically get a level 1 character flagged in there sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jete</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got my flag last night, level 52.<br />
<br />
The group was made up of bard, warrior, cleric, mage, rogue and myself.<br />
I was healing occasionally during fights, but mostly between waves and on Executioner.</div></div><hr />

*boggle*<br />
Shaman are one of the best classes to help on poj exe trial.<br />
You want a slower on the boss, and we can help do heals and nukes as needed in the trial.<br />
<br />
I don't see what the problem is with people getting flagged.<br />
If you get this group together, and still fail, you should just delete your characters because you suck...<br />
<br />
Tank (war or paladin or shadowknight or a well equiped ranger)<br />
Healer (cleric or druid)<br />
Shaman<br />
Mage<br />
Mage<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
With this group, it's nearly impossible to fail the trial.  Shut up.  Stop posting your sob stories here.  Go get flagged.  Geez.</div></div><hr />

        The boss is not difficult . all problem in this trial is the dps on all 4 waves. But it's true with 2+ mage 61 it's easy.</div></div><hr />
