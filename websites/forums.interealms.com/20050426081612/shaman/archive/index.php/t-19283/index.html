<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have noticed that level 63 has been a lot harder for me than level 60-62. So much so that my soloing exp has gone down to  zero or none. I have been soloing in PoN or PoI and if I group most of the time it is for LDoN's and now and then I will get a tell for Valor or BoT. Is 63 just harder that the other 60's or am I just on a sting of bad luck and will pass as soon as I level to 64? I am just about half way into 63 and been that way for almost a week with playing about 3-5 hours a day (hunting). Just wondering is all. :) Also, any spots that may yield a better exp output would be nice to know  as I do tend to solo a majority of the time I am on as I don't know when I need to get off next and don't want to bog down a group by leaving 10minutes into a spot. Thanks for the help. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just group in *shudder* BoT or PoV and plow through 60-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out HoH. If there is a necro kite team at GY try to hook up for buffage and quick heals. A bit of fun tracking 3-4 necros each kiting a mob in their group and popping regen/heals as well as the occasional root parking/dotting of the 4th add.<br />
<br />
I was lucky to find 4 necros and chanter farming aa's there over the course of a couple days and went from 50% into 63 to dinging 65.<br />
<br />
If it is a good group, you can toss PoX or BoU on each mob, send Rover after one, manage heals and assists, canni a bit and be fm/fh by end of the fight or before next set gets pulled.<br />
<br />
Good xp and great change of pace for an xp grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes and solo in HoH is great too.  Depending on if you can split them up with root or zone etc..  I can kill one of the Guardian types in about 6 minutes and have on occassion had to kill 2 at the same time.  IF a group is not available solo there  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since you mentioned it, Blud, I now have to share this.<br />
<br />
Zoned in HoH, only one in zone so decided to try the guardians. Pulled and both came so rooted one and zoned out. Came back in and began on the rooted one.<br />
<br />
Cast disease over and over and over and cannied tons tossing in a torpor while mob root rotted.<br />
<br />
Was a pretty long fight and as I was checking xp (working my last bit thru 64) it was set at 100%. Finally kill the guardian and no noticable xp gain.<br />
<br />
My initial impression was too much work for too little gain. Then it dawned on me ... I had soloed using Pox instead of BoU with an occasional BoNife tossed in towards the end. (Don't have epic yet so free dot not available.) I had to laugh at myself at that. Out of habit, I had loaded Pox and spent a great deal of mana doing only partial potential damage. /slapped head<br />
<br />
With epic and BoU or epic, BoU and Pox stacked the fights would go faster and be very easy to do.<br />
<br />
For xp, at 64, 3 guardians were giving 1% xp ... lots better on staight on aaxp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Set up is rooty pants, Epic, BoU, BoS, and JBB.  Just to kill them quicker.  I have killed them just to see if I could with no mana.  Using Epic, JBB, and Mah pants  :D  , took a little over 12 minutes.  Oh yeah I also got to use my dog pack 2 times right at the beginning and near the end lol.  But definately if you gotta split um root one, run, root the other and zone.  Use your big root just incase zoning takes a bit of time.  Sometimes I have a dog most times not.  GL in there and if you play on Xev give me a tell...err I meant HoH is down for update and ummm only gm's are allowe din for the next 5 weeks sorry...yeah 5 weeks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 2 zone off of Plane of Tranquility.<br />
Used to be accessable only if you were flagged, but was opend up to anyone level 62+.<br />
<br />
Is one of the most amazing exp zones in the game - aggro kiting duo with either a necro or a druid is insane exp. But the loot sucks open weeping ass sores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But the loot sucks open weeping ass sores.<br />
<br />
beg your pardon? Open weeping ass sores?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a figure of speech, bro, just a figure of speech</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol<br />
<br />
That's a good one I gotta remember for the next crappy group I get in PoV when no one seems to know their class.</div></div><hr />
