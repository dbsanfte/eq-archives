<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to run two accounts of EQ on the same system with VI's new window interface?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not yet. They mentioned building in that feature though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">damn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My experience:<br />
<br />
It is possible to start 2 accounts but they managed to completely screw up the switching between the 2 instances of EQ so no sane person would be able to play like that.<br />
<br />
EQW is a billion times better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQW allows you to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">www.eqwindows.com <br />
<br />
version 2.32 (I think that's it, just the newest one) allows you to run to EQs at once</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can bring up two instances of EQ on one computer.  Just started EQ and got a toon up, windowed EQ, started up EQ again and that was it.<br />
<br />
It was horrible though and I only do this with a port bot.  I can't imagine what it would be like trying to actually play this way as it doesn't switch between the two very well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks I'll do that when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaytlin Snowstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well the only reason to run 2 instances of eq imo if 1. for your port bot to port you or 2. to trade stuff between your accounts/chars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its awsome for PLing. Just buff up a toon and he's gtg for 15-30min none stop fighting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or if you are never sure quite how long you have to play.<br />
(Pre-PoP I used to duel-comp most of the time.)<br />
<br />
As a side benefit.... you get to keep ALL the LOOT :)<br />
<br />
It was _great_ looting 70kpp worth of stuff in The Grey over a 10 day period and being able to keep it all.... screw rolling for stuff!<br />
<br />
Muahahahah &lt; evil laughter of death(TM) &gt;<br />
<br />
Hard work running two chars at once though. Well some days...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's good for about a billion things -- stocking a bot with tradesupplies for tradeskilling and standing him next to you to hand you stuff(or just leaving him with lots of inventory space for the products you make), for powerleveling, for playing two characters at once if you can't get a group or don't want one, for selling on a mule while you're experiencing on your main, for having an extra character around to help out on raids....  The game is way more than twice as good if you can play two accounts at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldnt agree more. I dont think I would still be playing if I could only play one character. And I definately cant go back now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can quite easily play 2 character for actual xp on one computer.  You have to have a good connection to the internet though, like a fast steady cable modem connection.  You also need to have a computer with enough power not to lag down hard with 2 EQ sessions running.  Turning down all graphic options and going back to old models helps for that.  The performance suffers badly when you have too many people on your screen at once.  If you are hunting in small groups of people, it's no problem.  I have been helping plevel a friend's mage in the hole at times, applying Quiescence then swapping to the mage to manastone down.<br />
<br />
If you have 512 MB of ram, and a 1800 Gig processor or so, you should have no problems duelcomping with EQW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i play 2 toons using eqw on a p2 450 machine with very little problem. I do have 512 mb ram, 64m vid card and a cable modem. I also have everything minimized as far as graphics go, and also have sound turned off. I wouldn't be playing eq without playin 2 toons at a time. For me its to damn inneficient time wise with just 1. i can get on and get 5% xp with 2 toons in an hour or 2 and think wow, xp sucked but when ya consider its 2 toons that got xp its not to bad. I'd get to bummed from the grind otherwise.</div></div><hr />
