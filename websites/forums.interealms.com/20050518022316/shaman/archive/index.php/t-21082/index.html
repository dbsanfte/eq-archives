Knights of Nobility Is Accepting New Members<br />
<br />
As the winds of chaos died, only a few remained to stand strong against the darkness. They were deemed the Knights of Nobility by Mithaniel Marr himself.<br />
<br />
Knights of Nobility seeks to shed light upon the inhabitants of Norrath and its heavens by banding together to facilitate hunting parties, protecting each other from evil forces, and sharing our wealth of knowledge with each other.<br />
<br />
If you are seeking a guild that is more interested in adventuring and exploring than being &quot;uber&quot;, that doesn't require you to play a certain number of hours a week, likes to do a bit of roleplaying (nothing too strict), and that brings together like-minded players that enjoy all facets of the game (not just leveling), then we may be the guild for you!<br />
<br />
Check out our website (http://www.knightsofnobility.com) and fill out the application if you like what you see!<br />
<br />
Honor virutus preamium!<br />
Honor is the reward of virtue!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All members should treat other members with the utmost respect and honor at all times.<br />
<br />
Being respectful to players outside of our guild is also important.<br />
<br />
As we interact with the world around us, it is important to represent yourself with the utmost dignity at all times.<br />
<br />
Foul language or other current slang terms that can be construed to be offensive toward our members is grounds for disciplinary action.<br />
<br />
I'd apply but I don't think I'd make the cut :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We could always tell our dear friend Ragz Deslicer about this wonderful opportunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can safely say that you would not Jin :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol, gonna sick poor Ragz on 'em? Now that's mean!<br />
<br />
They could make him the officer for the evils, maybe, since it sounds like they're aligned with good and don't have much provision for evils.  Ragz could reroll as a troll paladin.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to Ragz anyway?  Did he move to China?</div></div><hr />
