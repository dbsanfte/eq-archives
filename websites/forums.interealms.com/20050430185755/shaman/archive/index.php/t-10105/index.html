Someone needs to make a Lovecraftian MMORPG, I would SO play it.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heh, sometimes I think people who like Lovecraft are like a secret society or something.  I've bumped into people who've seen me with Lovecraft books and just had to talk about them and would up making friends and having long talks on the spot.  I'm so glad he finally became a little more popular -- especially since he's been stolen from so relentlessly by everyone that it's only fair people start actually know his name and read some of his stories.<br />
<br />
I've read most of them time and again; Pickman's Model, The Colour Out of Space, The Dunwich Horror, you name it.  He did a great essay on fantastic fiction too -- forget the name.  Anyway, he's a lot of fun!  I would play in a Lovecraftian world too.  Something about those creepy old Victorian houses and his way of making you feel the world's about to turn inside out really gets me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Blargx there was a role-playing (paper and pencil) game that came out quite a few years back using the 'Lovecraftian' theme. In essence you traded sanity for knowledge. <br />
<br />
TSR tried using Lovecraft's creations in the original Dieties and Demigods book. They were sued of course since they forgot to ask for permission. (Same with the Elric of Melnibeon (sp) folks).<br />
<br />
The Lovecraftian gods were: a) huge, b) quite evil, c) caused insanity, and d) often unaware they even had worshippers. (This according to TSR).<br />
<br />
Didn't Ashton Derlith (Or something like that) continue some of Lovecraft's works, attempting to write in the latters style? (Lovecraft died at a young age iirc).<br />
<br />
Oh, and finally - ever see any pictures of Lovecraft? He LOOKED like the kind of guy who wrote those stories. <br />
<br />
&quot;The rats, the rats in the walls.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Faern --<br />
<br />
Awakening slack from the unwholesome dread of an evening of nightmares of unspeakable geometries, I pinch my spectacles to my nose and recall my studies at Miskatonic University....<br />
<br />
I think August Derleth was the guy.  If I remember correctly, he collected some of Lovecraft's stories from pulp magazines, I think while Lovecraft was still alive, and started publishing them in books from a company he started called Arkham House.  He did do a good bit of writing in the Lovecraftian style(thought it seemed pretty inferior in comparison) as have a number of others -- there are even whole books of short stories out.  <br />
<br />
The rats in the walls!   I remember the Stephen King story of that name, taken from his &quot;Night Shift&quot; collection, which was a clear copy of a Lovecraft original, but was great all by itself, not just a cheap paint-by-numbers business.  King was very good at that point in his career, I think.  He wrote about Lovecraft and horror and fantastic fiction in a really great book called &quot;Danse Macabre,&quot; a non-fiction book about how that kind of fiction works -- how it pulls and tugs at our psyches, and appeals to us, and why -- and looks at examples of leading themes and writers in those genres.  He pays great tribute to Lovecraft, who he rightly credits as a sort of father of American horror writing.  When I originally read that book, I had to go find Lovecraft.  And I did, and had a good time. :)<br />
<br />
I did see his picture.  Poor guy!  Not a looker.  I remember the phrase from some biographical sketch of him saying that his wife described him as &quot;an adequately excellent lover.&quot;  That seems like a complement, but not one, at the same time.  I don't think I'd be celebrating if someone said that about me.  <br />
<br />
He used to find it quite adequately excellent to live on a can of beans a day, he said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">an adequately excellent lover <br />
<br />
We call that 'damning with faint praise.'<br />
<br />
As in &quot;So and so would make an excellent college professor.&quot; (As opposed to university)<br />
<br />
They made a movie out of that story I believe you are referring to - Night Shift. Basically there was a textiles factory, a machine in the basement, lots of rats, heat, and well, some more.<br />
<br />
As I click the 'post reply' button, movement just outside my vision, like a shadow dancing in the wind catches my attention. All to briefly as the decaying animal smell of something not right assaults my olfactory senses.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the piercing shriek of what could only be described as a Howler Monkey in pain jolts me upright in my chair bringing me face to face with -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">...an abomination of tentacles, coiled around the vaccuum of an enormous, interminable black pupil yet simultaneously shrieking outward, tearing through an impossibility of bitter void like a shock of thunder toward its hapless new messenger into these realms, this ancient home reclaimed, foretold and conjured by the insane gibbering shadows crouched in the frenzy of violent ceremony beneath ancient, corrupted stars...<br />
<br />
Faern -- <br />
<br />
&quot;Nightshift&quot; was actually a collection of stories.  The story I was referring to was actually called &quot;The Rats in the Walls.&quot;  &quot;Nightshift&quot; was really pretty good.  The pretty darn unexceptional movie that was made from the short story collection did have some stories in it, including one that I think had James Woods in it, who's always great, in a story called &quot;Quitters, Inc.,&quot; about a pretty ruthless and psychotic company that promised to make you quit smoking -- or else!<br />
<br />
Reminded me of some Roald Dahl stories -- the guy who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, who also wrote a lot of creepy and unsettling short fiction, some of which was put into &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and some other shows.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, as you can probably tell I really like a good imaginative short story.  :)<br />
<br />
Too bad EQ's stories hold no interest for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lovecraft was married? I never read that...IIRC he was unmarried and lived with his 2 spinster aunts. He inherited syphillis and pretty much lived in misery his whole life. That and being brought up in an academic environment is what led to his style of storytelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Blargx the movie you are thinking of is &quot;Cats Eye&quot; and the movie I was thinking of is &quot;Graveyard Shift&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I actually liked the Lovecraftian patcher graphic.  Then again, I have been a huge Lovecraft fan for many years (in fact, he was the single reason I got into creative writing).  <br />
But the new patcher is cool, too -- can't wait to play a frog shaman!<br />
<br />
Anyway, in response to some of the discussions here:  August Derleth and Clark Ashton Smith were two of Lovecraft's closest friends and members of his writing circle.  I believe Derleth was the one responsible for making sure Lovecraft's works did not fade into obscurity.  Smith was more of the fantasy/sci-fi Lovecraftian, as can be seen in his &quot;Xiccarph&quot; and &quot;Zothique.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for Lovecraft movies, I have yet to see one that does him or his creation justice.  And yes, a Lovecraft MMO would be the rulest in the history of the rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He was married, but it was only for a short time.  I can't remember if it was like two years or 8 months or something.  Evidently, being and &quot;adequately excellent&quot; lover was not enough.<br />
<br />
She must have took him for all he was worth in the divorce if he made due on a can of beans a day.<br />
<br />
Then again, if I recall, he didn't work, either.  Probably could have had a few more beans if he did.</div></div><hr />
