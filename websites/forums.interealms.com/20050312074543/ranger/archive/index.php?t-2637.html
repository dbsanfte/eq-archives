<br />
What are ya and why?<br />
<br />
I picked Karana, cause I had other Tunare chars, and was sick of being the same all the time.<br />
<br />
Also, I think of Karana, Master of Storms as more of an Offensive Deity, and I like to think of myself as more of an Attacker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  I didn't want to do what everyone else was doing (also one reason I picked a human Ranger vs Wood Elf)<br />
2.  The great plains near my homeland are named after Karana.  It just made sense from a roleplaying perspective to have a wandering Ranger from the area follow the lord of the plains he traveled.<br />
3.  For me personally Tunare seemed too close to the &quot;Gaia&quot; Earth Mother concept that's pretty overdone by a lot of media, literature, and special interest groups.  People are free to believe what they want, but I choose not to take that path, even in &quot;pretend&quot;.<br />

Karana, because I knew NOTHING about this game <br />
 I was kinda the same way. Didn't know diddly about the game and saw that Karana was Lord of Storms. And like all Ranger (RL) and infantry, we ain't happy unless it's raining. If it ain't raining... we ain't training!<br />

I think that if your choice of deity is based solely on a single hat (that wasn't even out when some of us were trying to convince people it's &quot;you&quot; not &quot;u&quot;), you are just a sad, sad person.<br />
<br />
Sorry if it seems insulting, but *come on*!  Think about Tunare-worshipping clerics...they have no choice but to waste a bunch of gems for any of their Velious breastplates.  Or bite the bullet and spank Tunare.</div></div><hr />

agreed :)<br />

I saw Tunare more as the fluffy bunny rabbits side of nature, Karana as the wild untamed force of nature. Andric was always envisioned as a half-elf and not to fond of his elven relatives so wasnt much of a choice really</div></div><hr />

K A R A N A · The Rainkeeper <br />
Karana is allied with Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Bertoxxulous is his enemy. Followers of Karana, the Rainkeeper, believe in the absolute power of storms. They worship the life-giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer strangers shelter from the elements. Many of Karana's followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana or of his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also have a half elven Karana ranger, seemed more fitting after I have learned more about the game.<br />

<br />
T U N A R E · The Mother of All <br />
Allied with Karana, Erollisi Marr and Rodcet Nife, and enemies with Bertoxxulous, Tunare, the Mother of All, rules the Plane of Growth. Tunare appears as a very attractive older humanoid female wearing flowing robes and a crown of vines and leaves. Tunare is very protective of what she considers to be one of Her finest achievements, the good elf races of Norrath. As part of an agreement with Brell Serilis and Prexus and in response to the arrogance of Veeshan in claiming Norrath for her own, Tunare created the High Elves and the wood elves of Norrath. <br />
<br />
<br />
I follow Tunare and will protect the forrests and glades of Norath with my blade to the death.  I have nothing against Karana, he is the ally of my Mistress Tunare.</div></div><hr />

Like many of you even when I started in late 1999, the game was too full of people picking wood elf tunarean rangers because that seemed to be the best max/min combo.  Bah, half elves rule.  Karana, Father of Storms, rules.  Fear the rain!<br />
<br />
I still hold out hope that in future expansions the helm of the tracker injustice will be made up to those of who believe.  Something special for all worshippers and races would be nice actually.   (/rude cultural tailoring, /rude helm of the tracker, /hug ivandyr's hoop).</div></div><hr />

Tunare all the way.  Like Dlmystic mentioned above, I'd rather bow down before a hot elven female than a grumpy old man that makes it rain every time I decide to travel somewhere :)</div></div><hr />

Waaay back (fall/99??)when she even got to meet Tunare! There was a GM event in Gfay where they had to gather 7(?) female tunare followers in a circle, then the guide led a prayer-type thing and Tunare....a high elf... showed up.  She said stuff, DT'd a couple nidjits who kept /bonking her and left. The guide then gave the leader of us 7 (Bramble was one of the 7) a bunch of wine to distribute to the 7 of us. Nothing special, just elven wine.  <br />

Karana strikes me as a kindly, wizened old man with a cane that doubles as a beating stick.<br />
<br />
Tunare seems to be an uppity, aloof, flower-gardening old tart who has had too many facelifts.<br />
<br />
Now, from a roleplaying perspective, Aendyce has a healthy respect for Tunare and her creations. Karana appeals quite a bit more to the player though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm from the ranger equals hunter / woodsman school. This &quot;protector of nature&quot;, &quot;defender of the balence&quot;, &quot;pruner of apple trees&quot; stuff is for druids, if you ask me. Gimme some venison. /grin<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate that Karana rangers have no decent alternative to Helm of the Tracker. Well, Golden Leaf is okay, but you can't beat Truesight. I really hope Karana rangers will be able to use some of the new player-made bows coming out. But if not...<br />
<br />
I'd still pick Karana if I started over.</div></div><hr />

/ooc Besides, as a side note from my RP of my character.  Ruvane is half high elf, half barbarian (don't tell me I can't be, because I am =p).  Her father is a wizard of Karana, her mother a Shamaness.   Her beginnings were in the ritual fires of the spring, while her father was traveling the frozen lands of the north seeking arcane wisdom.  The mating of that one season was not to last, neither culture would allow.  She was taught the ways of the land by her mother, but when her mother met an early death when she was a young girl, she went off to seek the ways of her father.  He welcomed her, and taught her the ways of Karana.  Utilmately she chose the path of a ranger.  She is not an outcast, but neither does she find home in the village of Halas, nor in the City of the High Elves.  She is of the land, the mountains and the forest, and finds her strength in Karana.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to be a Tunare follower, but it meant leveling up my necro to do PoG.  I know I could become a traitor but it's just not in me.  Maybe if they itemized PoG a little better, with some Karana ranger stuff, it would balance things out a bit.</div></div><hr />

So even Karana rangers, except those done with questing and stuff, are kind of screwed in PoG as well. *shrug*<br />
<br />
We make for good scouts tho, and you can pull, as long as you camp and come back. Anything to help make Tunare suffer *eg*</div></div><hr />

I have to say it sincerely pisses me off that there is not equality in terms of gear for all races/dieties.  I say that even tho I can use all the better items as a Tunare worshiper.<br />
<br />
As far as the cultural items go, each race should have access to a similar level of items.  Show a great English chef an intricate Italian recipie for Shrimp Scampi and he can pull it off with practice.<br />
<br />
While D&amp;D goes the way of a more homogenous, everyone can do whatever they wish... EQ likes to make things harder and frustrating in the name of &quot;consequences to your choices&quot; or &quot;meaning behind your races/gods/class&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Yeah thats great to throw meaning into the choices mid stream.  <br />

I just never thought about it, when I picked.  And then I  never looked at it, there on my screen.  Turns out, I was with Karana all along!  I even wrote this terribly elaborate RP story about being a Ranger of Tunare.  Then, oops!  What a doof.</div></div><hr />

If i could choose over again Id still choose Karana. Just because tunare is stuck up and frigid. It makes no sense to have all these Tunare only items without having an equivalent for Karana followers. Remember when we did our epics? One sword is blessed by Karana and the other by Tunare. When you completed both of them you were proclaimed natures champion. Yet Tunare conveniently &quot;forgets&quot; who you are and wont give Karana rangers the time of day. By not offering to help she is saying her followers are better than us. Bloody favoritism!!  All I can say is when Planes of Power is released and I enter Karana's plane for the first time, I had better find the local equivalent of Tunarean earthmelder who will need my help with a great threat and the result being something useful for KARANA RANGERS ONLY!!  Should that not happen I will be looking to join a Tunare raid just so i can watch her die.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt that any ranger that has ever played on Fennin or looked into fletching on eqtraders would think you started after the cultural stuff was put in =p<br />

For those not on Fennin, Maena is THE Fletcher of Oldschool.</div></div><hr />

How come everyone is saying Tunare is stuck up and frigid? Mother of All = stuck up and frigid? I have never seen Karana in any planes or even GM events. He must be too good to walk among mortals. Karana does not give his worshippers anything, dont be pissed at my goddess because she spoils us. Karana is too aloof and uncaring to be bothered with his mortal followers.</div></div><hr />
