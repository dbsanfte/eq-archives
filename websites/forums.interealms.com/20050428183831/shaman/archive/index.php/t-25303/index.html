<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys<br />
<br />
I just dinged 60 and I am sick of Dulak's Harbor.  I was wondering where all the other soloing 60th Shamen hunt.  I was considering Sebilis, but it sooo empty compared to when i played before that by the time i clear a way to a camp, it will be bedtime for me...lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Post 15th Patch Umbral Plains is probably the place to be. I was getting 3pct AA a kill at level 68. At lvl 60 with V, KEI and pet toys you should be in good shape (though I didn't look at your magelo). Stuff summons, so you'll be tanking. Pull with malo, run inside, send Dog, cast slow, step into melee range before dogdog gets eaten. Melee, Torpor, Cripple, Stack Dots and wait for em to die : ) Not sure you'll want to mess with the undead guys so much, they cast some nasty stuff I think, though I was resisting most of it. I'd prolly stick to the Gantru models that are near the zone there at level 60.</div></div><hr />

  A couple of places I hunted (and still hunt) which are steady xp, and may be a change of pace for ya....<br />
<br />
Sanctuary Room in Crypt of Nadox.  Invis up and work your through the tunnels in Dulak, all the way to the Castle in the back of the zone.  The zone in for Nadox is in the back of castle.  When you zone in, this first room is the Sanctuary room.  Mobs are spread out enough for single pulls, and is things get hairy for ya, safety is a few steps away.  Decent loot, 3-8pp / weps that sell for 5pp / occaisional gem drop.  There is a rare spawn that pops in this room - High Priest Grumsalot, occaisional A Cloister Sentinel will pop as well.  Can get some decent mid lvl gear out of here that could make ya a few pp in baz.  I still hunt here at 63, but mobs are starting to go LB.  If you haven't done your Blood of Nadox quest spell yet, I urge you to think about spending some time in this zone.<br />
<br />
  I also recommend (as others have) Nurga.  Xp may not be as great now that it's no longer a hot spot, but still a place I liked to hunt around your lvl, and still do once in a while as there are still DB mobs at 63.  I hunted here before it was a hotspot, and xp wasn't too bad.<br />
<br />
Not sure what your wearing, or if you have all of your lvl60 spells, but another option may be PoJ Basement and the enforcers.  I solo here a lil bit once in a while.  Just need to be careful... mobs don't come alone and they repop pretty fast.  I usually just pull to my pet parked outside the doors from the first enforcer and pull to there.  When you get an add, slow it and park it away from your camp.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps... and if not, just peruse the Hunting Grounds threads.  Lots of great suggestions that may be burried in here =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Griegs End - I believe this is still a hotspot for mid 50's, still decent exp<br />
Droga, Deep Nurga - these 2 can take you all the way to 70 but BYOC if ya die. Great cash loot.<br />
<br />
  Is Neriak still DK blue?  Chardock, Howling Stones, Sol C, Nadox are all off the beaten path but don't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank You Guys:)<br />
<br />
I will check out all of the spots you mentioned, as I kinda want to do some actual exploring as I level up from here.</div></div><hr />
