<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilucia</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday my guild held the arena in Kael for something like 12 hours straight. Plenty of plate dropped, and some other drops as well, but if there was any chain that dropped before I arrived (around hour 10 or so), I didn't get it. About an hour or so after I got there, someone in the raid shouted that one of the giants just dropped a corroded chain tunic. I was the only chain class at the raid, so naturally I got looting rights to it. My faction with Coldain is very high. After that raid, it should be ally or at least almost ally, and if it isn't I can always go back and fix that. My main problem is finding three Flawless Diamonds. They sell for about 3 to 4k apiece on my server, which I can NOT afford to pay, especially after finally buying a Tolan's Darkwood Bracer last night which cleaned out much of my bank account. From what I hear, the only three zones that drop those are VL, SG, and DN. As hard as I try I can't get a Velk's group unless I drag my guild there, I've only been through SG once and that was using the ghetto-succor route, and the only time I've been in DN was on another guild's raid because mine doesn't go out there very often. <br />
<br />
Has anyone had more luck with one of these zones than the other, and are those really the only zones they drop in? It's very unlikely that I'd be able to buy them, and the item is too good for me to sell the MQ of it for someone else. I seem to be pretty limited for my options here. Am I destined to let the chain tunic rot in the bank until I hit 55 or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, its not gonna be easy to just get a pick up group or even 5 good friends/guild members to get these.  BP gems only drop off the toughest mobs in those zone.  In SG its the underwater city, in Velks is probably up near Velk himself, and DN must be deep in the depths (I know Vaniki can drop 3 at a time).  <br />
<br />
If you do go to those places it will take time.  Keep in mind BP gems that drop could also be the caster or priest ones.  And even a group of high 50's could have troubles in any of these places.<br />
<br />
I recommend exp'ing in places where items drop that you can win and sell.  Velks, Seb, maybe even Karnors or Chardok.  With patience and luck you may be able to scrape the money together in a couple/few weeks.  Trust me, it will be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know for fact in Velk's they drop off of the higher-level spiders past the kobold area in pits or behind tents camp (the name of the camps may be different on your server). They may drop off of other mobs in there too, but this is all I can verify. Those spiders make the entrance spiders look incredibly easy (some enrage, summon, hit for over 150, etc), so this may be a pretty tough task for you to undertake at your level, assuming you're still a Pathfinder. <br />
<br />
If you want, shoot tells to friends asking if they have any flawless diamonds you can have, or if they can drop you a loan so you can purchase the necessary gems. If you're like me and share everything you have with your friends, I don't see why they wouldn't be willing to help you out when you need it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliak Quickblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best place for BP gems, bar none, is the siren temple in SG.  Invis, swim down the well from up top and go up a couple ramps and to the back corner.  Pull to there, with a L60 pulling you should get very few multi pulls.  Make sure to load up on MR gear, an ench/shaman helps here for slows and MR.  The sirens are enchanters and will charm/gflux/dispell so MR is very important.  i have done this area with 3 L60's with minimal problems.  Good exp and about a dozen BP gems in 2 hrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turgeran</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure you have a paladin with you with the insta cast cure disease shield.... Really nice for getting rid of those pesky slows ;) Either that or make sure you keep the sirens stunned...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DN rats (very rare)<br />
SG Sirens (pretty common unless they nerfed the drop rate)<br />
VL past the gargs after &quot;Upper dogs&quot; (broodmother camp i think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldeneyes</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did sirens the other day, they are very very easy once you get down there and we got 10 bp gems in about 1.5 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odile Champagne</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a group to Siren's Grotto when I got my corroded chain mail and we got all 3 gems I needed in one night of fighting :) An enchanter is a must here and a mage who know's her way down and can CoH the group down is very nice. The xp is great as well and, on the Rathe at least, the area is rarely camped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Siren are in Siren's Grotto was great the times I did it. Getting through the waterway into the siren area seems to be the only hard part. I think there might be one or two mobs that can see invis. Once you get to the siren's area, set up camp on one of the upper platforms in a corner and pull to there. Definately bring a wizard or druid (not optional) as it is a lot easier to port out than walk out when you are done.</div></div><hr />
