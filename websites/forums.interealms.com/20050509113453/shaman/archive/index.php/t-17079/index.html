<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Admittedly this was first time I been pom, which is now located down south of the river in GD. The mobs weren't very resistant and hit for around 300s. Easy to single pulls, and we we killed a named that dropped a hp40 and some other stats range slot which was nodrop. Didn't notice exp if was good or bad as was 3 of us, so didn't really pay attention to exp bar. Seems like a Droga standard loot zone.<br />
<br />
Looks to be an alternative soloing spot for some, only thing is you have to watch is they run at 20%. Also noticed a black stallion and a while stallion both indifferent. Its some sort of quest but couldn't figure out what to say to the black stallian to start it. Only thing you can say is white stallian and it starts on about how they don't exist. <br />
<br />
What are other peoples experiences of this zone? since revamp. I heard of a  quest that requires 4 items from mushrooms to be given to this npc but sounds like it is bugged as the person who handed it in, actually lost exp instead of gaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it is the plane of mischief....maybe you get random exp for quests including possible negatives :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had a nice Int caster shield drop from a named mob, almost was on the scale of a Bulwark shield.  Took a group halfway through to AIW before an OTM was called. Pretty much everything is KOS to everyone.  Some things see though Invis inside the castle. <br />
Nothing that i came across saw through invis in the forrest. I was pulling for group inside castle. Single pulls most the time unless multiples inside a room. <br />
<br />
Most mobs are easily slowable with malo, and turgurs.  Max hit i received was 355. Still looks like a place we can solo fairly easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found the Zone out, its in the trees where you arrive, there is no item to click just run about clicking madly, the anoying thing is you get dumped in Cobalt scar (in the sea)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woulda been nice of them to update the zone out when they updated the zone in.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I guess it makes a nice shortcut for running to ToV though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So now all mobs hit like Stomples?  Do they summon still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i havent figured out how to get in the caslte yet, but in the zone in area where the shrooms and bixies are, nothing summoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at the right corner of the castle (as in to the right of the false bridge)<br />
you have to run at an angle from one corner at ground lv to the other corner on the rampart took us about 30  min to find it lastnight (was our first time there)<br />
all in all was fun mobs didn;t seem to have pop lv hitpoints or hit like pop mobs more like high lv velious mobs  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think i will go there anytime soon cause my computer is still spontanously rebooting itself when it wants, so i ripped this info from a friend that posted it on guild board (a druid):<br />
<br />

<br />
Info from EQ Druid posts -<br />
<br />
My guild last night went into the new PoM with about three groups. Was fairly eay going with some ok loot drops. We eventually happened upon a red con (at 65) mob that hit for about 1200. We called in a few reinforcements and with 5 groups proceeded to drop The Mischevious Jester. To our dismay this mob dropped absolutely no loot. After a check of track thought it as discovered that Bristlebane the King og Thieves had been spawned.<br />
<br />
A few stats on BB:<br />
Hits for 1800 max non defensive, about 1k defensived (dont remember exact, am not a tank)<br />
Slowable, our bard was pulling with slow<br />
Nasty, nasty, ae, illusion halfling + 40% slow to all spells.<br />
<br />
We attempted him twice before calling it a night, neither time did he drop under 90%, he has a ton of hps and seems to have a very big regen. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some details for everyone. The skunks in the wooded area are charmable with Command of Tunare, I did not try a lower level charm. unnamed mobs in the wooded area don't summon but I did come across a named bixie that did, unfortunately charm broke at about 10% and I got owned. After calling in reinforcements the named was taken out and he dropped some 13 20 no drop bard/rogue dagger. Think it was called Buzzing Bixie Stinger or something similar.<br />
<br />
I have never been to the original PoM so I don't know what it was like before. I do however like the new PoM, great solo spot with charmed pet, was getting a little under 1/2 blue per kill when nuking once. The mobs also seem to have less hps than loroks and hit less. I'd say it is a little harder than charming rats in PoD and hunting flies. The 1/2 blue was in AA at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
I was unable to go into the castle because for some reason the ramp over the water can't be walked on. Every time I tried to go up it I would fall through it<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
my experiences so far...and what i have read on other threads <br />
<br />
similar to a tier 1 plane, forest mobs seem to have a small aggro radius, harmony works well. snare root dot summon your horse...typical.<br />
<br />
i would say off hand you can prob quad kite there assuming you have enough mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
there is a portal out that is invis in the middle of the forest..good luck finding it.<br />
<br />
<br />
to get up on the rampart there are 2 invissed bridges one on each side of the visible ramp. the second arch to the right and left of the visible ramp indicate the location of these bridges. No mobs, that i know of yet, see invis either in the forest or on the ramparts or down the first hallway of the castle. from what i have read, including some new quests, there are only a few mobs that will see invis. Exodus is our friend....that and innate camo.<br />
<br />
the guards (dastardly rascals?) on the ramparts are an easy kill..just root snare dot away.. they will break root more often then the forest mobs (btw i have the first root AA so that may help me some) I also used winter's storm on them and no resists. they have slightly more hp's than the forest mobs.<br />
<br />
there is a quest npc along the glass fence that wants 4 shroom spores....there is a quest npc in the chessboard room that gives a quest in which you may very well need a raid force..but who knows a good lvl 65 group might be able to do it no prob.<br />
<br />
the named bixie drops items i got some range bauble that a small group left rotting. i think the stinger may be the rare.<br />
<br />
i only had time to kill a few beasties, the forest mobs that i did kill, about 8 of them, dropped only plat. of the 2 guards i killed, one dropped a yaeths pg 80 left and plat of course. <br />
<br />
there is a good map of the castle that i think has been updated but i dont know for sure over on eqmap.<br />
<br />
the castle is huge so i imagine it can handle a number of raids going on simultaneously and i imagine there will be a number of guilds headed there in the next few days.</div></div><hr />
