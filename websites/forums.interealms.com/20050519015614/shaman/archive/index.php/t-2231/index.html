<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SWEET, what else can I say but ... SWEET. Now the shaman has a much safer dot which keeps on giving to groups in dungeons without it being a danger to the group. Only danger is a running mob which I always &quot;/pet back off&quot; and let the melee finish off. <br />
<br />
<br />
Two points which bring a smile to my eyes.<br />
1) Pet is neutral to all mobs so won't draw adds (unless following a running mob)<br />
2) Pet will NOT break mez no matter what. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A number of Mages do not like this change.  Mainly because it removes alot of the skill required to be a good pet caster.  Many new Mages will not ever have to learn how to really keep a tight leash on their pets.<br />
<br />
However, it's alot harder for a shaman, what with slowing, debuffing, root parking and healing to be able to keep an eye on our pets all the time.  And as I've noted before, mine just loves to go running off exploring all on his own for no reason at all.<br />
<br />
I have not heard of a single enchanter who does not love this change though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's my point exactly, it can run off but will not bring back any friends it made along the way. Can just summon the pet back to &quot;daddy&quot;.<br />
<br />
A lot of mages are also happy as they will not be ignored as groupers as much as they aren't the risk to the group they used to be.<br />
<br />
Also pet control now is easy, do your normal shaman work (debuffing/buffing/etc) and then assist the MA and let the puppy have a little fun. When you get agro your puppy will auto attack with &quot;TAUNT&quot; which can keep a mob busy till the chanter or shaman has time to mez/root park the mob.<br />
<br />
The group as a whole will also like the 100 odd damage that the pet can do per round.</div></div><hr />
