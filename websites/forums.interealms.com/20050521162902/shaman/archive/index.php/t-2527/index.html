<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bubkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if Troll cultural armor has been found for those that worship Innoruuk? I've looked around on the EQtraders site, and they don't know too much either.<br />
<br />
However they are telling me that Ogres might be able to make some. <br />
<br />
If anyone knows about it let me know. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll cultural armor is made by ogres. Trolls can convert some of tha old-world crappy weapons and stuff to new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogre smiths make cultural armor that can be worn by Trolls.  Unfortunately the only stuff that take Innoruuk imbues is the brand new high-end cultural stuff.  This armor takes blue diamonds to make, but the chain is somewhat equivalent to Thrurg/Pog and the Plate is on par with or better than Skyshrine/Kael.<br />
<br />
I am,</div></div><hr />

She is a 250 Ogre Blacksmith, so I think only Ogre's can make the Inny/Cazic stuff.  <br />
<br />
You can use the link to check stats on the makeable stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It looks as though she hasn't made any of the Inno chain either though =/<br />
<br />
In reality, many of the pieces, if they are basically the same as the cazic chain pieces, are superior to even some of the skyshrine quest armor. The bracers are very nice with 5 wis, 30 hp, 30 mana, 5 all saves. I would bank my skyshrine bracers in a second for those. Would need to see more to see if anything else would be a nice upgrade for me though hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People seem to be willing to pay those prices listed next to the equipment stats.  <br />
<br />
My guess is its mostly people from the local uber guilds that are trying to swap out AC for HP/Mana since they found out about the soft AC cap.  <br />
<br />
I forgot to add the link above is for Rodcet Nife, but the purpose was to get an idea of the stats on pieces availabe for your religion and rough prices of what its selling for.</div></div><hr />
