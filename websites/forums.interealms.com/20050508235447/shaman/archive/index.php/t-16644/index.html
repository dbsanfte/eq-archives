It is a proc that while it lasts removes a certain % of your melee damage taken (as far as I understand).<br />

oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to the description of Bulwark of Vie which has the same effect:<br />
<br />
&quot;Places the Bulwark of Vie on your target, absorbing a portion of incoming melee damage. This spell absorbs a set amount of damage before dissipating.&quot;<br />

(blatantly ripped from Lucy)</div></div><hr />

100/5/200 =<br />
<br />
Works on 100% of melee hits<br />
Absorbs 5% of damage<br />
Absorbs a total of 200 damage before wearing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Absorbs way more than 200 damage. Guard 1 absorbs 1000damage before falling off, 2 gets 2250, iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been trying to find some definitive info on Guard also (with little luck), and a theory just hit me.<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, the data info is:<br />
Guard I (100/5/50)<br />
Guard II (100/5/100)<br />
Guard III (100/5/150)<br />
Guard IV (100/5/200)<br />
<br />
I had also read the 'it absorbs 5% of 100% of melee hits up to 200 damage' theory too, but 200 damage for Guard IV sounded so paultry.  Perhaps the third number isn't the amount of damage absorbed but is the number of hits it absorbs.  That would make the upgrades worthwhile to get, and it would make the Guard effect actual useful (keeping in mind the 5 minute duration limitation).<br />
<br />
Take a mob who hits for 500 and for the sake of the example assume he hits 500 every time, 5% of 500 is 25 damage which isn't much, but 200 hits of 25 damage would be 5000 damage absorbed again assuming the mob landed 200 attacks in 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Again, just a theory that I'm too lazy to test. =)</div></div><hr />
