<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I played a beastlord for 63 levels and a shaman for 45 before I left the game a few months back.<br />
<br />
I came back and started another shaman, and got him to level 50 before I heard the term &quot;alpha'd pet&quot;... I know it means giving the pet weapons but can someone tell me root of this phrase?  Thanks.. no one on my server seems to know =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We could tell you, but we'd have to kill you .....<br />
<br />
Our pets can't use weapons .....<br />
<br />
Nothing to see here .....<br />
<br />
Hypothetical:  If one had an ability that was unintended, and wanted to keep said ability, it might behoove one to make up a &quot;code name&quot; for said ability and discontinue discussion of it on public forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Along time ago, when it was firt descovered that our pets could indeed use weopons and even better dual wield them ! we feared that The great god Sony would hit us with the nerf bat big time. So the thred was called project alpha and we tried to keep it secret. Its been decided that this skill of the pets is actualy as intened so now we share the information freely.<br />
<br />
Ok i am going off to canni myself to death now for revieling the secret of the secret.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The &quot;alpha&quot; is the leader of the pack, the most powerful, the dominant male.  We co-opted this descriptor to mean our pet when buffed/equiped.  It is an apt description, as an alpha'd pet is far more powerful than a basic pet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I beta my pet. <br />
<br />
I get lots of complaints about him, he feigns death  constantly and I keep him for over a year before using him in a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My pet is Project Alpha Beta....... tell a friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slurm:  Nice story but I just came up with the name out of thin air.  I suppose we can retro the story to add the alpha male part :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm calling the cops on you..you should never beta your pet.<br />
<br />
BTW NEVER EVER give your pet weapons. It doesn't make him better, it just makes him lazy.  :D</div></div><hr />
