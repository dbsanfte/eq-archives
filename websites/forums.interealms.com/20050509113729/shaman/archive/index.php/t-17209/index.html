<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have an idea what the Raid Experience penalty is?  If indeed there is one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really a penalty, you just don't get bonus xp for a raid group.<br />
<br />
So if you had 5 people in a normal group and a mob worth 500 xp, each person would get 180 xp since the group has an xp bonus of 1.8.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand, take the same 5 people in a raid group and they only get 100 xp each.<br />
<br />
Now normaly you have a lot of people in raids, lets say 50. If the mob gave 500 xp then each person only gets 10 xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can you point to a source for that? I ask because I seem to recall a note in some of SOE's text about raids that said raid exp would be 40% of regular exp. <br />
<br />
I'm just curious if its documented anywhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe it said there was a 40% exp penalty for being in a raid if memory serves - could just be rumors.  From my observations (no hard data) this seems about right.  You pay for that 7th person big time.</div></div><hr />
