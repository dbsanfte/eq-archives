<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mystarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, sorry to start off my posting here with such a newbie question, but I have been trolling here for about a month or so, just biding my time and trying to learn behind the scenes.  But, now I just have to ask a few questions.<br />
<br />
First off, I read on one thread that there had been a nerf regarding racial regen and high levels?  Anyone care to fill me in?  Or was that just something that I misread?<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, I am starting to get to the point where I need to think about upgrading my equipment for my eventual raiding career.  I would like to forego the trips to Hate and possibly even find a way to skip Kael except for the needed faction work.  <br />
<br />
What kind of upgrades in equipment should I be looking for to place me in a good position to do this?  (I currently plan to upgrade to an Ivander's hoop and a PotC earring soon for a bit more ac and hps)<br />
<br />
My current equipment is:<br />
<br />
Left earing: Forest Loop<br />
Necklace: Ivory Imbued Collar <br />
Face: Bone Mask of the Jarsath<br />
Head: Totemic Helm <br />
Right earing: Forest Loop  <br />
Left finger: Velium Jasper Ring<br />
Left wrist: Jaundiced Bone Bracer<br />
Arms: Jaundiced Bone Vambraces <br />
Hands: Shissar Scaled Gauntlets <br />
Right wrist: Bracelet of Sense <br />
Right finger: Velium Jasper Ring <br />
Shoulders: Elder Wolf Hide<br />
Chest: Fungus Covered Scale Tunic <br />
Back Acrylia Reinforced Cloak <br />
Waist: Crystalline Belt <br />
Legs: Peerless Dragonleg Breeches<br />
Feet: Tribal War Boots <br />
Melee 1: Slime Coated Harpoon<br />
Melee 2: Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
Range: Medicine Totem <br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestions.<br />
<br />
BAH... EDIT = Changed shields last night... Switched to an SBS vs a CGS</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, at one point, iksars and trolls received 2 points of regen per point of AA regen.  They now receive the same AA regen benefit as everyone else.<br />
<br />
As far as a career as a raiding shaman, resists are always a good goal, an SBS is definitely a step in the right direction.  Also look into:<br />
<br />
BD bracers, earrings<br />
Froglock crown<br />
Crested MM shield +10 MR/PR/DR<br />
Earring of Essence 10MR<br />
Sabre tooth amulet +15 MR<br />
Diamond masks<br />
Velium diamond rings<br />
Velium jacinth rings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get rid of the wis rings and replace them with 6ac 65hps rings or 1 of those and a shadel bandit ring.<br />
<br />
Both are fairly cheap now.<br />
<br />
Grab a shissar helm.  Nice ac and hps on it.<br />
<br />
Arms I would go with CC sleeves or hardened grey flesh.<br />
<br />
Shoulders you could get an ODS or keep the wolf hide and replace your neck with a crystalline torque.(mana pres 3 is soo nice)<br />
<br />
Lost the crystalline belt.  You're not a druid :p  Get a flayed turmoilskin belt or a spider fur belt.<br />
<br />
Personally I couldn't stand the color on the tribal war boots, so I sold mine.  Grab some dragon booties or CC boots if you're appearence matters in the least ;)<br />
<br />
Might would replace the slimer with a howling harpoon or a REIF.<br />
<br />
Shield, I would try to grab a bone braced buckler.  Nice ac/wis/hps on it.<br />
<br />
Grab a goranga idol for your ranged.<br />
<br />
Maybe a death mask of elysions/crystal spider eyes/enshrouded veil for your face slot.<br />
<br />
Some of the upgrades mentioned are inexpensive...some are not.  Just depends on what you want and since we don't know your lvl, not sure what was in your grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mystarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you both for your suggestions!<br />
<br />
Sorry for not including my level,  I am currently level 48, but quickly leveling to post 50 hell level fun.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a long term goal of equipment as I don't have but about 20k left for gear.  I am also worried about not being able to replentish this before I need it for spells. :/</div></div><hr />

Okay, sorry to start off my posting here with such a newbie question, but I have been trolling here for about a month or so, <br />
<br />
Since ya a newb I can do this to you, (in a friendly sort of way).<br />
<br />
Let us correct this misconception once and for all for everyone.<br />
<br />
A TROLL in webboard or Usenet speak is one who posts inflamatory or controversial material for the sole purpose of eliciting responses and starting &quot;flame wars&quot;. Sometime he may crosspost conflicting material to get 2 or more groups arguing amongst themselves. He usually posts and scoots until his next TROLL. Troll are bad things but sometimes fun.<br />
<br />
You my son were a LURKER and have been LURKING here, simply a lurker is one who reads the boards without posting or making his presense known. Lurkers are not bad things.<br />
<br />
So HI Lurker and welcome to Crucible!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mystarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Zurabo for clarifying that and thanks for the welcome :)<br />
<br />
Still reviewing this thread for more ideas on equipment..   Anyone else have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your equipment looks VERY good for your level.  Doesn't look like Hate would upgrade you any and PoG is too hard to get a raid in :)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about what you have now, it looks pretty good, upgrades here will come fairly naturally.  However, I would spend some time on epic if possible and spend lots o time on resist gear.  Many players seeking to get into high end raiding don't spend the time on resists and slow their teammates, don't be one of these.  MR is probably the toughest/most useful of the resist gears for us, so spend a bit of time here and laugh at WuSushi as she fears your guildies!</div></div><hr />
