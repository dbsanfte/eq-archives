<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I am going to start a shaman and monk to duo.  I already have the monk (human) and was wondering what race to make the shaman.  First was gonna do barb, cause then the monk and sham would both be able to travel safely pretty much everywhere.  Then decided Iksar because the monk could go into town to buy stuff and the iksar could either take the stuff from monk or just forage for both of them.  Then decided on a troll because they arent hated as much and have regen like an iksar......    but forage would be nice.    So which would be best to duo with a human monk(they will probably be traveling a lot:D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll all the way, they are the sexiest.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, why not make an iksar monk / iksar shaman duo? You could call yourselves the Handbag Twins or something (jk) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think Troll would probably help you more because of areas in which you can hunt. And with Regen he'll have less downtime which equals faster pulls. It really depends on where you'll be hunting. Velious and Luclin make faction a moot point. <br />
Iksar having a much better newbie area, and can find all their spells in the same city. As far as traveling goes, if you make a Barb he can travel to the same areas as you (human monk) except a Barbs downtime may be a bit more than Troll or Iksar. And Barbs are blind, blind, blind ! But Barb chicks have a nice rack ! Not that it matters but I thought I would throw that out there.  :D<br />
<br />
Forage really isn't that great, I'll starve before I can forage enough food to keep that low on food message from disappearing. I think I've used forage all of 10 times and came up empty 8 out of 10 times. Not very reliable and almost useless IMO. <br />
Overall I'd probably pick a Troll in your case. Regen, Slam, High Sta = more HP's, High str = can carry more loot, access to more &quot;toys&quot; like JBB, Snare necklace, JB armor, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Or if you're making them both from scratch..use Iksar monk/Iksar Shammy combo....very deadly and downtime is pretty non-existent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fubah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I kinda like Ogre..<br />
<br />
I am troll at the moment but Ogre is starting to attract me since i get stunned a lot while soloing Katta Guards and etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oger.  <br />
<br />
What is (arguably) the only stat that really, really matters at the end?  HPs.<br />
<br />
Ogers get 50 more points in STA than Iksars when they start.  27 more than Shamanicus Commonus aka Barbarians. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Not having regen sucks, but no stun from front is *great*.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't let forrage be a determining factor, as iksar forage is capped at 50 and frankly you don't forrage all that much stuff with such a low skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grippa- Troll all the way, they are the sexiest.  <br />
<br />
Damn straight they are!<br />
<br />
Make a troll, they arent as un-balanced as the ogre is, and they have regen+infravison.  Besides, take off your tunic or BP and you are like a bus to the ladies, they ride on you all the time...<br />
<br />
But anyway i like the troll and in my opinion they are one of the top shaman races, but iksar are stitistically better, but they are lizards, and lizards are lizards....<br />
<br />
Well, actually chose whichever you like.<br />
<br />
*NOTE*- Unbalanced meaning they have great str+sta, but a shaman needs wisdom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder why this is. When i made my shaman it was just after release and the only other player i knew was a high elf paladin, so i had to be a good race to play with him (roleplay wise). Plus i have a great body when naked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like ogre. Not being able to get stunned and interupted is nice. I duo a lot so I get beat on with all the early aggro I draw.<br />
<br />
The regen is nice for trolls an iksars with it comes the huge xp penalty which isnt very big in my opinion. Since you will have less downtime..faction isnt really an issue with velious and luclin now...all the old world factions wont affect you as much as you think.<br />
<br />
EDIT - Not being able to get stunned from the front and not getting interupted as much as other casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ogre all the way.<br />
<br />
What good is regeneration, anyways... when you get into mobs who hit for well over 100? Answer: very little. Not being stunned as much by that mob who hits for 100 is what will save you.<br />
<br />
Slam is also nice for caster NPC's. Rare chance to hit, but when it does... it's a lifesaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play in a human monk/troll shaman duo. We kick ass and take names.<br />
<br />
The regen helps because he has more mana than if he didn't have the regen. People pay out 5-8k for an Ikky BP (depending on server) and a Troll comes with one built in! Iksar get it too but they have their own problems.<br />
<br />
Such as having zippo for STR and STA. You've got a monk. Monks don't carry things. There just aren't any pockets in their dresses. So you need a nice big pack mule to lug all your loots around for ya. Leaves you with Troll, Ogre or Barb.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly I don't know why anyone would make a Barb except for appearance, roleplay or lazyness reasons. I don't see that they have any bonuses beyond only having a 5% exp penalty. Hell, they can't even see!<br />
<br />
Ogres are cool. They're big fat strong and have those fangs that just drive the girl's wild. Not being stunned is pretty hardcore but if you duo 90% of the time the Shaman doesn't get hit all that much. He's not tanking for Dogdog or anything so he can stay out of the fray and preserve that oh so important regen.<br />
<br />
A Troll has it all. You get the added regen, fairly decent str/sta, and most importantly... you get to be green. Plus if you worship Innoruuk you get that snare necklace which is pretty handy to have around when you're exping indoors (and if you're exping outdoors with a monk someone should slap you).<br />
<br />
If it was me it'd be an obvious choice between Ogre or Troll, with the Troll winning out. <br />
<br />
Snare necklace and regen &gt; no frontal stun for about 98% of the game... 100% if you're never actually tanking anything.<br />
<br />
The REAL pain in the butt is that a Human Monk exps soooooooo much faster than a Troll Shaman. At one point the Troll and I were at 33 and 35. The Troll did a fair bit of soloing (raising defence) while the Monk only ever grouped with the Troll. Monk still dinged 42 before the Shaman did (he was really pissed about that too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Barbarians have no advantages that a little common sense can't get around except for only 5% exp penalty<br />
<br />
Iksars = medium race that can't wear plate nuff said.<br />
<br />
Orges = high sta and str.<br />
<br />
Trolls = sexy regen, sexy necklace, nice stat balance and are just plain sexy.<br />
<br />
cats = no one seems to know anything about them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't go worrying about foraging when you have a shaman -- shamans summon food and water. :) It's less of a hassle than relying on forage, that's for sure. Besides, shamans are strong enough to carry regular food, if that's what you like, and just give it to your monk when he's hungry.  Anyway, you should get at least one character high enough in baking to make fish rolls anyway, which weigh 0.1 and are, what, a banquet or a feast, I forget...lasts forever, costs almost nothing to make, good stuff.  And getting baking that high is extremely cheap in terms of cost -- just a few hundred plat.  (And...you can make stat food...)<br />
<br />
On ogres, I'm a 60 ogre shaman, and it's true that at the endgame, ogres have the only stats and abilities that really count -- unstunnability from the front and more hitpoints because of greater STA.  (Regen is extremely trivial once you get torpor and canni 5.  I have a fungi but don't wear it anymore.)<br />
<br />
But, ogre is by far the hardest shaman to play.  Shamans thrive on regen (pre-torpor/canni 5), and ogres don't have it.  Neither do barbarians, right?  But...ogres have a 15% experience penalty whereas barbarians have only 5%.  Don't believe it when people tell you that the exp penalties don't matter -- they are huge and very noticeable.  Over 60 levels, I always noticed people getting more bubbles than me in camps -- sometimes it seemed like a helluva lot more.  15% adds up to a LOT over your lifetime.  So, unless you are absolutely sure you're going to play your shaman all the way to 60 and do whatever it takes to get torpor, ogre would be the last choice I would recommend.  Not having regen is a big set-back before then.<br />
<br />
Now, if you can get yourself an iksar regen chestplate VERY early(6k on my server), then it won't be so bad.  But a real newbie won't have anywhere near that kind of money for a very, very long time.  If you're rich enough to buy a fungi, play whatever race you want, because you'll kick ass no matter how much of a chump you are(unless you play like a druid with too much root/dotting).<br />
<br />
For the average guy, troll shaman is probably the best because of regen and the ability to use the jaundiced bone bracer(JBB), which is an incredible item, and one even 60 shamans can use every day.  Their wisdom is lousy, but the regen makes up for it.  Their fire resistance is 20 points lower than anyone else's, but you don't always fight fire mobs.<br />
<br />
Iksars have wood-elf stats, plus regen, and they can't use the JBB.  At 60 the innate armor bonus that iksars get works out to about 40 AC extra for free.  They have high wisdom, but that's not all that important.  In the endgame, everybody has high wisdom anyway.  So they're a very mixed bag.  Handbag, that is.<br />
<br />
Iksar monk(hooray for regen!) and troll shaman(ditto!) would be the best combo, unless you wanted at least one of your duo to be someone who could easily buy/sell and avoid faction work.  In that case, barbarian becomes more attractive, but I'd definitely still stick with the iksar monk.<br />
<br />
And level either in the iksar areas or in the warrens off toxx forest, both of which are fantastic for experience and can lead to some good faction work(too lengthy to get into here).</div></div><hr />
