<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently lvl36 myself, and need to move on from the steady diet of Snow Cougars in IC.  From lvl33-35 they're good exp (generally getting 3-4% exp for every 2 kills), so I'm kinda in the same boat.  I was going to check the ULthorks in EW or possibly head to OT and solo tigers, sarnak and succulent.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to think of better alternatives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about Overthere? I know, I know, yuck. But it's a staple. Also, I've never been here, but a friend here at work highly recommends it: Kaesora (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ulthork hunters are quite nice for that level. They're not too nasty but are good for working mele skills. Good exp and good loot. They occasionaly drop a tusk, save them and head to Cobalt Scar with 'em. Turn in four of them to the Othmir Chief Kalan and he'll return a gem with about a 25% chance of it being a Blue Diamond. (Last time I looked BD's were still going for 1500-2000 a pop in the Bazzar.) Last time I headed up there to hunt some Ulthork's there were like 4 or 5 high level druids and wizards farming ulthorks though. :( Reminded me of the Mamoths in EF way too much.  If you're an Ogre or Troll I'd really recomend hitting the lizards in front of CT. Bind in Oggok in front of a merchant because you'll be overloaded with Fine Steel in no time. The exp is incredible (newbie zone bonus) and they frequently drop fine steel making it nicely profitable hunting. You can easily single pull the corner lizards off the pyramid closest to the bridge over the river. Also if it's open the three spawn on the north tip are single pulls also. They have low HP/Ac and go down prety easy with just a slow and mele except for the Tae Ew Justicar/ Justicator. These guys are worth note; they're a cleric mob with 200+ HP nukes and they self heal. Major pain. They're real good practice for learning how to deal with self healing mobs. Mele, heal yourself, and wait for them to start healing, bash, interupt and nuke to finish off. The timing's tricky and they forced me to gate because of low mana more than once, but they're totaly doable at 37. If you're adventurous or can find a guide to show ya around Crystal Caverns is totaly awesome at that level, good experience and loot, but I'd recomend against just wandering around down there alone if you don't know the area, way too easy to get gang mobed if invis drops while looking around. (Been there, done that; and nothing's more fun than a CR in an unknown dungeon trying to backtrack down unknown twists and turns :).) Good luck and good huntin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bereg Spiritbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CT lizards sound fun.  I have had success in Eastern Wastes on Ulthorks when its not too crowded.  Just one farmer will make the exp crawl though, as you spend yer time looking for something to kill.<br />
<br />
Any reason that Vah Shir could not do CT pyramid area?  Not sure of my faction in the region though.  With a PoK book to the area, should not be too big a trick to bind at the merchant/bank area in PoK and pop up there to sell, then book it back down.  At what levels do the exps slow enough to want to look elsewhere? Will it go to 40, when I can move to DL for the grouping there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With the PoP books now I can't see any reason at all why a Vah Shir can't do the lizards. I did them to 39 and at 39 the exp seemed to drop some and I was ready for a change of scenery so I headed to the Commons to hunt some Druids and Guards. (BTW for you evils out there the money and exp at the Druid ring in West Commons is very, very nice if you can get the rythem down on hunting them.) Hope this helps ya', good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 37 , I found a fun place to xp solo. Ssra basement to kill the slaves, it was safe and very descent XP. It can probably be done before level 37 too.<br />
<br />
only need to stay away from the named taskmasters, so get invised and run down to slaves quaters.</div></div><hr />

  ....not. Hardly a safe zone at 37.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well, once you are in slaves quaters, it is safe.<br />
<br />
going there is not easy if you don't know the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
by safe, I meant that slaves can be very easily pulled solo, almost never resist a spell and are not kos (no faction there).<br />
 I never died there.</div></div><hr />
