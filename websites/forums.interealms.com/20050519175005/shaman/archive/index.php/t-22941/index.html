<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for real this time.  It's just got too silly and the game isn't fun anymore if you're such a marginally-desired class for the top stuff.  I gotta get on with my life anyway, so rather than log on for another meaningless raid or &quot;attempt&quot; at a GoD group, I'm going to go meet my buddy and some chicks at a blues bar and try to have some fun.  EQ is over for me, I gave the account away to someone who will pay for it and I don't mind playing the chars.  No ebaying, that's always been lame as hell, and only losers do it.  A measly whatever it would be for the account would be a proverbial slap in the face for the sheer amount of time wasted developing such an advanced char.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, for those of you who may care, I'm outtie.  Best of luck to those who remain to hold down the guard.  Precious few old timers left tho seems like.  <br />
Well I'm off to the bar, so . . . <br />
Cheers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I stopped playing EQ when I read what GoD contained - a few weeks before its release.  Like a lot of people I'm hoping that WoW will eventually provide a substitute for what was once the best MMORPG out there.<br />
<br />
But in the meantime I doing 'the tour' - I'm taking advantage of the time before WoW appears to play as many other MMORPGs as possible.  Its great fun  and I'd recommend it to anyone considering return ing to EQ.  I meet a lot of old EQers doing the same thing :)</div></div><hr />

Don't be a stranger though. Just because you no longer play EQ doesn't mean you can't at least hang out in The Grey (like I was doing). :)</div></div><hr />

Hope in a few months you can come back and enjoy EQ on some level. If not. then enjoy life on a whole nother level. <br />
<br />
Just remember to every now and again wish your car had spirit of the wolf, or that zoning from the bedroom to the bathroom at 6 AM always takes too damn long. And the loading please wait at the end of the night can bring forth better dreams than a fungi tunic a JBB and a glowing spear.<br />

I, like the others before me in this thread, make a point of reading your posts always. I so liked your icon of a shaman gnome, that I made one for myself that I use as my windows log in icon. I have learned much from you in the many years of lurking on this board, and wish you all the best in all that you do. Whether that is moving on from gaming, or to another game, or going back to EQ. All the best to you Josh.<br />

Was nice knowing you through the different boards and the unfortunately too brief times we had to chat on the serverwide in-game channels.  We've seen some interesting times in the game come and go, but I have to agree with you that the reward to effort ratio has fallen too low to make spending the time worth it.<br />
<br />
I haven't been playing for a couple months either, but at least I made over half a grand just learning how to play hold'em online. :)   <br />
<br />
I'll try WoW when it comes out, but I think EQ has shown me the limits of what online MMORPG's are all about, and I'll never get that wrapped up in one again.  I'll probably never even join any but the most casual of guilds imaginable.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I pre-ordered Doom3 from Amazon.  It will probably be waiting for me at work Monday morning.  That should hold me fine, especially when all the graphics lock up my computer completely.<br />
<br />
Anyway, take care.  If you post here when you get WoW, I'll see if I can come visit your server sometime and say hello. :)</div></div><hr />
