<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like to think that my gear is pretty nice for my level.  I am constantly upgrading when I can.  The Tae Ew stuff I had made after I got the components.  I should be able to gather the blood for some Tae Ew leggings shortly.<br />
The question is, what do I work for after that?  I have the leezard, but no JBB.  I don't think that I want to invest in the JBB since it supposedly looses it's usefullness in a few levels.  I have read the debate already so this isn't another thread on why I should have it.  What else should I look into?<br />
<br />
P.S. - I'm broke so I will have to farm money if it is going to be bought, or I can get a group of upper 50s-60 to try and drop mobs for stuff.<br />
Magelo in sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say upgrade your mask, cloak, shoulders and earrings to give more hp.  Those are some cool shoulders though, I wonder if you can use it from inventory?<br />
<br />
Anyway, look into the earrings from chardok that add hp/mana or save up for an earring of the solstice.  Mask I would try to find Crystal Spider Eyes.  Cloak and shoulders would be tougher to upgrade but you might find some good bargains in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take a tank, cleric, and a druid and head to Umbral to do Elysians for the druid.  In return, have the druid track the Corrupted Elysians.  They drop the Death Mask of the Elysians and the Death Watchers Shroud.  Stats for both are in my sig :)  Also if you have access to a Barbarian smith who is willing to cut you a deal, the Artificer's Ringmail Bracer and Skirt (belt) would been nice upgrades.  They can be a bit pricey though due to needing BDs to make the tempers.<br />

(Yes I know I need to do some upgrades on my own armor for my level :( )</div></div><hr />
