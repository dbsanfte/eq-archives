<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As before, I haven't played in years and would like to know how to travel to Dulak's Harbor.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From Tox forest, go to the Panieel newbie area, then into the warrens, coming out in Stonebrunt.  Stonebrunt to Gunthak harbor then Dulak.  You might wanna go to EQatlas for the maps of how to get through the warrens and Gunthak.<br />
<br />
The zone like from Stonbrunt to Gunthak is a boat that you click the door to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, any problems for a Lvl 36 Troll Shammy getting there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope a 37 troll should have no troubles and the mobs on the beach should be good experence for you.  Just be sure to get a map or two it'll help alot.  If you have not gotten any of these MAPS (http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/) then you should think of taking the time to download them they will help you out ALOT.  And you dont have to worry about finding your notebook/web page while wondering a zone.  These are maps for they LoY expansion (Activated by Backspace).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easier way - get a port to Stonebrunt and skip the run from Paineel.  From there it's like Zammatacus says, Stonebrunt-&gt;Gunthak-&gt;Dulak.<br />
<br />
And you know Dulak is a perfect place, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you do decide to hunt on the beach in Gunthak, I’d recommend keeping Lev up at all times.  If you get into trouble the run to the zone is not a long one, but you have to cross a lot of water to get back to the lighthouse.  For some reason the powers that be don’t seem to penalize mob movement speed in water like they do ours.  Even with 200 swimming I can’t keep ahead of them.  But with levitate you can quickly outrun them and zone out.  <br />
<br />
I cast levitate on myself any time I’m heading back to the lighthouse from Dulak.  Half the time my invisibility will drop half way through the tunnel and I have the rest of the tunnel following me to the water.  Trust me, lev can be a life saver.  And if you are in need of batwings, they are sold in the lighthouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">36 is too young for Dulak, he should stay in Gunthak.  Sure he could do it with a group but would be hard for him solo.</div></div><hr />
