<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jennahlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all =) 20th lvl shammy here and just had a quick question that im sure i will get /bonked for hehe.  what is this &quot;canni dance&quot; that i hear about? i know its a hotkey that yall set up but if it could be explained in depth to me that would be great...thx in advance  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Canni dancing is using the games refresh rate to gain a little more mona than normal.  The game sends information to the server every 6 seconds.  What you want to do is sit until the game sends the data packet (you will know it happens when you see your HP update) then stand up, cast canni and then sit down before the game sends the next packet.  That way you get the sitting mana and HP regen rates and can still canni at the same time.<br />
<br />
The hot key I use is<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 7 (use whatever spell slot canni is memorized in)<br />
/pause 15 (this number varies with your system, play with it a little)<br />
/sit</div></div><hr />
