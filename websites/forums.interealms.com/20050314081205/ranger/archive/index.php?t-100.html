<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyreliter</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a solitary  man with elvish features walks hesitantly up to the looming emptiness that is the lair of the legendary Numbuk, he notices an uneasy stillness.  He peers longingly into the gapping hole, wondering if the mighty ranger friend is just on one of his lengthy dorf hunts, or that the quiet of his lair is another sign that all is reborn in the annals of ranger lore. The man quickly returns to the edge of the forest, and gathers his belongings, eager to awaken a big fat, and surely juicy, dorf that is tethered behind the man's horse. The man takes the dorfs lead, checks its security again, and hastily secures it to a stalagtite in the lair (for we all know that dorfs can't reach them). For the man understands that the mighty orge takes a fancy to fresh dorf, and he is eager to draw the mighty ogre back to the glen where rangers gather to sing the ageless feats of past and present.  the man then draws up the horse's lead, and after he is upon the saddle, leads the horse deep into the forest once more.</div></div><hr />
