<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all i am wondering what s the selling price of the slugworms and black gold inlay from your server.<br />
<br />
i am from rathe and :<br />
<br />
slugworms going from 38 to 50K  (saw one slugworm acid for sale today (75K) ).<br />
the black gold inlay = 200 to 225 K<br />
<br />
the pure augments goes  from 450 to 550K usually........... :eek: <br />
<br />
i never see any discordant scoriae  for sell in bazaar yet   :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wayyyyy too much! lol...the only worms i ever got my claws on , i failed with=(<br />
<br />
the prices look quite similar, too bad the drops are switched...common flow stones...rare worms, rare stones, common flies...gah! the twisted logic!<br />
<br />
on an Upnote, My hubby is a GM jewler, together we have made some awesome augs, just need those drops to make em. (we dont sell them, they are for gifts and alliance game prizes)<br />
<br />
=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">slugworms? drinal, usually anywhere from 70-200k, depending on who is selling and if they know what they have....<br />
<br />
black gold inlay? never see one for sell, the scoriae itself goes for 150, so if I ever see one drop, I'll GM smithing just so I could make an inlay myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slugworms have been a bit cheaper laely, ranging from 50 to 75K, which is down from the 80-100K they have been commanding.  <br />
<br />
Black gold inlay is pretty rare to find, and goes for 300K +.  White gold is more common, and hovers around 30-40K.<br />
<br />
Nice augs with +4 focus effects run 250K-500K, Cleave 2 augs sell instantly at 400K.<br />
<br />
I hate Rodcets economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Fennin slugworms hover in the 50-60k range, but everyone once in awhile one will show up for much less. Aug parts for some reason have gotten very expensive...scoriaes go for 100-200k (which I understand), and the gem-stone type (citrine, etc.) sell for up to 200k as well. The odd thing is, becasue of this you can usually buy a completed aug for less then the price of making one yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zexxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh they still drop? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the Rathe I paid 410k for 2 black gold inlays. Didnt bother with Slugworms as I was lucky to get Radiant Cute Kyanites for a total of 550k for two of them.</div></div><hr />
