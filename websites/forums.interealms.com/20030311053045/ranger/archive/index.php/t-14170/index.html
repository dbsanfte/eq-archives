<br />
In my opinion, Bind Sight is one of the most under utilized and under appreciated spells in a Ranger's arsenal.  By using this simple spell, it is often possible to scout an entire zone by remote viewing.  Last night I toured almost the entire PoN zone without ever leaving the zone in area.  Simply target a mob, bind to it, then use the F9 key to switch to panoramic view.  Target the next mob and recast.  Using this method, one can hop around from mob view to mob view, garnering valuable recon data in areas not normally accessible.<br />
<br />
Try this out and practice using it.  At the very least, it gives you something to do while waiting for the cleric to med, etc..  Also comes in handy when you're sitting at the PoJ trails waiting for your turn.  You can watch the current group's progress and know how they are doing before it gets announced in OOC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a young Ranger who probably doesn't know any better, I too have found it useful.  Especially in dungeons that I don't know very well - cast it on MOb in the distance, go to a third-person (panoramic, I guess) view, and look around.<br />
<br />
In PvP, it's also a good &quot;junk&quot; buff spell to keep at the top of your buffs so you have an empty slot when fighting casters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arkus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used it a couple of weeks ago before going in and trying a trial.  It was neat to get a lay of the land before my turn was up.</div></div><hr />

Thanks and stay safe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea bind sights slick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used it once on Nagafen as we charged him.  That was way back when.  It was really kind of disconcerting to be in first person view with him and watch the horde descend.  :)<br />
<br />
I love the spell personally.  Not only is it very useful, it's also fun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apollyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like to Bind Sight with rogues, who can turn around and be my eyes when HoN'ing mobs in sticky situations.  Also, binding sight with roaming npc's is the next best thing to being there :)</div></div><hr />

/cheer Bind Sight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Timmit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bind sight lets you harmony around corners if a mob is handy (or a rogue with shroud of stealth is around).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SirTamalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that spell was fun until they neft to LoS now it suck like 95% of our spell. Beside if u want to know what mob up use your tracking silly ranger!</div></div><hr />

You either use Bind Sight and Harmony if Nature or youll get 3-8 pulls rather often. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This spell is actually fantastic for pulling Reavers in CoM if you don't feel like fighting your way all the way up or dont have a rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
get directly below a mob upstairs and use the command to target the nearest mob. It need not be the mob you're trying to pull it just needs to be somewhere close. Bind Sight to that mob and switch to one of the far-out 3rd person views. From there retarget your way until you can get the reaver. (Bind sight has no LOS or Range check.) Then cast on the mob with Jolt or cinder Jolt (neither of which have a LOS check either) Bam. now you have aggro but have inflicted 0 damage. No summoning, but be prepared to receive a train! ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Please tell me how YOU use it. In order to cast it on a MOB, do you need to actually see the MOB to cast it? Is it possible to cast it on a MOB who is not in line of site? If not, are you saying you cast it on a MOB and then hope they wander all over the place?<br />
<br />
Sorry, if I am being ignorant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You do need line of sight.. (And, on Sullon Zek, it's considered a beneficial spell, so you can't cast it on members of the opposing teams. But you can cast it in a MOb. Go figure.)<br />
<br />
Frequently, there will be a MOb that wanders away from the rest of its buddies, then wanders back in among them. That's the one you cast on.<br />
<br />
I haven't done the part about chain-casting it farther in, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Chain casting: So you are saying I cast it on MOB 1, who wanders off. MOB 1 see MOB2 and I cast it on MOB 2 through the eyes of MOB 1? Sort of like a virus spreading? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No, you do not need line of sight any more.  It was nerfed at one time so that you had to have line of sight to a target to use it but that was changed a few patches back.  The only requirements now to bind sight is to have the mob/NPC/Player targeted and be in the same zone.  Then with the use of the F9 key to pan out in third person view, you can target other mobs and recast onto them, hence jumping around from mob to mob and scouting at your leisure.<br />
<br />
By the way, this is an easy way to single pull the castle steps in PoD.  Bind to a wizard's Eye of Zomm and use it to harmony the firebone casters on the second flight of stairs.  Then do the same for the two deathbones up top.<br />
<br />
Just try it out and you will soon get the hang of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">long time ago me used this to hop all the way to the hand of veeshan in poa. has always been very useful, before and after the los nerf (its unnerfed atm).<br />
<br />
want to know if thought horror overfiend is up? warders in st? leave a corpse. if you can target your corpse (this worked even after the los nerf btw :D) you can bind sight on it. me will leave it to you to figure out how to target your corpse..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rainkng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aye.<br />
<br />
I use this spell all the time for all the reasons posted so far and also for just killing boredom while waiting for a raid to buff or pull to come in.<br />
<br />
But let's keep this quiet, ok?<br />
<br />
Would hate to see a stealth &quot;harmony&quot; nerf hit this spell as well.<br />
