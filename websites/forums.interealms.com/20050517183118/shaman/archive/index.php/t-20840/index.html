<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 65 upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inate dual weild<br />
Slight increase to HP and AC and maybe regen<br />
Add proc, spirit strike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit strike is a proc that will hit your target for 50 points of damage and steal their life and turn it into mana giving each person in the group 10-20  mana back from each proc. Can always change this to Life, but i think mana would be more productive.<br />
<br />
Yea i know its nuts and i been playing my SK too much, but hey, it would be cool ( and this isnt a negitive post .. yet ;) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Just tossing fun ideas around =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya, that would be nice to have, get the pet another purpose other then its poor DPS =/, but the odds of that happening are so bleak i cant even imagine it, also isnt spirit strike also a low end shaman nuke? was like 60 damage if i remember correct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pet idea: rideable dog pet with innate sow and duel wield.  Just walk close enough to target and have doggie mount attack it. :P I mean, what could be cooler than Shaman riding wolves.<br />
Ever gonna happen? No.  Fun as heck? Yes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh i dont know, i think your right, or its a BST spell i think actualy. I dunno, was just thinking of something fun off the top of my head. Kou made me laugh so mission accomplished  ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey, you never know when a silly idea is good or inspires someone to add to it and make a great idea anyway, right ? Besides, if i read one more post about our problems im going to explode ( yes im counting my posts  =p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spirit Strike is a lvl 14 spell that maxes 72 damage, BTW. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can just imagine the uproar from mages and necros if we got a pet that gave the entire group mana off procs... and chanters would be like.. yeah so.. our pets hit for a quadjillion hp's and outdamage entire raids.. kkthxdrivethru~</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hey why not, they gave the mages canabilize ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They nerfed pet Canni though..didn't they?<br />
<br />
Haha, Mage r teh SuXX0rz!!!11 <br />
<br />
I just hope I can still get my pet weapons, /hug a mage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They'd only make the proc super resistable  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey why not, they gave the mages canabilize ;)<br />
<br />
Yea, but poor magicians.. they lost their good mana regen from rods, and then reclaims... this addition was much needed because they kept getting nerfed left and right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why don't they just give us some of the Beastlord pet buffs.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords get a bunch of our skills (just at a later level).  Why can't we have a few of theirs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well we really have just a ton of pet AA -- it would be nice if they actually made our pet worth casting.  I rarely see shamans using one, personally.  The lifespan and DPS once you get to high levels makes them more trouble than they're worth in most situations.<br />
<br />
I remember back when I was in my 30's though...that pet was pretty darn strong.  I let him tank for me on rooted mobs while I canni'd and meditated and cast DOTs, then called him back and let him regen a bit and go again.  Compared to what he is and what he fought in the 60's, that 30's dog was pretty tough.<br />
<br />
I wish they hadn't wasted so many of our AA on that stupid dog at this point though.  Either that or made the dog stronger so that it was worth getting the AA.<br />
<br />
Pretty much how I feel about rabid bear.  For the great number of AA you can sink into it, you'd think it would actually be a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great ideas Litgruv and Koushirou, I liked both of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just walk close enough to target and have doggie mount attack it.<br />
<br />
GO GO CUJO HUMP ATTACK! Doggy-style kung fu!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Better be a pretty big wolf if you're going to throw an ogre on it.  Have to keep regen on your pet to heal the damage to his spine cause by &quot;Tiny&quot; the Ogre Shaman.<br />
And cats riding dogs?  Thats just wrong, like frogs on lizards. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personaly id be happy if they changed pet to a monk giving him inate duel weld and an extra damage attack.  <br />
<br />
Still trying to figure out how we ended up with a &quot;warrior&quot; that tanks and hits like a bard with a bad voice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You just wanna see dogdog do a flying kick, admit it :p  (actually, that'd be pretty damn cool)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">http://www.johnohab.com/celebritydoubles/images/co9-small.jpg <br />
<br />
Move over BST &amp; Mages. Here's the new shaman pet all new and vastly improved. Comes full featured at lvl 65 with such attacks as the flying &amp; donkey kicks, can gore your enemies and includes a new gas attack that leaves land mines behind for when you gotta make it to the zone with those nastys on your tail! Another welcome addition to the pet is it now plays sustenance for your party no longer will you eat or drink those stat boosting foods with the everflowing abundance of milk, cheese and hamburger from your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">http://www.dfcom.freeserve.co.uk/hbw/images/hkp_chop.gif <br />
<br />
Ok so this would me more like our real pet. All show and no action being totally inept having others actually do the work and pull you through just like the real Hong Kong Phooey, guess that makes us Spot.<br />
<br />
P.S. For those not old enough to remember Hong Kong Phooey always screwed up and Spot his trusty sidekick bailed him out without him ever noticing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A cow pet would rock.  Especially a kung-fu cow.  I might start xping again for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i would exp again, 20 AA if needed for a kung fu cow.</div></div><hr />
