<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so far I've got Malo, Torpor, and Bane of Nife (my spellbook is gimptastic). Pox is never gonna happen, I'm still two levels away from Bane and have 0% progression towards Anathema. Epic's still waiting on that damn tear.<br />
<br />
So what I was wondering is, is there any place that's pretty good, safe solo exp? I've tried PoI/PoD but that's kinda lame with only Ebolt and BoN chewing on a mob's hp. I was thinking deeper parts of droga would be somewhat efficient. <br />
I have about 4300hp fully buffed, 900ac (my gear's worse than my spellbook), and no AA that would be conducive to soloing.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I'm on a pvp server, so tier two zones are pretty much out... all the fef xteamers on my server live there with their alts it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly it sounds like the best thing for you is to find somewhere to group and grind through some XP to get to 65.  Root rotting is much easier at 65.  If you can't get a group, find a partner you can work with.  Duoing opens a much wider range of options.<br />
<br />
Never played on a PvP server but common areas to get quick levels on blue servers include BoT, PoTactics, PoV, etc.  Unfortunately it sounds like these aren't available for ya so maybe:<br />
<br />
Droga - Poor xp for the trouble, but easy kills and decent drops.  This zone is well known so you may have trouble there from others looking for an easy PK.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia - About the same as Droga, but a little further out so likely less competition.<br />
<br />
The Deep - Almost no-one goes here so it's fairly safe.  Not great drops, but the XP isn't bad.  You would need to be proficient at handling 2 or more mobs for break-in.  I'd recommend invising somewhere out of the way to avoid the occasional ZI train.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - I think you are high enough level now to single the mushrooms.  Extremely boring but not much to worry about.<br />
<br />
Madien's Eye - Should be able to find a nice corner to pull the roamers to. Never really camped here so no idea of the XP/ Drops.<br />
<br />
The Umbral Plains - Same as Madien's Eye but a bit higher level.<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins - Should be able to camp the entry hallway for decent xp.<br />
<br />
LoY - Many good spots in LoY.  XP isn't bad and drops are decent.  Out of the way so very little competition.  Try any of the camps in Nadox, ZI at Hates, Nadox ZI at Torigan, luggald caves in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate - ZI mobs are easy.  Also some nice places close to the ZI where you can hunt.  The marsinger quests are well worth doing.  CRs are a pain here though.<br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto - Stay away from the ZI/ZO and you can do well here.  XP isn't great but the place is easy to get to now that PoM is in the GD.  This is a bit rougher than most of the other places I mentioned since a lot of it is under water.<br />
<br />
Chardok - You could probably do the entry hallway / ZO area.  ZO is a bit harder to break but easier since you can run to ZO when in trouble.<br />
<br />
Skyfire - Lots of wanderers here that should be in your range.  I hunted the Chrono's for the essence of sunlight that sold very well.  But, I also had a duo and could handle the debuffing.<br />
<br />
City of Mist - You might still get some xp from some of the mobs near the castle.  Was decent XP and not too dangerous.<br />
<br />
Old Seb - Several camps here you should be able to do.<br />
<br />
Veksar - Entrance gobbies are in your range and the faction for the non-Iksar is good.  Be sure to do the weapon turn-in quest.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - Easy access now since it is in the GD.  Do the halflings along the castle wall and the yard trash.  Be sure to figure out where the ZO tree is in the courtyard before you agro anything.  Lots of spell component drops here so get an idea of what you need and watch for it.  You can help fill your spellbook as you get xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of these places work well for me, but I've got a duo monk that I use and both toons are 65 with decent armor, complete spell book, 85 AAs, etc.  You should be able to find some places here that fit your level and resources.<br />
<br />
I can't emphasize enough that getting to 65 will tremendously help your ability to solo.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Volotani, always good to see Vallon Zek shaman putting in an appearance. If you see me in game, send me a /tell - I occasionally have spare shaman spells or even gear in the bank for giving away to worthy causes!<br />
<br />
In terms of good soloing spots, Tsuyoi gives a good set of pointers, but if you specifically want spots that are not too PvPcentric, here are a few ideas based on VZ:<br />
<br />
Veksar - You can do Veksar fine from 61 onwards, by either root rotting or Letting 61 pet tank. |seems you dont have Bane or anathema, so pet tanking is probably the way. (Poison &amp; disease DoTs will not stick). I used to pull with Malo, then send Dogdog (dogdog would get aggro), cast Slow, tank for like 2 or 3 rounds because of aggro from Slow, then back off and let puppy tank while I cast Epic Dot and medded / Torpored back up. <br />
<br />
The exp is not spectacular, but there are plenty of named that drop loot that sells for anywhere between a few hundred plat to 20k plat. at this stage you will probably only be able to do the easier named, but some of that stuff sells for 2 or 3k a piece.<br />
<br />
N.B. You need IVU potions for Veksar, and Suspended Minion 2 is a huge benfit, but not an essential requirement<br />
<br />
Dulak / Nadox<br />
These zones are good because they are so &quot;uncamped&quot;. the exp is not spectacular, but there are a few named that drop ok bazaar loot.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for advancement is IMO, Lost Dungeons - you will always get faster exp doing LDoNs than you will soloing, and you will be earning valuable points for spells and gear upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would try soloing in Plane of Justice.  Go down to the prisoner rooms and park yourself in a corner,  most of the mobs are casters and so have few hp but can catch you with nukes if you're not careful. <br />
<br />
Start in a room with 2 or few prisoners and back into a corner.  Pull with slow and you should be ok.  Once you get to know what prisoner is what class it becomes even easier as you can pick and choose your targets.<br />
<br />
Be careful about your faction,  I think you start at neutral to both sides and you can go back and forth keeping your faction at neutral and get great exp, the occasional nice drop (shaman spear with a healing proc is one of these) and gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Though I don't play on a PVP server, I thought of a few places you might like to try with your server as a consideration.  There have already been some good suggestions, so I won't go over ground that's already been covered.  I would echo the advice to group your way to 65 though, be it in Adventures or elsewhere.  <br />
<br />
My soloing recommendations:<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule.  There are very few see-invis mobs in the zone, so you can travel around fairly safely while invis, and the mobs don't have an amazing number of hitpoints that I recall &amp; many/most are dark blue.  Don't tangle with anyone camping the FT3 boots and you should be fine - the zone is frequently empty for long periods of time in my experience.  It is also close to a PoK stone, so travel time isn't too high.  Easy to get in &amp; out of, and you can bind either at the PoK stone (so you don't get bind camped) or right outside of CT itself, allowing for fast recovery in gate situations.  I recommend you bypass the zone-in mobs and go straight to the maze area.<br />
<br />
Not sure if The Hole  will be light or dark blue for you, but same sort of thing there (except travel time is longer &amp; exiting is more dangerous beyond the ledge).  Nice out of the way area that shouldn't be crowded.<br />
<br />
If your CoV faction is good, I'd also recommend Western Wastes.  Leave the dragons alone, and kill the animals - velium hounds, brontotheriums, and the drakes that don't give faction hits.  Dust off your level 9 spell Sense Animals (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=238&amp;source=Live), and you will never lack for targets even when you are snow-blinded. :D   You will have to keep your eye out for transiting raid forces who might try to pick you off as they head to NToV, but you can bind anywhere in the zone so gate should be a decent escape option for you.<br />
<br />
If your faction is thrashed with CoV, you could try farming the nested dragons instead of the animals, though it isn't for the faint of heart.  Rezzes may be a problem if things go South however.  Realize once you are KoS to CoV mobs, traveling through WW becomes much more treacherous.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
