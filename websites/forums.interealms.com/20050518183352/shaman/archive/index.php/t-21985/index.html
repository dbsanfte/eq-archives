<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems that most of the fuss around our class balancing has to do with healing.  And, secondly with the fact that stat buffs are worthless.  Well, it &quot;appears&quot; that the stat buffs are being &quot;reworked&quot; for the new expansion so it would be premature to comment on that.<br />
<br />
Healing.  First, I want to say that I don't agree that this should be our &quot;primary&quot; issue with class balance . . . and here is my reason.  I was on a raid with 60+ folks last night in CoD for flagging.  Of the classes present, the majority were clerics.  I'd say the class makeup looked like this.  This is a good estimate based on who I remember buffing.<br />
<br />
Clerics       9<br />
Druids       6<br />
Rangers     6<br />
Chanters    6<br />
Mages       5<br />
Paladins     5<br />
Warriors     5<br />
Monks        5<br />
Wizards      3<br />
Necros       3 <br />
BLs            2<br />
SKs            2<br />
Shaman      2<br />
Rogues       1?<br />
<br />
This was a two-guild event and the other shaman is in my guild; so, the other guild didn't even field a shaman, not even a bot.<br />
<br />
If there are 9 clerics and 6 druids, why the heck do I want to heal?  There is no need for me to heal.  What would be useful, IMO, would be useful stat buffs (which looks like SOE is working on), useful cripple, useful slow, etc. . . . the same thing we used to do well but now content excludes it.<br />
<br />
Granted, I'm talking about a raid, not a Gates trial (which I have not done).  But, let's face it, the other classes aren't going to take us for our healing anyway.  Yes, we should be viable healers in XP groups and to some extent are not, but SOE will never make us &quot;real&quot; main healers for any &quot;end&quot; content.<br />
<br />
I post this in hoping we can work towards goals that are actually reasonable to expect from the Devs, and pesonally, I don't think main healing is what they have in mind.  I feel like our community is beating a dead horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look more closely at your own numbers.  Which class has the least?  It's not the &quot;balanced&quot; ones if you get my drift.  Rogues seem a bit abnormally low, large burnout ratio among them I've seen.  But hey, they might need some balancing too.  To be given something FUN to do might be &quot;balancing.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure I catch your drift, Lan.  Yeah, the rogues surprised me, and sorry, I totally left out Bards, of which there were two also.  My apologies to my music playing friends.<br />
<br />
My point was why do I want the role that is already so vastly taken . . . i.e. healing. /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not fair to call us unbalanced because there's not 9 of us in a raid.<br />
<br />
Clerics are the most, because in most raids, they have to be the most.   When you can't get enough clerics, you tack on enough druids to help make up... and lastly shamans.    If some night all your clerics show up, fine, your druids can backup heal and nuke.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly confident that when looking at a class, you have to look at <br />
<br />
- Solo Play<br />
- Group Play<br />
- Raid Play<br />
<br />
These are 3 very different aspects, which people all enjoy differently.  For some, Soloing is what they want most... not having to bother with groups, or only have a short time, or just want to stay away from people in general... WHATEVER.<br />
<br />
Some people like to raid... just look at the &quot;casual vs uber&quot; debates... not every &quot;non-raider&quot; is &quot;casual&quot;.   I certainly logged enough hours on EQ, but didn't look for a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Finally there's the people who just enjoy a good group, hanging with friends, whatever.<br />
<br />
The fact is, classes typically fit into some of these different, and have almost forever.<br />
<br />
* Shamans are excellent soloers.<br />
<br />
* Shamans are very good in groups - could we be better... sure... the new &quot;faster fight&quot; style doesn't go well with the slow process, but we still do offer a lot, and depending on the content can be healers. <br />
<br />
* Shamans are &quot;required&quot; for raids, however you truly require only 1.   That might be a busy job, and a bit riskier, but you really truly NEED 1 shaman... after that, more is gravy, backup, share duties, etc...   Except for the healing, shamans don't &quot;stack&quot; well on raids.<br />
<br />
Of course these are &quot;generalizations&quot; but I believe them to be mostly accurate.<br />
<br />
Now lets compare to the clerics.<br />
<br />
* Clerics are pitiful soloers.   They CAN solo some things... but really, it's not productive.      It's not that clerics want to be massive soloers, it's the &quot;I just have 30 minutes and wanna do something&quot;... or can't find a group.<br />
<br />
* Clerics are very good in groups.   I don't say &quot;Excellent&quot; here because it really depends on the content... the older the content is, the more shamans and druids have been able to replace them... whereas in the GoD content, it's more &quot;cleric required&quot; (I'm not saying REQUIRED FOR EVERYTHING... just leaning more to them in most cases, if not required).    Clerics still shine in groups, but in cases where hardcore healing is not required, you can substitute more DPS.<br />
<br />
* Clerics are Excellent in raids.    They stack almost indefinately.   This is because of the way a lot of content is designed sadly... but it's still a reality of the game.    <br />
<br />
So right there... when you look at a raid... almost always you'll find a ton of clerics... and maybe not so many shamans.    All it does is show the balancing in the &quot;raid&quot; portion of the game.<br />
<br />
While not every shaman wants to solo... we have exceptional soloing skills, and that IS part of class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually the only thing it shows is the holy trinity extrapolated to raid numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, Sariss, I disagree.  Soloing is NOT part of class balance.  That's also from Brenlo, btw--I forget where, but I'm sure someone has a link to the quote.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point being, the strongest emphasis in the game is on grouping.  There is also an emphasis on raiding (people will disagree how much of an emphasis or whether it's right, but it's there nonetheless).  There is a significant DIS-emphasis on soloing.  Exp nerfs, random unrootable/unsnareable mobs, etc.  Groups get significant exp bonuses--you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if shaman are being penalized for our ability to solo, then SoE isn't following their own guidelines.  Soloing is pointless, boring, and slow.<br />
<br />
Class balance is supposed to be (and should be) a feature of grouping ability and (to a lesser extent) raid stackability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree about soloing being slow, and mostly boring.  Not sure I'd say &quot;pointless&quot;... it's nice to be able to solo some things &quot;just because&quot; or to go kill some time... or to go farm parts of your VT key without help when you're really bored, even just that you want to be alone for a bit, and still grind out a few points.<br />
<br />
Soloing is what people always harp on... soandso can solo, soandso can kill this mobs solo, etc... because as we all know, some classes can, and some can't... I think that's also being addressed in EQ 2 and WoW... I believe almost any class CAN solo with skill, even if it's not the best way to go. (I mean moreso than clerics CAN solo now... it's kinda pathetic next to a shaman).<br />
<br />
I was happy with the ability to solo.    I'd say I spent 80% of my time to 60 soloing... mainly because I had deleted my old characters, restarted, and finding groups in the middle level ranges wasn't always easy.<br />
<br />
But after 60... I'd say I spent 98% of my time in groups... it's what I wanted... being ABLE to solo was a great class advantage, for those who want to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not saying it isn't nice to be able to do it, but SoE has officially said that the ability to solo is not, and should not, be considered part of class balance.  Like I said, hopefully some nice person can link or paste the exact quote.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We should not be punished in other areas for our ability to solo . . . just as Clerics should not be punished for their group desireability with poor solo abilities.  I would fully support anything that gave Clerics more solo ability . . . so long as it did not make them even MORE desireable for groups.<br />
<br />
THAT is class balance.  If it's a hard line to walk, so be it.  That's what the devs get paid for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You are over-estimating our solo ability.  Can I solo?  sure I can.  I can't solo anywhere near as good as a druid can however.  Druids have DC and can even charm animals in tipt for insane DPS.  Druids can quad at the tables in fire, etc.<br />
<br />
I do solo and duo a bit, but at EP+ level, I don't bother to solo much.  I get so much better exp in a earth, or fire group.  Hell, I have gotten very decent exp doing the vxed / tipt trials ( but that is only cause chanters charm is broken and the whole group leached exp from him ).<br />
<br />
So, if your argument is that we solo better than the other priests, just remember, druids solo much better, and still get better heals.</div></div><hr />
