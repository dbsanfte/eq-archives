<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that you can MultiQuest the epic if other person have the maxed faction with spirits and has the extra PoF child's tear to turn in.<br />
<br />
I also heard that, I can build and max the faction by doing the Woe and Envy part over and over.<br />
<br />
So my question is this.<br />
I so far completed my Epic quest up to The &quot;Three Books of Lord Ghiosk&quot; and already have turned those 3 books in.<br />
So how many times do I have to repeat the Woe and Envy part before I have enough faction to MQ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need MAX ALLY (meaning &quot;Your faction with TrueSpirit could not possibly get any better&quot;) before attempting the MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About 4-5 times, if you also repeat the gem hand-in step in EJ as well. Those two steps each give a lot of Truespirit faction.<br />

<br />
I have the tear and dont ever see being able to complete the rest of the quest. Further, I dont have a dime...<br />
<br />
Do you think one would pay a little bit for this part of the quest?</div></div><hr />

No, you must complete the epic first before you can MQ the tear as far as I understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lies yatta, i wasn't max and got faction and still wasn't max from final turn in hit, I MQed the tear with a guildie ( -_-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">trust me first hand, you must have MAX ALLY to do this. i lost my scale from rak when i turned it into the spirit. luckily i said the spirit said nothing back and re-got my scale. so now i have to do tedious faction to get it all back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The faction hit for envy/woe is no where near as big as it used to be. I did everything but the hole part and probably turned in about 15 sets of items to that stupid wisp to get max ally + several sets of books and reports as well as at least one extra black dire pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Do envy/woe and then do the gem turn in to spirit in ej also. Only takes about 5 or 6 round trips for max ally.</div></div><hr />

i completed my epic and rested my truespirt so if its possible to mq again you would have to do endless factioning<br />
