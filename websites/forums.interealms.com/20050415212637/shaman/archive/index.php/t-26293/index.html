<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>souryo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting ready to start up a shammy alt to play along side a younger brother's Shadowknight character and thought I would throw this question out there.<br />
<br />
Looking for thoughts on most enjoyable race? based on Quest's and such.<br />
 I ask because I love my troll SK main but dont want to Faction grind (again :D) we will not be twinking, just exploring EQ zones and questing.<br />
<br />
Thnks- and did check the &quot;best race&quot; post's but all were pretty old (03' ish)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vah Shir have a lot going for them race-wise. For one, they get innate safe fall and I think some sneak as well. The also have NO XP penalty, like Trolls, Ogres, Iskar and Barbs. I am not 100% sure, but I think they also have some form of night vision. They aso start with good faction all over the place. All that, and the only downside is that they consume more food than other races. If I had to re-make my shaman, I would probably go Vah Shir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gotta agree with Blazz here.  Vah Shir have it all, they are like a Cadillac™ for the price of a Camry™.  I love the Troll for roleplay and look, but Vah Shir also look very cool and have way to may good features to overlook.  Frogloks also have no XP penalty that I am aware of but I will not play a Frog till they leave Grobb.  Iksar are also a great choice, mostly for forage as they are the only Shaman race that is able to do so they have other inate abilities that like the Troll cost WAY too much to be worth the XP penalty.  Ogres are fun offering great opportunity for roleplay and being frontal stun immune is a great plus as well.  Barbarians are the 'boring' choice to me as they are most common in Norrath in the Shaman croud and are little more than larger Humans in appearance.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so long winded, but voting Vah Shir here as well.</div></div><hr />

Just think how impressive it was the first time you saw a lvl 60 troll! back when 59 took.. umm months.<br />
Make sure you pick Inny as your diety so you can get a snare necklace !<br />
Sks are evil anyway.. so any faction stuff will be the same for you. besides.. how many troll shammies you see running around?<br />
Not to mention the role play factor. regen. good night vision. and finally ---being able to own HFL guards with no cares in the world.<br />
<br />
If you are not twinking.. dont forget such cool little quests like the freindship ring in sharvalh and the scavenger satchel in SWT. then the trader quest in shadowhaven.. be lvl 5 before you kill a single mob (well except for the tutorial kobold.)</div></div><hr />

but thats just me putting out irrelevant info. I play a barbarian shaman, and I enjoy it immensely.<br />
<br />
no real faction issues.<br />
<br />
no night-vision, but you don't really need it once you get acumen.<br />
<br />
no safe-fall, who cares, I can take a hit, sometimes I jump off ledges just to get a bigger hit. :P<br />

I still think male barbarians looked a lot more manly and appealing pre-models, w/ polar bear hats.  Which is weird considering I play a female barbarian and do like it as a race.  I think maybe what I don't like is the postures/stances on the updated models.  /shrug<br />

Why wait till level 56 for Acumen (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1575&amp;source=Live) when you can Serpent Sight (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=276&amp;source=Live) + Spirit Sight (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=79&amp;source=Live) at level 9?<br />
<br />
I remember a discussion of old where a Barbarian used the HUGE downfall off being 'nightblind' to help justify the 20% racial penalty of Trolls/Iksar... teehee.  Lightstones (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=10300) being sooooooooooo rare and dropping sooooooooooo far away from the native birthplace of Barbarians and all. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From a roleplaying aspect I love the Barbarian.  The sight issue isn't really relevant I think because we get sight buffs and there is enough gear out there with See Invis effect on it, ie. Fearune.  On the RP aspect I mentioned, Barbarians are the only true pure race in Norrath.  Not melded from two things or spawned from some gods disgusting visage of what he wants.  It also ties in to the Tribunal feeling of not following anyone and only doing what is just.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depends on what it is exactly you are looking for in quests.<br />
<br />
Froglocks have more &quot;newbie&quot; quests I seem to recall, given they were last implimented.<br />
<br />
However, you are duo'ing with an SK.  You'll never get into each others cities.  Also the quests you will get to later, would be on alot of opposing factions.<br />
<br />
SKs are inherantly evil.  A troll or ogre would compliment one best, but you said you didnt want faction work...<br />
<br />
The most &quot;neutral&quot; one would be Vah Shir, but not too sure how they stack in the quest department.<br />
<br />
Iksar's have alot of nice quests, wouldnt have to worry about faction, since you're hated everywhere, just kill indescriminately.  And he can be SK of same race = lots of duo power.<br />
<br />
Human SKs might work well with Barbs.  Dont recall my starting faction in Halas (it's in the tanker now, mwahaha).<br />

You forget, that the Barbarians were created by the Marr Twins and not by the Tribunal! If I remember correctly E.Marr gave birth to the first Barbarian, and I admit I would love to see a E. Maar Shaman, following the Spirit of Love.  :D <br />
Even more I would love to see a barbarian Paladin. I really hope that maybe sometime in the future, the Race/Class restriction will be lifted in EQ 1 also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Myself, I'm very happy being a vah Shir.  I rolled a vah shir, primarily because most shamans were barbarians, trolls were fugly, and I hadn't learned of the Iksar lore.  So I wanted to be different and went kitty.  As for vah Shir veing shamans and gods and what have you, I see no issue, as a shaman is more or less similar if not the same as a tribal witchdoctor if you will, a practitioner(SP?) of voodoo and such.  They don't rely on gods per se, but the majiks of the world.. sort of :p<br />
Plus, we're the only race that has no belief in gods, all we do is through our written documents of Vah Shir lroe. yay for history!<br />
<br />
Although, if I wished to re-roll, I could be persuaded to roll an iksar shaman, simply for the roleplay/lore that comes along with being a handbag.. err Iksar.  If you're into the roleplay/lore thing, perhaps Iksar, otherwise vah shir.<br />
<br />
And as for safe fall, as an example, I've sen people jump from top spiders in velks, and eat a 20k when they hit the ground... with a innate 50 Safe fall.. and if I accidentally fall, I eat like... 600damage. woohoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Frontal stun immunity is game breaking, so there's no question about what the &quot;best race&quot; is.<br />
<br />
Frontal stun immunity is very nice for tanks, especially casting tanks (SKs, BSTs and, of course, the Secret Order of Ogre Paladins), but I don't know if I would give up my Troll Shaman's snare neckalce and higher regeneration for it.<br />
<br />
Counting the number of times I (or somebody else) died because I couldn't channel through stuns, I come up with, um, somewhere between 1 and 5, which is not that big a deal over 65 levels and 30something AAs. On the other hand, the number of camps I could hold because of the snare necklace was fairly significant, although I much prefer having a real snarer in group. Also, the total amount of HP regained over the same period of time because of the extra regen was in the seven, if not eight, digit range, so that's somewhat significant too in terms of mana/time saved.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's just one casual Troll's (who doesn't tank much except low blues, LDON and such) perspective, perhaps things are different if you solo or raid much.<br />
<br />
Overall, Ogres are the only other race that I would even consider when making a Shaman. They are the only ones aside from us, Trolls, who appreciate the fine art of Halfling cooking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd remake my troll into an ogre for Frontal stun immunity in a second if I could.<br />
<br />
Snare necklace was nice and all... but not being stunned is just awesome.  <br />
<br />
Thats how I die 90% of the times on raid, slow X, slow Y, slow Z... tanks didn't pickup Z.  Bam Bam Bam as mob Z rips me a new.. you know.. start to cast heal on myself..YOU ARE STUNNED.. LOADING...<br />

<br />
It depends. I am pretty casual and I never minded the XP penalty.<br />
<br />
Pre-Luclin Troll graphics, though -- now, that was a thing a beauty! Post-Luclin it was borderline acceptable at best. /sigh<br />
<br />
Besides, Trolls are so very very me. Roleplaying a Halfling hunting Troll chef feels absolutely natural the way a Barbarian or a Frog could never be. But to each his own, of course.</div></div><hr />

Cats and frogs are pretty boys. Cats only class choice should be bards, frogs should be deleted, and gukta should be returned to the trolls (who only lost it due to GM intervention!)<br />

<br />
If I had to do it over again, Id be torn between Vah Shir and Ogre; Vah Shir because no matter how much anyone tries to deny it, any exp penalty just sucks, and Ogre because Stun immunity is close to godlike.  <br />
<br />
All in all, Id probably go Ogre, even though frontal stun immunity might be worth 15% of my exp at level 45, but not at 70.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Vah Shir, hands down. Safe fall has got to be the best racial ability ever. I know for a fact it has saved me many many deaths. Gotta love jumping into the tactics pit for 350 damage while other people who try it get a good old 20k.<br />
<br />
Sneak...second best racial ability ever. I'm a quest freak, and sneak gives you the option of using the &quot;secret handshake&quot; instead of spending mindless hours painfully working up faction. Haven't tried it on the newer quests, but it worked just fine for things like the old VP key, shadowhaven merchants. Anything you can do with instant indiff faction can be done with sneak.<br />
<br />
The only other races with significant advantages are trolls (jeez a clicky snare would be nice), and ogres who are immune to frontal stuns. Incidentally, these are both ugly and evil, and have xp penalties, while Vah Shir do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SAFE FALL.<br />
<br />
Get it.  Use it.  Love it.<br />
<br />
No other shaman race avoids cheese damage while SoW'd by stepping over rocks.<br />
<br />
No other shaman race can fall into the OT pit because of lag, fall from the top to the bottom, and take ABSOLUTELY NO DAMAGE WHATSOEVER.<br />
<br />
That was the moment I fell in love with Safe Fall, cause I was on a CR, and losing a naked corpse with shortened rez timer cause of nakedness in OT pit really woulda sucked.<br />
<br />
That was the RNG pulling off the miracle check on my Safe Fall, hahahaha.<br />
<br />
Safe Fall clearly makes Vah Shir the superior race.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Seriously crying over Safe Fall when you have Levitation, componentless mind you, and frontal stun immunity is not enough for me.

Snare?- In the high end, I know not one Shaman that prefers the old root and rot to straight out tanking those bad boys.<br />
<br />
I know I know, the arguement to ensue is we all aren't Time geared, and that's cool.  Everyone has a preference, but I wanted to bring light to this fellow, that depending on what your long term goals are, any race is pretty good for a Shaman.  I still out regen most/all the Troll Shaman on my server with careful gear selection, have went passed the stun thing with AA's and gear, Snare never needed it when I'm tanking, and I love factioning whether I need it or not.  Questing has always been a favorite of mine, I know it's not for some.<br />
<br />
I think one question you have to ask yourself here is how much are you willing to put into your Shaman.  I think I speak for all of us when I say no matter what race you pick, the Shaman has much to offer you as long as you are willing to learn.  I mean search some other communities for classes and tell me if you really think they have a love for their class like us . . well maybe Necro/Rogues, but screw them!  :)<br />
<br />
Out of all the points for picking a certain race listed by our great Shamans all over Norrath, no one mentioned or said, &quot;yes I wish I had that but I adpated.&quot;  Shaman=adaptation, overcome.  There is alwatys a way for you to get around any problems you encounter.<br />
<br />
And yes I know about the Marrs, but you missed the point :)  They are still only the pure, not breed from an evil design that eventually backfired on the God who thought it, not a terrible disease bred from a rock and a puss filled boil and then given +2 regen and a &quot;I'm sorry note&quot;, and not some meathead experiment that went terribly wrong and they can't even speak properly so they were given an ability to never be able to be shut up so they annoy you further , ROFL.  I keed of course. . . or do I?<br />
<br />
Have fun with it, but remember, if you give it your all ,this class I mean, this lifestyle, you won't turn back . . .So be ready.  Much love for the Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Iksar, by far because we're just that cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Iskars rock. I love them And with PoK who the hell needs faction? lol. I remember being  little lizard b4 PoK, the good ol days of running into a town praying invis don't break while waiting on the boat. Damn fishermen!!!... <br />
<br />
Anyway, yea.. now a days with PoK around, the hated faction from every race for the poor, misunderstood Iksar isn't really a huge deal anymore. <br />
<br />
As for quests.. wouldn't seriously know. I did one armour quest for kaz it' wasn't terrible, wasn't great either. Other than that, I'm not much of a quester. Did the epics of course though hehe.<br />
<br />
I also love the forage that they have, (though i get more food than drink, /sigh..) But it is a nice little ability to have.<br />
<br />
Guess it kinda depends what your looking for. If it's quests, you probly want a good race that can go wherever, for some quests have you go to good towns like freeport where ever (like the epic does). I don't know though, guess ogres/trolls can go to the evil towns for whatever. But, if your looking for a questing type mode, best bet is probly va shir/ barb, probly even frog. With good faction, you'll be able to do more questing I'm sure. (Just guessing though.) As for exp penalty, seriously, when your playing the game doing your thing, enjoying whatever it is your doing, you don't seriously think about it. I never did. Had the hell levls, which were really hell. Beyond that, the exp wasn't seriously all that bad depending where you were. /shrug.<br />
<br />
G'luck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">And if you noticed no one mentioned frogs, cause no one respects frogs, and no one should.<br />
<br />
Naw, but seriously, look at the choice your son is makeing and look at how your choice will fit in with that one depending on the factions since it looks like your going a different route from most here would do now.<br />
<br />
btw, frogs marr, marr=the anti-sk, froggy be kos anywhere near where your sons welcome and no invis till 35 or so.<br />
<br />
So again i reiterate no one should play food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">mmmmmm frog legs!!! <br />
<br />
There' I mentioned frogs for ya! /innocent look..<br />
<br />
I don't like frogs for the mere fact they took my bf's warrs home town away from him and he has to share with the dark elves. That was just wrong... The swamp has more than enough space for both frogs and trolls!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I prefer Iksar.<br />
<br />
Yes, we have to put up with bad faction because the other races are jealous that Iksar are the most Handsome race around. But at least I don't worship some pansy god of Justice (as if there is such a thing) or War (Destruction is not the true power in the Universe) or Hatred (which only blinds you to true power). I serve Cazic-Thule, the God of FEAR, the ultimate power over the creatures of Norrath.<br />
<br />
It took me a bit more experience to level, but that just gave me the time to enjoy myself and to spread fear amongst the lesser creatures of Norrath, especially those little snack foods from Ak'anon.<br />
<br />
With the release of DoN, I am back to doing what I was born to do, ridding Norrath of the foul corruption of Dragonkind. While the soft-skins (Elves, Humans, etc.) are fit for slaves once they've been properly broken, Dragons are an abomination. They dared to fight against the mighty Iksar, and many of them have already perished. They, like the corrupted Sarnak of Chardok, will be completely destroyed by the forces of Cabilis.<br />
<br />
That said, pick whatever race you like. In the end the biggest differences are in the mind of the player. That is roleplay. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Snare?- In the high end, I know not one Shaman that prefers the old root and rot to straight out tanking those bad boys.<br />
<br />
Root/rotting and tanking are one thing, but snare is a who different ballgame. Pretty crummy snare, unfortunately, but it has its uses.<br />
<br />
I know I know, the arguement to ensue is we all aren't Time geared, and that's cool.<br />
<br />
Speaking of gear, it's interesting that nobody has commented on the large races' superior starting STA, especially Ogres' and to a lesser extent Trolls'. Makes it much easier to max out STA at lower levels. Even at 65, I don't think my mostly Bazaar equipment would get me to max STA (buffed) if I were an Iksar or a Frog and not a Troll.</div></div><hr />

I never even considered that. 'Coming of age' when I did, every bit of gear I owned had +6 Sta or +6 Wis on it until those were each over the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Oh sure, any race can do the Skyiron cudgel quests, if you don't mind the days of factioning.<br />
<br />
I didn't include stats because it's way too easy to max out stamina or wisdom with gear and buffs.</div></div><hr />
