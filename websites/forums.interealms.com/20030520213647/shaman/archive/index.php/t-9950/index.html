<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I two box shaman (55) and  monk (who will hit 40 this weekend).  My pet project has been the monk, I've gotten her to 40 in about 6 weeks.  Now I'm starting to look over my gear.<br />
Because with my RL situation, it wouldn't be fair to a guild or group to tie myself to them. (6 month old baby means I often log on for 20 minutes of play time, or 45 minutes, RARELY more than 2 hours at a stretch). Although I pickup group with friends when possible, 90 percent of the time it's just me and myself.  I have some decent gear for the lvls, but because I am not guilded it is all DROP gear. I am starting to look wi****lly at the No Drop stuff, as it seems once you're over lvl 50 you'll never be considered well geared off of strictly purchasable gear. <br />
<br />
So, my question... are there places I can go with just these two for gear, or am I pretty much stuck with my buyable gear? Will I ever be able to do places like Kael for the quest armor, considering my play time limitations.  And have I overlooked some obvious pieces that I can get?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The main difficulty is that a lot of no-drop stuff is hard to get with just two comps.  I was able to pick up some minor items, like the Improved Healing 2 item in Trak's Teeth (Meditative Blanket), but I know that the really good stuff that I see on the websites is out of my reach unless I get guilded or start going LFG more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 60+ you can 2 Box kael bank fairly easily.<br />
<br />
That will let you work on thurg armor.  55 is still pretty low to get most no drop stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not entirely true that you cannot be geared well of purchaseable gear, btw.  I frequent HoT with my guild (with my 61 wiz, though the same will hold true with htis toon), and honestly, very few pieces are an upgrade over my purchaseable gear.  Now, if you're talking ST or VT gear, then that's a different story, but most people will not see those zones, especially if they have a life and a family.  Grats on the baby, btw  =)<br />
<br />
As to the gear you are wearing, there are several upgrades that you can purchase that will go a long way.  Earring of the Solstice, Silver Hammer Earring, Crystal Spider Eyes or Elysian Mask, Shadel Bandit Ring, Crystal Chitin Arms, Barbed Ringmail Arms, Tribal War Boots, Black Fur Boots (part of epic), Kromrif Military Leggings (not purchaseable, but EASY quest) ... just to name a few.  Anyway, most of those pieces will be pretty close to better, if not outright better, than ToV gear.<br />
<br />
PS -- IMO, the biggest boon to the monk right now will be to reduce that weight.  Way too heavy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I slightly disagree.<br />
<br />
While purchasable gear is better than /most/ things you will get from Thurg faction, HoT is a step above.<br />
<br />
There are better things than HoT, but all no-drop... with a few exceptions...<br />
<br />
HoT gloves are a joke - get coldain skin (purchasable)<br />
Hot sleeves are iffy - hardened grey flesh sleeves are more hp<br />
<br />
But the pants are good, bp is good if you can't get Vindi, boots are good. Bracer is a good sturdy bracer with wis and hp. I personally wear the hot arms as I like the looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Monk quest gear is not so great.<br />
<br />
You need to get some levels.  No-drop gear is higher end stuff, in general.<br />
<br />
You shaman is BARELY old enough for TOV; any younger and the AOE spells would wipe her out constantly.  If you play so sporadically and are low level, your chances of getting no-drop loot aren't good.  A few levels might help a whole lot.  Without them, you might put in a hundred raids without getting a drop.<br />
<br />
Monk quest gear is wanted almost entirely for the spells they cast -- very low level shaman spells.  Your shaman can already cast them and better, so there's not much point to even the main virtues of no-drop monk quest gear.  My monk would feel guilty looting stuff like that when it is such a huge upgrade to the other leather-wearing classes.<br />
<br />
Your standard store-bought monk will be wearing things like hardened grey flesh sleeves and pants, and barbed dragonscale boots, and perhaps a shimmering terrorhide cloak, spider fur belt, or suchlike, depending where he keeps his haste item.  Go for the lightweight hitpoint items and you'll be wearing mostly the best stuff you can get until you get up to Ssra level and VT loot on him.  It's nice that you can get good stuff that way for your monk, but he's also very strictly limited; you won't get much above 2500 hitpoints on your monk without GOOD no-drop gear -- stuff above the level of HOT/kael.  And that will make him a very poor tank in PoP.  His damage will remain nice, but not his tanking.<br />
<br />
You might want to try to get into raids in Plane of Growth, too.  The people who go there these days are usually raiding Tunare, so they are fairly high end people, many of whom only use the PoG armor drops for their twinks or let them rot.  Your chances of getting an item or two aren't bad there because of that.   <br />
<br />
However, PoG raids can last for hours, even all day.  So if you go, be sure to let people know right up front that your time is strictly limited, or else they'll see you come in and maybe loot something and seem to disappear WAY too quick, making you look pretty bad.  PoG is not a place for 30-minute raiders.</div></div><hr />
