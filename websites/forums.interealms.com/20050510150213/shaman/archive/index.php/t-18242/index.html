<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Along the lines of the multi-server Cleric+Enchanter plat farmer duos, I am beginning to suspect something strange going on in bazaar.<br />
<br />
On Saryrn, we had a couple of traders move in that:<br />
<br />
- Are on constantly<br />
- Never talk<br />
- Have simply ridiculous prices<br />
- Move almost zero stock<br />
<br />
I'm talking three or four times the normal price for an item.  They seem to focus on more rare items, but even common ones are grossly overpriced.<br />
<br />
It's possible that they are simply patient and don't mind waiting for a sucker.  My personal suspicion is ebayers.  Someone who has to hang around bazaar to deliver items bought with RL cash, so why not see if some player might overpay in game?  Plus, listing the item high will drive up the price, thus making the real-cash sale more tempting.  I checked two auction sites that I knew of to see if the same items were being listed but didn't see it.  I did notice a huge number of pure plat auctions.      <br />
<br />
It could also be related to the new transfer-with-gear character moves SoE is pimping.  Prices have also risen due to LDoN.  Less items from other expansions are coming up for sale.<br />
<br />
I bring it up because I'm curious if you've been seeing the same kind of traders who price like they don't want to sell. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If anything I would lean towards them trying to drive prices up in order to sell more plat. When EQ2 comes out and if people slowly move to that game there could be some bad times for plat and item sellers until they are able to farm in EQ2 if the game even goes over big.<br />
<br />
But then I know a few idiots that always sell things for 4 times what they are worth and they sit forever without selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about those selling rusty weapons for 100k? They are trying to catch an idiot running around with all his bank account clicking on every trader to see what they have for sale? They expect him to click on purchase by mistake?<br />
<br />
Or they are buying PP's on ebay/PA and this is how they deal online?<br />
<br />
I see the same seller,with 3-5 items at 50k,100k or even 1000k.None even worth 100p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have not seen traders like you are saying but i do see an increase in the overall price of itmes in the bazaar.  Things i have noticed are NO high level ie 63-65 spells in bazaar and an overall increase in items that were normal farm items.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's a notable one on Prexus named Aaaspell who sells vendor-purchasable spells for 400pp+.  He's been there everytime I've checked and, as far as I can tell, hasn't sold one of them.  I'm not sure who his target clientel is.  <br />
<br />
I can't imagine who really thinks, &quot;Rather than take the PoK stone to Halas and buying Malosi for 25pp or so, I could save myself the trip and fork over 400pp for the convenience of buying it in the bazaar.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some people use traders to move plat between guild members in different time zones, etc.  A rusty weapon for 100k will obviously not sell, but can be used to get 100k from one guild member to another when they are not online at the same time.  If some idiot actually buys the thing - gravy for them.<br />
<br />
Some of the price increases have stemmed from drop nerfs or rumors of nerfs.  The Obulus Death Shroud, for example, has shot up in price because of the OS drop nerf.<br />
<br />
Aside from the slight decline in supply, a LOT of high level players seem to be bringing up twinks and have more plat than sense.  They will spend more plat for an item just because it's &quot;required&quot; for that class than the majority of players, and the market seems to be leaning towards capturing that extra plat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres virtually nothing useful for sale on my server (Drinal) and ornate is retardly expensive... 100k for ornate chain boots? lol 40k for leather HELM? I think part of it is everyone is in ldon, which has a rather limited loot selection per dungeon, but fair cash loots. Of course, theres also a lot of tools selling ornate chain gloves (not patterns) for 30k, hoping to catch a sucker.  Recently, coldain velium tempers were selling at vendors for 0pp, but had decent resale value. I know many people got several hundred kpp buying and selling them to the vendor before he was perma killed until the fix. I assume this is also largely to blame in the recent price insanity.<br />
<br />
However, people have ALWAYS been retards about bazaar prices. You'll see, like hundreds high quality cat pelts for 10pp or whatever, and some guy with 2 at 500. Guess some people like being wastes of vendor space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aemon, unfortunately someone will come across it who isn't aware of that and think that maybe it is an underpriced uber spell.  I can see that happening and that might be who they are shooting for.  Not everyone visits sites to update themselves on their classes.  I'm willing to bet that they actually get a few sales that will make up for sitting their mule all day long (which really isn't a problem if they are on DSL or Cable and have two accounts).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are two vendors on Ayonae Ro (at least) that are ALWAYS logged on, and charge such stupidly high prices that I can't imagine anyone actually buying anything from either of them.  Their names are Flexen and Moneybagz (dood - cool name *thx bro*).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine anyone ever buying anything from either of them.  They'll be charging 34k for a bloodmetal earring, when there are several others priced in the 25k range.  But they don't ever seem to drop their prices, and they deal almost exclusively in high-end items (boots of flowing slime, mask of hailstorms, boots of the storm, velium encrusted gauntlets, etc.)<br />
<br />
They have somehow come into enormous amounts of money (several million plat, I would guess), so either they're actually selling some of this stuff to complete fools or they're somehow connected to playerauctions (that's my guess) and put their stuff up for sale in a stupidly-overpriced fashion until someone buys it off the website.<br />
<br />
Also, in many many cases, they charge the exact same price for an item.  For that same bloodmetal earring of engagement, for example, they'd each be charging 34,998.  It seems a little suspicious to me, because I used to watch the bazaar a LOT, and they'd always be in the same situations, with grossly-overpriced and often identically-priced items that no one with a functioning medulla-oblongata would ever consider buying.  And yet they stay in business, with a stock of items worth 500k+ at any one time.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are 2 such activites going on FV.<br />
<br />
One is a trader that has very high end loot (remember, no no drop on FV), but charges exorbitant prices for it.  The trade off there is that if you have the plat, you can buy God/Elemental type drops, even if you can't get there.<br />
<br />
The other is like the original poster.  People with a rusty weapon for 100k.  I think its a simple way to move plat around really.  For example, if they are buying Plat, maybe they don't want SOE to see that they have 2million PP..so they buy some rusty swords for 100k each from their alt/another account, and quickly and easily move the money.  Holy crap, money laundering in EQ!</div></div><hr />

Kind of annoying to take up a bazaar slot for that though, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We have a few of them on Stromm that make me giggle. One in particular purchased a mage summoned focus item and jacked it up to about 50k. Yep, mage summoned, no rent, 50k. <br />
<br />
Then we have Businessmajor. The king of all the resellers of the server. He of the 50k Tae Ew Chain Tunics, 500k Fungis...moron. And because of him others have started jacking up their prices. It's just silly...14k for hardened grey flesh sleeves /sigh<br />
<br />
It really seems that Stromm has an overabundance of people willing to wait weeks to sell an item at an inflated price. Like the person still trying to sell Disinfecting Aura for 1500, been trying to sell it for around that for about 3 weeks. I guess some people really don't care how long they hold stuff or else they're just clueless. <br />
<br />
Oh well, in one of my frustrating bazaar visits I did at least figure out who our reselling king's actual played character is. Well, I think I did anyway. I'm sure he thought he was all sly doing the /hail bit as if he was making a purchase but doing that at the bank and then only moving one character at a time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For that same bloodmetal earring of engagement, for example, they'd each be charging 34,998.<br />
<br />
That sure rang a bell. On Kane bayle there was a guy named Bagim that usually had 500kp to 1 million in stuff up for trade. Everythig was always priced at like 89,998 or 44,998. We started playing at the same time and were in the same guild going nowhere. We quit the guild at the same time and all of the sudden he was loaded with all this overpriced stuff. Very high end items but still way overpriced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you are online 24/7 with a mule you are bound to sell an item eventually (logically the 100k water flask isnt going to sell...).  There is going to be SOMEONE making a twink, and, when the only (insert twink item here) is available at four times its normal price, it is going to sell for that to the impatient buyer.<br />
<br />
However, you are banking on being the only seller with an item, and you can't be selling common drops because you could never compete with 100 other people.  This is why items like mithril gauntlets, boots of flowing slime, white dragonscale helm, etc. are the primary things sold by these people.<br />
<br />
I don't see any &quot;mystery&quot; here, just common sense and people who have a large bank account and know how to play the market.<br />
<br />
That said, the people selling VERY common drops at VERY inflated prices are just complete idiots.  THese people don't make money and move no inventory.</div></div><hr />

Our guild does this--it's just more convenient than having to update the website every time someone gets a spell or an item from the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The rustys for 100k I'd guess are some kind of laundering deal as speculated above...there have been some really bad dupes/bugs in the past months that have flooded the economies of some (all?) servers with 'dirty' plat, swapping it around through a couple of traders makes sense. Just because it looks like they never sell anything doesn't mean they don't just 'sell' the same items over and over, only takes a minute to turn /trader off and take the stuff back then turn /trader back on.<br />
<br />
The resellers are just that usually, resellers. See several people go from spamming 'WTB Fungi, SSHB, BoFS' in the auction channel to selling them in the bazaar at +20% of what they were paying, and then back again with the 'WTB' in auction later the same day. However the ridiculously priced ones are quite possibly holders for PA, that too unfortunately makes sense. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently, a few weeks ago, sharks in Erud's Crossing were dropping 100 million gold per kill.  People were repeatedly killing the sharks, making many millions of plat.  In order to launder the money, as has been hinted at earlier in this thread, some of them went around the bazaar buying up everything of value, to presumably resell at a later time.  <br />
<br />
Thread detailing the Shark exploit. (http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessage?topicID=995.topic)  I'm sure there are threads that are more detailed, but this is the best I could quickly find.<br />
<br />
So much new money entered the economy of some servers that the GMs went around searching for the people who exploited the sharks.  They tracked down at least some of the exploiters and rolled them back, losing money and items purchased.  A few of the people selling items to the exploiters were also rolled back.  <br />
<br />
The net effect was the deletion of many of the heavily farmed items.  At the same time, people are not farming as much because of LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">People at the high end of the game have nothing to spend plat on - so they twink alts and don't really care if its 2x or 4x the normal price. If its the only one for sale, they seem to buy it anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is partly to blame for price inflation. That, and LDoN meaning the old loot isn't farmed as much, and more pp is entering the game. <br />
<br />
Not sure how much impact the likes of EBay and Yanis are having, but you can buy a lvl 65 character now - choose your name, race, class, server, pay a LOT of $$ and bingo, next day delivery even! These guys must be hardcore farming plat and PLing chars, which simply has to hurt the economy.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about any other high end players, but I'm blowing a ton of plat on tradeskills right now.<br />
<br />
On a tangent, I'm really pissed that tradeskills are so heavily biased towards the foraging classes. Damn bazaar goons are selling foraged goods for dyes for 50+ plat a pop! Not to mention the exhoribant prices for foraged eggs, foraged plant shoots...</div></div><hr />

The person who runs the vault for my guild will occasionally have guild sales.  Everything is on the bazaar mule at an insane price for several days.  During this time, guild members contact her and say they'd like x piece (not sold to them at the listed price of course).<br />
<br />
After the guild sale is done, all of the items left on the mule are reduced to a realistic price and put on the open market in the bazaar.  It's a way for guildmates to get items they need / want and afterwards for the guild to raise the bank coffers.</div></div><hr />

So far as I've seen, Barm, Saryrn's prices are NOTHING compared to Bertoxx. That server must be the plat seller server, because common, worthless, kunark crap sells consistantly for 3x the price on Saryrn. 500pp for Cripple prices.<br />

I am my guild's treasurer and I do it sometimes as well. And 100K rusty weapons are just a way to pay your debts without having to contact the lender in person.<br />

However, something is defininitely fishy with the amount of platinum in the system right now. Whether it's the shark exploit, the temper exploit, the Enchanter macro exploit (all fixed now, but added a ton of plat to the economy) or something else that I don't know about, it's not good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If your talking about bazaar mules selling high end gear for exhorbitant prices, here's how it works. Someone make an alt to sell in the bazaar, helps if that person is in a high end guild. They go to EBay and buy up accounts, strip them of their equipment put that equipment on their bazaar mule, jack up the prices and wait for sales to accumulate. Then they sell the plat for real life money, which they use to buy up more accounts. The process starts over again. Over time they build up a large stock of very high end equipment which they are the only one selling and can raise the prices higher and higher. <br />
There is a guild on my server with an appalling drop out rate. They get people well equiped and those people retire and sell the account on EBay. There is a person in that guild who has at least 2 mules selling in the bazaar all the time. There are only 2 elemental guilds, so its not hard to figure where the stuff is coming from. Over time his prices have gone up and up. As long as there are people willing to spend the plat, he will keep raising the prices.<br />
If you check my magelo, you will see a shield I just won while raiding with one of the elemental guilds. The person I'm talking about has that very same shield on one of his mules for 350,000 plat. This was junk loot given to applicants (yep I was one of them), but not many guilds can do the encounters where this stuff comes from, so, 350,000 plat becomes a fair price.<br />
If you don't like whats happening, don't buy from people like the one mentioned above. Its only because people are willing to spend the ridiculous amounts of plat to equip their alts or EBay plat bought twinks that it is able to continue.<br />
Also remember if you are in a high end guild, this is loot that the guild earned. It could be used to equip newer members as the older members upgrade their stuff. Instead it is winding up in the hands of some knucklehead who's mother bought him a few hundred thousand plat with her credit card on EBay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I won't say which server I saw this happen on, but I'm sure it's happening on ALL servers.<br />
<br />
I know this certain time-level guild. Let's call them &quot;Farmonium&quot;. They routinely make a circuit of certain specific named mobs with thier hydras. Fortunately, PoP named mobs spawn at startlingly regular intervals. This particular guild tends to favour BoT tower named, but I'm sure other guilds do it in other places. You can catch them in BoT at least twice per day, knocking off the tower bosses.<br />
<br />
Once they have killed all of the named, they scoop all of the droppable loot and runes, then they SELL looting rights to other players for plat. Then, they take all of the droppable loot and sell it in the bazaar. Since they are monopolizing the content, they control the market. The prices become grossly inflated. (Last I checked, 500k for plate BP molds, average of 80k for rune-level spells, other items are similarly priced)<br />
<br />
Then with approximately 2 million pp in drops PER DAY, they go and sell the plat to an online broker. Let's call him &quot;Mantis&quot;.<br />
<br />
When the people in Farmonium are ready to hand over the weekly platinum to Mantis, they seek out one of his many trader bots, and buy, oh I don't know...let's say a fishing grub for 10 million pp.<br />
<br />
Mantis then turns around and brokers sales of platinum BACK to the citizens of the server to repeat the cycle.</div></div><hr />

Happens a lot and they are probably clinging to the hope that the won't lose money on it.<br />
<br />
Now the people who are selling rusty daggers for 100k are either 1) Morons who think they are funny, or 2) Laundering duped plat.</div></div><hr />
