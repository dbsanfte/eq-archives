<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All of this is in a theoretically ideal situation (you have a boss engaged, and are dumping mana into panthering melee)<br />
<br />
Damage Per Cast (DPC) of Panther: (DPS from panther-buff)*Duration<br />
<br />
Panther Cycle Time = Cast Time + Recast Time<br />
Panther Cast Time = 3.0 (focus'd by AA) + 2.5 (recovery)<br />
Panther Recast Time = 2.5 (on test, 30)<br />
<br />
Panther Duration = 60 * 1.75 = 105 seconds<br />
<br />
Damage Per Cycle Time (DPCT) from Panther: DPC / (Cycle Time)<br />
Damage Per Second Casting (DPSC) = DPC / (Casting Time + 2.5)<br />
<br />
Damage Per Mana (DPM) from Panther: DPC / 650 (unfocus'd, easier to compare with other classes)<br />
<br />
DPS from panther-buff: About 100 DPS on a player<br />
<br />
Max Burst DPS from Panther: DPS * Duration / Cycle Time = DPCT<br />
<br />
So:<br />
DPC: 10.5 k damage per cast of panther<br />
DPCT: 1909 damage per second of cycle time<br />
DPSC: 1909 damage per second of casting time<br />
DPM: 16.15 dam/mana (unfocus'd)<br />
Max Burst: 1909 DPS = DPCT<br />
<br />
Changes on test change the Cycle Time from 5.5 to 33 seconds.<br />
<br />
After changes:<br />
Max Burst = DPCT = 318.17 DPS<br />
<br />
And, it makes it a far more annoying spell to use.<br />
<br />
The max-burst DPS requires an insane amount of mana (Spiritual Channelling and mass-necro-mana feed level of mana).  However, the high DPM means that feeding the shaman mana is worth it: necro mana filtered through a shaman does more damage than used directly.  <br />
<br />
Without any outside active aid:<br />
<br />
At 120 mana/tick, over a 5 minute fight, with 10 k mana to start with, a shaman could cause 400,000+ damage to be pumped out via casting this buff.<br />
<br />
Wizards without outside active aid:<br />
<br />
Wizard's ancient nukes have a raw ratio of 4.8 damage:mana.  A 120 mana/tick wizard with 10.5 k mana who dumps every last drop into the mob does 132,000 damage before crits/damage focus items.<br />
<br />
With +90% damage foci, 30% crit rate, and +30% crit damage (overestimating by enough to leave a compy margin: I believe this is well beyond what a PC can get now), that wizard does 243,000 damage.<br />
<br />
(the above are assuming 40% mana pres from items+SCM+Spec for both shamans and wizards.  A change in mana pres would effect both shamans and wizards equally.)<br />
<br />
Is there any errors in my math?  I am guessing that SOE has done the same math I did above.<br />
<br />
(by &quot;active aid&quot;, I mean someone else doing something they would not otherwise do.  Twitch, sing a different song, etc.)</div></div><hr />

Your #s are not too far off on paper(after AAs and equip).  The problem is, You cannot calculate Mana efficiency nor Mana vs DPS, due to Mobs dying way before Panther fadeing.  Calculate mobs only lasting 45 seconds, and see where you are at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is based off the ideal circumstance, of either constant-pull or boss-NPC-grind-down.<br />
<br />
With 50% uptime, the spell is at least 50% as good as above.<br />
<br />
Random other nerfs:<br />
Reduce proc rate by X%:<br />
DPC drops by 50%, as does DPCT, DPM, DPSC, Max Burst<br />
<br />
Set max_proc_number to X:<br />
10.5 k average damage means an average of 19 procs per cast.<br />
So, this reduces DPC, DPCT and DPM down to a factor of X/19, if X is sufficiently smaller than 19.<br />
<br />
Max Burst doesn't drop theoretically, but becomes far less practical.<br />
<br />
A max-proc-count has the advantage that you could extend the spell's duration significantly.  Ie:<br />
10 max procs<br />
1/2 current proc rate<br />
30 minute duration (or longer)<br />
6 second casting time<br />
no recast<br />
<br />
Each panther buff that is up does 5500 damage before fading, at a rate of 50 DPS per player (over 2 minutes).  So a 50 melee+pet set of players gets 2500 extra DPS, or a total of 275,000 extra damage.  Costs frontloaded.<br />
<br />
Each cast does 850 damage per second of casting time, and 8 damage per point of unfocus'd mana (with mana pres, 11 to 13 damage/mana).<br />
<br />
A proc-count would basically code in the downtime effect: it reduces the effectiveness of the 100% uptime panther, without changing the effectiveness of the 50% uptime panther.<br />
<br />
And, if you made the mage lava orb (A) cheaper and (B) targettable, mages would be able to grant the same nuke DPS increasing abilities to caster classes.<br />
<br />
(600 mana for +50 DPS for 2 minutes: that is what this spell becomes, and that is what the mage orb does.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for responding to myself, but in short:<br />
<br />
Change Leopard/Panther:<br />
1/2 current proc rate.<br />
10 max procs.<br />
No recast delay.<br />
6.0 casting time.<br />
30 minute duration.<br />

<br />

6.0 casting time.<br />

That's 18x3=54 targets for Panther.  Oh, 6 extra clerics.  60 targets.  One 54 man raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe I am just thinking about our raids, when there is usually not enough bodies meleeing that I couldn't hit them all with panther before the cycle was finished but... either way, you can see that there is a limit on the amount of shm that can contribute in this way while any wizard could add their dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can the math be redone, without the assumption that everyone has access to all the AA's and the focus items.

<br />
Damage Per Cast (DPC) of Panther: (DPS from panther-buff)*Duration<br />
<br />
Panther Cycle Time = Cast Time + Recast Time<br />
Panther Cast Time = 6.0 (unfocus'd by AA) + 2.5 (recovery)<br />
Panther Recast Time = 2.5 (on test, 30)<br />
<br />
Panther Duration = 60 * 1.0 = 60 seconds<br />
<br />
Damage Per Cycle Time (DPCT) from Panther: DPC / (Cycle Time)<br />
Damage Per Second Casting (DPSC) = DPC / (Casting Time + 2.5)<br />
<br />
Damage Per Mana (DPM) from Panther: DPC / 650 (unfocus'd, easier to compare with other classes)<br />
<br />
DPS from panther-buff: About 100 DPS on a player (assumes high dex)<br />
<br />
Max Burst DPS from Panther: DPS * Duration / Cycle Time = DPCT<br />
<br />
So:<br />
DPC: 6 k damage per cast of panther<br />
DPCT: 706 damage per second of cycle time<br />
DPSC: 706 damage per second of casting time<br />
DPM: 10.0 dam/mana (unfocus'd)<br />
Max Burst: 706 DPS = DPCT <br />
<br />
With 30 second recast:<br />
DPCT=Max Burst=167 DPS<br />
<br />
If you add in a 10 hit count, extended-buff AAs matter less.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that in a raid situation, the raid can only take advantage of one shaman that you describe above while any wizard can do that much damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, if you don't use necro-twich or spriritual channeling (which is what the 400,000 damage shaman didn't use), each shaman is only keeping it up on at most 16 targets.  3 shamans could 'easily' stack doing this on a raid.<br />
<br />
Alternate to the above solution I liked:<br />
Leave panther/leopard at 1 minute duration, keep proc rate the same.<br />
Set max_proc_number to 10.<br />
Do not add a recast delay.<br />
<br />
This halves the 'perfect situation' (ie, raid) power of this spell, and barely harms the 'non-perfect situation' (non-chain-pull group) power of the spell, and the spell isn't nearly as annoying as having a recast delay on it.<br />
<br />
The spell keeps it's 'burst' power for groups, but it fades after just under 1 minute of combat.  Extended buff AAs and foci allow you to buff before engage and use the 10 procs per buff fully, so are quite useful, but do not up the power of the spell by 75% anymore.<br />
<br />
In other words, shamans start doing less DPS just via casting this spell than a fully geared anguish wizard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a raid, the mob doesn't die after 45 seconds.  I'm looking at the best case situation.<br />
<br />
Adding a 10 proc-count to panther would have no effect on the situation where the mob dies after 45 seconds compared to the current situation.  It would make the raid numbers less ... impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All of this is in a theoretically ideal situation (you have a boss engaged, and are dumping mana into panthering melee)You have some interesting numbers here, Yakk.  <br />
<br />
I think some of your variables provide useful side-numbers, but they don't really figure into the calculations.<br />
<br />
I think some of your numbers are roundoffs and estimates (100 dps for panthered melees instead of 92 dps; guesstimating wizard damage 'with a comfy margin'; and so on).<br />
<br />
You have not factored in efficiency:  a wizard who only has to target the mob one time and then cast the spell will be much more efficient than a shaman who has to target a melee, cast, target another melee, cast.  The shaman will lose many small fractions of time along the way.<br />
<br />
You have not factored in that the shaman's dps takes half of the fight to build to full, while the wizard's is constant across the three minutes.<br />
<br />
If we are trying to calculate the max burst damage possible over a 3 minute fight, then I think mana calculations are not a factor:  we will simply line up however many necros we need, to pump however much mana is lacking, to achieve this maximum.<br />
<br />
What would a wizard's max burst dps be, over 3 minutes?<br />
<br />
I freely admit I am pretty ignorant about wizard stuff, so I went to Graffe's and read spell info and commentary from the forums there.  At a first cut (please please some of you knowledgeable people come up with better analysis):<br />
<br />
It appears that with maximum aa and focii, and the proper buffs, a wizard can chain cast the spell &quot;Ancient: Core Fire&quot; 23 times in 3 minutes.  Assuming that the tank can hold aggro like superglue, that the mob is fully debuffed, assuming 18 nukes land for full @ 7936, while 5 crit @ 12006 damage:  202,878 total damage = 1127 dps.  Assuming 98% efficiency (nobody is perfect):  1104 max burst dps.<br />
<br />
What would a shaman's max burst dps be, over 3 minutes?<br />
<br />
In the other thread I calculated shaman max burst dps at 1113.<br />
<br />
If that is correct so far (I'm counting on people to provide better wizard numbers), that would make the two essentially equal, for max theoretical burst dps.  (I'm sure there is error built in at the moment; the difference of 9 dps is inconsequential within that margin of error.)<br />
<br />
Now, these situations are not normal.  We don't set up raids in order to maximize wizards dps; we don't set up raids in order to maximize shaman dps.  These are only calculations of what might be possible, if we were to stack the deck in order to maximize the dps of one character.<br />
<br />
I'll offer three preliminary conclusions.<br />
<br />
First, even though these are theoretical numbers rather than numbers you would get in ordinary practice, people at SOE will consider that a shaman should not in theory be able to match a wizard's max burst dps.<br />
<br />
Second, the wizard's theoretical burst dps comes from the wizard chain nuking the target boss mob.  The shaman's theoretical burst dps comes from chain buffing 18 other characters, who then actually cause the damage.  The wizard's dps is direct; the shaman's is cooperative.  That means that a straight comparison might not be appropriate:  it is comparing apples to oranges.<br />
<br />
Third, some sort of decision needs to be made as to what level of cooperative dps is the maximum that we think a shaman should be able to provide.  If a shaman can buff 18 people to provide an additional 1000 dps, is that all right?  800? 600?  What level of cooperative dps is acceptable to be accomplished with shaman buffs?<br />
<br />
(As an aside.  If you have 30 active melee characters on a raid -- warrior monk rogue paladin shadowknight ranger berserker beastlord beastpet magepet necropet -- who provide an average of 150 dps while fighting unhasted:  then one enchanter casting one (!!) mgb 70% haste provides 3150 cooperative dps for the next hour.  Assuming that that's zero while we are moving or standing around, and that during trash pulls we are sloppy, but during a three minute boss fight we are all pretty attentive:  we will claim 75% efficiency during the three minute boss fight.  The enchanter's cooperative dps during that fight -- off of a buff cast 40 minutes ago -- is 2362 dps.  More than the wizard's and the shaman's theoretical max combined.  And that's a real number that would show up in any raid, not a theoretical one calculated off of trying to figure out what's the max possible.)</div></div><hr />

You are messing up the math.  Ancient: Core Fire, is  <br />

<br />
4070 dmg base.  Assuming 25% (50% fire focus) + 15% (best flappy or bard) it is 40% more, on average, assuming ZERO resists or: 5698 average hit with a bard.<br />
<br />
23% of casts however, will land for full damage, and do double damage with destructive fury.<br />
<br />
That gives, (4070 * 2 ) * 1.5 + 4070 * .4 average crit = 13838 average crit with a bard and a fully debuffed mob.<br />
<br />
So, weighted average of .77 hits at 5698, and .23 crits at 13838 is 7570 damage.<br />
<br />
Cast time, with maxed spell haste, maxed item haste, cleric spell haste is 8 * 57% (23% item haste, 10% BoV, 10% quick damage maxed) + 2.5 second recast, 7.06 seconds per cycle.<br />
<br />
That gives, 1072 damage/second.<br />
<br />
Core-fire, consumes 850 base mana.  With 20% mana preservation, specialize evocation, that is around 23% average saving, or 655 mana per cast.  At one cast every 7.06 seconds, a wizard consumes 92.70 mana per second.  With every single raid buff, a truly top end wizard might regain around ~16 mana per second, giving a net loss of ~77 mana per second.  With a 12k mana pool, a wizard will be able to sustain this for 155 seconds.<br />
<br />
155 seconds of 1072 damage/second is 167064 damage.<br />
<br />
Let's analyze what is necessary for a wizard to achieve this:<br />
50% fire damage focus.  Currently one item in game with this focus, and drops from Vishmar, top end DoN boss.<br />
20% mana preservation.  Two items in game with this effect, one from Yar Lir, and one from Vangl.<br />
23% detrimental spell haste up to level 70.  Anguish gear only.<br />
A bard to keep HoS, fire chant, ancient chant on boss to minimize resists.<br />
A bard to sing manasong, focus song.<br />
Full raid debuffs (ro's, mage malosinia, etc) and even with full debuffs most high end mobs you will still get a fair share of resists.<br />
<br />
This scenario requires some incredibly high end gear, a huge support crew dedicated to making the wizard shine, and some really good luck.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that Panther got changed waaaay too much during DoN beta, so when the final version came around the developers did not get a chance to test it.  When I first saw that it had no recast timer I really thought it was an oversight, and I assume other people thought the same thing.  Until you reach 'saturation' or you run out of targets to panther, the spell is really really good.  I don't want to write some Thott type graphs on the spell, but I think thiis shows two things.<br />
<br />
One, int casters in general really need some love in the damage department, and two the spell should have been tested much more in Beta.  In MMORPG, it is horrible to give a very good thing no matter how overpowered then taking it away.  Even when the level 49 necromancer pet got nerfed, and it was something overpowered beyond compare, people whined and nerfed.  I think the key now is changing the spell so it is still very useful and not incredibly annoying to keep up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with haste, is that encounters are balanced with haste in mind.  There is an excellent write up about this from an EQ2 developers and buff scarcity.<br />
<br />
Let me spring a little concept on you and see where you run with it.<br />
<br />
In EQ, haste spells are essentially meaningless, because encounters have to be balanced assuming players have an unlimited supply of the best haste available. That's really the same as if you took haste out of the game completely and rebalanced all encounters with that change in mind.<br />
<br />
Mezzing is basically the same way. Encounters have to be balanced assuming there will be enchanters or bards around to mez mobs. The choice when designing, then, becomes whether to flag mobs as unmezzable. Otherwise, you have to assume that any mob that can be mezzed will be mezzed.<br />
<br />
But what if you had to make choices? What if haste wasn't a long-lasting effect that was in limitless supply, but instead you had to choose whether it was better to haste the tank or debilitate your opponent in some other way? And what if the &quot;best&quot; tactic varied from fight to fight?<br />
<br />
What if you had to choose between mezzing a mob for a limited duration or aiding your fight in some other way? And what if the &quot;best&quot; tactic was also variable depending on your opponent?<br />
<br />
Our combat system is about tactics, and the whole idea of locked encounters means we can control the resources of a group or raid and balance encounters accordingly. No unlimited healing. No unlimited haste. No unlimited crowd control. You have to choose the best way to play your class in every single situation.<br />
<br />
Sound fun and challenging?<br />
<br />
Setting aside the fact that EQ2 sucks more than a bard at a keg party, the concept is a good one.  Melee damage is balanced assuming they are kept hasted, and so are encounters, and so is clarity.  They are designed assuming people have those buffs.  Panthr 'breaks' this mold, and it is something 'on top'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You are messing up the math. Hah, I had no doubt about that ... ;)<br />
<br />
Ancient Core Fire ... gives, 1072 damage/second. I had figured 1104, so this is slightly less, /nod.  Thanks for providing solid specific numbers.<br />
<br />
With a 12k mana pool, a wizard will be able to sustain this for 155 seconds.Yes.  A wizard will need mana support to maintain this for 180 seconds.  We will task a necro or two to this, because we are not trying to come up with a real situation, we are trying to come up with a maximum burst dps figure over 180 seconds of time.<br />
<br />
This scenario requires some incredibly high end gear, a huge support crew dedicated to making the wizard shine, and some really good luck.Again, yes.  The exercise is to calculate a theoretical maximum, not to report on what will happen on a typical raid.<br />
<br />
int casters in general really need some love in the damage departmentI'm not an int caster so I won't claim to know, but I certainly would not argue against that.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for providing more specific numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This game has too many classes, half of which regard themselves as &quot;the damage class&quot; and the other half of which want to &quot;at least do decent damage&quot; which usually translates to &quot;I want to do at least 70% of what a DPS class does&quot;. The only solution I can see is to diversify damage. And since we do not want to make classes useless in experience grouping there is only direct vs indirect damage and burst DPS vs steady DPS to work with.<br />
<br />
Indirect damage is haste and the likes. This will have to be strictly more efficient then direct DPS, since you can not indefinitely stack it. How much better? That is anyone's guess. But in the case of panther you can play with the DPS of a single panther spell and the duration of the spell, in addition to the usual DPS/DPM values. So if you raise the impact of a single cast of panther high enough it need not be much more efficient then direct DPS at all.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;int casters need some loving&quot; bit - yep. But whats more, they need restructuring. Chaincasting nukes is not very different from chainmeleeing at all, and thus they have to be pretty equal in terms of burst DPS - remember, everyone wants to be the definite DPS class. And that means casters lose out with equal DPS (because of their limited mana pool) and melees lose out with less DPS (since they are not the DPS class anymore). Solution? Hand out bigger nukes. Much bigger. Wizards should be nuking for 50K. Yes, 50K. Have it take a third or what not of their mana. I can remember noticing every wizard nuke by watching the target's HPs. Nowadays the only difference between DPS classes seems to be which utility spells they bring to the table. The method of delivering damage does not matter at all. And that sucks. We do not need 10 DPS classes who all want to do the exact same burst and long term DPS. Diversifying them is the first step towards having them all contribute equally, yet differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got some real easy math.<br />
<br />
 6sec casting time + 30 sec refresh = dead spell<br />
<br />
Hypthetical  instances of  &quot;what a shaman can do with panther&quot; don't work in this game, it's too dynamic. Your assuming that a shaman could effectively keep track of who/who's pet, he/she hit with panther on raid which is not going to happen unless Commander Data from Star Trek is playing EQ. Most raid shamans don't have the luxury of going into &quot;full panther burn&quot; because of the other duties that are required on raids. Hitting the &quot;theoretical Maxium&quot; is like winning the lotto. It could potentially happen but most likely will not.<br />
<br />
The best way I see to fix panther is to do a considerable amount of parsing and adjust the spell on a mana to damage ratio comparable to the damage we can do with our other spells, rather than cast/recast times. Once that is done adjust pet procs to fall in line to the same rate that the spell works on player characters. Then let the shaman community decide if the spell is worth the mana cost or not. By this time Sony shold have a clue on what the spell is capable of in most situations and balance it properly instead of pulling this last minute patch crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The problem with haste, is that encounters are balanced with haste in mind. ... Melee damage is balanced assuming they are kept hasted, and so are encounters, and so is clarity.  They are designed assuming people have those buffs.  Panthr 'breaks' this mold, and it is something 'on top'I don't really find this convincing.  Here's why.<br />
<br />
Some encounters are too hard for MyGuild_01; some are yawningly easy; and some are moderately or highly challenging.<br />
<br />
Take Derakor the Vindicator in Kael Drakkel.  I bet we got wiped by him 15 times.  We knew we could take him, we just knew it:  but we failed over and over again.  <br />
<br />
Now, of course, he can readily be taken down by a solid group; by numerous trios; probably some good duos; maybe by a superb soloer (has anyone soloed Vindi? I don't know).<br />
<br />
Vindi was too hard for us because the dps and the healing we could bring was not sufficient to win the fight.  He is now easy because the dps and the healing we can bring is quite sufficient to win the fight.<br />
<br />
If the encounter with Vindi is 'balanced,' it is balanced at the point in the life of MyGuild_01 where it is a hard-but-winnable fight.  If we do everything right we will win; if we mess up some stuff we'll lose.<br />
<br />
If we are well prior to that point, adding more dps won't help us enough to get us into the hard-but-winnable category.  We will wipe at 30% instead of at 55% -- but we'll still lose.<br />
<br />
If we are well past that point, then more dps means instead of killing Vindi in 50 seconds, we'll kill him in 40 seconds.  <br />
<br />
If we are just prior to that point, the encounter is not quite balanced:  but adding more dps could make it balanced.  So instead of &quot;this encounter will be hard-but-winnable (=&quot;balanced&quot;) in another three weeks, when we have a little bit better gear and all&quot; -- it's hard-but-winnable (=&quot;balanced&quot;) now, with the additional dps.<br />
<br />
Every encounter in the game is like that.  With the spells, gear, and aa available today to MyGuild_01, some encounters will be trivial, some will be balanced, and some will be impossible.  <br />
<br />
It does not make sense to say that Vindi was designed on the assumption that the raid would be hasted, so it is fine for enchanters to provide massive cooperative dps (that won't make Vindi too easy); but Vindi was not designed on the assumption that shamans could provide hefty cooperative dps as well, so it would be wrong for shamans to be able to do that (that would make Vindi too easy).  No.  Vindi (or any other mob) will be too easy, too hard, or a good challenge, depending on the overall skills, spells, gear, and aa that MyGuild_01 can bring:  including haste, including heals, including buffs like Leopard.<br />
<br />
If Spirit of Leopard had been available back in those good old days, it might have meant that Vindi would have wiped us only 6 times instead of 15, before we got it figured out.  We would have advanced a little more quickly.  But hey, it still looks like we would have advanced from the point where the encounter with Vindi was impossible, through the point where the encounter was balanced, and on to where the encounter was trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The differnce between haste and panther is stackability.<br />
<br />
There are 3 classes in game who can give full haste to anyone.  BST, Shaman and Enchanters.<br />
<br />
Only one of their hastes work on a person.<br />
<br />
At 400,000 damage over a 5 minute fight in a 54 sized raid with 40 valid perminate and the occasional temoporary pet+melee targets, 3-4 shamans can stack doing nothing but casting this spell.<br />
<br />
That is the difference between haste and this spell.  The gain on the margin.  The marginal gain from adding a 2nd enchanter, haste-wise, is 0.  In a raid containing BSTs and Shamans, the marginal gain from adding 1 enchanter for haste is freeing 1 shaman from an annoying chain-cast-haste duty, or a 5% melee DPS upgrade (going from 191% haste with shaman group buff to 200% haste).  The 2nd enchanter... does nothing.<br />
<br />
If panther had a 1% slow component (nullifying haste), or if only 1 of 3 different could generate that 400,000 panther-damage, then you'd be correct in comparing haste and panther.<br />
<br />
I was calculating a theoretical maximium.  Putting forward a way of nerfing the spell in a way that reduces the theoretical maximium without lowering the practical result nearly as much may fall out of this.<br />
<br />
A 10 shot proc-count might do this.  It weakens panther where it is very strong, and does not harm panther where it is weaker (ie, you only have an NPC engaged 50% of the time panther is up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The differnce between haste and panther is stackability. ... and that haste is on for an hour at a time, and that one cast of haste already adds well over twice the damage that 36 casts of panther can do.<br />
<br />
over a 5 minute fight in a 54 sized raid with 40 valid perminate and the occasional temoporary pet+melee targets, 3-4 shamans can stack doing nothing but casting this spell. Ummm.  Two shamans, sure.  Three, if you like, only have to do 13 targets each.  What's the fourth one supposed to do?  You can't stack four or five or six shamans to cast this buff.  You can add more nukers or more melees to cause direct damage, and they all stack.  But buffers don't stack so well, it's true. <br />
<br />
If you can get Panther onto 40 targets successfully at the raid, that means your three shamans, casting buffs as fast as they can go, will just about match the buff-caused cooperative dps of one enchanter casting one spell per hour.<br />
<br />
Your argument seems to be this.  Three shamans working together frantically can provide Panther buffs that add perhaps 2400 burst dps to a raid fight. One enchanter can provide a haste buff to add 2400 dps to a raid fight.  A second enchanter, however, cannot provide another copy of that haste buff to add an additional 2400 dps to that raid fight.  Because that second enchanter cannot buff to provide for a second 2400 dps, three shamans should not be able to buff to provide 2400 dps even once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Not trying to be a smartass, but I promise you that the comparison to haste will not convince any developer to side with you.<br />
<br />
300 DPS is the number he wishes a shaman to achieve.  You can negotiate the number a little bit, perhaps up to 400, but what you should focus on is how can he best tweak the spell so it reaches a maximum DPS figure of around 300 DPS while not being a huge pain in the ass to mantaiin.<br />
<br />
You also have to figure, that even though you can do 300 DPS with DoT, Panther has all sorts of advantages.  Panther requires less time focus'ing on dott'ing and less spell slots taken up.  Panther is aggro free.  Panther works on mobs that are immune to DoT.  Panther is unresistable.</div></div><hr />

I think what I should focus on is having Rytan explain why this buffing spell should be compared to the nukes of a wizard, rather than to the buffs of an enchanter.  Because I really really really want to hear Rytan's explanation of why Panther should be compared to nukes rather than buffs.<br />
<br />
You also have to figure, that even though you can do 300 DPS with DoT, Panther has all sorts of advantages.  It has a lot more advantages now then it will after I assume that they really ought to nerf it, so I'll help them come up with the best way to nerf it.</div></div><hr />
