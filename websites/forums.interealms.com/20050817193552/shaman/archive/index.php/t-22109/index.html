<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I have been wondering are other classes slows also mitigated or JUST Shamans?  If it is just shamans then I can understand the anger alot of you have expressed about it.  However, if it effects all classes who can slow, why the hard feelings?  I guess the easiest question is not about balance, it is about what you want to be able to do the best out of any class in EQ?  Cleric = Best Heal, Wizzy = Best Nuke, etc..  Give me a list of what you think the top ability of each of the classes are.  I think it would be interesting to see the different opinions about the leading class abilities.  Full list including every class only please.  If you can't think of a &quot;Best&quot; ability on a given class leave a ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes all slows are mitigated but what this means is that it bunches the effect of slow much closer together so the Shaman slow is effectively much closer to the other slows. There are several threads with a detailed analysis of the effects of mitigation if you look for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It mitigates all slows.  If it were JUST shaman slows I'm quite sure that Enchanters would be 70% slowing on raids rather than having shaman do effectively a 20% slow or whatever ;)<br />
<br />
Now, do some research on the subject.  All the information you need is on the crucible, use the search feature.  Figure out how slow mitigation works, and what it does to the actual difference in DPS between an unslowed mob, a shaman slowed mob, a bst slowed mob, and a bard slowed mob.  Once you've done that, and thought about what those other classes bring to a group ASIDE from slow (and by comparison what shaman bring), you will understand the hard feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you missed the point of the post, sorry about that.  I know it effects all slows.  That was kinda the point, ie I am tired of hearing the complaints about how much mitigation cripples our slowing ability.  But the real point of the post was to gets lists of what this group of ppl think are the best abilities of all the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recall this being done somewhere, but for the record, slows are mitigated for EVERYONE.  That said, it's hardly balancing.  After mitigation the differences between our slow and the next best slow (chanter) works out to less than 1% and barely more than that for the next best slow after that (BST slow).  In 30 second fights a 1% difference is about as noticable as a single flea on a big hairy dog.  Class defining ... my butt.  Clerics have a 53% better heal thats not mitigated and druids can add significant DPS AND their heals are almost twice as effective as shaman's.  I don't see how shaman can compete for group spots, especially considering how much more difficult it is to succeed with our spells in roles handled by druids and clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of those who have posted so far so you guys have trouble getting groups for EXP? Raids aside where you may fall, because of to many shaman, to the  role of patch healer or be assigned to a CC group to keep another class alive to aliviate the load on the clerics mana pool.  I am in a group within in minutes of putting LFG up or am asked to attend raids just becasue they don't have enough shaman or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A lot of shaman issues manifest themselves in the post-elemental part of the game.<br />
<br />
Where exactly you draw the line is a matter of opinion but pretty much everyone agrees shaman are fine until at least early PoP.<br />
<br />
Judging by your magelo that is where you are at now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Post elemental shaman problems effect what percent of the shaman population, since you seem to like percents?

This serves you what purpose in real life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, best abilities of all classes...<br />
Bard: Pulling/crowd control.  They can do a LOT, but in a *group* I'd say this is most important, along with their ability to give groups big boosts in areas beneficial to the makeup of the group (ie overhaste in melee heavy group, truskik in caster heavy group)<br />
Berzerker: Whatever they get when they get &quot;the beastlord treatment&quot; because nobody is playing them.<br />
Beastlord: Best ablity is probably their pet/melee.  The nature of pet/melee dps allows them to contribute while slowing without major degradation to their dps.<br />
Cleric: Hammer pets.  &gt;_&gt;<br />
Druid: In a group setting, at this point I'd say their ability to Heal, as they can function as primary healer in most situations...damn elusive clerics.<br />
Enchanter: VoQ/Haste.  If there's NOTHING they can CC, and NOTHING they can charm, people are still addicted to c5 and haste, and hey, while you're waiting to refresh our buffs could you slow these mobs?<br />
Magician: Pet/Nuke dps<br />
Monk: Pulling, melee dps<br />
Necromancer: Pet, fantastic dps, group hp/mana taps.  They can also save your group a lot of headaches in some instanced areas by FD'ing during a wipe and making CR a snap with Convergence (necro rez) on your cleric/pally<br />
Paladin: Tanking with Stuns.  Tnargs can easily main heal a Hard LDoN on a Pally with good FT and AC and consistent use of stuns.  They are really lacking in single group ikkinz+ content at the moment (<br />
Ranger: Bow DPS.  Can pull in some areas.  Back in the day tracking owned in like West Karana, too hehe<br />
Rogue: Melee DPS, Escape/SoS to speed up CR<br />
Shadow Knight: Tanking/pulling.  Sadly, SK's are feeling about the same as we are compared to the competition from war/pal as tanks and bards/monks as pullers.  Sometimes being 3rd best at 2 things isn't nearly as good as being 2nd best at 1 (<br />
Shaman: Slows.  <br />
Wizard: mob go boom<br />
Warrior: Since the aggro fix, these guys are definitely the supreme tank.<br />
<br />
That the type of thing you're looking for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummmm....I'd say about 1/2 of the 65's on E'ci have at least PARTICIPATED in elemental+ raiding, most of them being elemental flagged at this point.  The &quot;main body&quot;, ashorty (name of the raid leader and the chat channel), has been in time for months now and has also beaten ikkinz raids1-4, and I beleive the second tier of public raiders, &quot;backflag&quot; is an RZ kill away.  9 times out of 10 a PoP progression mob on E'ci is done by a public raid that anyone can join.  Efforts are even made to give &quot;raidin's&quot; to people that aren't flagged for the zone yet.  <br />
<br />
Also, I don't see anyone saying you're &quot;less&quot; of a shaman because you're not post elemental, I see someone informing you that you happen to be inexperienced in the portion of the game in which the problems we're complaining about exist.  <br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty damn sure that given the &quot;post elemental&quot; nature of the current expansion (GoD) and the upcoming expansion (Omens of War, where the level cap will rise to 70 in case you didn't realise), you'll be crashing into these issues like a brick wall in a few months if you continue to play.  <br />
<br />
Also, saying that &quot;most players won't see the post elemental part of the game&quot; is foolish.  SoE has said that OoW will only have I think 1 &quot;locked&quot; zone, and you're crazy if you think level 66+ xp areas will be closer to BoT than PoE.  Don't jump down somebody's f'ing throat for explaining something to you, especially when you're ASKING for the damn explanation</div></div><hr />

Where did I say you are a worse player / shaman / human being?<br />
<br />
I merely told you that the general consensus is that most of the problems that you see people complain about do not yet affect you or do not affect you to the same degree.<br />
<br />
Is any of that insulting you or implying that you are a worse player?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, the problem with &quot;single defining ability&quot; is very few of the classes are actually specialists.  Wizards, Rogues, Warriors, and Clerics are really the only specialists left.  Monks are the closest aside form those 4.  If you're just looking for single spells/skills I'd say:<br />
Bard: Lulls<br />
Zerk: the frenzy/extra attack skill thing they get<br />
Beastlord: Pet<br />
Cleric: CH<br />
Druid: SemiCH<br />
Enchanter: VoQ<br />
Magician: Pet<br />
Monk: FD<br />
Necro: No single ability, this class is defined by its unique combonation of skills imo. but if I HAVE to choose i'd say lich.<br />
Pally: Group heals.<br />
Ranger: AM3/EQ aa's<br />
Rogue: Backstab<br />
SK: Hard to put a finger on, but I'd say their array of taps<br />
Shaman: canni<br />
Wizard: Concussion<br />
Warrior: Defensive</div></div><hr />

No offense, but this is a self defeating question.  A) no one has accurate numbers on this, I'm sure SoE doesn't even have a ball park figure for their whole playerbase.  B) It's not the point.  These guys see what the shaman class becomes in the endgame, thats the part of the game you are (like it or not) progressing towards (from a gameplay perspective).  Wouldn't you like to know that problems you are not even likely facing today are being fixed for you tomorrow rather than complaining that it's just more uber people complaining?<br />
<br />
I feel like you think you are a better shaman because you are in better gear and a guild who can do these things. This serves you what purpose in real life?<br />
Murtak was stating fact, he wasn't trying to stick it to you.  If you are defensive about your gear or your gameplay, that's your issue.<br />
<br />
Please, just stop being defensive and at least listen to what some of these guys are saying.  Agree with them or not, but listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its not like that on every server.  Your server may have open raids that take on time we have 4 maybe 5 guilds there.  Thats the biggest difference.  We have 2-3 Shaman in the Top 100 Shaman depending on stats filtered on http://www.eqrankings.com/ .  On my server you can see depending on what stat is used I fall around 75ish over all.  Now this is if everyone else updated their stats recently.  142 lvl 65 shaman are listed from the server I feel I represent the &quot;average&quot; shaman here Halfway to Time still need Minis and Sol Ro for PoF.  Unguilded I will never see Post Elemental other then some of the GoD trials.  Guilded I will most likely see much, much more.  I regularly Hunt PoE and Sol Ro Tower for exp.  You are right that I can only speak for the content I have seen.  But not every server has Open time raids guys.  It seems that when you are the &quot;little&quot; guy your opinions and observations just don't count.  I have played since EQ was released.  I have other classes Cleric, Monk, Warrior, that are lvl 65 with varying amounts of AA.  I have been guilded but after leaving the game for a year they just weren't the same so I stayed solo, gained AA like a mad man, well as much of a mad man as can be expected on a 2-3 hour a night play schedule.  I haven't seen what you have, but end game shaman and &quot;average&quot; shaman don't differ in many ways other then Gear, AA's, and what the guild they are in has accomplished.  Tactics don't change much you learn an encounter and then you pratice it till you win.  Your end game shaman just has a larger encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all, just saying that we &quot;average shaman&quot; may never have to deal with them.  They should be considered even if they effect a small percentage of us.  Now what I feel and how SOE will deal with it is entirely different.  If they have to expend X resources to fix for n% of players, where n% &lt; n2%  they won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure given time EVERY player would have the best gear, max AA's, LAA's, etc.  But realistically it is not gonna be like that.  With only one locked zone in OoW once unlocked it will open up to other &quot;locked&quot; zones much like progression is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't make any sense &gt;&lt;  There is only ONE locked zone in OoW.  Nothing beyond it will be unlocked.  It'll probably consist of 2 &quot;zones&quot; having a non instanced and instanced area, but other than that there won't be anything beyond it to unlock.  VT didn't unlock anything beyond VT in luclin, ST didn't unlock anything but ST in velious (though it did make some mobs more doable...the endgame stuff in velious was a lot more doable with primals than without), and VP didn't unlock anything but VP in kunark...it seems they're trying to get back to the general zone setup of those expansions, because of people that feel alienated by their inability to get flags.</div></div><hr />
