<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been in some decent PoD, PoN groups and get about a blue normal xp roughly every 1hr 30mins. I got all my 61 62 spells, couldn't get a PoJ trials group and was getting bored so I decided to hit the emperor in seb. Blood/emperor/PH are on a 26min 32sec rotation, so you would think one kill every 13 mins would be pretty bad. I noticed that the solo xp was almost exactly the same as a PoD or PoN group, with the added benefit of seriously &quot;phat lewt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well I'm staying in seb till I hit 63, then have another go at the trials. Yes, I do know PoV, PoS is great but if u can't get there seb is a pretty good alternative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What is your method of soloing emperor? I have read that he is very difficult if you do not have a snarer with you. I wouldn't mnd trying him solo if it is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're not going to like this but I use a 60 bot necro for snares. I have tried him 3 times without snare and died 3 times. I tried rooting but he got out of the torches non-gate area and gated, I also tried keeping his pet alive till end he still ran. The best solo method is to keep yourself below 2 bubs of health, he never runs. The one time I tried I healed myself over 2 bubs accidently then died. Also I believe you can get those fungus beast glands that cast snare, they would work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is this &quot;torches non-gate area&quot;? I've tried the pet thing, doesn't seem to make any difference what you do with the pet.<br />
<br />
I tried emp with a small group, and he gated back to spawn point. Fortunately, by some miracle, our tank got summoned but the skeles didn't aggro, and the Emp then died from the DoTs plus tank whacking on him. Out tank then looted and gated out with a thurg gate potion, as we had no crowd control other than root to handle the 6 skeles. The remainder fought back out and we called it a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One enchanter to rule them all...<br />

<br />
get a chanter with you and you will be able to clean the room with the 6 skellies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are 4 torches in the blood room if you keep the emperor between the 2 torches closest to his room and the door to his room he will never gate.<br />

Umm celebel we are talking about soloing him :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaytlin Snowstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's a good way to solo him...buy a serrated bone dirk(or whatever the name of that rogue daggar that casts darkness) or 2 in the bazaar, alpha project pet with avatar or carnage and haste/focus and your golden.</div></div><hr />

SBD and a Gnoll Hide Lariat makes for one awesome little doggy, just be sure you have a stable enough connection and enough time to play to make the cash spent worth it.</div></div><hr />

Umm celebel we are talking about soloing him :-/ <br />
<br />
and using a level 60 necrobot for snare is soloing him?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have 2 questions...<br />
<br />
1) what is alpha project? <br />
<br />
2) can you hand pets 2 weapons or just 1? i think just 1 because they double atk, not duel wield right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pets will dual wield only if given two weapons even rustys.  Also will equip SBD and proc.  What i need help with is how snare keeps emperor from gating to his spawn spot.  Also how does a solo shaman open door to emperor room?  Done the crypt and emperor several times with group but never solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hush Henora :P I can solo him but its less risky with bot snare. Crash just pay your local LFG rogue a few hundred plat or PL him by killing all the way down or ask a group in 6r to let you in to camp out. If you snare the emperor when he runs due to low health he will never cast because he is still in flee mode. If you root him when he runs, he knows hes stationary and will gate, same applies to any mob. The 100% sure fire method to stop him running is stay below 2 bubs health, but its risky with such a low health pool to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for info Mcast.  Didnt know about not gating if snared.  How can emperor be more of a knucklehead than simple sebilis froggies.  Seen a froggie gate from b2 before.  No biggie. Just had to repull him.  Now that I own torpor,  I'm gonna get an SBD for dogdog and try my luck for malo from emperor :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm interested in doing this a bit mysef.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The gang camp is also nice here at 61. The 4 iksar necromancers are dark blue and same with the leprous scarab and sometimes the two frogs next to it but I usually don't have time for the frogs. The necros are a pain with all the dotting and nuking they do but it's actually quite fun. The 61 pet's insane regen + replenishment really helps here because it's always getting dotted. For some odd reason the necros don't dot me often, they usually nuke me with ignite bones which bounce right off me with my resists.<br />
<br />
Not the world's greatest xp but ots of gem drops here. Haven't seen the gangerous scarab pop yet though (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Umpaa - you can single pull the emp at 60 (and quite possibly before) using slow from behind the doorway. Obviously his pet will come too :) So maybe I should say duo-pull :p<br />
<br />
I've even seen a level 58 tank get summoned to his gate spot and NOT AGGRO the other skeles there. DoTs killed off the emp and the pally looted - some crappy sword and no spells :( Luckily the pally had a Thurg gate potion to get out - no way he could have run past the skellies without aggroing them. Not sure if pacify would have worked or not......</div></div><hr />

Ok, not really, but I've never been into Seb and what I've seen of it is rather intimidating.  The thought of losing a corpse down there just gives me the willies. While I've spent a lot of time in dungeons, Seb just looks a lot deeper and more dangerous than places like SolB and LGuk and Permafrost.<br />
<br />
How does one solo all the way down to the Emperor?  With all the casters, I'd assume at least half the zone can see invis, right?  Just looking at the map on EQ Atlas you have to go through four named areas and who knows how many other mobs to get there.  Do you just fight your way down or is there an easier way?<br />
<br />
I'm only level 54, but I'll be hitting 60 and maybe even 63 in the next few weeks.  If anyone could offer some advise to this deep-dungeon noob, I'd appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Refer to my post in Hunting Guides, its got all you need to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sorry to hear about your nasty luck mccast, did you get it to drop yet? I got him to hand it over after about 14 kills. I spent about 2 weeks in there, I would log on and kill whatever was up, log out to play with kids, log back about  45 minutes later, rinse, repeat. He dropped Malo after I said &quot;ok one more shot at him then bed&quot;. So, I am done with this spot. I never got any other high selling spells so I probably averaged 700pp/hour camped in there as far as cash. Made about 10k in sells (and I gave breath of harmony to a guildie worth about 6-9kpp) and I still have a few spells on vendor. Good luck to anyone doing this camp, it is not hard but it is looong.</div></div><hr />

the 3 extra pets from spirit call seemed to be better for the interupting.</div></div><hr />

I, however, am level 60 and when I tried it I got beat down fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What about 61?  Could they just run past?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've found the exp to be quite lacking here and I'm only 61.  I've done emp camp but only seen Avatar (didn't scribe it) drop in a few days of camping... The gang scarab camp kinda sucks, with the necros casting, and most are LB at 61.  The NG camp is great for cash, but still sucks for exp despite being mostly dark blue.  Plane of Valor exp, on the other hand, is insane!  Get flagged, whatever it takes.  Getting 1% every 2 kills in a full group here.  Regular exp at 61, not aa.</div></div><hr />
