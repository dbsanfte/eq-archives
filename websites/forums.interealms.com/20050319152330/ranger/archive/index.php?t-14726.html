<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jalim</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am sick of this. About once a week someone in guild or a buddy of mine will link this. Ususally in /gu this will be followed by OMG WHERE DOES THAT DROP! (usually non-rangers saying this). I of course say &quot;It is fake&quot; and then the response is &quot;Well, someone HAS to have it for them to post a link&quot;. I usually say that there is a way to fake links, etc, but I am really curious where this link originated, if anyone has info let me know please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way to make fake links. There is a way to produce links for items which you may not own. This bow does exist in the items database. Doesn't mean anyone has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuma</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crap if your gonna make a fake bow, at least put some good range on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldy</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dunno, i heard its cross server and i dont know how that would work, i mean, if one server has it how does the other get it and it still be fake? unless the guy that made the fake link(if thats even possible) went on to like 40 servers. Oh well someone /petition and ask about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">12-01-2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that bow is in the item database. No, no player has one. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of items in the DB that players will never see that Developers have messed around with.<br />
<br />
How someone got the link? Most likely a GM calling up the item and linking it to someone, who then linked it to someone else, ect, and eventually got spread across servers through the cross-server chat, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
And no, you can't fake an item link to someone. Item links call up item numbers from the DB.</div></div><hr />
