<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I scanned thru the board, and if I missed a topic where this was already discussed I apologize in advance.  <br />
<br />
Can someone tell me which of these I should be using?<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 48 shaman, and for a long time I used root exclusively - I had read that it will cast faster and had less chance of being resisted.  At about 44 I switched to Enstill, because the mobs seemed to be breaking root very quickly.  Enstill does seem to have a higher resist rate though.<br />
<br />
Since I tend to be the only shaman in my group I don't have much to go on besides my own experiences, so some advice here would be great. (1) Will enstill be resisted more than root when cast at my lvl?  (2) Will enstill hold longer than root?  (3) Can anyone clear up whether CHA actually effects the chances of success or failure on root/enstill/slow's?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, and happy hunting<br />

<br />
Find the mana cost and cast time far outweighs the cost of casting the higher lvl ones, specially when they break the roots in less than 5 seconds half the time.<br />
<br />
CHA dont effect roots as far as I know, mobs get a sv vs spells to break the root over time till its time runs out then it auto breaks.  DD spells and such also allow the mob to try break the root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) It shouldn't be<br />
2) Ideallly, yes, 96 vs 48 seconds I think<br />
3) Never heard of CHA affecting root<br />
<br />
That being said, I still used root over enstill til I got Immobilize at 51.  At 58, I still use Immobilize.  I'd use Paralyzing Earth, except I haven't gotten a copy yet (sad, I know).  One thing that will help with root breaking is to Malisement/Malosi the mob to lessen its chance of meeting the sv check every few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use Root exclusively at Level 55. Between all-too-often immediate breaks (like the next line in the text window after Root has stuck), group members and pets nuking rooted MOBs, needing to hold off MOBs for just 10 seconds so someone else can get aggro, and resists, it seems better to go with a spell that uses the smallest amount of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The trick with root is always to be using mal* spells too. Root spell all have a MR check every ticks and you want that MR debuffed if you want them to stick long. And the dirty little secret of enstill is that it's easy to break with DD or spells with DD components (our DOTs, cleric stuns, etc.). Else, it will stay on longer than root.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole root line works the same way--skip the next part if you're familiar with it!  :)  Root has a magic resistance check on the mob, to see if it lands.  If it hits, the mob has an immediate check to see if it breaks root (also against MR), and then an additional check every six seconds (a 'tic') until it either breaks root, or until the spells wears off.  The mob has an additional check to see if it breaks root each time it is hit by melee damage or a direct damage component of a spell.  Damage shields and DoTs will NOT offer an additional chance to break root (outside of the initial damage component of some DoTs which DO offer a chance to break root).<br />
<br />
Comparisons of cast times and mana costs are important.  Root has one of the lowest cast times and lowest mana costs in spite of its short duration.  At 60, I have a 9 second cast on epic, and about a 5-6 second cast on both Bane of Nife and Pox of Bertoxulous.  Bane has to be reapplied every 48 seconds.  In my experience, direct damage of spells and melee seem to have a higher chance of breaking root then the normal 'tic' check--especially the spells.  I don't know if people have looked into that or not.  If you are using spells of short duration that have to be reapplied, then root is MUCH more mana efficient.  If you are casting on the mob every 30 seconds, it's less mana to have to reapply a root than a paralyzing earth.<br />
<br />
In terms of cast time, assume you have mobs beating on you or your party and you need to park it NOW.  Root is the second fastest casting of the line at 2 seconds.  Immobilize is the fastest at 1.75 seconds.  Root is 30 mana, immobilize is 80 mana.  Both are effective in parking mobs that a puller is bringing in.  You can target from a distance and root it fast enough once it gets in range that it stops before it gets to the party.  You may or may not be able to get the 2.5 second or 3.0 second spells off fast enough.<br />
<br />
Level seems to help substantially in terms of roots landing AND lasting through the duration of the spell (absent someone hitting the mob, of course).<br />
<br />
The only time I use longer roots is when I am playing ghetto chanter for my group, and we have high HP mobs.  Most good groups tear through mobs fast enought that we are ready for the next within 30 seconds.  It's annoying to have to wait on rooted mobs.  I'd rather re-root than have to wait or try to break root and drag it back to camp (if you are in a spot where the group can't afford to move up or back much).  It's VERY rare and situation that I ever use longer roots--mostly in places like Cazic Thule or maybe Siren's Grotto where the mobs take a little longer to kill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as I am concerned there are only 2 root type spells you should ever cast.  Root, and paralyzing earth.<br />
<br />
Root for everyday rooting, short cast time, good resist rate, virtually 0 mana.<br />
<br />
PE for root parking, nice duration, throw on a malosini as well and the mob in question is going to be sitting there a while.  This is great when you don't have an enchnater.</div></div><hr />
