<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't think you're able to use potions on pets, but wouldn't it give alchemy a decent use and be pretty cool to be able to give pets potions and they would use it? You could give your pets illusion potions, and have it look like you. Just thought that would be a cool idea before i went to bed lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is a good alchemy idea.<br />
<br />
There have been hundreds of fantastic alchemy ideas.<br />
<br />
none of them have ever been implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Expanding on that idea, perhaps some kind of targetable potion might by useful, allowing one person to use a potion on another without having to actually GIVE it to him.<br />
<br />
Some potions certainly couldn't work like this, like gate potions (forcibly gating someone using a potion so they have no chance to stop it), but it could be useful with potions like SoW or DS potions.<br />
<br />
Implementing this would be the first step in the holy grail...the REZ potion.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Others have pet-spells for their pets.<br />
<br />
We could have companion-potions for dogdog.<br />
<br />
Very good idea my friend.</div></div><hr />

rez potion could works like that ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the whole point of a potion is that you drink it.. if you drink it for someone else how exactly do you expect them to gain benefits? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">your pet drinks it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the whole point of a potion is that you drink it.. if you drink it for someone else how exactly do you expect them to gain benefits? ;)<br />
<br />
Maybe you could splash it on them, like holy water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it would give alchemy a good use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have targetable potions annoited on your spear of fate.  then you stick someone with it to give the benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">or it could be like a combine, it says Put potion in. and u target someone and click Use or something. Good idea though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">don't forget the throwable potions... the concept is consistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dogdog with a DS ... mmmmmmmmm</div></div><hr />
