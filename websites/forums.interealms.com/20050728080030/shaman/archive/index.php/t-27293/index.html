Thank god if i do decide to play WoW i will not end up sharing a server with this bunch.<br />

Although Europe probably has its fair share of retard WoW players too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After reading that thread I think it's more than safe to say that people on both sides of that arguement have very skewed and innacurate views of history, not just the US posters. As a sidenote the WoW forums are filled with these mental midgets. Other than official announcements it's not even worth visiting. Much more information can be found other places without all the prepubescent drama.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't get me started on American involvement in European affairs.<br />
<br />
Unless you want to claim that the influx of 1 million American soldiers and the tank had nothing to do with Allied victory?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Europe can little to no claim to doing much of anything in WW2.  Russia carried the load for 3 plus years against Germany while it was the United States pretty much going it alone versus the Japanese.<br />
<br />
It is typical European hubris to downplay the overwhelming American and Russian contributions and attempt to equate french  resistance  with the D-Day invasion.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, before you even THINK of responding with some tripe, two words:<br />
<br />
Marshall Plan.<br />
<br />
Moreover, we've seen that Europe STILL cannot manage her own affairs in the latter half of the 20th century.<br />
<br />
Balkans.<br />
<br />
And finally, the LONGEST period of uninterrrupted peace on European soil was managed ONLY by the stationing of AMERICAN troops for there(in).<br />
<br />
So fek off with your claims of equitable contributions (cough NATO cough) and and shared experiences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the beauty of it though, the socialst state controlled media in third world europe doesn't tell the truth, but it is okay, next time you need to be bailed out, America will help you.<br />
<br />
We are kind and powerful, even to our enemies in Europe.<br />
<br />
Don't want anti-Europe stuff, quit the trash posting about America, punks. I have to listen to this garbage in the grey, I do not need it here.<br />

And to think, we saved there butts twice. MAybe this time we should start the world war. I am sure if we dumb down the argument enough bush would take us to war for PvP/RP WoW servers. <br />
<br />
Teh stupid is strong in that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meia_Hexendoktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that whole thread is just sad.  trying to justify the American servers getting rp pvp because &quot;omg teh Fr3nch suxx0rz Amer1ca is b3tt3r!&quot; is just retarded.  Vivendi is a European company, duh!  if it was based in America who do you think would be getting the rp pvp first?  imo they are just taking care of their own.</div></div><hr />
