<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keistle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm sure a few of you know that all i needd to complete my epic ragebringer quest is that Damned kedge robe..... bane of rogues everywhere.<br />
<br />
I took a smallish group over to kith tonight to try to get a kedge of one of the dark elfs there, but it was a miserable failure.  We had a 55 monk attempting to FD the dark elfs, and a ranger to tag the last one standing. Granted, the Monk was rather inexperienced in FDing in a situiation such as this, and our luck wasn't so hot.... but i'm sure there are better ways.<br />
<br />
KoE seemed to do ok, so how does KoE break the dark elf cabin?<br />
<br />
what do you use, where do you use it and how exactly does it work?<br />
<br />
also, i've heard rumor that a 60 ranger can solo pull the dark elfs? is this true? and if so, how does one do that?<br />
<br />
Lastly, in your esteemed opinions, how many groups and specific classes is needed to kill the dark elfs, once they are seperated succesfully?<br />
<br />
Thanks fort the help KoE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mawa is the master at pulling that cabin solo so I'll leave the strategy to him.  However with the Ranger they are probably using Harmony and single pulling from max range with an arrow or spell.  I think that would be the way a ranger or druid could do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Harmony works.  Sometimes with pathing, the mob may run through/next a mob that was harmony then aggro them also.  For that situation I run them to the zone while a FD monk would tag the Coercier off of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mawafu Steelfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I watched a 59 ranger harmony the cabin then a 60 rogue single pull it. So the single pull is more than likely just based off of lvl agro after harmony.<br />
<br />
The way I do it is just from experience. I don't really know how to explain it other then I died a few times through trial and error if you remember from that morning. It's a monk thing I guess  ;P<br />
<br />
As far as groups go, I would suggest 2 groups minimum with at least 1 tank with defensive as at least 2 of the DEs were yellow to me at 57 and a cleric to keep him up. The rest would just be back up healers and damage dealers.<br />
<br />
Look me up in game the next time you think about doing this and if I'm free I'll come help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Level 60 Ranger Harmonies the entire camp at max range then pulls with arrow.  One group is all you need in this version.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
High Level Necro gets SoW puts up Harmshield and runs around the house setting off all the HT, then FDs safe distance away.  Then same Necro pulls house and runs for it while other FD class (preferably SK with Disease Cloud) spell tags the mob you want then FDs while the Necro trains the rest of it to the zone.  Tagger then peels desired mob off of FDer while other mobs are chasing Necro.  This requires two groups but is not dependant on having high level characters, just on having a necro and enough to kill the mobs one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to add, the other DE's can drop the robe also not just the Coercer.  So don't think that if the Coercer doesn't have it to stop.  Clear all the caster DE's at least.  I don't think the warrior guy at the front of the house can drop it but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just make sure you have a shammy there for uber buffs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">uh, I might have read that wrong and ignore me if I did... but don't have a Ranger tank those DE. Just my opinion, unless its Nolani... since she tanks better than Sinsem. Hell, Nephlim tanks better than Sinsem and he's a level 44 Enc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dont think I will ever tank em. Maybe Kite them ;)  Though I could tank them for 20 sec before I die :eek:</div></div><hr />
