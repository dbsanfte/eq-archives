<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of any viable solo spots @ lvl 61?  This is not for a hard-core soloer, but for someone looking for something to do in the off moments.<br />
<br />
I have both epics, Regen3/Run3/MC1/ND1/CF1/NA1, and decent equiptment.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WW is still my favourite place to solo at level 61.   The xp I get doesn't  concern me, I just really like the zone.  It's almost always close to deserted and it's one of the more beautiful zones in EQ, IMO.  Soloing in WW nets me 1 AA yellow per hour, plus a little cash from hounds, and furs and silks to use or sell.<br />

Depends on how long you play for in your off moments, of course, as to whether such as out of the way place is a good option.     Also depends on how motivated you are by xp, there's probably much better places you can get it solo in the planes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was thinking about this with exp. in mind, to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If xp is the motivating factor, bow kiting in second tier planes is probably the way to go.   There's a bunch of threads in this forum and the PoP one with more specific information. :)</div></div><hr />
