<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just bought EQ recently and I have been playing on the stromm server just trying out the different classes. I'm planning to move to a regular server in the near future and i'm going to make a shaman (race still undecided) and was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to donate some plat/items and show me the ropes. Please leave your char name, level and server name. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please dont flame him too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I loath beggers and more so, I hate poorly created sob stories. I want the 5 seconds of my life that it took to read that post back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you dont want to donate anything then don't, i didnt post this expecting people to just rush over. If you want to i'll be grateful, if you don't then don't. IMO tips (that's what i prefer) on how to play your character right are 1000x more valueable than any in-game item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sigh ...... and I thought we could get away from beggars on this board.<br />
<br />
Wonder what happened to the sense of &quot;achievement&quot; of doing things oneself.<br />
<br />
Well if you need help to learn the ropes on Torv, np. Just dun expect hand outs.<br />
<br />
PS Oh btw, what's wrong with Stromm server? If my memory serves me correctly, it is a normal server, just the newest that doesn't allow character transfers so there are no high level toons right off the bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as i said in my post above id much rather be shown around thatn given handouts. I don't want to become a high level newbie. I've seen too many of those in other games to know that I sure do not want to be one of them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: When i asked for donations if anything i was looking for aybe 5 plat to buy a level 5 spell, nothing much, or items that a higher level character would just throw away as trash. In no way was i asking for uber gear or anything like that.</div></div><hr />

Sold on mysupersales.com for $49.95.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Matten, first off i aplaud you for playing on the newbie server,  you sir are experiencing EQ how it is best. If i could give you any advice, it would be to stay there and enjoy the game while it lasts cause soon that server will change and fall inline with the rest and over run with ubers and uber twinks rushing through the game think there is level 1 then ding level 65.<br />
<br />
Stay there, group up, explore Blackburrow, work hard at your character and dont expect anything but advice to be given to you. In alot of ways i envy you so dont throw it away.<br />
<br />
As far as real advice. Start building yourself as a HP and AC monster. Dont forget to sprinkle in a lil wisdom, but you are not a druid, you are not a weak lil wizard, you are a tough as nails living in nature, drawing from nature kind of class. You should be off tanking adds at all levels, or atleast be able to when needed. Once you good slows start coming you will be taking the hits alot so get used to it and prepare, when you solo you will also be taking the hits. unless you root and rot, which i never liked.<br />
<br />
Spend your cash wisely, when you reach 34ish realize that Crystal Caverns in Velious is a gold mine for tradeskill supplies to sell and straight up velium to sell to vendors.<br />
<br />
Work hard, play hard and have as much FUN as you can and the pay off will be so big when you look back.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I started a beastlord on Stromm 2 weeks ago.  I am now level 25, I have over 500pp in the bank, 2 polished steel ulaks (among other weapons to practice with), im also sporting full greyhopper hide armor (not bad for low level bst).<br />
<br />
My advice, go play, the loot will come with time.  There is nothing better than killing mob_01 for the really cool piece of equipment you have been lusting after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I start a new character (I have 4 newbies on Stromm - all in starting cities I've never been in before or have little experience with) I go to www.eqatlas.com and click on the starting city, then the quests link. Doing the quests in your own starting city will get you basic armor and weapons. Will introduce you to solo and group hunts and move you through your levels in a steady fashion. Steady leveling means your skills are right up there and generally your cash and gear stays even as well.<br />
<br />
I then go to the class boards like this one and read the writeups on quests and hunting grounds. The possibilities are limitless.<br />
<br />
My level 12 stromm beastlord is working hard at tailoring and various quests and somehow ended up at leavel 12 and with almost 20 plat in the bank without doing any /auction at all.<br />
<br />
There are tons of quest and camped items at every level. Yes there is a level 3 hopper that drops a magical weapon, a level 3 spider that drops a magical weapon, etc. Nothing beats the satisfaction of doing your own research and outfitting and playing your character your own way. IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent advice that bears repeating.  After reading this board, that's the approach I used to build my shaman and I've been very happy with the results.</div></div><hr />
