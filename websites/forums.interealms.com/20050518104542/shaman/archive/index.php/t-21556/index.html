who stops the mez'd mob from killing your partner ? i doubt you could, once mez breaks, and you get a resist/stun its pretty much over.<br />
i learned long ago my best partners, are melee.</div></div><hr />

Its a skilled duo, but a highly effective one. Dont let the down talking sway your views of reality. If your quick and the chanter knows what they are doing with runes and stuns and mezz control, then it can work very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In a word - no.<br />
<br />
Shaman best partner is FD-Melee type, followed by Necro and MAYBE Mage. Sure there are people who do Rogue and Paladin etc, but if you're looking for the path of least resistance - SK / Monk.<br />
<br />
Enchanter best partner is Druid, Ranger, Necro and maybe Paladin. Note - two different paradigms: Charm duoing versus Melee - self heal.<br />
<br />
All bets are off if you're two boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a RL friend of a level 65 chanter, we duo very well.<br />
<br />
Snare glands (if not a troll with necklace) are extemely helpful. Other snare abilities work as well.<br />
Method i use is:<br />
1- malos<br />
2- root (short lived root if possible, VP if needed)<br />
3- malosinia and tash.<br />
4- Snare gland<br />
5- Either pull a mob to it, to break root with melee, or  wait for root to drop.<br />
<br />
Keep the chanter a long long way away. Runes are vital. Haste the charmed pet if you want. When we duo, i mainly debuff the mob the pet is on, and keep Q on the pet all the time. <br />
<br />
A neat trick, if you are not too worried about the DPS, is use torpor instead of Q. So when it break, the mob is snared. Not sure if that still works, but it used to.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Duo'ing in the tactics bedroom is very easy, as is HoH. Without snare, it becomes quite nasty, and tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually exp with a charming mage in BoT. Quite efficient with an equipped and FoS'd / FA'd / hasted pet. When things go well we clean all the stormriders and gargoyles before the repop...<br />

<br />
Exactly. When a mob of the power of a PoP mob is hasted and buffed having torpor on him isnt hurting it that bad.  Also space is key. Letting the chanter run around and cast stuns/charms/roots is key.<br />
<br />
But then again, chanters are a beast in their own respect.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that if you're slowed, the slow effect negates haste and then applies its slow to the base melee attack delay.  Torpor, for example, would make someone 30% slower than base no matter what haste spells are currently in effect.  Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see, as an optimist I would have to believe Lit. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'd imagine the chanter being a long ways away. This isn't going to be a two box, no. I don't think I would two box well even if I could anyway. <br />
<br />
That's a good technique if it still works...torpor chanter charmed mob upon break. <br />
<br />
I'm going to have to be really proficient with my VP. A real necessity for this duo. <br />
<br />
<br />
What's a good duo spot to try this dynamic duo out? the floors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was under the impression that if you're slowed, the slow effect negates haste and then applies its slow to the base melee attack delay.

<br />
Correct when the effects of torpor &quot;slow&quot; is on the mob it would negate the haste on the mob and calculate its slow off the base DPS of the mob, while torpor is in effect.<br />
<br />
My point however is that the mob is still going to be putting out some nice damage, even with torpor on it. Bottom line is , chanter is shaman are a decent duo if both are skilled and knowledgable in their capabilities   their classes. Pretty much always have been. Duoing with a melee is the &quot;safe&quot; approach. No one can deny that safe has its advantages. But im not exactly a safe player ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you are getting single pulls and have some room to manouver there is no reason you wont be an excellent duo, you have malos+roots+disease root for great crowd control, with slows and heals you can survive a ton. I dont have any problems with the chanters I have duo'd with in the past. if you both have a clue then its easy enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is my exact dual box setup and has been for some time.   Honestly the chanter was something to to do with my gf's abandoned lvl 43 character at the time.  Yes the lack of snare is bleh but honestly how do you think chanters charm solo?  Mines a long story I wont bore you with but more or less it comes down to this.  Ability for a chanter to gain xp is off the charts solo.  Even still post charm nerf I make more xp dual boxing the shaman and the chanter than I ever could with the shaman soloing.  Shamans purpose when doing this is:<br />
1) to slow the mobs <br />
2) Off tank the mobs (lr5 owns)<br />
3) distract broken pet (vp which is disease curable is great for this)<br />
4) Malosinia the pet<br />
5) heal chanter<br />
6)  Throw dots for added albet minor dps<br />
<br />
The shamans my main and has 150 aa's under his belt with passable gear (just got elemental), so where I'm xping in hoh and tactics he can off tank as needed for periods of time.  I doubt this combo would be nearly as effective in areas where he'd be pancake, but even still I can make comfortable xp with this combo at a faster rate by far than ldon pickup groups.  The chanter is eh gear that I got her  when I had sebilis money while it was still farm central this summer.  She just hit 65 today and has 10 aa.  Was really hard to learn to do dual box but I did it, and should be substantially easier with two active people in an actual duo.  Shaman should have vp3 though and SOME ability to last while getting pounded, otherwise he'll just be by and large leaching off the chanter while the chanter dies alot.  ps another tip dont be afraid to slow charmed pet when it breaks then just use abolish disease afterwords..wont touch tash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When duo'ing, I've only slowed the pet before it is charmed. I cure it after that with my Wolf Callers pants (good thing to hold onto)<br />
When charm breaks, I just want to control the pet, and VP/root does that just fine. The cast time on slow means i can't heal or do anything else but slow. Its simply not efficient to slow the mob on a charm break.<br />
<br />
IMO, easiest to stick with low level root, and get things under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Druid works better I would think. Stackable mana regen, better fast heals along with snare and instant evac to make it considerably safer.<br />
<br />
Apart from providing healing for little &quot;oopsies&quot;, if the chanter survives, there really doesn't seem much a shaman can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They make a great duo. He charms, I slow.<br />
<br />
I duo with my friend Revere. Wherever we fight he grabs a pet and hastes it, and there's your melee.<br />
<br />
sure when charm breaks it gets a bit hairy, but I think I can count on one hand the number of times a charm break has got us killed. Now biting off more than we can chew that has got us killed a few times :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Corazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally unless you planning on charming at high end I'd say top to bottom a mage is by far the best partner for a shaman from lv 4 to 65 over all in most zones. anyone who says monk or sk or pally has never really seen the potential of the mage first of all the 61 mage pet out tanks most 60 tank players and has a nice stun and duo proc from weapons and thats at 61. At 65 you can take ornate rune droppers in BoT using the mage charm or using just his pet to tank in Tactics including the mob thatll drop you ornate chain ft2 bracer and pulling wise a good shaman can split most mobs and if not you always have COH 55 mage spell to save your butt in most zones.. oh and not to mention the mage makes a good back up healer for you tank thats his pet.<br />
PS any good shaman can do enough CC for duoing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">he didint ask what other classes would be good he asked if chanter would be good... Bottom line is how good of a shaman are you and how adept are you at making adjustments... I have done Many things in this game bottom line is  you can make almost anything work if you are skilled enough to do it.... Go out and try its the best way you are going to find out. Just cause someone else can do it doesent mean you can... and just cause someone else cant doesent mean you cant =).<br />
<br />
Ive duoed with a chanter just fine if the chanter is skilled and you are skilled its quite a powerful combo.</div></div><hr />
