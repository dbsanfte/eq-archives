<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am quite sure I will probably get shot down very quick.<br />
But how about this, give Clerics and Druids a low %slow 30-20, then increase our heal. That way no one can say we suck at healing because our slow rocks so much. Just a rough sketch. I thought I would throw it out there.<br />
One more thing, another line of healing. Instead of healing for X amount of HP's heal for % amount of HP's, at lower lvls it would be pretty ineffecient but at higher lvls(end game) it might level the playing field a bit. Tanks has 7k hp's you heal for 40% that's almost 3k a decent upgrade. I am sure the clerics would scream about that one though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Down with Slow.<br />
<br />
Giving yet MORE classes access to Slow is not the answer.<br />
<br />
I think what is happening right now is that the Devs are seeing that 75% Slow was a huge mistake as it made content balancing far too difficult.  They tried to correct it with mitigation, but it screwed one class over big time . . . unfortunately we were that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Give every class an instant click -1000 75% slow. As a keyboard hot-key. Then give us some healing and dps changes, and maybe we could slow a few magic-immune creatures and have AE slow as our flavor. So many classes have slow now that it is just a millstone in current content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you give everyone slow, why would anyone group with a shaman then?<br />

ahh, cha buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Give 'em slow, I don't care.<br />
<br />
That would kick the legs out of their using slow to nerf us and keep us nerfed.  <br />
<br />
They'd have to restore our playability if they did, or at least would have no excuse not to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree. Screw slow, give us a new toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The original suggestion proposed giving both clerics and druids a lesser variant of slow. The only problem I have with that is where druids are concerned. I think it would have the opposite effect of the original poster's intent in the sense that druids would now be able to snare the mob, and slow it well before the mob comes to the group for about 30%. Add to that their greater capability to heal and I see it increasing their marketability more than the resulting healing changes would increase desireability of grouping with our class. On the other hand, it would add to druid's bag of tricks when soloing: when a mob DOES catch up with them, it would hit them slower for increased chance to channel a snare and scoot away again.<br />
<br />
I'm still debating whether clerics would even want a slow spell, outside of allowing them to hunt in a smaller group. A meat shield with a cleric who can both slow (albeit for 30%) and complete heal might be a little unbalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think that the healing, nuking, snaring, and mana regen buffing abilities of Druids is highly underrated.  If slows get any less useful, add snare to our spell lineup and you will never see a Shaman LFG :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think anyone else really noticed I said then increase our heal right after I said give them a minor slow. Because really the dev see's our slow as so high and powerfull(granted it is most of the time). Give them a piece of ours then increase our heal to maybe to the amount of druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another odd idea:<br />
<br />
Give us some different spirit &quot;pets&quot; that when around increase various skills. So if you have a tank that likes to dual wield you summon your dual wield pet or if your main source of damage is a ranger using a bow you summon an archery pet.<br />
<br />
This would mean shamans would be wanted (and needed in the group not just as buff-bots). And we dont have to cast a damn buff every 10 minutes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Game needs to cut to the chase. <br />
<br />
Give bstlords an 80% unresistable slow effective on all mobs, except named, in any zone except PoP, GoD, LDoN. Remove the ability to cast any slow spell in PoP, LDoN (above level 59) adventures, Gates zones.<br />
<br />
Give shaman a pet that is 2X as powerful with 4X as many hitpoints and that self buffs more than any class can buff every stat. Allow pet to do tradeskills on command with maxxed (GM-250) level skill. Provide pet with ability to single pull (FD, lull, pacify, root - as needed) and snare/slow on incoming. Give pet a self-cast LoH without recast time restriction.<br />
<br />
Allow pet to solo xp when owner is offline with all experience going to its own set of pet only-AA abilities. Troll pets will only solo in Gunkta (whatever that freakin frog town is.)<br />
<br />
Make this pet 6X as large as the beastlord tiger with the standard shaman &quot;unable to shrink pet&quot; ability as the penalty for its other abilities.<br />
<br />
Let the beastlords whine for a few months while we bask in glory of groupage ... which we won't care about since we can solo PoP named/bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Down with Slow.<br />

--------------<br />
I actually think that the developers saw that slow mitigation was the &quot;EASY&quot; way to balance content - not necessarily that a 75% slow was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Obviously the end result is the same, slow became less powerful relative to other skills.  Shaman were the class most affected by the change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shaman should get /disc defensive....<br />
<br />
Just so we can see the Warriors all pout and stage a walkout again.  That was some good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Whatever the solution is, it's clear from both any clear thinking about the issue and what Rytan and the other developers themselves have said about it that slow will continue to ensure we will never get meaningful upgrades.<br />
<br />
The entire class continues to be &quot;balanced&quot; around a slow that is only 5% less than one class and 10% less than another's ...and THEN is mitigated so that those differences don't even matter.<br />
<br />
Shamans as a class are entirely balanced as though slow DOES matter, and to every tiniest degree.<br />
<br />
Is a few percent worth the difference in utility we have between a beastlord or a chanter?<br />
<br />
The developers answer with a resounding YES!<br />
<br />
As long as we agree with them that slow, even a mere 5% greater than the next guy BEFORE MITIGATION !!! (did I mention ! ?) is either valuable or for heaven's sake DETERMINATIVE, we had better be content to rest on our pride and laurels because we will not bet upgraded one significant iota.  We will be essentially dead as a class.<br />
<br />
Which we are, right now, except for invites from either friends or the ignorant.<br />
<br />
You'd have to be a dunce to invite a shaman now compared to an equally equipped and AA'd beastlord or chanter.<br />
<br />
I know I groan a little when I see someone inviting one when I'm playing my SK.<br />
<br />
So go on crowing about slow the way we had every right to two years ago.  Back then, it applied and I'd be first in line to do it.<br />
<br />
As of now, that kind of mix of ignorance and optimism doesn't really apply, and is detrimental to the class as a whole.</div></div><hr />
