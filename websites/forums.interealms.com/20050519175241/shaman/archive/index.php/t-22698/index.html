<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I have been AEing in MM for about 2 days now, and im still max KoS. Is there any faster way to get RoS faction? because this sucks  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dwarf King in kaladim gives +RoS. Can solo him, but you may get 4-5 guards too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">was there last night killing him for about 2 hours, come to find out they super nerfed his faction hit =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so to get good RoS were left with AEing mistmore for days on end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I lvld my chanter in MM from probably mid 20's-45ish<br />
I pl'd many MANY people in there pbae'ing.<br />
I was amiable to Talendar before I ganked his ass, not sure what I am at now.<br />
<br />
<br />
the faction hits in MM are pretty smalll :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so noone knows any place that is quicker than AEing in MM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">High Keep... kill the bards and nobles.  Don't ask me why they give RoS faction - but they do (or used to when i leveled there ages ago).  This is how I got ally with RoS a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">how long did it take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive AE'd 6 days in MM and still scowls.<br />
<br />
going to australia for 3 weeks, tempted to leave Urd afk in one of the towers with pet up, let the respawns get killed for faction for 3 weeks :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">urg that's how i got live guk faction with my shaman and my necro :) did it in ass/sup.<br />
<br />
also did that in droga before the change with my necro to get chardok faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe, tried it tonight, almost died to a named because of the fire dots and 4 respawns at the same time from the original AE pull! Nasty stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">id guess that the monkeys/developers have over loked this; they have forgetten to include a kunark faction method.  they need to implement a way to do faction with hand ins. eq gob skin or swrds from veksar<br />
<br />
Maybe we should ask the forum spokesman to raise this as an issue.  there will be a higher number wanting this faction than ever wanted chardok faction; thats alot easier to get.<br />
<br />
possibly there is some other way, that has been missed or someones just keeping very quiet about.<br />
<br />
Would ros be oposed to any factionin cabilis??? would kiling named npc there give big hits??  would make historical sense....given the dragon/iksar wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ok well i made a pet and gave him a kit, and am going afk tonight in the gypsie pit. So bleys no trains please mate  =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shoot, I think I'm gonna go farm Prismatic Dragon Scales in Sleepers Tomb !<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">heh..I had the same though Faern...<br />
<br />
