i apperciate your patience in helping me again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Upgrades to think about (some just +hp/ac, others +wis).  Most are single group questable.<br />
<br />
Shield of Bane Warding<br />
Divine Inspiration<br />
Mask of War<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Earring of the Solstice<br />
2x velium fire wedding rings<br />
2x electrum black sapphire earrings<br />
Oboulous Death Shroud or Death Watcher's Shroud<br />
Spear of Fate<br />
Bracelet of Sense<br />
<br />
Also start collecting Rune Weavers stuff if your guild (assuming you have one) isn't doing HoT or WToV.  As you go up in levels, you should start doing Kael more.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents!  Mix and match as you like.  It leans a lot more towards +wis than hp/ac, but that is, of course, your choice!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Get your spear of fate--+15 wis is nice.  All you need is a couple of mages and clerics!  I'm on your server, and I have a tear for MQ if you want it.  Just need the faction, need to spawn Rak, and have the mages and clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Drop the black Fur Boots in inventory and get JB for damn near free (you can use the boots from inventory, so just put them on a hotkey)<br />
<br />
Shoulders:<br />
  Chodaki Hide Spaulders<br />
  XXX Dragonwing Mantle<br />
<br />
Dump the 2 rings and get a pair of 6/65 rings<br />
<br />
2 Imbued Ivory Earrings<br />
<br />
You hat...well, get ANYTHING. 3ac on your head is a death wish.<br />
  JB<br />
  Totemic<br />
  Arctic Wyvern<br />
  Iksar Hide<br />
<br />
Get a Totemic/JB helm and Chodaki Spaulders and you will spend next to nothing and get a nice boost in AC while taking only a small hit to Wiz.  <br />
<br />
Face:<br />
  Crystal Spider Eyes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not an expert, but I am pretty happy with my gear. 1800 hp  900 ac 223 wis  FR 75 CR 95 MR 105 all in no drop gear (rallos zek). I do have some benefits because I am an Iksar and therefore more scaly and wiser. But you got slam (god I would love slam in pvp). Anyway, I digress. here are my thoughts (they will mostly be in no drop gear because that is what i know. Plus you dont have to pay for no drop. most of it gives you xp at 51 while camping it. I took your level, money in bank, and that you are unguilded. I did most of this stuff duo with my sk friend who has been the same level as me.):<br />
<br />
legs - Kromriff military legs  ac 14  6 str 5 wis 5 cold 5 dis quest thurgadin<br />
<br />
finger - Shadel Bandit ring<br />
-or-<br />
1st chardok ring from quest (you just have to do the faction work)<br />
-or-<br />
feather rings (grimling forest no drop NOT lore) ac 3 3 str/cha/fr 20 hp/mana<br />
<br />
waist - Spider fur Belt<br />
<br />
arm - Gladiator sleeves (if you doing SS faction. drops in KD)  +16 AC +9 Str +5 Dex +3 vsMg +2 vsFire +2 vsCold +2 vsPos +2 vsDis +20 HP <br />
-or-<br />
Hardened Grey Sleeves from grey 16 AC +6 Str +6 Sta +6 Dex +5 vsCold +25 HP<br />
<br />
ear - Claw of sonic howler (grimling forest NOT lore NO DROP)  ac 3 3 str/wis/int/pois/cha<br />
-or-<br />
player made hp/mana earring if you want to go that way<br />
<br />
shoulder - Meditative Blanket 10 AC +2 Str +2 Agi +3 Wis +3 Int <br />
<br />
face - personally I had a cougarskin mask for a long time ac 6 2 dex/agil 10 hp. I have that one from rokyl atm ac 5 +7 int/wis more damage 2, but I am trying to get the gangrenous beetle mask from OS. 7 AC +5 Str +5 Dex +10 vsDis +20 Mana  More ac and DR to raise that up) if you have the cash try to get crystal spider eyes  8 AC +3 Wis +3 Int +35 HP +35 Mana. i would love this item, but no drop &gt; manaburn<br />
<br />
head - that othmir is doing you no good. get a Jscale helm from KC  +10 AC +2 Wis +2 Int +5 vsMg   That stuff just rots. Heck get a full suit of jscale and keep what you like and toss what you dont.<br />
<br />
wrist - drop the supple scale and use jscale bracer  8 AC +4 Wis +4 Cha  until you find something better. only thing supple is good for is casting heals away from Gore's AE and pvp. If you are 3 football fields away from the mob you are killing then go play a druid. shamans get up close and personal. you should be bathing in your enemies blood, not being prissy like a caster.<br />
-or-<br />
coldain military wristguard ac 10 5 str 6 wis 5 mr 5 cold extended affiliction 3 (makes your dots last longer). This is my favorite piece of gear atm until I get bracer of deep sea from ntov. anything that makes me do more damage, slows last longer, malx stick longer, you gotta love.<br />
<br />
neck - shrouded medallion  12 ac 5 str 25 mana 15 mr 5 fr/cr no drop from robed guys in ME<br />
<br />
Shield - if you want to hunt chardok (before you get your ring is more faction work later) or you can afford it, the tried and true sarnak battle shield is good. i love the hp's and resists on this one. or the skull marked shield from the grey.<br />
<br />
You should go to allakazams and research heavily. I have used my moneys worth and more on that site. get yourself an account there and research. did i say research?<br />
<br />
When you have level 60 people asking 'where did you get that item. wow. and its no drop? wow!' then you know your work was well done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">NP. glad to help. I took in account that you werent 60 with unlimited cash and uber guild to help. Sometimes some people say get this such and such gear but it is kind of unatainable for some. like me.<br />
<br />
Iksar get a huge boost in AC/wisdom/hps/resists with Hate gear. I cant imagine how you poor softies do it.   :) But before Hate I had to get everything I could in no drop so it was a challenge. Glad I did it too. Had very good wis/ac for non uber.<br />
