<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild's recently got into Plane of Time, and run into a problem there, so I thought I'd see if anyone else has come across it, partly curiosity, and partly to see if anyone has any suggestions for a work-around. We're already talking to GMs, but I'm sure you know how that goes - it's been over 2 weeks so far.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what happens is this. We can zone into potimea no problem, and set up, and zone into potimeb and start the phase 1 trials. However, when we succeed on the first set of trials, the clocks open.... then no more mobs. The next set of clocks opens, we can go run around the pit etc, people have zoned into Tactics from Time (which I believe means that RZ is dead) but no phase 2 for us. We get ported out when the original phase 1 timer runs out. It's happened 3 or 4 times, and is very frustrating, we want to progress.<br />
<br />
The situation on my server is - the first guild in Time now raids once a week, Sunday, and clears Time, from phase 1 to Quarm. All dead.<br />
<br />
The second guild to get into Time is up to Tallon Zek, I believe. They raid during the week, but I don't know any more details.<br />
<br />
We're the third guild to get into Time, (the only Euro guild in Time) and so far there are only the three. As far as I know, they've not had any problems like this at all.<br />
<br />
It seems that we might be stuck in the first guild's instance, where everything including Quarm is dead. However, we (and they) have no clue how this could happen. We have relatively cordial relations with that guild, but we don't join their time raids and they don't join ours. On at least one of our raids, there has been a member of that guild in potimeb, who went linkdead on their raid and repopped in the GY, but that shouldn't cause problems - they must have had that happen with the second guild before with nothing going wrong.<br />
<br />
One thing that's been suggested that might work is to wait the 5.5 days respawn time and try again in the small window before Quarm dies again. However, this only leaves us Saturday night to raid in, which has never been our strongest raid day, particularly recently with people going to Christmas parties etc. Naturally, even if this works, it isn't an acceptable long term solution.<br />
<br />
So, has anyone else come across problems being the third guild into time, and if so, do you know any ways around it?</div></div><hr />

sorry, you got cockblocked (by intention or not).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have read that, and I don't believe we've been cockblocked like that, intentionally or otherwise.<br />
<br />
The exploit that is detailed there allows another guild to have access to our instance and hence to clear it. This would mean that on at least one occasion we would have had to have had mobs in an instance in phase 2+, which we have not.<br />
<br />
In the example on the FoH guild boards, the guild has partially cleared one day, and come back to continue the next day only to find their instance empty.<br />
<br />
In our case, we've never had any mobs in phase 2 -it seems that we're going into the first guild's instance, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Also, we're relatively friendly with the first guild, but they're not particularly friendly with the second guild. If they could and would cockblock in time, I'm pretty sure they'd do it to them, not to us. And the second guild isn't yet capable of the level of clearing (i.e. ALL) that we've experienced.</div></div><hr />

...every time, we pass through the clocks at the end of the trials into an empty Phase 2, run into an empty Phase 3 pit, charge the homes of the Gods in Phases 4 and 5 and even enter an empty Quarm's lair in Phase 6. No mobs whatever. No progression.<br />
<br />
No one's cockblocking them.  Guild #1 and #2 are on different raid times completely from Kianor's (#3 guild) times. I can safely say this cuz I'm in said #2 guild. It's EST vs Euro time.<br />
<br />
Evidence?<br />
<br />
#1 guild clears to and kills Quarm their one Time raid of the week.<br />
#2 guild is working on VZ (phase 4).<br />
The instance they seem to be stuck in has to be that of guild #1 (see quote above), which has no reason to cockblock, because as Kianor said, they are on relatively good terms and don't even raid in the same time frame.  Even though we (#2 guild) aren't on super great terms with Kianor's guild, they are out of Time long before we start raiding, so to cockblock them would be a waste, as their instace runs no where near ours.<br />
<br />
It's simply something buggy with Time and OC happens to be the unfortunate man out.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear someone has finally contacted you all about it.  I hope things get fixed for you guys soon though.  Nothing sucks more than dwindling attendance because of frustration that you don't have control over!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night the american guild ganked the euro guild's time instance (unintentionally) and cleared it.  Euros got on to find their instance empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, we eventually got sorted out by a GM, I believe it was a dev. We each had to be summoned and he cleared an internal flag (I assume it was an instance flag).<br />
<br />
Last night, we cleared phase 1 and actually found mobs up in phase 2. Hooray.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what Jinheim is referring to, but it's nothing to do with my guild.<br />
<br />
Also, thanks for posting a clarification, Thlayli. We never did think AV was responsible, since Quarm was dead in the instance we found ourselves in, and I've already explained why it wasn't a stolen instance.<br />
<br />
What possibly happened is a the first time we passed the phase 1 trials, a Harmonium member came back from LD in potimeb while we were still in the trials. I'm not sure how, it's not supposed to work like that, but it's possible he bugged us, even beyond the 5.5 day reset thing. *Shrug* let's just hope we don't get the problem again.</div></div><hr />
