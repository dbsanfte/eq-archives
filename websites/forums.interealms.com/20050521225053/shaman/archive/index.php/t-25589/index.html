<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im posting this question on a few boards to get a different perspective from different classes as i understand there may be a bit of bias coming from the class boards hehe. I just got done trying out WoW and eq2 and i came crawling back to eq1. I have wanted to two box for a long long time now and i guess i have just been lazy and never started to. Due to a bit less people playing the game right now i figure now is a good time to start. i have one blank account. on my other account is my 65 druid 62 shaman and 65 beastlord. i enjoy playing all of these character equally as much. and i am trying to decide what duo i want to invest more time into. I want a duo that is good at farming AAexp and reg exp. A duo that is good at farming plat(trash loot,named drops, ect.) I dont realy enjoy playing casters(Int based ones that is) and i like the melee/healer role alot. So i am looking for input from people who possibly duo some of the duos i am going to list below on some of there cons and pros. <br />
<br />
Beastlord/cleric<br />
shaman/SK<br />
shaman/monk<br />
Shaman/beserker<br />
druid/? (cant realy think of any melees who pair well with a druid other than bst heh)<br />
<br />
I understand i should play the duo funnest to me but i am just trying to get a lil info on these duos. Also i would like to note that you should keep in mind these characters will be of bazaar/possibly Ele lvl of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Its been awhile since i noticed duo question threads on this board so might as well throw this out for old time sakes.... does a paladin or shadowknight make a better partner for a shaman?.... =) also for the people who like to post pointless messages like search please and whatnot, please just ignore this post and maybe it will sink down the list for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman/SK or Shaman/nec<br />
<br />
do a search for &quot;partner&quot; and you'll find 1248912784912 threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">awhile ago i wanted to create an alt that did things i (shaman) could not do. the 2 things i always wanted to do is snare and FD. the SK does both.<br />
<br />
just this past week i got a new account and got her (female DE SK) moved there so i could 2-box her. mostly for before/after raids and a new challenge.<br />
<br />
the power of a shaman/sk combo is amazing and a lot of fun. they compliment eachother so well. on top of splitting and snaring the SK can give you 200 mana about once a minute. plus buff taps for 6 minutes!<br />
<br />
so anyways, shaman/SK all teh way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman/sk is about one of the best combinations possible. I powerleveled my sk from 49-65 with my shaman in about a week, and it was very easy. You can do many things with them, and it's somewhat simple to play them both. The aggro from the sk is great, and the shaman HoT really helps a lot with duoing. You can just lay a HoT on the sk, get aggro with the sk, then dot with the shaman. It really is a great combo.</div></div><hr />

I have just started 3boxing and have a Mage and BL on the other account.  I started the other box for a tank since I can see as I get into OOW that the mage pet/BL/BLpet just aren't going to cut it for some stuff.  So I was thinking I would get a tank and use the second for DPS.  I made a Paladin and have just started to lvel it.  Was thinking the stuns/heals/rez would be welcome.  However, the more I hear the mroe I think SK would be awesome too.  Just wondering what you guys think about a paladin instead of a SK.  DPS isn't an issue since I have another account to provide that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The biggest reason people go with SK's is not for DPS but for getting singles with FD and snare. You are running into what I am when it comes to OOW. Beastlords are not that effective at tanking partialy slowed mobs because thier AC is way low.<br />
<br />
I will say that 66+ mage pets are just wrong in what they can do. I have a 70 mage guildy that has all his pet aa's and he can duo BOT named with his chanter. I don't know what you plan on trying to tank but having a mage pet for a tank with the right aa can let you hold some decent camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as a 2 boxer, the biggest things I miss on my shaman/monk combo is snare and aggro control. It's keeping me from so many place, and takes more figiting on both comps.  I can't DoT much with shaman, and I can't sit too soon, I have to worry about trains if it runs too fast...<br />
<br />
SK + shaman would rock as long as SK can maintain enough mana in lower levels.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm currently lvling a Paladin for use to due with my shaman. Paladins are a nice in that they can stun, pacify, rez, and heal plus tank nicely. I have an SK on my Shamans account as well and love playing him too but hey, if I can get a rez at any time, it's all about having a paly for those situations. Provided they have the right pacify splitting a camp is no problem until you get into really high lvl camps. Either one really have their benefits. I would suggest you doing what you enjoy most and weigh the options of the tanks' benefits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My 2nd box SK is currently level 57.  Would you mind giving a few pointers on how you did your powerleveling from the mid-fifties to 65?<br />
<br />
I usually just group the SK and SHM together and do mass slaughter in some easy zone like PoJustice basement because I can get the kills done faster using SHM pet + dots and not having to worry about KSing the SK.  But I suspect you're doing something much more efficient to get to 65 so fast.  Some tips on zone/technique would be excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went into PoI, and I pulled the big clockwork golems. Sk can pull them very easily, and they only hit for like 400. I didn't have them grouped together, though. I would use my shaman to dot so it would die a lot faster. You just have to be careful to not ks. It gets somewhat boring, but after 60, it gets a little easier. I pulled them into the little hallway by the time flag guys (I can't remember their names, but they port you to the time entrance), and that way my shaman was out of harms way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i started 2-boxing my SK at 56. hunted in the same area as mentioned above, only i stayed grouped and i did the tanking. SK was just there to look good and swing her sword. she didn't even pull until later lvls. i would just root one, kill the other and if the 2nd came, kill it also.<br />
<br />
it was 59 or 60 when i moved to an HoH basement and lived there until she dinged 65. when i moved there she did all the pulling. at 60 SKs get a very nice FD that actually works most of the time. she still doesn't tank yet but i let her get hit enough to keep her skills up there.<br />
<br />
from 56 to 65 took about a week, give or take and i stayed grouped. don't have to worry about KSing then. just dish out the DPS!</div></div><hr />
