<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I want to say this isn't a question about how to make money, just something I noticed.<br />
I am now 56.. it took me almost 6 months to reach 54 didn't play much and before pop blah blah blah. Now I find myself leveling alot faster and in a sense growing too big for my britches. Spells are getting more and more expensive, I feel my gear is sufficent for now, but of course I would like to rech 2k unbuffed hp and 950ac.<br />
Soloing seems to be my main source of incom.e making 300-1k in the morning if I get to play(morning is pretty much only time I can play unless my gf is not home :D ) <br />
Now at this rate saving for malo/torpor or any upper spell will be near impossible for a non twink.<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />
And yes I know best way to get them is probably get a group and hunt in those areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why yes, yes I am. Soon I'll have to buy size 36 pants...<br />
<br />
But seriously, unless you're in a decent guild it's often hard to upgrade your spells and gear to keep up with leveling now that it's much easier/faster to get to 65 than it once was.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep.  Biggest problem I have with the 65 at any cost crowd.  IMO, a 65 in level 50 gear that got groups because of slow is a liability, not an asset to a raiding team.<br />
<br />
You need to take the time to farm the cash (or raid) to keep gear/spell books up to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I completely disagree with Kizent.  Go straight for 65 and it will be very easy to equip yourself decently.  Lower than that, and the money is harder to come by.  At 65, though, it's a joke how easy it is to make money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Play any melee class, then any casting class.  It's a joke how fast/quickly teh casting class will be able to farm money compared to the melee class.<br />
<br />
At lvl56, you should be able to pull in at least 800pp an hour, if not you're hunting in the wrong areas.<br />
<br />
My lvl63 rogue, VERY well equiped, has a had time farming pp as fast as my lvl54 shaman.  And my lvl54 shaman camps areas that my rogue wouldn't dream of attempting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the helpful hint!<br />
<br />
Next time Fennin drops his drawers (chain pants) I will tell the officers that I need them because sitting on my lizard has caused my ass to expand, causing rips and tears in my current set of pants.<br />
<br />
I'm certain this clever ploy will work!</div></div><hr />

I disagree as well.  I am still wearing mostly gear from my 50's and have never had a problem soloing, raiding, or grouping.  I sold off some of my better pieces a while back to buy torpor and then got lucky with malo.<br />
<br />
When you are 65 and in BoT / HoH / Tactics, getting spells and money is really easy.  Farming *just* cash at 65 is really realllly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye... was in an insane BoT storm rider group...<br />
<br />
They were dropping diamonds of all sorts like candy and since I told them I was saving for Q they let me have 'em...<br />
<br />
Got 3k + 3 yellows and a blue of lvl 64 ;).<br />
<br />
Ubahness, here I come!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great example Okotona.<br />
<br />
The thread starter sounds like he is in a similar situation that I was in.  I spent a lot of time in my 50's and at 60 soloing and relied very heavily on good gear to level fast.  High AC, Fungi, Epic, JBB (later horse), and torpor.  Shaman could get way faster xp soloing pre PoP than grouping with the right toys.<br />
<br />
I did raid, but not heavily, so I had to get my own stuff.<br />
<br />
Basically because I soloed mostly I was always concerned about my gear since it was a huge factor in how fast I could xp.<br />
<br />
When PoP came out, I began grouping a lot more and haven't even bothered to upgrade my gear really.  I have a few new spells which is nice, but in PoP your playstyle, class knowledge, and AA's go a LOT further than any gear can get you.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that when you shout &quot;65 shammy lfg&quot; you aren't there for an interview.  I haven't ever recieved something like, &quot;got a spot for ya if you have 2500 unbuffed hp and 1200ac&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that while it is true that casters make money easier than melees, this is how it should be. Warriors dont have to fork out for spells. Casters do. I dont have Malo, Torpor, Pox or Avatar...why not, because i cannot afford them.<br />
<br />
It is a juggling act trying to <br />
a) Level up<br />
b) Get spells<br />
c) Keep upgrading armor<br />
d) Keep AA ticking over<br />
It is, IMO, important not to get to focused on any one aspect of the 4 listed above, but to set goals in each, and to spread ones effort over all 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IMHO equipping and getting spells is way harder than merely leveling to 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The process of equiping yourself with really high end gear is much slower than at lower levels.  At lower levels, the speed at which you can get new gear is just basicly limited by how much PP you can make.  And considering the way mudflation works, you can get some really amazing gear now for incredibly cheap that used to go for a fortune.<br />
<br />
Once you can no longer buy any gear upgrades with PP, that's when your equipment upgrade process really begins to slow down.  You have to start raiding to get equipment upgrades.  Raiding to acquire items isn't a fast process to get outfitted with new gear.  If you are in a guild of say 60 people, and you kill whatever targets that drop 3 pieces of gear each kill, you have to kill 20 targets on average before you can expect to win a piece of gear.  Factor in things like competition with other guilds and spawn times of targets.  If you manage to kill 4 raid targets every week, you are looking at 5 full weeks of raiding things before you can expect to win a single piece of new equipment.  If you don't raid that much, it'll be longer.  If you raid a LOT as a guild, you might be able to see some new gear more often.  But in the end, raiding to get new gear isn't fast at all for upgrading equipment.</div></div><hr />
