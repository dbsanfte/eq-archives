<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've made 2 trips up there since the patch and thought I'd offer what little knowledge I have and ask if others could post what they've learned.<br />
<br />
The zone seems to be more of a typical zone that the existing PoG,Fear, etc.  Meaning, your not gonna clear the zone of mobs.  The common ones respawn on a 15-20minute timer.  I'm guessing the named are on some kind of cycle, but the common yard trash respawns.<br />
<br />
You can take 2 approaches here - Bring a group or 2 up and camp the zone in or take that group or 2-raid and crawl around.  You won't have a monk pulling things back to the ZI.<br />
<br />
Most raids have invis'd before going up but I'm leaning towards it not being necessary anymore.<br />
<br />
Zone is fairly safe - You zone into a little alcove with a well.  Stay behind the well.  The walls in that area seem to be safe - we haven't gotten adds through the walls.  <br />
<br />
The zone now looks like your outdoors in a town, but lizards/horses don't work, nor does sow<br />
<br />
Drops are far more rare than in the past.  I'd say 80% of mobs drop pp only.<br />
<br />
Quite a few drops are lore only (ghast fingerbones, kuraiki flesh, abhorrent powder ).  no stats, probably all quest stuff<br />
<br />
We've only crossed the bridge on the right and headed west.  We haven't explored to deep.  Haven't found too much in that direction.<br />
<br />
Wondering if anyone has gone off in a different direction and found any of the new golems or higher level clerics (we've found clerics of hate but there are supposedly some templars and high priests?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis isnt really necessary as many mobs see through it anyway.<br />
<br />
Gone are massive 10 plus mob trains.  pretty easy to have nice steady 2-3 mob pulls.  Easy to split for an FD'r.<br />
<br />
Drops may be slightly rarer, but having mobs quickly respawn more than makes up for this.  Previously we could  clear Hate in under 3 hrs, now that is impossible as mobs will respawn.  Worst thing is that drops are practicly useless as they have not been upgraded.  Anyone level 46 can buy better stuff in the bazaar for a few hundred plat.  the loot should have been seriously upgraded and level 2 or even 3 focus effects added .<br />
<br />
this is really an xp zone now IMHO, around PoI, PoN difficulty, maybe less.  They should have put a book in PoK for it.</div></div><hr />
