<br />
*** Game Updates ***<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- Warrior and Magician epic changes – A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations.  Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned.  Players wishing to change these items into &quot;permanent&quot; versions in order to augment them should do the following:<br />
<br />
Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport.  He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics.  You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you.<br />
<br />
Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest.  She will take a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable orb.  The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no changes to the spell or use.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and Quests **<br />
<br />
- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for this zone on Stormhammer only.  All of the NPCs there are meant to be aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not aggressive.  They are now.<br />
<br />
- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible but were bugged to be non-aggressive.  They will again be aggressive, so be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep.<br />
<br />
- Plane of Valor - The Aerin'Dar projection was despawning after only a few minutes.  It will now remain as long as other projections.<br />
<br />
- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again.<br />
<br />
- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop.  This should allow the completion of the Rallican’s Bracer quest<br />
<br />
- The Ghost of Kindle has returned.<br />
<br />
- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole.<br />
<br />
- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be working properly now.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron Bracelet spells. <br />
<br />
- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and transformation spells.<br />
<br />
- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow for future upgrades and items.  All existing foci should work as they always have.  If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, please /bug report the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface **<br />
<br />
- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that have help information available.  Just click on the question mark in the upper right of the window to see the tips.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee range than they should have in some cases.<br />
<br />
- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create characters on opposing alliances.  That is no longer possible.  If you see this message: <br />
<br />
&quot;You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You can only have characters that are on the same alliance.  Please correct this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an opposing alliance with the first character you created.&quot; <br />
<br />
You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are not on the same alliance.<br />

** Known Issues **<br />
*<br />
This is the list of cosmetic issues that we're aware aren't perfect, but determined as acceptable to launch with, as*none should affect peoples' ability to enjoy the game.* <br />
*<br />
Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons' launch.<br />
*<br />
- Paladins and Shadowknights:* The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands timers when you use those abilities.* You may still use INSPECT and OPEN, however.* It just won't look like you can.<br />
*<br />
- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers' Camps, for now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should.* <br />
*<br />
- Pet Users:* If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object (chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack.* This is a problem with the message, not the behavior. *The pet should be telling you that it cannot attack such a thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Use Augmentations Wisely **<br />
<br />
If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last.<br />
<br />
For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item.  In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2.  If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case.  This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available. <br />
<br />
So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope its just me that doesnt understand it but that last part about applying augmentations in a specific order sounds very problematic.<br />
<br />
So what are you supposed to do if you are &quot;unlucky&quot; enough to get a slot 1 augmentation first? Wait until you get a slot 2 one so you can put that in first and then you can finally use the first one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grunx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No it's not just you. It will cause problems and seems a stupid way of doing it.<br />
<br />
I would not think is that hard for it to check if there was a Type 1 slot available for use for a Type 1 Augmentation before it sticks it in another type slot on you.<br />
<br />
Very lazy, and more than a tad stupid on SoE's behalf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Correct me if i am wrong, but the problem they describe only occurs, when you get some augmentation, that can fit in any possible slot and another augmentation, that would fit in only one specific slot number (say slot 2).<br />
<br />
When you put the 'all slots possible' augmentation first on slot 2, you kinda block that slot for an augmentation with limited slot selection for slot2. The other way around - 'specific slot' first - you could apply both augmentations to the same item, assuming you have enough slots available on it of course.<br />
<br />
But my head hurt too, as i read that paragraph first time  ;) <br />
<br />
Sidenote: No mentioning of shaman epic NPCs?? So CoM hand-ins working as intended ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think what they are saying is if it has 3 types of slots<br />
<br />
Type 1: 1 stat upgrade<br />
Type 2: Multiple stat upgrades<br />
Type 3: Worn Effects<br />
<br />
and you get a Augumentation Slot: Any Type, you have to fill the others up first, but if you got an Augmentation Slot: Type 1, you could use it as normal because it can not fit in the other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmm no mention of fixing Neh and Rak.</div></div><hr />

New skeleton models for the second time in EQ history....but we're still using the lipbear!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The trouble with changing graphics for player used forms is Sony is damned if they do and damned if they don’t.  I would love my brown bear form to use the same graphic as the bears in Plane of Storms.  But I can guarantee there are people who would hate it.  Just as I would love to have a sit graphic in bear form, which is the reason I almost never use bear form, but I know there are others what would hate it.  So I find it interesting that Sony is changing the skelly forms for necromancers.  I wonder how popular that will be.</div></div><hr />

Why don't the just make the Manastone not useable anymore and be done with it? :p<br />
<br />
/prays for lots of LATE fix-it patche$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok I read the paragraph about Augmenting and I got confused.<br />
I read the replys about Augmenting and now im really confused  :confused: .<br />
Does this mean if I get a augmentation item that goes in any slot i cant put it in slot 2 even if i wanted to as it would automatically go to slot 1 as its still empty ?<br />
Or do all the slots do the same thing just that the items are for specific slots ?<br />
Sorry if this makes no sense but ive had a hard day at work and now im really confused :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As I read it, a slot 1 item can go into a slot 2 (and maybe slot 3), spot *IF* the item has multiple empty slots.<br />
<br />
Whichever augment you apply first will go into the highest available slot...<br />
<br />
so, if you have slot 1, slot 3 open (and slot 3 could hold a nice FT2 item), but the first thing you put in is a +6 CHA slot 1 item ... that +CHA will go into your other slot (2 or 3), meaning you can NO LONGER put that FT item into the slot... and only have room for another slot 1 item.<br />
<br />
That would seem a poor implementation IMO ... slots should line up by slot - which seems more logical to me, than as a stacked queue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is how I interpreted that:<br />
<br />
1. You have an item with Slot 1 and Slot 2 available for augmentations.<br />
<br />
2. You have two Augment items. One which only goes in Slot 1, and one that goes in any slot.<br />
<br />
3. If you use the Augment item for any slot first, it will go into Slot 1. This makes the Augment for Slot 1 unuseable for the item in #1.<br />
<br />
4. You would have to use the Augment that goes only into Slot 1 first, then use the Augment for any slot to fill Slot 2 in order to have both of them on the item from #1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Slot 1 items -------&gt; Slot 1 holes<br />
Slot 2 items -------&gt; Slot 2 holes<br />
Slot 3 items -------&gt; Slot 3 holes<br />
<br />
Slot ANY items -------&gt; Slot 1 if empty, if not --&gt; Slot 2 if empty, if not --&gt; Slot 3<br />
<br />
What they are saying, is if you have a slot 1 item, and a slot &quot;any&quot; item, make sure you apply the slot 1 item first, or the slot &quot;any&quot; item will take it's place on the item and you won't have an available slot 1 hole left for the slot 1 item.<br />
<br />
That help?<br />
<br />
And someone asked the question about what if they get a slot &quot;any&quot; item before they have a slot 1 item, do they have to wait to use the slot &quot;any&quot; item so they won't lose the slot 1 hole in case they get a slot 1 item? What you could do, is buy the cheepest slot 1 item you can find, apply it, then apply the slot &quot;any&quot; item (which would then go to the slot 2 hole), and then desolve the slot 1 item or leave it in. Use the cheepo slot 1 item as a place holder in case you get a better one down the road so you can go ahead and use your slot &quot;any&quot; item right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>AbsorEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Slot 1 items -------&gt; Slot 1 holes<br />

<br />

<br />

Two questions:<br />
1) Once something has been modded...can it then be traded?  All of the screenshots that I've seen of pieces were NO DROP ( or was this just cuz of beta? )<br />
<br />
2) Once something has been modded.... can it be reverted back!?  I imagine that you might want to be able to take out that +2 AGI and put in the new FT3 that you got on your last crawl.  If we can't do this ourselves ... how about taking to a &quot;vendor&quot; who will do this for some sort of fee.<br />

<br />
From what I understand:<br />
<br />
1) If the item and augment(s) are droppable, the item is tradeable. If either the original item or any augments added are no-drop, the item becomes no drop.<br />
<br />
2) augments can be removed but are destroyed upon removal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Which slot is the any slot? :P<br />

Any Slot means the Augment can go in Slot 1, Slot 2, or Slot 3</div></div><hr />
