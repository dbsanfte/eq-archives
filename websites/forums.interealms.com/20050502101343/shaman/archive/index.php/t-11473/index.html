<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which would be better in the long run, Conjuration or Alteration, and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">alteration because... all of our Conjuration spells are useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dots for soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you really only solo until about 51. Up until 51, with the DoT's you get, KEI more than makes up for the Mana saving aspects of Conjuration Specialization. Once you get to 52, you'll be able to join first tier PoP groups, and the exp will come in just as fast as it did soloing and your sole job will be to buff, reduce resistances, and slow... and guess what school of magic all of those come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Evocation, omg! thanks~keke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alteration. Buffs, heals, debuffs.. all of them are alteration type spells. Conjuration is only good for dots. Even soloing, you'll cast a lot more alteration-based spells than you will conjuration-based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">k, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">everythign in your arsenal is based on alteration . You have a few evo and abj and conj and such , but the bulk of what you will cast is alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just adding that I would also strongly suggest Alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">do certain spells help to increase your conjuration faster, such as the more mana it costs, the more &quot;training&quot; you receive in the skill? also, does the type influence the chances of increasing your skill, i.e. a buff vs a debuff. Basically, im looking to increase skill by chain casting, and want to know the most mana efficient way to do this so medding downtime is as little as possible. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I took specialization with my druid, I just put a point in all the specializations and then picked the cheapest and easiest spell of the specialization I wanted to specialize in and cast it over and over until my specialization was 51.  As best I remember, it wasn’t that hard.  I really don’t think it matters what spell you use.  If you can find one that uses 5 or 10 manna then go for it.  It’s just like practicing your spell skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">sorry for the double post..not sure how that happened. anway, thanks for the help, one more question. i notice it mentioned onkly specializing in one, why not all of them? im new here so i dont know why to only choose one when it seems beneficial to be using all of them. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You should put a point into all specs, but be sure to get your alteration to 51 first.  As mentioned before conjuration has limited usage and nothing else is even worth mentioning... Unless you just have a really strong desire to be the onlly Divination master specialist in the game :) .  Alteration is definitely the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Specialize in Divination now...  True North owns!<br />
<br />
Seriously though, go Alteration</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">if your going with alteration(i belive you should. do what you want) can use Cannibalize and minor healing  buy your self a kei  for the int/wis buff and dought ya could out cast your mana regen<br />
<br />
lvl of the spell or mana cost has nothing to do with how fast a skill will raise  only  that matters is casting  a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">eq_newb: Of the 5 spell casting types, Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, you can train in specialize in all of them (for int casters at level 20, priests at level 30), but only one of these can go beyond 50. The first skill that hits 51 in specialize becomes your specialization and can go up to 200, from then on all the others are capped at 50.<br />
<br />
Note, this is for Specialize Alteration, Specialize Abjuration, etc - not for the basic Alteration, Abjuration, all of which can can max out at 235.<br />
<br />
As for making sure you hit 51 in the right specialty, most shamans will max out Specialize Alteration way before any other. I suggest keeping an eye on it, but do your normal stuff - but you shouldn't need to do anything special to make sure that maxes out first, especially if you cannibalize a fair bit. Hell, I hit 200 in Specialize Alteration before Specialize Evocation even got to 50. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, if you want to chose a different specialty, or if you're doing say, nothing but dotting, you may find it helps to do the level 1 spell again and again thing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just an additional note I didn't see anyone mention:<br />
<br />
You must put one point in each specialization before any of them will pass 50. I was going crazy with my cleric wondering why his spec alt wouldn't pass 50 until I saw I didn't have any points in div.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Alteration is the ONLY way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree with the crowd here, Alteration is by far the best.  At high levels Turgur's and heal spells are all you really NEED, with Focus/Hos and other buffs a close second - and ALL of them are Alteration.<br />
<br />
My approach was to train all of them at once (because at the time it was a PITA to get all the way from Kunark to Halas to train) but cast Minor Healing about 50 times give Alteration Specialization about 15 skill points as a &quot;lead&quot; over the others.  Then I just watched the skillups carefully to make sure Alteration won.  Turns out I didn't need to do the extra casts, Alteration hit 51 while the next closest was still in the low 20's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And again ... with Stocism easily available, we now have a way of generating mana from air (stoic costs 180m to cast and generates about 320m cannied down). With Alteration spec Soicism will cost much less (on average) and therefore your mana regen will be even better ... it will more than make up for any mana savings you see while DOTing (even while soloing).<br />
<br />
Ateration spec. No longer disputable.</div></div><hr />
