<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vapn Maistre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone provide some information as to what it takes to do the Hole encounter for the shaman epic?<br />
<br />
Number of Groups suggested<br />
Required classes and quantities (ie., 2 enchanters at least, 3 clerics, etc...)<br />
Levels of classes<br />
And any other info you might have.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine on Povar is trying to get a raid going, and knows we need a reasonable raid force to do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One high level group including cleric, 58-60 can do it.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Two groups, including cleric each or at least someone who can IVU in second group, 50-60, higher the better for clerics and tanks.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
A few more than that.<br />
<br />
Enchanter? depends on your groups styles, if they're used to add tanking you don't *need* a chanter for the hole but they're always nice to have along I suppose.<br />
<br />
In my experience it is easier to take less rather than more as taking more people than you need into a cramped dungeon just causes confusion and problems.<br />
<br />
If you take more than two groups in then don't try and take more than two groups up Kirns tower, it just turns into comedy. Leave the rest of the raid at the base of the tower, if its an underpowered group left behind they can go sit to the right of the tower (when facing it) on a ledge there (don't fall off the drop) as nothing paths there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure if this is appropriate to your circumstances, but here's a repost of my guide &quot;How to kill Kirn if you are not very uber&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Hope this is useful to someone out there:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here's how I killed High Scale Kirn, I hope this will be useful to<br />
someone else, as The Hole really seems to be a sticking point for a lot<br />
of shamans trying to get their epic.<br />
<br />
There are several things you need to carry out this plan, but you don't<br />
need to be in an uber guild, you just need a few friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Preparation<br />
<br />
Make a halfling rogue, and scrounge a teleport to Toxx. Bind in Paineel,<br />
or ideally, at the entrance to The Hole. Learn how Hide and Sneak work,<br />
and then go exploring! Never drop Hide/Sneak unless you want to die -<br />
and if you do, be careful not to train other people who may be in the<br />
zone.<br />
<br />
Find the undead tower where Kirn lives. Find the 'safe ledge' outside<br />
the tower. If you are facing the entrance to the tower, the ledge is on<br />
your right. No mobs will agro you if you are on this ledge.<br />
<br />
Basically, spend a few hours learning the zone, especially the tower<br />
area. See where Kirn spawns - and while you are there, if his pet is up<br />
but he isn't, petition a GM to fix it. Preparation is the key, you can't<br />
just run into a zone like the Hole unprepared.<br />
<br />
Make a load of Invis to Undead potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your party<br />
<br />
Most importantly, you need a mage, with the Call of the Hero spell, who<br />
doesn't mind giving up two evenings of their time for you. I found a<br />
mage via my server message boards, and offered help hunting wurms in<br />
Burning Woods in exchange for their help in The Hole.<br />
<br />
You will need a few tanks, and definately a cleric. You can probably<br />
persuade a couple of enchanters to come along, as they can get their<br />
epic drop from the Ghost of Kindle, who lives right next to Kirn.<br />
<br />
You can probably persuade another shaman or two to come along, as they<br />
will want to see how it's done, for when they need Kirn themselves.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you should try and get a porter so you can evac to safety when<br />
you are done.<br />
<br />
For the record, my party had: 3 shamans, 1 warrior, 1 pally, 1 cleric, 1<br />
mage, 1 enchanter, 1 ranger. All were between level 51 and 54 (except<br />
the mage who I think was 57).<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting in<br />
<br />
There are two ways you can accomplish this:<br />
<br />
1- find a guild who are planning a raid on the Hole to kill Kirn. Ask<br />
nicely if you and your mage may join their raid. Assuming they say yes,<br />
get your mage to the safe ledge, and either bind or camp them there.<br />
<br />
2- find a dwarven Cleric of Brell, who has never hunted in The Hole, and<br />
is high enough level to Revive. I personally didn't use this method but<br />
I know someone who did, so my details may not be totally accurate. Go to<br />
Paineel, and have a high level cleric cast Divine Aura on the dwarf.<br />
Drop the dwarf into the Hole. They will land in front of Master Yael,<br />
but won't be KOS to any of the mobs there.<br />
<br />
The dwarf should then use Invis vs Undead, and make their way to the<br />
safe ledge.<br />
<br />
Next, take the mage to the normal entrace to the Hole, and kill them (in<br />
a duel). Use your rogue to drag the corpse to the safe ledge, and the<br />
dwarf cleric then revives them. BEWARE - corpses from duels are only<br />
rezzable for about 10 minutes! So be fast!<br />
<br />
The dwarf can now gate to safety, with a large chunk of your platinum in<br />
their pocket :)<br />
<br />
Either way - you now have a mage at the safe ledge.<br />
<br />
If you are coming back the next day (or next spawn) to get Kirn, camp<br />
at the safe ledge. If not, just proceed to the next step!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Raid<br />
<br />
Assemble the raid force in The Hole, at the zone. Log on the rogue, and<br />
have them invite the mage into a group. Then (assuming the rogue is<br />
bound at the zoneline) plummet to your death!<br />
<br />
The rogue is now back at the zone, and invites each person in turn, they<br />
get COTH'd to the safe ledge, and then disband. The last person to get<br />
COTH should be the rogue himself. Leave the rogue at the ledge, you may<br />
need him for corpse recovery if anything goes wrong!<br />
<br />
Form groups, buff up, and hand out ITU potions to anyone who can't cast<br />
the spell. Everyone ITU, and lead them into the tower. Go as fast as you<br />
can - anyone who loses ITU should simply stay in one spot and die. As<br />
long as the cleric and some tanks get to the top, you should be ok.<br />
<br />
When I did this, we actually fought a battle on the stairs leading up<br />
the tower. This was EXTREMELY nerve wracking! :)  But we only had 2 mobs<br />
to kill, we finished them, recast ITU and made it to the top.<br />
<br />
When you get to the top, turn left and assemble in the room where the<br />
Ghost of Kindle lives. Only ONE mob in this room will agro you on sight.<br />
Stay away from the door to avoid agro from mobs outside. No one except<br />
the puller should leave this room.<br />
<br />
Drop ITU and kill whatever agros. As long as half your people survived<br />
the run up the stairs (and no one trained you) you shouldn't have a<br />
problem here. After killing this mob, use the rogue to drag dead people<br />
up to the top for a rez. Buff up anyone who needs it.<br />
<br />
When everyone is ready, kill the rest of the mobs in the room. Gratz<br />
Chanter_00 on their epic drop from Kindle. Then pull any KOS mobs from<br />
the hallway, and adjacent rooms (carefully!) and kill them. Kindle<br />
respawns in 20 minutes, so you may have to kill it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kirn!<br />
<br />
When the revenants are cleared, you are ready to pull Kirn. Make sure<br />
you are not in bear form, there are reports that this messes up your<br />
faction. Get a symbol buff for those extra few HP. Everyone except the<br />
pulling shaman should wait in Kindle's room, away from the door. The<br />
shaman should hand in the icon to Kirn, and leg it back to the party.<br />
<br />
You will probably take Kirn's Harm Touch on the way back. As soon as you<br />
get back, the MT will taunt Kirn off you, and just kill him as you would<br />
any other mob. He was white to me at level 53, and I had no problem<br />
landing Malosi and Tugur's (after Tash).<br />
<br />
I think you should have all your tanks in one group with the cleric,<br />
and the second group shouldn't attack Kirn until he is down to 50-60%.<br />
What you don't want is him ping-ponging all over the room and possibly<br />
attracting agro from outside.<br />
<br />
And that's it! Kill the scaly, loot his ring, and leave! If you haven't<br />
got a porter, you can hold the room until you can convince one to come<br />
get you! Use the rogue to invite them for a COTH from the zoneline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some of you who despair of ever getting your epics,<br />
due to the Hole stage. I used to think the same way :)  But with a<br />
totally non-uber party, made up of friends, guildmates, and just people<br />
I asked nicely, we did this raid, and took down Kirn with no deaths to<br />
our party! Which I am pretty pleased about, I hope you have as much<br />
success as I did!</div></div><hr />
