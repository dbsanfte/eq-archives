Definitely sounds like someone ESL who is probably playing more than just two machines.  Would be interesting to coordinate 3-4 people (all on different servers) talking to their server's Seb necro/jail duo at the same time.  It doesn't look like a BoT to me though on E. Marr at least.<br />
<br />

I feel sorry for those people that their lives are so empty that they would want to do that.  But i also lack understanding why you keep posting on this subject or why you think anyone else cares who or why or how long someone is farming plat on server x in Sebilis.  Take it up with Sony if you want to stop the plat selling, item selling, char selling.  Maybe they will grow some backbone and try to take cancers like Yantis down.  The best solution is not to buy plat for these sites, dont by characters, items etc.  If there wasnt money to be made from this then people like Yantis would not exist.  I cant fathom why a normal person (who isnt filthy rich) would even consider spending real money for pixels in a game.  I have seen the auction sites and the prices being charged and It just boggles the mind how much they sell this stuff for.</div></div><hr />

You spend real money for pixels in a game every time your credit card is billed by SOE, every time you buy an expansion, etc.  Some people are just willing to take farther, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'm interested in finding out why there are cleric/enchanters duos on lots of servers (all?) camping Pyramid then Iksar Jails. I'm glad Gardeltron has been looking into this and sharing his findings with us. Why am I interested? I don't know. That these duos are there on a lot of servers is very odd, and maybe I just like a good mystery.<br />
<br />
I play EQ a certain way - probably the way most people do. Lots of grouping and raiding with a bit of tradeskills and plat-farming mixed in. I levelled my characters up myself and have never bought plat or items on playerauctions. Now if someone is organizing all these duos on different servers to farm plat which then gets sold for RL cash, I find that interesting.<br />
<br />
Keep up the detective work, Gard.</div></div><hr />

You realize that you could ask them to share the spawn or actually pull any mob thats has not been pulled by them ... know the rules and use them ... if they are bots or hated for what they do .. just mess with them .. no one will care =)<br />

<br />
<br />
Yesterday it was Guk and FBSS, today its Seb next week its somewhere else. <br />
<br />
Skadi, have you ever wanted an item or to hunt somewhere and it's camped? You come back and its camped? What if every time you showed up you could'nt get access but you pay the same as everyone else? <br />
<br />
Then on top of it you find out that the someone camping what you want has found a way to make real money off of it and can deny you access while you were interested in doing the same thing for fun and relaxation. <br />
<br />
I think you understand what I am saying. I have no issue with racing to a spawn and losing. I have a big problem with someone running a business that interferes with my fun. Now if SOE said that it was ok to sell their property for cash and make a RL profit off their labors, that would be a different story.<br />
<br />
I also think that people that post on this subject liked the ability to hit Seb for a few hours, make a few K and be able to buy an item they want. Getting a great location nerfed due to farmers takes away from those of us who would use the area as I believe SOE intended. <br />
<br />
To all of you trying to expose this, keep it up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sarelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haven't seen this &quot;Duo&quot; on Tunare.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We have the same thing going on in OS on Torv. Cleric/ench duo camping same areas. They are running macro's and they have been there now almost 90 days (24hrs a day) I think..maybe less. I would assume farming plat for RL cash sold on PA. <br />
<br />
GM has been talked to on several occasions about the 2 on Torv. GM/Guide basically says macro's are impossible, but yes, they are against the EQ rules LOL...go figure and no, nothing has been done about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, the enchanter had a sebilite golem as its pet, I'm sure it was DC.  He would sic the pet on a mob and the cleric would heal.  I didn't see either of them nuking.  I sat and watched them on a couple of mobs before I wandered off.<br />
<br />
Today I logged on a different character and chatted a bit with Avry.  Here's the log.  I was using a chat window so unfortunately, it didn't record who was speaking, although I think its pretty easy to tell who said what.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and I was doing detective work here, so I really wasn't in the same guild as Avry, but the guy I was talking to didn't know that.  Detectives do that kind of stuff all the time.  My character's name is Limkin.  Again, I've editted out everything but the actual conversation, which is all there.<br />

Is it someone farming  PP for  cash, more then likely. Thing is &quot;what&quot; can you do about it? &quot;What&quot; do you hope to achive? It seems to me bro that your being pretty obsessive over it. And that cant be makeing your play time any more enjoyable. We had a guy on Vesheen that use to do this with his 'girlfrind&quot; who was saposably the enc. Biggest gimp you ever saw when he tried to group. If a mob hit him twice he would gate and leave the group to die. Was a clr named Corpsman from there he went to selling Virtue KEI till that market ran dry. If others had the necro camp he would fear the mobs to get them killed then take the camp and things like that. Pretty much an ass. Well anyway my point here is /ignor forget the person is there or exsists and your EQ life will problly get much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

I am on Bertox server, and yes there is a chanter/cleric duo camping the bugs and pyra camps... for about a year now.  Actually I remember when this person started doing it and they were quite friendly.  If you needed a rez or a kei you knew someone you could count on.<br />
<br />
At the time it was kind of a give and take.  Us players understood what was going on, and although it was annoying that part of the zone was now permanently off limits to players the people doing the camp were making an effort to be considerate to others.<br />
<br />
However that has changed over time.  That chanter/cleric duo has added a necro that sits in the jail, and between the 4 of them they clear the jail, pyra, the bugs and all the way to the golem and bugs in front of the disco camp. The people operating this have also gone anonymous and are no longer assisting others in the zone for any reason.<br />
<br />
Engage a target in one of those camps and the chanter will charm it.  Do too much damage while passing thru &quot;their&quot; camps and the necro will FD pull on top of you.  This is what EQ described a long time ago as a zone disruption.. ie &quot;any player that monopolizes all the kills in a area&quot;.<br />
<br />
I recently got ahold of a guide to speak of this topic.  Strangely I had petitioned several times and each time I went to check my petition status somehow my petition had been deleted.  It made me wonder if the guides were trying to cover this issue up.<br />
<br />
So I made up another reason to petition, and while I had their ear I launched my concern about this OS camping.  &quot;There are no recognized camps in Everquest&quot; I was told.  &quot;If you engage a target and someone else attempts to kill that target it is an offence.  Log the event, making sure that you have the 'Others Hits' filter turned on.  Once you have proof we can do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
I actually rarely go back to Sebilis now.  Once or twice I have soloed the Broog and Disco camps, as we call them on this server.  I just decided that tangling with this Plat farmer wasn't why I come to EQ... I come to be entertained, not to start a war.<br />
<br />
Still... it just doesn't seem fair that someone can do this.  It lessens the game for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Im sorry if im comming into this really late, but i must ask.   Do you mean to tell me, you can make or program a bot to not only respond verbal to voice commands and questions, but it can sit there for days, weeks, months, and even years without fail, for the sole purpose of making pp to be sold???<br />
(Correct me if im wrong, but i think the thread starter did ask for virtue and another buff.)<br />
<br />
I personally have 2 accounts, none of them are bought.  I started both, and got both up low and mid lvl 50's chars.   No lvl 60's yet, just a total of 5 low to mid lvl char.   I have been on EQ since the middle of kunark, but i have never heard of this,  im beyond shocked to hear this is possible. (guess i shouldn't be)  <br />
Again i know im a bit of a moron for jumping into this at such a late time with little or no knowledge on this matter.    I understand what the issue is reguarding keeping the camp so no one else can camp it, that would tick me off also..... I'd be screaming purple by now if the camp had a epic or other important item.  However i dont see the issue in reguards to selling pp for RL money, other then it being against sony rules.  (plz explain to me why people get pissed of about this)  I heard on CNN  reguarding this matter of items being sold from the game by RL money.  They said soo much selling is going on that EQ has the ability to be it own economy or stock market.   Yeah this is crazy,  tons of money pour thru and around EQ.  Why are soo many people against others who sell pp and others that buy it.. Not everyone in the game has the privilage of being the awsome lvl 65 with 200+ aa points, and all the lastest gear.  Some people are just out to do the best they can, with what little they have, and what they can get thier hands on.  Does it so much hurt that someone lvl 25 wants a nice lvl 40+ weapon? The GM's of EQ have nerfed the good pp areas, mainly rathe mountains. (for lower to mid lvls)  People since i have been online have been working there butts off for pp, and EQ cheats them by lowering the amout the giants drop......   They good ways to make pp for lower lvls main, is nearly gone.  I go to rathe mountains and peeps are fighting over giants almost,  they dont spawn fast enough, thier arent enough to go around, and they drop gold and silver sometimes now.  Not much for lower lvls to do anymore.  yeah try for the scales and the cloak of Vox and Naggy when possible.  Not much good chances when 40+ peeps come and only 2 to 3 people and get the good items.   <br />
I'm not for those who are doing braking the rules, that isn't my point.  EQ should make a way for all to make decent pp without feeling they have to nerf every freaking way for lower lvls to make pp in game.  <br />
<br />
Yes this guy seems to be way crazy for needing that camp every day, 24/7  ,   i say find him and boot him.  But gosh, plz make a good way to make pp for all without making us fight each other for ways to get good pp.    The items needed for mana regen like FT, and mana preserving items cost range from 5k to 90k+ ..    What area will give me that kind of pp for my lvl???<br />
<br />
(This message isnt made to put anyone down, nor is it made with the purpose to fuel ways to do Sony wrong.  This issue is double edged though, both sides have somthing to correct, unless there is something i dont know reguarding making good amounts of pp somewhere.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yes, it's possible. It's a well documented phenomenon, a guy whose name I can't recall wrote a script that perfectly played a toon, and it was able to solo a camp effectively. It even had programmed responses to all sorts of questions, looking for keywords in the /tells it received.<br />
<br />
He posted logs of conversations it had with other players, and they looked exactly like those above, except the english was better.<br />
<br />
Those scripts above look very automated to me. Same mistakes on multiple occasions, limited use of english to cover up the existence of a bot - what better way to avoid talking to others? Well, I suppose he could just say &quot;no speak english&quot; or something :)<br />
<br />
But yeah, I find this interesting. And to those who say &quot;why are you bothering?&quot; - /shrug, leave the guy alone, he just likes investigating, it's interesing! :)<br />
<br />
I think it's fascinating that people write scripts to play a game to make cash. Awesome, a triumph of human spirit, or greed, over the environment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Here is my best guess. <br />
<br />
This is definitely some sort of sophisticated macro system. I imagine a room FULL of computers, and 10-12 people &quot;working&quot; for this company or whatever it is. The macros are set up and running, and 3 or 4 people at a time monitor all the systems. They probably have some form of warning system, maybe its as simple as REALLY big chatfonts and any /say or /tell they recieve show up in some bright color so one of the &quot;employees&quot; can run over there and have a conversation once the macros auto-responses start kicking in. Another part of the employees jobs is to move from machine to machine, and play them manually for a short time every couple hours, to break up any obviously detectable macro pattern, and also manually port out, sell off the stacks of gems, etc etc. They chose this area because there REALLY isnt anything that great there. Lammys, masks, big deal. But there are gems. Tons of gems. Stacks and stacks of gems. They chose well, OS is mostly a ghost town on my server, except the occasional group heading in to camp something specific, and that something sure isnt a Lammy. The biggest complaint I can see is &quot;They are farming pp where I wanna farm pp&quot;.<br />
<br />
And they are probably making a fortune. Plat is cheap to buy on the net. A lot of people would rather spend their game time more productively than farming for pp. The money they pay for pp is insignificant to the time and aggrovation they avoid. It takes me a week to churn out 20+K pp, myself, so whats the big deal buying it for 50 bucks (or whatever, I have no idea of current rates). I have no problem with it whatsoever. However, the whole &quot;OS Pharm Company&quot; thing is just bad form. It HAS to be interrelated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think the biggest reason I feel something of an obsession regarding this, is because artificial intelligence and any pseudo-form thereof fascinates me beyond belief.

Furthermore, you think that you should post it here and take up space to share this story about a person farming for money.<br />
<br />
I'm going to agree and say you're getting pretty obsessive over this. I'm curious as to why you picked this subject to obsess over, because farming money is such a run-of-the-mill procedure for all classes of all levels its equivalent to whining about someone setting up a bazaar trader or someone doing tradeskilling at a forge all day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Penny, you're missing the point.  This isn't about a single person, boxing 2 characters on one server to get pp for their twinks (heck, I've done that before myself).  There's several things that are unique here:<br />
<br />
1.  This is a phenomenon that is occurring in the same way across many servers.  Same two ebayed characters: 65 cleric/65 enchanter.<br />
<br />
2.  There is the distinct possibility that these characters are partially or totally automated.  That is, an intelligent program may be running the EQ program.<br />
<br />
3.  The pp generated is apparently not going into twinks, but being sold on the market (e.g., ebay) outside EQ for real money.<br />
<br />
4.  Either the program, or the persons running the program, are not English speaking.<br />
<br />
5.  This phenomenon has been going on 24/7 on some servers for MONTHS.  Initially the pharmers are nice, but can turn nasty.  See Kukgulano's post above.<br />
<br />
This has all the earmarks of a CONSPIRACY.  Why would someone (or group of someones) buy up accounts on numerous servers and do the same thing with those accounts on multiple servers?  This phenomenon seems to be growing, spreading to other servers.  Is this simply a money making idea or is it something else?  What is happening to all this plat?  Do the characters keep the plat on them or do they transfer the loot to &quot;couriers&quot; who bank it?  There are so many unanswered questions...<br />
<br />
There is MUCH more to this phenomenon, Penny, than a couple of guys out to make a little pp.  MUCH MORE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In short - yes.<br />
<br />
But I don't think it's fully automated unattended macroing here. I think there is atleast some human supervision. Think ten-twelve computers, and a guy surfing porn until one of the bots starts flashing a red light.<br />
<br />
But<br />
<br />
It's even more likely that it's actually a human actively running the characters. Perhaps with some help from one of the (insanely good) script programs.<br />
<br />
When I played Earth:2025 there was a Korean guild on the A server. (Well, there were many korean guilds actually.) The guy who handled diplomacy for that guild was chosen because he was the BEST english speaker they had. If he had been this good at english I'd have wept with joy.<br />
<br />
Think back to your spanish class. You've forgotten most of it, right? Now you start playing a spanish game online, where people are always asking aggressive questions in a language you barely understand. How frustrating wouldn't that be?</div></div><hr />

1. DC enc plus cleric are most efficient and self sufficient farmers, so they reside on all servers.<br />
<br />
2. sorry Matlock but the above dialogue proves nothing, and if anything eludes to an ESL person, but NOT a bot. <br />
<br />
3. Stop the presses! You mean they sell pp outside of EQ!? It started years ago, did you think they just magically created platinum out of thin air? someone has to collect it.<br />
<br />
4. And your point is....<br />
<br />
5. phe·nom·e·non     P   Pronunciation Key  (f-nm-nn, -nn)<br />
n. pl. phe·nom·e·na (-n) <br />
1. An unusual, significant, or unaccountable fact or occurrence; a marvel.<br />
2. A remarkable or outstanding person; a paragon. See Synonyms at wonder.<br />

There's nothing phenominal about this. Its an enchanter and a cleric 2 boxed by 1 person who is farming platinum. Get over it, and go to Cazic Thule if you want money. its much better there anyways.</div></div><hr />

The problem has become such that the zone has been nerfed in terms of dropped loot.  I went to seb yesterday and got a fire opal in 2 hours doing bugs and frogs (was there to raise guk faction anyhow).  It seems rather odd that SoE would nerf sebilis so long after its been in game just as a random nerf, but if you add in bots farming for long stretches of time it becomes more plausible.<br />
<br />
You can say its not a bot (maybe its not), but it seems rather odd with  some of those responses.  They answer a lot of very different questions with very similar responses.  I also found it strange that the bot starts saying bro at one point, but then reverts back to the &quot;no abc la&quot; line of speech a bit later.<br />
<br />
I think we can all agree on one thing--its a pretty well-written bot :) if it truly is a bot.<br />

What I wonder is if its possible to make more money farming plat like this with bots on multiple servers than if you had a real job (and something that requires a college degree) and worked 40-60 hours a week.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Penny don't be dense. Its the same combo on at LEAST 15 reported servers, in the same exact spot, 24 hours a day 7 days a week (confirmed by people playing different times of the day). Thats way over the top of &quot;coincedence&quot;. At the very least, its a team of players running this &quot;business&quot; taking turns maintaining the boxes. More logically its a macrobot that is being maintained by a LOT loss people. EQ Windows, 1 machine per server, a couple people sitting there making sure things are going OK and no one is training, petitioning, repporting, whatever. <br />
<br />
Question is, when they get busted (and unless they just pack it up they WILL get busted) will we be told what the deal was?

You're thinking in the wrong terms here. I don't think this is a bot, I think it's a small group of people in a computer &quot;sweat shop&quot; type operation set up in a developing nation. One person with computer/business skills and a bunch of people who would otherwise be unemployed/migrant laborers. You can't make a decent standard of living for a US citizen doing this, but it's likely you can make enough cash to entice people in a less fortunate situation into sitting there for 12 hours before the next shift takes over. So no, don't quit your job and set up an EQ plat farm, but if you happen to know Spanish and have good computer/business skills maybe you could set up shop in Mexico City and support yourself by having cheap labor farm multiple servers constantly.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. Anyone knows that it's good business to do more for less cost - it's not that hard to write a bot to handle this. You could easily combine some old &quot;chat with the computer bot&quot; into a bot that handles a series of tasks, add in some code to handle GM interference, add in code to handle various situations - and suddenly your computer makes you money with half the effort - and without paying some asian or mexican $2/hr.<br />
<br />
Yes, you would have to keep an eye on it, but the very fact that sometimes (rarely) they aren't there tells me that errors happen that aren't accounted for in the script - LD, Trained and needs to be reset, and of course the ones that are accounted for, such as recieved a tell from a GM, so /q out instantly, etc.<br />
<br />
If I put my mind to it, I'm sure even I could write something like this (I'm a software dev though) so I see no reason that it can't be done - a bot makes more business sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course who knows - you may be right and I may be wrong. I'm fascinated and annoyed by the situation though, so I certainly condone this investigation.</div></div><hr />

Its not hard to tell that the person dose not live in the US so they are problly only makeing $2 a day. PP sells for like 20 -30 dollors for 10K. Has for being there 24/7 emploee A works 7-3, B works 3-11, C works 11-7. Cost $6 a day in labor only 4 if you cut it to 2 12 hour shifts. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Yantis pays his plat farmers $5 / hour.  This is no secret.  I'd assume they'd want a steady stream of straight plat, rather than a rare item that might or might not drop, which they'd then have to sell to players.  Seeing as how the vast majority of human beings sleep at least a few hours a day, even the most devout anti-Garditarian can't deny that account sharing is going on.  And you can pretend your skull is as thick as a redwood trunk, or you can admit that all that plat is most definitely getting ebayed.<br />
<br />
You may say that it's none of our business, but it most assuredly is.  First and foremost, it just cheapens the game.  SOE is doing this themselves, but not to the degree Yantis is, and two wrongs don't make a right.  The extra plat flowing into the economy from this isn't earned and promotes ebaying.  Even if you don't agree that (or care about) EQ is being cheapened, ebaying concerns us all.  When you fail a mission or quest, or just get bad exp in a regular old fashioned grind group, because of one or more poorly played characters, it's affecting you.<br />
<br />
It seems to me as if Gard's just curious and doesn't mind chatting up the people behind the bots farming plat.  A few people have said that he should stop getting so bent out of shape, or just get over it, but it seems to me that the only people who're getting bent out of shape and can't get over something are those speaking out against him, who can't get over him chatting a bit with people in an online and quite social game...<br />
<br />
Helper programs can get fairly complex.  A post made to the official EQ boards mentioned programs that will sonically alert you to various user-defined situations; eg. hp dropping too low, being attacked, receiving a tell...  As someone has already mentioned, what's likely going on is 2-3 people working in 8 or 12 hour shifts in front of a bank of computers.  Each computer is probably 2boxing the enc/cler combo for a particular server using EQW, running a script to make it automated, and running a program which will alert the employee if anything unexpected happens.  This way if a real human response is required, it can be given, such as peoples' examples of getting c3 or a res.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) It could be anything from a simple script that simply says<br />
<br />
move to loc x1, y1<br />
cast 1<br />
move to loc x2, y2<br />
do while mob.alive<br />
  cast nuke<br />
  if mana &lt; 50% then MedWhenDone = true<br />
loop<br />
do while mana &lt; 90<br />
if MedWhenDone = true then meditate<br />
loop<br />
...<br />
<br />
or it could be some kind of complex system that can adapt to different situations - I'm betting on the former.<br />
<br />
b) /targ &quot;phat lewt dropping mob's corpse&quot;<br />
/loot<br />
<br />
c) I've been told that they offer no resistance to trains. If trained, they probably die, and then the person watching all the machines has to reset the script.<br />

Well, that may be true, but people saying that this &quot;can't&quot; be a bot are simply ignoring the fact that technology is way better than it was 10 years ago. Even I could write this bot if I put any effort into it.</div></div><hr />

It's much better than working in a corporate environment.  If I could farm plat for myself to sell, hell yes.  For yantis or someone else prolly not worth it. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">When I was factioning in sebilis for my wood elf crown, I remember seeing the enchanter / cleric duo there every time I went there.  I thought it was pretty odd that they never slept, especially since the cleric was an old guildmate of mine (who became inactive and probably ebayed).  I neve really thought of them as being &quot;bots,&quot; but that does seem like the most likely solution now that I think of it.<br />
<br />
One thing that I especially remember was that the enchanter would cast shissar on me every time I came within close proximity.  I remember thinking how strange it was that she would shissar a shaman, rather than something a little more appropriate, like KEI, but this would make a lot of sense under the &quot;bot&quot; theory.  Just something to think about I guess- i find this whole thing to be unbelievably funny, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I wasn't going to mention the company name, but since somebody else already did: those of you who don't think bots can be this complex, go check out Xylobot.<br />
<br />
In the interests of &quot;seeing how its done&quot; I got a copy of Xylobot and played with it some. JUST FOR TESTING purposes--I don't use it in game other than to see how it worked (CYA). Nonetheless, I did play with it enough to be able to set a PC up who could follow a complex routine, such as: buy stacks of items from vendor, move to other vendor, buy stacks of items for that vendor, move to brew barrel, open brew barrel, place one of each stacked item in barrel, combine, drop results in bag, rinse and repeat until supplies are empty, return to first vendor, sell results of combines, sell empty bottles. Start all over. Loop it, sit back, and in 10-12 hours your brewing skill is 250. My brewing was already 250 when I did it, but the principle is sound. And the level of sophistication for the scripting is pretty remarkable, even for a rudimentary programmer such as my self (I'm a hardware guy, not a sortware guy :) In fact, if you buy their scripting tool, you can also download a ton of already-made scripts to just plug into place, to handle all sorts of mundane tasks.<br />
<br />
Give those sorts of tools to somebody who knows what they are doing, and I have no doubt they could write a macro to camp multiple spots in Seb--even running back and forth between jail and pyra, as the ones on my server do.<br />

<br />
I have to take issue with this a bit.  I dont agree with ebaying, buying or selling stuff on ebay at all however I dont think people buying plat or items is ruining the server ecomony.  The money came from somewhere, it was possibly farmed from bots if you believe that or just people rotating shifts on the same account at the same account or just someone who never sleeps heh.  The point is the plat or items were being farmed, its not being duped or obtained in a way that is inconsistant with the way they normally would be.  Meaning something dropped it.  So it was &quot;earned&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are enough people out there who suck at playing their class without ebaying as it is.  I know people who have played their class for years and still are clueless.  You just avoid those people.  If you find someone stinks you dont group with them agian.  So that affects you just as much as playing with some clueless guy who ebayed.<br />
<br />
Sony could probably do something about it if they put the money and resources into it.  Is it worth it though?  Keep in mind that if you think SoE is going to eat the costs involved in investigating this your fooling yourself, those extra costs will be passed right on down to you in the form of higher subscription fees.  I dont think it damages the game as much as some people think.  Does it hurt the game less when someone takes over the account of a retiring player for free?  Or is it that money is being made that makes it so horrible.  It is still a small minority of players who are involved in this activity.  I still just dont see the reason to obsess over this the way some people are.  Who goes to Sebilis anymore??  The few times I have been to this zone in the last year especially there has always been less than 6 people total in the zone. There is nothing that drops here anymore thats of any use to anyone anymore, save for a couple things.  Only reason I can see to come here is for cash drops and to maybe PL an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I seriously doubt its a bot.  What would be the point?  Hell, there are lots of times when I played, that I never answered tells.  Sometimes I would make a nasty AFK message saying something like &quot;I'm busy, don't bug me, no I won't buff you, keep talking to get added to ignore&quot;.  That would be much easier than a bot.</div></div><hr />

Whether or not it is, I don't know - but asking what would be the point is akin to saying &quot;ha! ha! I haven't read this thread!!!1&quot;</div></div><hr />

he had talked of quitting EQ and left the guild about a week after, definatly looks like a player auction and a macro to me</div></div><hr />

I mean what would be the point of having a bot programmed for interactive responses.  It would be a hell of a lot easier to just set an AFK message or completely ignore all the tells.  Why spend all the extra time?  And how does a bot know where corpses are to res them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I agree, it seems as though maybe you've just skimmed over the thread.  A few people have mentioned that the most likely scenario is one or a few people looking over 15-20 computers.  There are programs which will let you know by sound if you get a tell, if someone is nearby, or whatever else you want it to let you know about; this has been gone over in a thread on the official SOE EQ boards.  &quot;Why spend all the extra time?&quot; We've already gone over how much Yantis makes from his plat sales.  That's big money my friend, and that's why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Wow was not even aware of macroquests existant till last week. Then I found this about it and saw this post. http://www.rpgexpert.com/395.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I heard on CNN  reguarding this matter of items being sold from the game by RL money.  They said soo much selling is going on that EQ has the ability to be it own economy or stock market.   Yeah this is crazy,  tons of money pour thru and around EQ.  Why are soo many people against others who sell pp and others that buy it..<br />
<br />
I read that article as well.. and it seemed total BS to me.  Theres no way Millions of dollars are changeing hands for EQ plat.  I can only assume they were taking the existing ratio of $ to PP and then adding up the value of all the PP in the whole game.<br />
<br />
and as to the person that mentioned buying 20kpp for $50 to save time?  ...if the ratio was that good maybe for some retired rich yuppy.  I went and looked at some of the E-bayd chars one time and clicked on a couple links from what I saw it was more like 2kpp for $50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Hmmm, weird.  Now that I think of it, awhile back I was in Sebilis for a few days playing in the crypt and each time the same cleric and chanter were there each time no matter what time I went.  I wrote it off at the time and just figured it was two more people farming faction for the wood elf mask.  <br />
<br />
The thing is, at level 65 I can think of much better places to farm plat, especially with a chanter/cleric combo.  But the risk is much higher than in OS.</div></div><hr />
