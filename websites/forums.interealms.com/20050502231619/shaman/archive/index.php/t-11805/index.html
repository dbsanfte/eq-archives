<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In old Cazic there was an illusion potion (earth elemental?) that dropped that could make your day in The Hole much easier. Anyone knows where it drops now? ...if it even exists today? ...or if there is any other way to get hold of such a sweet delicacy?<br />
<br />
I can't help it but I still miss that old zone - it's not the same now... heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sounds familiar...<br />
<br />
I found these on lucy.<br />

<br />
I gotta get one of these...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, I actually used that potion a loooooooong time ago so I could buy a ship in the bottle from Clurg to finish the Kaglari Mana Doll quest. <br />
<br />
I would think if it dropped anymore at all, it'd be in front of CT. Kill lizzies on the pyramids until that golem pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BowenBathory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what is the mana doll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as I know, all of the mobs from old cazic got moved out to Feerot.  However, they might have gotten rid of the clay golem, which was the mob that used to drop the item &quot;ball of golem clay&quot;.   My recomendation would be to spend a lot of time with a tracker in feerot, and do research on google or something.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">so what your trying to say is , they got move out to feerot ? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well , ive never seen a golem in feerot personaly , i think it might just be gone :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Kaglari doll was kind of lame, ac4 mana+15, but it was a fun quest. You had to find all the skeletons Kaglari lost when she was cleaning up her master's den and talk them into coming back. You had to be fairly enterprising to do these quests. <br />
<br />
As for clay golem, I think he'd spawn after a bunch of lizards got killed. He used to be a maze mob IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they only moved the lizards out of CT... and forgot about the rest. Noone on any site I've managed to dig up has confirmed even the sight of that golem after the revamp. That's what made me come here and ask... since you lot always knows it all ;)<br />
<br />
Also the fact that they made a new item with the exact same name makes me believe the old potion is no longer existing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I crawled down to Jaeil the Wretched yesterday instead with my husband. 62 ranger/shaman duo can do it.<br />
<br />
What made me very surprised was that I got much more than a full blue bub of level exp at level 62, even though it seemed that most of the mobs were green and the rest only light blue<br />
<br />
It was very fun even if it is a dungeon of greenies that adds from far, far away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Judging by the fact that any Ball of Golem Clay I have come across in Bazaar is now 7K+ or so, I would guess this is an item that no longer drops.<br />
<br />
The Kaglari mana doll quest was way ahead of it's time.  In an era where every other quest was &quot;give four of X to NPC Y&quot; the mana doll required faction work, tradeskilling, and minor sub-quests.</div></div><hr />
