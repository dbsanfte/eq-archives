<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are the negative effects of running out of stamina (if your stamina is 100 or over)? <br />
<br />
To be more precise, does running out of stamina effect the rate of skill increases? Obviously this isn't going to be something that's easy to find out, but hey, someone might know!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah. Just suck it up and buy some food :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My pally died (indirectly) from starvation.  If you go without food / drink long enough you eventually begin to loose STR and AGI.  I quickly became so encumbered by my own armor that I could not move and a wandering mob decided to chow down on me.<br />
Some of the less severe effects of stamina loss are slower attack rate, inability to heal naturally and inability to meditate.<br />
Basically listen to Nerun and just summon some more food / drink :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You'll eventually not be able to jump.<br />
<br />
Thats about it with sta over 100 afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like Seredith said.<br />
<br />
I thought that if you had Sta over 100 then apart from jumping nothing else is affected.<br />
<br />
As for going out of food when I was leveling my druid I didn't bother feeding either Hal or the druid even though I was getting the &quot;you are hungry/thirsty&quot; messages for ages, when I realised that neither Hal not the druid was regaining mana even though they were sat.  I thought I was bugged so camped out and logged back in then it clicked &quot;Ahhh no food and water  = no mana&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Damal Iceroot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Up until about a month or so ago, I had never gone without food or water(always carried Ping or Fish rolls), well one day after my KEI (C3) wore off I realized my mana bar wasn't moving any more, figured it was just my character getting back at me for not getting a refresh on his KEI hehe. So I camped and came back, and then realized I had no food, so I summoned some of that tasty bread and everything was fine again. Oh I felt rather dumb after sending out a few tells to some of my friends on at that time about this weird bug happening to me, only to send a tell back saying &quot;Oh I ran out of food&quot;, and this was after a couple of them asked &quot;You do have food right&quot; and my reply back was&quot; Of course I do&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if stamina is over 100, that bar has no effect on you at all except you can't jump.<br />
<br />
if stamina below 100, you lose some str/agi/dex i think, as well as can't jump.</div></div><hr />
