<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rufus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been awhile, but, I'm fairly sure that she was immune to slow the last time we fought her.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">She's not slowable, hits for 385 max.  Took her out today for my 53 SK 2box alt, it was him tanking, me healing (took a full mana bar + a canni5) and a 65 ranger friend am3/eq, disc'd trueshot.  I was plyaing all 3 characters, so it was close... If I could have been canni'ing on my shaman the whole time, there would have been no mana concern but as it was, if the 5 minute (or so) fight took any longer I'd have run oom.  Quiescence, nice as it is, just can't keep up with something hitting that hard unslowed :p  When it was my ring at stake, the same 65 ranger (tanking this time), a 65 druid, and I were more than enough of a force.</div></div><hr />
