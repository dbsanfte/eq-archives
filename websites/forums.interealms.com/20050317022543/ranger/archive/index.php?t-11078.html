Another mechanic is introduced in this expansion as well. Death is no longer the inconvenience it used to be. If this moderate malady should by chance befall you, then your corpse will be transported to a new Graveyard, where you can pick it up at your earliest convenience. This cuts down on having to walk back to the scene of your demise, which more likely then not, was a dangerous place to begin with. <br />
<br />
I tend to stay away from the Verant Propaganda of this game, but even so I've been exposed to it a few times...has ANYONE else heard of a Graveyard deal before?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prae</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hoping that this only applies to the PoP zones.  It really wouldn't make sense for it to be otherwise.<br />
<br />
Not a half bad idea, but what happens if you die on a raid and the raid survives...if your body is in the 'graveyard' it's hard for the clerics to rez you back right away, isn't it?  You think there's some kinda timer or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaffis</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a trap, I tell you. What they fail to mention is that the Graveyard is guarded by PoG-like KoS dragons. One's named Veeshan, the other's named Kerafrym. And having a rez cast on you triggers a summons from one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of the PoP zones are keyed.  So if your die in a keyed area and can't find enough people with keys to help you get your corpse back, you're kind of screwed.<br />
<br />
Enter the graveyard.  At some point before the res timer expires, your corpse will move to that zone's graveyard, which is outside the keyed area.  That way you can get it back and maybe get a res.<br />
<br />
At least that's my understanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prae</div><div class="date">10-06-2002, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, thanks Venture, that makes more sense now.<br />
<br />
That's actually a pretty cool idea.</div></div><hr />

You Group port-in and noone else is on the plane. If another group ports in, they will be in a different instance.<br />
<br />
So if group wipes, or cleric dies, no chance to rez.<br />
<br />
This is why graveyard is a must.<br />

Is it at all confirmed that these exist?  Sounds like wishful thinking to me.<br />
<br />
I did notice the PoP preorder box advertises &quot;private guild halls&quot; -- if there are going to be &quot;virtual zones&quot;, I'll bet that's what they'll be.  Guildhalls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're doing it with SW:G, so I guarantee you this is a mini-test of that same code.<br />
<br />
Private guild halls, no kidding?  Hmm, betcha that's why the key system is so screwed up right now- it will only work right once you upgrade to PoP.  That is so typical of Verant's behavior.  Funny stuff<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I also read an article that mentioned graveyards, I think it was in one of the issues of electronic gamer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds remarkably similar to ST, VP, VT, etc, etc, etc...  nothing new there, except now this graveyard thing kind of trivializes the danger of it.  Not really hot on this whole graveyard idea.  Think it will make things too easy.<br />
<br />
Edit - Cuz me no type so good at 12:30 am on a worknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velondra</div><div class="date">10-20-2002, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched 3 videos about PoP that someone here on the Glade linked too, and I only had about 50% of my attention on it... But sounded to me like the VI guy was explaining that near the zone in would be a safe area and after 30 minutes on the timer the corpses would be moved to that safe area. I am not sure if he ment the zone in of a plane, maybe right at the zone in but not in the zone, or  the zone in of PoP itself (doubt this option, while one guild was rezing up to head back in another could just zone in and start working to the mob, who gets it? Seems like it would create a ton of /petitions) <br />
 The one instance thing makes it kinda rough, maybe you will enter a plane then go through a portal into your instance, and when you die the corpses would go to the area before the portal? I guess it remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

It was in relation to something not quite on the topic, too..<br />
<br />
 NM that was easy here is the link: http://www.4gamer.net/patch/cool/main_e3_2002_02.html scroll down to where they have 3 EQ PoP videos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LyssaRZ</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I experienced this last night.  After fighting through PoJ for awhile we found a woodelf who deperately wanted us to plead his case before the tribunal.   Being of the good natured sort I decided to try and use my gilded tounge to get him out.  The Tribunal are standoffish and want me to prove myself before they put any weight to my words.  I tell them I'll do it, and me and all of my party members are teleported to a room with no doors.  Shortly thereafter, about 6 or 7 mobs pop and start tearing into us.  We were well geared, but there were only 3 of us, and the mobs were hitting for mid 300's.  Needless to say, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  While the other two members of my party started to freak out, I just went back to the PoJ zone in.  Sure enough about 15 minutes after I died, my body showed up at the zone in graveyard.  I've heard the timer for corpse teleport differs from zone to zone.  Very convienient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaziel Fyretracker</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't too happy with this feature. I'll admit at times it helps, but it can also hinder you. <br />
<br />
My group last night was fighting inside the castleof PoDisease. The Ranger (That would be me) bites it to a nice spell caster. I go LD for some long amount of time. Get back and get rezzed. <br />
<br />
As I'm pulling my body to the corner and getting ready to loot. It poofs... where does it go... you guessed it. All the way to the Graveyard at zone in. So I had to waltz my arse all the way back. From my exp and from others, it seems like a 15-20min wait on corpses to appear at zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shareel</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion ist that they alter the /corpse command to allways work inside the graveyard.<br />
<br />
So you can enter the graveyard and type /corpse if you need the graveyard feature.<br />
<br />
The 15 minute timer can be an problem if you go LD and I assume they will disable COTH in many zones.<br />
<br />
So you are out of business in the harder tones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like it could be part of that tactics talk they were saying.  Lose a member, and if it takes longer than 15 minutes to get him back, (s)he is out of the fight unless you wish to start over.</div></div><hr />
