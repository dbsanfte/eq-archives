I went there at 47 doing the Stoicism quest and found ALOT of blues, Blackguards, Scouts, Drunken Pirates and the exp is awesome ! Loot wasn't too shabby either, runes, words, Shiv (I alpha'd Cujo with those), Mithril Amulets (they sell for 78pp to a vendor)<br />
<br />
After I finished the Stoicsm quest I decided to go back and exp grind there. Great place to lvl, you can probably stay there until 52+. who knows. Great spot !</div></div><hr />

Light blues out at 50ish.  The enemys at the entrance are still dark blue but will be light blue by 52.  There is one dock that doesn't have any roamers though that has lots of dark blues to a 52 around it.<br />
<br />
I would really suggest luggald caves though if you can get a melee partner or something.  We had 3 diamonds and 2 blue diamonds drop in a night trying to get a shadowknight friend her 44th spell.  They need luggald organs.  Also a luggald flesh quest yielding nice rings if you can get the fecund flesh from Nadox eventually and torn luggald robes for a 20% haste 10 ac 10 hp 10 sv poison amulet for pure melees.</div></div><hr />
