<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I originally posted this question on the guild board of a guild that has killed Lodizal several times.  I asked this particular guild because they had a similar strength as my guild (none of the guildmembers were higher than 52 with the exception of 1 cleric i think).  <br />
<br />
Here is a link to that thread.<br />
http://pub73.ezboard.com/ffallenstars53598frm2.showMessage?topicID=59.topic<br />
<br />
My guild is not a powerhouse guild.  We started out as all RL friends.  New members had to be RL friends with at least one member, but we have since grown beyond that as a requirement for membership.  However, we are still a very close-knit guild and enjoy grouping together and helping each other with quests.<br />
<br />
The main group available to us is as follows:<br />
56 Warrior (approx 1100 AC, and 3K HP unbuffed)<br />
53 Mage<br />
51 Shaman (me) (1000AC buffed, 1300 HP unbuffed)<br />
42 cleric<br />
40 Warrior<br />
40 Druid<br />
<br />
It is apparent that we don't have the healing power to tank Lodizal (even slowed).  I was brainstorming for different tactics to try, and one of my new found shaman friends suggested that I post here and ask about the unusual tactics floating around in my head.  I felt like kicking myself for not thinking about it earlier! :D<br />
<br />
Unusual Tactic 1:<br />
What if I pulled Lodi with Malise and then kited him around until I got Malise and then Turgurs to land. Then run back to the waiting group. Stand my ground and stack as many DOTs as I can before he kills me. Warrior should then get aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd be bound nearby, and re-appear with FM and FH. Do you guys think this tactic would be worth trying?<br />
<br />
Unusual Tactic 2:<br />
What if I pet kited Lodizal, maintaining aggro through Malosi, Turgur's, Insidious Decay, and dots, letting all other guild members and pets chew on him as he chased after me?<br />
<br />
Unusual Tactic 3:<br />
Have the Mage pet initially aggro Lodizal.  Then send in my pet.  After the mage pet dies, and he turns to mine, Mage re-summons pet, and sends it back in, and I begin to chain cast Malosi until it lands and then Turgurs.  After Turgurs lands send in all melees and pets.  56 Warrior is the only one taunting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal Tank Tactic (tweaked a bit):<br />
Warrior pulls Lodizal by proximity aggro, does no damage to Lodi until he gets back to group.  After arriving at the group he immediately uses his discipline Furious (auto-ripostes all attacks for 9 seconds).  Then immediately uses his discipline Defensive.  Hopefully he lives long enough for me to land a Malosi and a Turgurs.  I'll probably get aggro at that point.  The 40 druid (whose sole purpose is to keep me alive) and I do our best to keep me alive until the Warrior gets aggro back.  The warrior and I try to swap aggro to spread out the damage.  All other guild members and pets engage with melee damage.<br />
<br />
Soo do any of these have a chance?  Are we nuts to even think about it?  Is there something else that I didn't think of?  <br />
<br />
Our main problem is that we don't have enough healing power to make up for our shortage in DPS.  How do we get around that?  I'd like to do this as a guild effort, involving as few non-guildies as possible.  We will be purchasing KEI beforehand for the casters though!  :D<br />
<br />
Please leave me some thoughts on this from those who are familiar with this encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lodi summons when damaged so you can't Pet Kite him.<br />
<br />
Not sure on how long the refresh time is for a warrior's Furious disc but he won't be able to go Defensive until that is up. <br />
I.e. you'd have to chose one of those (I'd go with Defensive).<br />
<br />
Basically level up some more then try.<br />
Having that cleric able to Cheal is a must (is that a level 44th spell?). <br />
That first Cheal is probably going to taunt like a mofo. Maybe do some spam heals on the tank til he has good aggro.<br />
<br />
One thing you could try is to have the druid aggro lodi with snare and then run around your group while you land malise and then slow (and pray the warrior can taunt off you).<br />
<br />
Buying KEI as well as a group Aego will do wonders for your survival chances. Possibly buy/beg some more buffs. <br />
Definitely buy a good shaman DS potion for the tank to stack with the mage DS.<br />
<br />
How many other people are in your guild? <br />
If you chuck in a few more melee/casters to dish out more damage and a few more patch healers you might survive.<br />
<br />
Hard part is gonna be spotting Lodi before someone comes over with 2 60+ chars and owns him.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to duo-ing him sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you can take Lodi! Or at at least be close enough to make it worth the effort to try! Your biggest problem is YOU, unfortunatley<br />
<br />
A level 56 warrior with 3k hp and 1100Ac unbuffed will be looking pretty tidy with cleric and shammy buffs - Im guessing what you oughta be able to get the warrior to around 4k hp and 1150 - 1200Ac - this is plenty for Lodi (if you are worried about it, buy / beg an aegolism for your tank from a high level cleric).<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Lodi is going to be slowing - once you slow Lodi, your tank will be absolutely fine and you are home free. So, slowing her is the key. at level 51 it is possible for you to slow, but very very hard. I would seriously recommend having a chanter along for tashani (or whatever MR resist chanter has at given level). also, any other class that can MR debuff, should do so (don't wizards get malosini?). You should have Turgurs insects, Torgors insects, and Malosi all memmed, and you should chain cast these in rotation until Lodi is slowed. The problem with chain casting these 3 is that after about 4 casts, chances are you will havre aggro, and the more you cast, the more aggro you generate. Basically it is gonna be a race  to see which happens first: (1) you stick Slow on Lodi = you win (2) Lodi kills you because your tanks cant get aggro off you = you lose, Lodi then kills everyone else (3) You go oom - Lodi wins.<br />
<br />
Right now, I would say the single biggest factor in the sucess / failure is your level. the warrior is good enough, the cleric is good enough, it is the slower that is the weak point - go level!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just FYI stuff....<br />
<br />
Mages get the malo/ mali / malx series, not wizards.<br />
<br />
Clerics get complete heal at 39, not 44.<br />
<br />
And you may be able to slow him just fine... I've never done Loz, so dont know his level, but I was at a Ragefire raid (three clerics, so was downtime between each), at Level 47.<br />
<br />
I told the MA, who was in my group, to pull a guardian wurm in the distance, and after being told by SEVERAL guildies that I could never slow him, it landed, first shot, no tash or malo/ mali on him (got the screenshot for the disbelieving guildies, hehe).<br />
<br />
So, it's very possible you can land slow right off the bat.. a suggestion maybe, try mali, then try slow, and slow again, if resisted, eat the death, get rezzed, and repeat again.  You get it stuck early, then bring him in for a butt whomping.  But again, I've not fought Lodi, so not sure if you can do it or your tactics would work. Just commenting on the few things I seen in the post.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Weyalan,<br />
I'm taking your advice to heart and hitting the XP hard to hopefully be at least 52 before we try.<br />
<br />
I'm feeling better about the traditional Main Tank, CHeal method.  A 44 cleric in our guild that we thought had quit playing logged on last night!  Whoop!  We now have 2 CHeal capable clerics.  I also completely forgot about our 2 paladins (both mid 30s).  They can act as a &quot;ghetto cheal&quot; with their LOH ability to keep our clerics from generating too much aggro too quickly.  If they get eaten, its no big loss.  <br />
<br />
Here's my plan right now.  I pull Lodi with Turgurs, and chain cast turgurs and Togors until it sticks, the mage begins chain casting Malosi immediately after my first cast attempt (much lower aggro spell, i should beep Lodi's attention)  :D until it sticks.<br />
<br />
The druid chain casts heals on me until warrior gets aggro.  If the druid gets eaten, no big deal.<br />
<br />
As soon as the warrior gets aggro, should he go Defensive or not?<br />
<br />
The first time the warrior needs a CHeal, one of the Paladins uses his LOH.  Then its the 2nd paladins turn.<br />
<br />
The next time the warrior needs a CHeal the clerics will begin alternating CHeals.  *edit*  hopefully this will help them avoid getting aggro.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the input!  Let me know what you think!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 55 I had alot of trouble getting Turgur's to stick, eventually after around three tries I got it to stick. Plague of Insects after landing Insidious Decay was no problem, but I knew that if I didn't get Turgur's on soon there were gonna be problems.<br />
<br />
I agree with the rest of the posters that you should level some more before making the attempt.<br />
<br />
Landing Turgur's turns Lodi into an Orc Pawn that summons, but its got to land.<br />
<br />
MAKE SURE YOU GET LODI OUT OF THE WATER OR YOUR SPELLS WON'T STICK!!!!!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your plan seems fine. Ghetto heals from your paladins is a nice touch. Begging/buying Aegolism for your tanks and C3 for yourself is a good idea. As an emergency, make yourself a 10 shot stinging wort potion - this might save the raid from wipeout<br />
<br />
Once again, I reiterate that getting lodi slowed is the secret to sucess - once she is slowed she is cake.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Tash line, from memory is unresistable - get a chanter, any chanter to cast tash on Lodi - it will help you get slow or malosi to stick.<br />
<br />
Having your mages casting malosi will help you a lot, if only to share the aggro around. But if the mages are lower level than you, they are gonna have even more trouble sticking their spells than you do.<br />
<br />
I first slowed Lodi at 54, and it sook something like torgor, turgur malosi torgor malosi (stuck) turgur (stuck). Since then I have slowed Lodi about 10 times and have had Turgur stick first cast or gone thru a full mana bar trying....it seems kinda random. I am currently 55<br />
<br />
I hope you get lucky!</div></div><hr />
