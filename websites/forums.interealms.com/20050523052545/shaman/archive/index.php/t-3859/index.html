Dont include things like we need Complete heal, feign death and port spells becuase well thats not shaman stuff. I am going to mention group shrink and alchemy of course .  <br />

only point the shaman class really needs fixed imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going as well, here's some things I hope get looked into:<br />
<br />
1)  Some sort of improved invis for the shaman class (Most if not all other invisers get this.)  <br />
2)  Improvement to the %%$$*&amp; Shojen armor.  No way on god's green earth a recommended 51+ item should have worse stats than totemic.  <br />
3)  Plea to up spell drop rate.  (Yeah yeah, I know.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spell Drop Rate - High End Kunark but also Componentless Levi, Eb, Remove Curse <br />
<br />
High End Spell Clustering - Focus/Group Focus same level etc.<br />
<br />
Spell Stacking/Usefulness - Groug Dex &amp; Str not stacking with Focus as lvl 59 spells makes them generally useless.  Primal Essence and other buffs.   Spirit of Bi'Lih and other Attack Buffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman Stacking on Raids - Remove group restrictions from Torpor or add some new type of Debuff spell (Suggestions include a REAL Attack debuffer, Spell casting Slow ie; add 10% to NPC spell casting time), or make DoTs stackable.)<br />
<br />
ALCHEMY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">-Drop rates (ya we all know this one)<br />
<br />
-Stacking issues of Alchemy potions and HOS (this is a real issue since the resist potions have issues.  Either remove the stat bonus on the potion or make them stack)<br />
<br />
- Remove the buyable Malo spell from the drop table (if this hasn't been done yet)<br />
<br />
- Either make alchemy MORE useful or more economically feasible.  I'd be happy to make mana potions if they didn't cost and arm and a leg and fail miserably. I just want 180 to HAVE it.<br />
<br />
- Agreed with Dith.  Iksars get screwed on this. (so don't I as I can shop there now with all my work on the cudgels)<br />
<br />
- Give Shaman some stackability.  Offensive, defensive, any one will do.  And possibly a dot between 49-56 (this is a LONG period of time to go without our primary offense, short of the pet dot, being improved.).  <br />
<br />
- Group Shrink.  Time saver but I can SEE the PVP ramifications of this (shrink someone in a zone where they can't get up stairs w/o being at least hobbit sized).  <br />
<br />
- Rub our heads and tell us we are good bears and have Pikinik Baskets drop from all killed Ranger Mobs.  Yes, this is SUCH a Yogi thing but hey we gotta have some basic amusement.<br />
<br />
- Invis is nice but we can live without it. We're not mages, we have root in case of bad luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can you ask em to make extended enhancement items work with group buffs please :)<br />
<br />
Other things on my wishlist:<br />
<br />
- Alchemy components to be reduced in cost<br />
<br />
- Spell drop rate to be increased (got all my important ones cept Poxx now, but a lot of my friends dont have any)<br />
<br />
- Would be nice of Shojen armour was better<br />
<br />
- Would quite like a bit of a bigger nuke for when there are 4 or 5 of us shammies on a raid<br />
<br />
- Aint gonna happen but an increase in our melee caps and possible a slightly better damage table would be cool.<br />
<br />
- Some other stuff too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">spell drop rates - definitely<br />
<br />
improved invis - no, not essential, but at least something they might actually be wiling to give shaman!<br />
<br />
Alchemy - even as they have made other tradeskills harder and more expensive, the alchemy remains way more expensive and unrewarding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- distant fourth - the Shojen armor, and again only because it is something they could actually be willing to do.  of course, with the twilight sea quest armor as a role model, they could just decide to nerf totemic!  but, then they would have to nerf Ry'gorr, as well, and ....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's an issue I think that relates to Shaman and other priest classes.  Attack table.<br />
<br />
I am of limited access right now, my connection from work blocks out all web sites of an obvious game nature so I cannot provide my backing, if someone could post the relevant data I would appreciate it.  Shaman have a cap of 200 on our weapon skills, I believe Clerics do as well and Druids have a lower cap.<br />
<br />
My pierce skill is maxed and my 2hb is near max.  Including Strength and Spirit of Bih La I have an ATK over 900 yet when I attack a level 20 green mob, I still miss around 50% of the time.  I'm not asking to be uber tank, running around landing all my hits on the next mob I'm going to solo, I'm asking to be able to beat off a couple stupid green mobs pounding on me.  Most shaman _don't_ have a JBB, clearing out green trash is a very trying ordeal without using all our mana.<br />
<br />
Can the combat tables be looked at giving higher level priest classes an improved chance of hitting much lower level mobs?  It's embarrassing to have to load a nuke &amp; kill a mob because it takes so long to beat it down.<br />

3) Alchemy - Add 180+ skill potion, like the grow one<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My biggest complaint is the Shrink situation. Either make it like Translocate spells, where you can cast on non group members and it pops up a confirm box, or make a group shrink spell (probably no confirm box on that, as it would require extra coding I believe).<br />
<br />
Also make warriors stop being lazy retards, and force them to use their cobalt bracers. I'm not sure if Verant can enforce that one, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 1) Alchemy: <br />
<br />
a) Drop Negative Effects. Name one other tradeskill where in addition to the AC, or INT, you get a negative component?<br />
<br />
b) Fix either:<br />
<br />
b1) The cost of Reagents<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
b2) The sell back cost.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see them explain why a single shot of Blood of the wolf sells for 5 g and 7 s to the vendor but a 10 shot sells for 44 g and 9 silver.<br />
<br />
(Numbers made up to illustrate a point - 10 shotters sell back for less per potion than a single shot of same type)<br />
<br />
 2) Pet<br />
<br />
Hi - our pet / animation / companion is a WOLF. Would it be so game imbalancing to have him come SOW'ed?<br />
<br />
Please explain why a SOW'ed light blue to a 51 Shaman Pet severely unbalances the game. Please.<br />
<br />
 3) Spell Drops. <br />
<br />
Fubared. 'nuff said.<br />
<br />
Three fixes.<br />
<br />
a) Start putting them in new locations.  Hell, put them on the Epic MOBs (Or a shot at getting them) in COM.<br />
<br />
b) Remove the vendor purchaseable Malx from Juggs table. Apologize. Do push ups.<br />
<br />
c) Institute Quests for high level spells. Quests = time sinks which fits in with the vision.<br />
<br />
Malo = Black Reaver thingy (NOT JR) + Blood of Chottal do-hickey + Drolvarg Bodyguard thing-a-ma-bob + Arrow from the Epic quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell stacking is bug-related that just happens to impact us.  The Shrink issue is increasing the convience to all classes, I wouldn't call it helping shaman, the game balance of being shrunk is pretty insignificant.  Heck, I'd call spell drops bug-related as well.<br />
<br />
Dodge &amp; melee balance is for all casters.<br />
<br />
Mostly what people are asking for is not an increase of power because Shaman don't really need that.  What we need is a lot of convience and more uses on Raids, the same that many other support classes are asking.  This is not a shaman specific issue but rather a game design flaw that is being addressed.<br />
<br />
Slow is one of the most powerfull spells in the game, on a similar scale to CH.  For 250 mana I prevent (effectively the same as healing) _how_ much damage?<br />

TGB-able, click-offable, Group Shrink. Shrink potions do work around this problem. Shrink potions are EXPENSIVE. (i know, so is Aegolism, but sheesh, it's SHRINK.) If making shrink/grow clickable means that it can't be cast in stages any more, so be it. (Actually, here's an idea: replace shrink and grow with Height of the Gnome, Height of the Halfling, Height of the Man, and Height of the Ogre, or something like that...)<br />

<br />
My guild isn't terribly uber, our last idol attempt we failed 3 times before giving up.  So, 3 times, guildmembers either died or camped, three times we would have needed to just &quot;whip up single shot shrink potions&quot; for an entire raid group (50+ people).<br />
<br />
No thanks!  If they would institute a group shrink with confirmation button, I would love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Absolutely I have to agree that SHRINK is my number one pet peeve. At the least it should be made to come up with a confirmation box like TL spells. At best there would be a group version of shrink that would be able to be used with /tgb and could pop up a confirmation box. Having to disband from my group to shrink 60 people multiple times a night really really sucks. <br />
<br />
Torpor. Yes, Torpor is a powerful spell. However, with its negative components it is severely reduced in usefulness. The cloest comparison would be the celestial elixir spell from clerics. They both heal roughly the same amount of damage, but the cleric version costs more mana. But, the cleric version also is not restricted to group only and also (according to site i read) makes attempt to cure poison/disease on each tick while it is on. So, what could they do to make Torpor more useful? Do something that allows it to be cast outside of group. Remove the group only flag. Or make it so that you can flick a switch in your character info that says like /accept torpor on  or something. There are so many times that I can be at a raid and some warrior needs healed and isnt in a group with a healer, and clerics are busy on their rotations or whatever, so he asks me for a torpor. I cant do that of course, but they need to be kept alive. So i am here healing a 7k hp warrior with fookin chloroblast. It is just wrong. Either remove the negative side effects of torpor or allow it to be cast outside of group as it is. Something has to be done. <br />
<br />
An AA skill having to do with debuffing. It is apparent to me that Verant doesn't seem to understand the role of shaman in EQ. There should be some sort of AA skill that makes debuffs faster, cost less mana, be less resistable, last longer, or something. Not all of those things in one skill mind you, but SOMETHING. The other casters seem to get AA skills that cater to their specialties in the game, I certainly don't think it would be out of line for shaman to receive the same treatment on that front. <br />
<br />
Finally, spell drops. Kunark spells for shaman are still rediculously rare. The worst offender on my server is Torpor. Torpor is currently hitting the 100k mark for buying it. Yes it is a powerful spell, but no spells, especially spell that makes the difference between someone with it and someone without it like the difference between night and day, should be as rare as this is. Comparing shaman without torpor to one with torpor is like back in the days when manastones still dropped if you were comparing a cleric with a manastone to one without a manastone. There is such a HUGE difference in power that it is crazy. The drop rates seriously need to be looked at.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one last thing, and this still concerns me even though I only wear one piece of this gear anymore. Velious quest armor for shaman needs looked at. The thing that needs looked at is the resists. This is because for most if not all of the pieces from all three quest armor there are few if any resists on the armor at all. Most of the other classes have some few resist on many of their pieces, so it doesn't seem that velious quest armor should be without resists across the board. Perhaps they can look into that. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Thank you Madcoww. Hope your talks go well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Things that just seem broken and should be fixed:<br />
<br />
1.  alchemy component costs are much too high<br />
2.  many potions are totally useless or not useful enough for their cost<br />
3.  Rage and HoS should stack<br />
4.  Spirit Quickening should be improved enough to bother using it<br />
5.  Scale of wolf should make you run a lot faster, given all its restrictions.<br />
6.  Spirit of Cheetah should last a bit longer.<br />
<br />
Wishlist (no real need for these, but would make me happy and don't seem overpowered):<br />
<br />
7.  group shrink<br />
8.  a couple pbaoe spells (maybe a poison DoT or dd and/or a slow)<br />
9.  some improvements to our defensive and offensive combat skills<br />
<br />
General (not specific to shamans):<br />
<br />
10.  instead of making high level spells unable to target low level players, just let them have reduced effect.  I find it annoying to have to have regrowth mem'd for myself and chloro memmed for a lower level person.</div></div><hr />

   snare the target as well?<br />
<br />
* A new traveling spell, like Scale of Wolf but at Chetah speed<br />
  would be great. Same restrictions as Scale. Think of it this way,<br />
   it would allow me to get lost faster! The world's a lot bigger<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I would love to have something to do on one of your )*(&amp;)( Immune to slow end game encounters besides rebuff the occassional dead tank and pump clerics that are modding.<br />
<br />
We have requested all sorts of stuff from a lure slow thats only 20 percent. Even asked for a 1 min duration. <br />
<br />
Topor have the group limitation removed. Which would unfortunately require them to take off the snare/slow effect to prevent missuse and end up getting the whole thing nerfed to a heal that is more useless on a 60 tank than Cloroblast already is, but we can dream.<br />
<br />
Some kind of debuff line that we can cast to limit rampage, or increase AE times, or anti enrage or Something!!! ANYTHING!! Im so sick of waiting for the freakin High Priest to die so I can do something its pathetic. <br />
<br />
VI took the Shamans primary tool, Slow, and made it and us 80 percent useless on all high lvl encounters. Disease slow should be higher percentage. 50 percent at least. its higher lvl than turgur which is already 50 percent.<br />
<br />
PE shouldnt stack with avatar but come on why cant some one get 2 agi buffs, not like we can dodge anything to begin with (see guk frogs for more info :P...)<br />
<br />
Group haste I like the idea.... dont count on seeing it ever.<br />
<br />
AA class abilities that are worth a crap. I mean to a raid shaman (like there is any other kind working on class abilities) theres all of 1 ability that benefits us more than everyone around us Canni 5. <br />
 Rabid bear is a joke Oooo I can melee like a 40 ranger for 3 min ooooooooo hold me down. &lt;blatant sarcasm&gt;<br />
 Improved Alchemy??? theres not a dang thing worth making with it, when I can PL a chanter to breeze faster than earn the money to make a crappy potion. (yes my alchemy was maxed before SoL came out)<br />
 Pet discipline PLEASE like a pet is EVER around on a raid or even remotely useful against even little Vindi lvl mobs. (good for farming which VI doesnt encourage so Im getting mixed signals here)<br />
 Hmmmmmmmmm Dire Slow??????<br />
<br />
Come one negative effects on a potion that costs 30 plus PP and only lasts 30 min and doesnt stack with cast spell or attack on???? who you kidding! <br />
 Give us gate on the same price table as our other ports and make it a 30 sec cast, 200 pp for a 30 sec gate isnt that over powering. <br />
 Give us invis potions, we have IVU and Invis animals, whats the big deal here your own vendors sell em already... and prolly cheaper than you'll let us make em anyway. <br />
 Drop prices on all skill trivial 100 plus potions at least 50 percent (EXCEPT PORTS I think these are dead on in price and difficulty). Hell make the higher lvl stat potions cheaper as a reward for high skills. <br />
 Stacking issues with potions, just put stat/utility/movement potions on a seperate buff catagorys and only allow 1 of each type and no conflicts with buffs. CURE CURSE POTION!!!!!<br />
 Shar Val portal. No one is gonna use a 200 plat potion as a short cut to get around the portal system (which is plenty stupid already) Poor kitties cant get home when they need to :) <br />
<br />
VI needs to go back to the table completely and write up thier core vision for all of the support classes then Stick to it. <br />
<br />
better melee hehhehheh Id like to see it, but only cause I got my new wonking bone off the HP :) <br />
<br />
Ya Im bitter about alot of this, cause VI continuosly screws both druids and shaman. I want Mana burn Dangit... like thats not over powering. Tell me how a shaman with slow is worth a Wizzy with 21K crit blasts. (see dire slow revelation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">1. Spell Drops<br />
<br />
Either improve drop rate, or add the spells to more loot tables.  This not only applies to Kunark spells, but to componentless EB too.<br />
<br />
2. Torpor<br />
<br />
The original reason for making Torpor group only was because you could circumvent the PvP switch and snare someone running.<br />
<br />
We need torpor to be castable out of group.<br />
<br />
a.) Enable a switch in eqclient.ini to allow Torpor to be cast on you.<br />
<br />
b. ) Remove the snare component.<br />
<br />
c. ) you can click off beneficial buff now anyway so the PvP switch shouldn't be such an issue.<br />
<br />
3. Alchemy<br />
<br />
a.) Increase sell back price, also fix 10 shot potions selling back for less than 10 single shot potions.<br />
<br />
b.) remove the 180 skill cap let us get to 200.<br />
<br />
c.) Let us make invis potions, or failing that let us combine the store bought invis potions into 10 shot potions, make this have an alchemy skill check so only shaman can produce 10 shot Invis potions.<br />
<br />
4. Iksars<br />
<br />
a. ) Fix faction in Cabilis so that all shaman can do the quests with appropiate faction.  The cugel quests are now flagged for everyone, but not everyone can complete.<br />
<br />
b.) Fix Nurga so you can actually do these quests.<br />
<br />
c.) Give the Iksars access to the buyable Kunark spells without having to mule tham out.<br />
<br />
5. Group spells<br />
<br />
a.) Make all group versions of the spell overwrite the sigle versions ie Riotous heath need to be overwritten by Talisman of the Brute.<br />
<br />
b.) Give us group shrink.<br />
<br />
c.) Consider group celerity as well.<br />
<br />
d.) Make celerity last longer! Increase the mana cost if you want, just make it last longer.<br />
<br />
6. Combat.<br />
<br />
a.) Possibly increase dodge cap to 100<br />
<br />
Some of the above are mine some stolen from others who I agree with.</div></div><hr />

Sorry about that.<br />

Canni5 has a refresh time of 3 minutes.  In the Old UI, when Canni5 was in this refresh period it was greyed out/depressed.  Now it looks exactly the same whether you can use it or not.<br />

This sucks because now you have to click it to see if it is available.  Which can be very dangerous.  :)<br />

This is why it's so difficult to reach consensus about what shaman need.  As a raiding shaman with a full spellbook who doesn't really care about making a profit from alchemy, group shrink with confirmation box would make my life easier. <br />
<br />
Group shrink would make me a very happy barbarian shaman.  Group celerity or something, would be even nicer. :)<br />
<br />
Would most like to see dodge cap raised, combat skills upped some, since we are the most militant oriented priest class.  And shorten the stupid recast duration of Rabid bear.  5 minutes of fun then have to wait 2 hours is silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Acutally, I like what Brek mentioned about curses.<br />
<br />
Imagine, once slowed the clerics do their CH rotation and we do our CC rotation:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cursing %t&quot;<br />
&quot;Next shaman up in 5 seconds&quot;<br />
&quot;/cast 1&quot;<br />
<br />
That would be cool.  A 3 - 5 second spell that would reflect damage, lifetap, or negate damage from the mob.  Recast 60 seconds, cast 10 seconds (so no focus items).<br />
<br />
Talk about stacking on raids.  Of course, the aggro would need to be set to what you would get from Malo, Malosini, 3 resisted Turgur's, and a landed POI ;)<br />
<br />
I don't want the same spells that we have....I want something DIFFERENT.<br />
<br />
Group shrink is nice, but really, just make single target versions available out of group.<br />
<br />
Get rid of Pet Control or Alchemy Mastery and add an AA lure slow 50%-60% 5 minute duration, 60 minute reuse.<br />
<br />
Another AA: Critical DoT.  Allows for a DoT to do 25% more damage and up to 25% longer duration.  Innate ability (like SCF).  Level 1 = 5%, Level 2 = 15%, Level 3 = 25%.<br />
<br />
Alchemy - is there really a point?  It's broken and there is no way they will fix it.  It would have been done by now.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear - sounds neat, but I would rather have DEF raised to 225.  That would be some nice added AC for all of the time the mob wants a piece of me.  Raise Piercing to 250.  Would it really make a difference?  Not really, but at least we can master our weapon class.<br />
<br />
Make slow affect casting as well.<br />
<br />
These are just some rambling ideas of some coolness.  Not like we are paladins and need all the help we can get :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Keeping it simple<br />
<br />
Remove the group restriction from shrink.  Add a consnet box, or group/guildmates only if poss.  <br />
<br />
Improve alchemy.  Problems include potion viability, skill up expence, poor resell value to both players and merchants, and rare/annoying components.<br />
<br />
Include a new direct damage spell to keep us inline with druids and clerics as we were pre luclin (before moonfire, and the 1k+ cleric nuke)<br />
<br />
<br />
And for something new.  I would like to see us get additonal AA abilities.  Rabid bear, the pet hold command, and alchemy mastery need improved effects or reduced costs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">1. Spell Drops, Spell Drops, Spell Drops.<br />
<br />
2. Alchemy needs a total re-work given how useless most of the effects are, but given that alchemy herbs are starting to get used in other tradeskills (e.g. celandine to make the fishbone darts) rather than dropping the reagent cost the right fix is to increase sell-back prices to vendors by about 10fold. The proper comparison here is fletching, where I got to 180 skill for about 200pp total because when I get close to a trivial point the sellback with failures completely covers the cost. And the aforementioned fishbone darts are more cheap and useful to my melee friends than any potions I can make.<br />
<br />
3. Rage should stack properly, although I'd not be so concerned if I ever saw a copy of VoB for sale. I'd say Group buffs should always over-write the single-target version, but we know that if they do that they'll screw it up to overwrite some other classes self-only buff that they prefer, in which case we'll start getting yelled at for using group buffs :-/<br />

Anything other than 1) would be gravy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah -- so one shaman with MGB shrink walks into a AOW raid and pops up 70 simultaneous confirm boxes just as AOW is engaged. This has HUGE griefing potential and won't happen. There will never be an MGB with pop-up box. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, there isn't a single spell that I can think of that is a only castable on your OWN group.  So they'd not only have to create a group-shrink spell (trivial) but they'd also have to add the code that would check to see whether this is an allowable /tgb spell. That could be pretty complex... and for one spell seems to be a bit much.</div></div><hr />

Seroiusly Fix this stuff. Make shaman more then just debuffers. Why not give rabid bear less of a refresh or non at all? could cancel all spells from being casted? could put a small HP dot while rabid bear is on to balance it? could do anything cut down mana regenaration? Do something. <br />
<br />
Alchemy.. all our potions suck cept for Shrink DS SOW and on rare occasions IVU and Port Potions.  Every  other Potion is a complete piece of ****.   Do something about this revamp em? make em stack with everything?  Do something. <br />
<br />
Our ancient spells: feral avatar ? can you say crap? get rid of that and give us Ancient group focus. Give it more HP. You were smart with the ancient group aego but feral avatar is crap. <br />
<br />
Avatar is another thing.  Ours is 3 min recast? Why?  You give our best  Damage Spell to everyone.  Why? why not just put KEI on clicky items?  Wouldnt that be fun?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">The Cudgel of the Ancients is special.  It is very hard to get and the effect should reflect that work and effort.  As is, it is never used...which undermines the status of this Epic item.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman community that did such an amazing job solving these challenging quests are pained that we cannot ever use its effect.<br />
<br />
It should stack with everything...to quote a favorite villian from the Professional...&quot;EVERYTHING!&quot; - Avatar, Focus, HoS, a Str Buff, Primal Essence...everything.  I agree that HoS shouldnt stack with Str or focus...but this is a very different and special case and exception should be given.<br />
<br />
It only lasts 6 min.  Fine -if it stacked with EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
12 sec casting time is VERY LONG for a spell with such a short duration. 5 secs seems correct.<br />
________________<br />
<br />
Alchemy:  Create Advanced Alchemy...begining at say 160+skill.  Customizable potions - Take a Gate Potion to FoB add some componants from say DL (or OT) and make Gate to DL (or OT).  The casting time of potions could be commenserate with the skill of the alchemist...so a gate could be 30sec cast for an aspiring shaman, but a skilled one may have a 5 sec cast.  Group Potions: 6 dose potions of say...shrink or lev or EB or sow or gate...that are combined with another componant to make a group Shrink, or lev, or EB or sow or gate...the group leader casts for the group.   Advanced Alchemist should be able to revisist old &quot;useless&quot; potions and make them useful...combine greater stat potions.  Potions that you take and collect agro like a taunt.  Potions that you take and memblur.  How about a CoH potion that takes you to your group leader in zone?  Or dare I say it?  Feign death potion?  Illusion Potions:  some may change appearance (but not faction) with duration similar to shrink/grow...more advanced ones might alter faction.  Fun illusions like animal forms, or similar to those in Griegs, or other races.  Who wouldnt pay to be a CT Ghekko or a Maidens Eye alien?  Alchemy should have an upside that is fun, interesting and useful.<br />

<br />
I would prefer to see improvements unique to the Shaman class.  Like Perhaps our slows or debuffs would stack with those of other shamans...So if one shaman casts turgur for 75%, then another shaman who casts after would further slow it by 5% for increasingly shorter durations instead of being told your spell would not take hold.  So if 6 shaman all cast Turgurs (and land it) on the same creature they could slow it 100% for a very short time, with each added slow dropping in intervals.  Or our poisons and diseases would work better when stacked with those of other shamans or just stack.   Shaman's could be the class that works especially well together...no more, we already have a shaman, the more the better!  Perhaps this could be a form of Alt advancement.  I liked the curse rotation suggestion made earlier.<br />
I never understood why shaman dont play some part with the dead...Shaman should be able to transport themselves to corpses while Necro's can summon them.  We are tribal priests! And there should be some enhancements tied to being grouped with us.  Being in the company of the primitive spiritual leader should have an effect on those with us.  Like self targeted focus spells that  reduce cast times of people grouped with us or increases their damage for being grouped with us or increases/decreases their agro.  Something to distinguish our class as the grouping class.<br />
<br />
Good Luck at Fanfare!</div></div><hr />

Rant about Int on some bracer and get laughed out of the fan faire! :)<br />
<br />
And the most important issue in my opinion remains 59-60 Spell drops. Those of us who have their important spells now (and I can say that because I have them, yay) should never forget what a PITA it was to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Serious issue: spell drops - it has to be.<br />
<br />
Fun issue: Better melee/defense skills.<br />
<br />
I think (and I'm sure Madcovv can use his own judgement on this) that presenting a laundry list of a dozen changes is the wrong way to go. We need to present 2 or 3 issues that are clear cut and easy to fix. Revamping alchemy doesn't sound easy to fix. Upping spell drops, and changing some skill caps does.<br />
<br />
Everyone says torpor is our best spell. People on this board advise you to sell your first born for torpor. Yet in this thread people are complaining it's not good enough!! The name is &quot;torpor&quot; not &quot;celestial healing&quot; - &quot;you fall into a state of torpor&quot; ie you are all snoozy and can't fight or run very fast. I don't think this spell should be changed - face it, if it IS changed, the odds are 50/50 that they'll make it less good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Shaman smiths have a couple of issues <br />
<br />
First,  we are not able to make a non-imbued version of our cultural armour.<br />
<br />
Other races, such as dwarfs, are able to make a non-imbued version, and are able to make cultural armour for more than one deity.<br />
<br />
The end result for shaman smiths is that we have a significantly smaller customer base.<br />
<br />
Second, the stats on our cultural armour are not as good as the stats on the plate classes cultural armour.  A quick way to see this is to compare the plate class cultural armour to their velious armour -- most of the cultural pieces are hands down upgrades.  Now do the same comparison for the shaman.  A few of the cultural pieces have better hitpoints, but not a ton more.  This can come at the cost of AC or other stats -- and there is no piece that is a hands down upgrade.  The shaman's cultural tunic is not an upgrade from the Skyshrine BP, or even from the Thurg BP (disregarding the effect). <br />
<br />
Compare a Tribunal Shaman's Cultural BP -- AC 30, Sta 5, Wis 10, Hp 40, mana 40 <br />
to the Thurgadin BP  AC 37, str 3, sta 6, Agi 3, Dex 3, Wis 14, HP 30, Mana 80 -- effect Riotous Health.<br />
<br />
Compare a Tribunal worshipping warriors cultural BP -- AC 51, Str 10, Sta 10, HP 80 <br />
to the Warrior's Thurgadin BP  -- AC 47, Str 14, Sta 10, Agi 5, Dex 7, MR 4, PR 10, HP 90 (effect invigorate).<br />
<br />
Now compare a Tribunal worshipping Bard's cultural BP -- AC 51, str 10, Sta 10, HP 80<br />
to the Bard's Thurgadin BP -- AC 42, str 8, Sta 10, Dex 10, Cha 10, MR 8, FR 2, CR 2, PR 2, DR 2, HP 50 -- effect Selo's song of travel.<br />
<br />
Note that the culutural armour is comporable or even an upgrade for some circumstances (again, disregarding the effect) for the plate classes.  It's a clear downgrade for the shaman.<br />
<br />
Third issue I should let others speak to -- but trolls don't really have cultural smithing, although they can wear armour made by ogres.  From my quick glance, it looks like the ogres could make similiar claims about the stats on the chain armour they can make.  <br />
<br />
Why is all of this a &quot;shaman&quot; issue rather than a race or diety issue?  It's just something that you should not have to give up when you decide to be a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more detail, I am happy to provide it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sounding us out.  Luck on your trip.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">The AA healing skills need tweaking. <br />
<br />
Healing Adept does 2%, 5%, and 10% more healing from levels 1 (2 points), 2 (4 points), 3 (6 points). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for shamans this skill is only a marginal improvement because our main healing spell is chloroblast (428hps for 175 mana).<br />
<br />
10% of chloroblast is a boost of ~42 hps for 470hp. Not much considering it costs 12 AA points to achieve. <br />
<br />
This skill should be 5%, 15%, 25%. Even then, it makes chloroblast a heal of only 535. <br />
<br />
Healing Gift also needs work. A 10% chance to double your heal doesn't really cut the mustard for another 12 AA points. Either boost the percentages as above to 5%, 15%, 25%, or change the effect.<br />
<br />
Should be a specialized skill for shamans and druids to cast an instant &quot;manaburn&quot; heal. All your mana for 2x or 2.5x the amount of hps. Eg: Tank's going to die, hit manaburn, full mana bar heals 5k HPs or something. Refreshed every hour or so. Kind of like a once-an-hour ch for the non-clerics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Well, pretty much the same as everyone else's requests, but I figure at least it gives a sense of concensus for our class:<br />
<br />
- Stacking on raids. There are 7 shamen in my guild (which only has about 45 active members total), all at 59th or 60th. Basically, the majority of raids (particularly in Velious where every mob and it's brother is immune to Cold DD's), everyone but the slower/malo'er just sits around and chats, hoping that we get adds so we'll have something interesting to do. Leveling up a rogue twink atm, so I can have a 'useful-on-raids' class. Why am I having to do this after spending 2 and a half years reaching 60th?<br />
<br />
- Alchemy. There is just no real incentive to skill this up past SOW trivial, or *maybe* damage shield trivial. Plus all the potions are so frickin' expensive, the average player couldnt afford them even if they were useful enough to warrant the cost.<br />
<br />
- Spell Drops. Torpor, Malo, Pox, blah, blah, blah...<br />
<br />
- Meleeing. This is more of a dream, but I figured I'd list it anyway. Would be nice to see our meleeing raised to put us somewhere near, but below bards in terms of melee damage output by 60th. Maybe give us an Off/Def cap of 205 or 210, and give us Double Attack. If we come from 'primitive' cultures, stands to reason that we're better at combat than those pansy tree-huggers and walking hospitals. (This might also give the extra shamen something to do on raids...)<br />
<br />
- AA Abilities. What was the dev team thinking when they came up with our sad selection of AA abilities? There are a few useful ones in there, but not enough to keep me xping for long once I get Canni V.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, I'm pretty satisfied with the class. It may sound like I'm complaining, but really I'm not. Even if these things never get addressed, the shaman class is still a fairly solid one.</div></div><hr />

Here's my personal favorite:  Double attack skill to 150.  Should apply to all casters, starting at level 20 with a level capped progression.

I am so glad so many of those ancient complaints were forgotten.<br />
<br />
Hi, gang.<br />
<br />
Ark went away because he had a new job. It went and is going well. So well, I let myself start playing again. Kept the stress level way down, and the enjoyment up.<br />
<br />
Some of this stuff is simply not very game threatening. so I wouldn't be surprised to see a group shrink and cleerity with PoP.<br />
<br />
Were I to add to the list?<br />
1) Give us back our Shaman only weapons. We had 2HB with original release, we had spears with Kunark. And then the weapons disappeared. Shamans got this wonderful Rabid Bear to use with Luclin, but have to make do with the same hardware as the lesser offensive Druids and Clerics. How be adding SHM to some of the melee only 2HB, Pal/SK 1HB, and maybe tossing in some spears?<br />
<br />
2) Review DoT agro. We have a lot of offense tied up in our DoT's, but the agro is so high... a druid friend of mine reported doing 20K damage on a target during one Boss fight. I did 4.8K over the same fight and died from JUST that agro, I did nothing else. I could see the DoT agro turn the target towards me at the end... every 6 seconds until dead. If the DoT agro problem was changed, it would also allow more Shamans to stack, each getting a DoT or two. Necro's would also become more raid-worthy, one of their common complaints.<br />
<br />
My last complaint would have been to put Affliction effects back on debuffs, but they did that last mega-patch, so they kindly eliminated that issue. Belt of Magnificence = 2.0 second Turgur's. Gotta like that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, look for me at Boston. At least one day I will be wearing my Canadian National Hockey Team sweater just to piss off all the Americans. Ain't I a stinker?</div></div><hr />

I don't know what makes them so resistable, if it is the fact that they are a dot with a DD component to them (have always heard that spells with 2 components are higher resist because they get saves against both things) or whatever, I dont know. I had a perfect example of how resistable our dot's can be the other night. I was fighting a friend in a duel and with PR sitting at 41, I resisted 5 casts of bane and envenomed bolt in a row. With a PR of 41 you shouldnt bounce all of those. Look at our DoTs and see if anything can be done please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it's only the 2 component thing, as Torrent of Poison is just DD and is still very easy to resist. I almost never land a Torrent for full damage even on crap mobs in Sebilis. Now, maybe Seb frogs have high PR, but it's like this everywhere I try it. Torrent just almost never lands for full damage. It's not that big a deal to me, as I rarely dot or do AE on raids, it's just kinda annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">hehe, well I rarely pvp so I never really took notice of any differences. Another example would be in Ssra mines where I bounced 4 envenomed bolts in a row from a poxed soriz or whatever they are. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I see a lot of resists on my casting of them as well. not a completely unmanageable amount, but enough of them. If it is due to the dd+dot component I wouldn't mind if they could change it to straight up dot only or a straight up DD. However, we likely to never have a really nice DD so dot only would be the way to go. of course, that is all based on whether or not the dd+dot correlation to resists on spells were even correct. I dunno heh. <br />
<br />
Still though, Shrink would be my biggest issue. DoT i only care about while exping. Shrink I care about most of the time. When ya cast that one spell 100+ times a night, it is extremely annoying to have to disband to do it all the time =(.</div></div><hr />

Good comments here though.  Don't think we need much, but 80% of what I've heard sounds good/reasonable.  Lets try not to waste our favors on silly requests though! (*cough*SOW'd puppy*cough*)  :D <br />

One comment that I did like from another thread<br />
was to give our pet our AC ala giving our pets our Resists.  This would be sweet, and would be a good way to upgrade our pet...  But I wouldn't<br />
hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

It's a pain to shrink 60+ ppl<br />
<br />
Also I read something interresting in that thread. Someone said Dire Slow.<br />
Could be nice for those long 20+min fight like the Creator in Ssra.. I hate going on rampage list because my 4th refresh of slow was resisted 5 times ..<br />
<br />
PE stacking with avatar ? no thank.. But with Agi buff I don't mind at all.. That spell is not that long to mem and cast.<br />
<br />
I'd love cursing the mob. But only if the effect worth the aggro )<br />
<br />
Our nuke really sucks. Casting time is too long, dmg/mana ratio is awfull and they resisted anyway. I'd prefer some new dot / debuff to a new useless nuke<br />

<br />
Id like to ask for either an upgrade to our Ice DD. Or a magic / elemental DoT. Im sick to death of all these mobs that are damn near immune to Poison and disease.<br />
<br />
We cant dot (may as well be immune), we cant slow (it is immune) we cant Cripple (chanters have nuthin to do then)<br />
<br />
Is it so much to ask to ba ABLE to do something that effects the outcome of the raid???!!!???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Things that should be looked into:<br />
<br />
- Alchemy<br />
- Spell drops (Recently saw a Torpor go for 125 k!)<br />
- AA Skills (Rabid Bear??? Alchemy Mastery???? Pest Discipline???)<br />
- Make Shaman more &quot;stackable&quot; at big raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">In order of importance:<br />
<br />
Spell drops (Not just Malo and Torpor, but Tirgirs and Poxx as well as most of the Luclin spells)<br />
<br />
Spell stackingoverwriting issues - not many left, but squash the ones there are<br />
<br />
PET - I'd really like to see some consideration of a new pet at 60th or a pet enhancing AA ability. (I don't think having a pet thats LT blue at 60th would be too much to ask)<br />
<br />
Group shrink/or targetable outside the group shrink, make it work everywhere like the potions too<br />
<br />
New spells - we definately a new spell or two for the unslowable and other nasty end encounters. Curses sound promising.<br />
<br />
Alchemy needs  a general revamp, many negative effects need to go and prices need to be lowered in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">i'd like to see our DD aa skill replaced with an archtype or class AA dot dmg increase skill similar to the new focus items too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">You can have my Spell casting fury after you pry it from my cold dead hands.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it was a bug or just RNG goodness, but 3 crits on a single cast of torrent made me want more. 720 720 720 540 = 2700 damage on a single spell cast. (Not bad for a spirit caller) With SCF3 I can have a theoretical (ooo big word, prolly mispelled) 1080 1080 1080 1080 Against two targets. for 4320 damage (Drool) You want a DD damge increase. There you go.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is have the spell casting fury effect dots as well. If you get a crit on it then you get the crit benifits for the entire spell.<br />
<br />
As in Spell casting fury 3 would have a 11 percent chance to cast a double damage dot. (Bane as an example instead of 150 DD then the 172ish a tick, on a SCF3 crit it does the 300 DD and 344 a tick)<br />
<br />
I have decided after I get rabid bear I am getting SCF2 for the increased damage and chance to crit. I do alot of the Slow AE groups with my friends and My poisen Wind censer is getting a hell of a work out, the added crits will make it even better.<br />
<br />
What I want from plains of power is the ability to raise my dodge cap, Offence, defense, and weapon skills. (and double attack damnit) Make it AA I don't care, but I want the option.<br />

It's a real drag on a raid when you are the only shaman there and have to disband and give tells in /gu &quot;please invite me for shrink&quot; .  When buffing for raids a lot of people go afk and let the buffers do their jobs.  If I could &quot;TGB on,&quot; and then cast shrink on an entire group w/o disbanding, this would save a lot of time and effort by not having to disband from my group every time someone wants a shrink, and when done, give my group leader a tell requesting a re-invite.<br />
<br />
Heck, just let me cast single target shrink w/o having to disband.  Perhaps add a new spell (group shrink), and change the single target shrink so that is can be used w/o have to group the person requesting a shrink.<br />
<br />
Also the same would hold true for casting invisibility, as well as bind affinity.  Simply put, let us buff those that ask for these spells to simply target that person and cast it.  What is the reason for having to group these people in order to cast these buffs?</div></div><hr />

You cannot cast Spirit of Bhi Li (sp?) on people that have bard epic or avatar on. I think that if you have bhi li and bard epic procs, it is ok.

I realize it has a small atk bonus, but thats no reason for you to lose your SoW if ya get a lucky proc or something =/</div></div><hr />

Jesus people aren't thinking through the repercussions here. <br />
<br />
Imagine MGB shrink... <br />
1. With permission box: Griefer casts MGB shrink on a raid just as AOW is engaged. Guaranteed wipe as 70 confirm boxes pop up on screens all at once.<br />
<br />
2. Without permission box: Griefer casts shrink on a monk that's pulling Vindi to the left arena dead end (you need to be large to jump up onto the wall and over it). Result = failed pull... dead monk. <br />
<br />
Imagine invisibility! You could poof a necro's pet while he's taking a particularly difficult mob! Now that frenzy spawn is all yours! You could break a chanter's charm spell when there are adds to keep mezzed! You could grief kill most pet classes with an invis spell that didn't ask for confirmation. If it DID ask for confirmation it would probably be ok on single targets -- but popping up confirm boxes is really inelegant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Besides an obviously needed overhaul on Alchemy, a hopeful better way to shrink poeple, and maybe a new heal, I'll repeat a post I put on another thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;A curse that drains stats+atk, twice the effectivness as Cripple, but works like a DoT. Then after a few seconds of full effectiveness it creeps back to normal or insta-normal stats. <br />
<br />
Or... something that drains int+wis the same way as above. Heck maybe even transfer it to the shaman for a temp period of time. <br />
<br />
Cause hunger. Probably won't do much to mobs though. <br />
<br />
Cause Confusion for an X amount of seconds. Causes a mob to attack nearest mob for a short period of time. Can't control it; mob just goes whacky. *charm level restrictions apply* <br />
<br />
CURSES CURSES CURSES. And I don't mean swearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to be a bit more creative, other than all these requests for *yawn* better DD's, DoT's, Double Attack, Pet with SoW (please, spare me).   Maybe Verant has soemthing in mind for PoP.  I know we don't have boring minds, let's be creative and fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Royganth SpiritFang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">1)  Spell drops.  Particularly Torpor.  The cost of that spell should be embarassing to them.<br />
<br />
2) An 800 dmg fire based DD at 60.  Sort of a &quot;closure&quot; for us, since we get a fire based DD at level 1.<br />
<br />
3) Snare necklace for all races - not just Trolls.  What's up with that?<br />
<br />
4)  MaloX line should either be resisted less or cost less.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Actually the confirm boxes dont interfere with anything your doing at the time. One mouse click anywhere and the box poofs. Its not like you cast DA on the main tank or something.<br />

I could see lag implications but COme on.. Grief casters popping up confim boxes while your fighting AoW? I would hope your already competant enough to work without a mouse or with a little box in yer screen for a split second once your at that lvl of the game.

I see you've never heard of the fine art that is 'rez box training'  come hang on sullon zek for a bit, and I'm sure you will see clerics using rez boxes as a grief tool  :D</div></div><hr />

I was just reading back through here, and saw one thing you mentioned was having the kunark buyable spells available in cabilis. Now I am not 100% certain, but I could have sworn that there was a guy in cabilis that sold them. In the shaman/sk guild area, if you teleport up to the upper level, then go down in one of those towers i know that there is a guy there that does the spell trade ins. I could have sworn that in that area is also a guy with the buyable spells. Hmm, its been a good year since i have been inside cabilis, so I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
