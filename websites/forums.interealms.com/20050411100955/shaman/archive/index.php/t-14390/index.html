<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Dell Dimension 4100, with 512 RAM and a GE Force 4 video card.<br />
<br />
After reformatting my computer, I updated all my drivers to the newest version and proceeded to load EQ. Now, however, EQ is insanely laggy. I play on a DSL connection, and fixed my datarate file, but am wondering if there's anything else I can do in the .ini file, or elsewhere? (The internet and all other internet programs work fine, run smoothly... I am fairly certain the problem lies within EQ's settings.)<br />
<br />
Examples of the type of lag I experience: Zoning takes upwards of three minutes, whereas before it only half a minute. Yes, I have caching on, but this three minute zoning takes place in zones I've already been to; I don't think its the caching. Also, when I open a window (i.e. the map, or the inventory screen) or a container (which I suppose would be similar to opening a window), EQ freezes for a second. And lastly, any interaction with NPC merchants is ridiculous in the response time, clicking/lag is unplayable.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what I can do? Please help, it is driving me Crazy!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">things to check...<br />
<br />
1. Are you running a custom ui?  If so, go back to default ui and see if problem persists. (probably won't help zoning but might help bags/vendors).<br />
<br />
2. defrag your harddrive.  Reinstall would seem to not have this problem but I've seen reinstalls that leave the harddrive horribly fragmented because of all the temporary files that get created/deleted.<br />
<br />
3)  what version of directx are you using?  What version of video driving are you using? directx9 isn't supported in eq though I haven't heard of any problems with it yet.  <br />
<br />
4) Have you do a &quot;thorough&quot; file check to make sure all eq files aren't corrupt?<br />
<br />
5) Are you sure all 512mb of ram are good?  Long zone times can be memory related if network access is okay.<br />
<br />
6) I think I recall reading somehwere about lag with container opening.....I think it was some kind of funky sound issue.  Try disabling sound inside eq and see if it the problem goes away.<br />
<br />
7) What resolution/texture qualities/&quot;new&quot; models do you have set up in options?  Try backing them down a level (for example if on high quality,  try medium or low) and see if that helps problems.  I found that at 512 memory, my system couldn't handle all luclin models without lag, so I had to unclick a few of them until lag got better.  With 1.2 gb of memory, I can have all models on, with high texture quality and do pretty good all in most places (still lag in bazaar and occasionally pok).<br />
<br />
8) If you are on Bristlebane, it quite probably is something on the server side.  Massive reports of 1017 errors during prime time play.<br />
<br />
9) PoK and Bazaar are notoriously laggy for me and my friends.  try banking/selling somewhere else and see if that improves things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not running a custom UI, and I have all the new models off. I have ran the complete file check, and also went so far as to uninstall and reinstall EQ since I posted this. EQ recognizes 512 megabytes of RAM when I'm in the options, so I assume that's not the problem. Still laggy when I open windows or bags : / I play on Firiona Vie, and experience these problems when I'm the only person in a zone (was in Western Karanas picking up my pet spells and still had the problems.)<br />
<br />
I do have DirectX 9.0a, perhaps I should try using an older version instead... But before I do that, I'll try defragging. If that doesn't clean anything up, I'll next try turning off sound. <br />
<br />
Many thanks for the ideas, I shall begin defragging promptly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've found that the defrag that comes with windows xp is inferior to the defrag that comes with norton utilities.  I've run that defrag on my pc but only used xp defrag on my wifes (pretty much identical systems - same, make, brand, model, video card, memory, etc...).   She lags in zones worse that I do, so I expect that if I install norton's over there and defrag using it, that she'll speed up. (though its possible that I upgraded some driver on mine and forgot on hers so that could be it also).<br />
<br />
It's possible that your video card requires directx 9.0a so make sure of that before downgrading.  It all depends upon how new your video card is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since it's a fresh install of Windows there's another direction you might want to look, background services. XP esp. is horrible for wanting to run a ton of unnecessary stuff in the background all the time. Do you have all instant messaging set to off (by default it will be on constantly checking for new messages); how about e-mail, is your e-mail program constantly checking for new mail? Are you running a firewall while playing, hardware or software? Do you have the anti-virus disabled while playing, if enabled is it set for heuristic scaning? For the background services the best site I know of for advice on what and how to turn off stuff is:<br />
http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm<br />
Before you start messing with administration services read all the advice he has and read all the descriptions carefully for each service you want to disable. Before playing with the services though I'd try disabling all the IM, e-mail, anti-virus and firewall stuff and see if that helps. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">YES!!!!!!<br />
<br />
It was the damned antivirus software! THANK YOU TUGA!!!<br />
<br />
My EQ is back, /swoon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh  you didn't mention installing antivirus software or I would have said that would be the first thing to check!   Norton antivirus causes me to get random linkdeaths if I don't disable it while playing eq!  :-)<br />
<br />
glad your eq is working again!</div></div><hr />

Norton is the devil! /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shortly after my success, I discovered an even worse problem...<br />
<br />
My computer no longer has reliable connectivity to EQ. Upon further experimentation, I realize the problem is my actual internet connection, not just EQ. <br />
<br />
This is making no sense to me... It isn't the ISP, I have another computer on the same ISP on the same router, everything identical, in the same house, that plays just fine. I've switched CAT5 cables, so I know its not that. I've tried different ports in the Router, so I know its not that. And now I know its not the network card, either... just installed a new one today, and no dice. What in the bloody hell could affect my connection so badly but be confined to my computer and its settings?!?!?</div></div><hr />
