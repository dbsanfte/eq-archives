<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK i admit since i wasnt in a hurry to get flagged for tier 2 some of my exploring in POP been a little slow. So i finally decide to get the stuff to get the side key quest thing for Cod done. I do like to find stuff as i go sometimes so i dont always look things up and went looking for the zone in. For some reason i thought it would make sense to connect to POD was kinda surprised to find the zone in in POT. <br />
   <br />
   Am i missing something? Crypt of Decay sounds cool and maybe spooky than i realize i'm like 20 seconds away from nexus and not connected to one of the other zones but its own little self contained zone in /yawn. Maybe i'm just being picky but not real impressed with it set up where it is. I really was thinking was gonna be some zone in by the castle. I hope the mobs dont realize they are so close to people! be fun if they escape and terrorize norrath/luc etc. I mean they have total access to all the zones just a click away hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There IS a zonein to CoD by the castle, as well as the PoT cave.  In PoS, there's a zone for BoT, as well as the one in PoT and to use the PoT portal, you MUST zone in the PoS BoT portal once.  This is not the case in CoD.<br />
<br />
Verant decided to have a portal to each of the zones in PoT, so zoning isn't so linear.  Imagine having to run through PoN to get to PoJ to get to PoS to get to BoT.....  it'd get a little old very quickly.  PoT even has a portal to PoT (Plane of Time) in it.....  it's the true PoP Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah i see and good point Final. While i wouldnt want full linear just seems weird not seeing much linear. Some of that comes from me though because i'm close to having points needed for my palidans holysteed and i am debating its worth. Will get it though seems like even with the zone ins will still have alot of zones will be running in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get used to it. Tactics, Torment, Tower of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, Bastion of Thunder and elemental planes can all be zoned into from Plane of Tranquility, too. I like it this way. I got sick of old raids where you had to travel long ways to get to the raid zone and often people would die on the way, and you'd have to find their body among lots of fast running KoS mobs (Western Wastes mostly). Having a completely safe route to get to raid zones is a big time saver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoD is one of the most enjoyable xp zones in PoP, get away from the zone in, avoid the undead knights (Soloing necros tend to be a right pita there, although the charm patch may stop that) and go explore the rat caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That cool jing wasnt really that upset about it. It is alot easier going right there to cod than running through pod just was...hmm i dunno sticker shock or something seemed out of place at first. <br />
  But i nosed around in there today and had some fun. Sure i'm gonna find out soon i dont mind dying exploring but rat caves a 1 group place or can get by with less? My normal group of friends tends to be Me and my pally when i solo/two box and than an sk and bst two boxer and than another 60 shaman. Really my last questions i went in there today and killed some stuff got my feet wet but dont want mods fearing this turning into hunting grounds thread.</div></div><hr />
