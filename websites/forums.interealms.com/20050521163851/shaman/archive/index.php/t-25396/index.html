<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I stumbled across this little gem when I searched my old HD for things to keep after I had to reinstall windows. This was written by Grun on the first Crucible on 3-27-2000. Enjoy. :) <br />
<br />
Diary, Me Grun.<br />
<br />
Grun have interesting day today. That last pixel of white still blink at Grun, but me think it never go away. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Me was in good mood all day, until late. Puny friend Krup (Shammy lvl 50 Barbie), take Grun to OOT and we get Grun Ebon spear. So me happy. Krup good guy for puny Barbarian.<br />
<br />
Me bouncing along all day, doing normal Grun stuff. Me buff newbie troll, me scold humies harrassing bashers, 'dat sort stuff.<br />
<br />
Me saving up to try for hoop again so me go Rathe to kill HG. Me see guildmate Rashana. She smart Erudite Wiz. She killing HG. She skinny, so me buff her good and we chat. Then me buff me and me go get a giant. Me say &quot;Hello Mr. Giant, let's have a chat&quot;, so he come to Grun to chat about weather and stuff.<br />
<br />
Remember, it long time ago Grun learn some these spells. And Troll no like admit, but we not smartest in Norrath. Anyway, me get giant and me root me like planned. Hmmm... me think something wrong. Me cast root, giant move but me no move. Me got headache from thinking too hard about it.<br />
<br />
Me kite no working good. HG no get far away. Me health go down fast, and me doggie too far away to care (he was doing doggie stuff). Then me realize &quot;Hmmm... maybe me head not hurt from thinking too much. Maybe me head hurt because giant hittin' it?&quot;<br />
<br />
So me panic. Me type &quot;/tell Rashana Heljp!&quot;, just like that.<br />
<br />
She no see where Grun is, so me stand there and do nail to his hammer. 'Dat no fun! BONK! BONK! BONK!<br />
<br />
Finally, root break (lousy root! me should root better than 'dat!), me get sow on me and me run to Rashana. She help Grun. Me live, giant die, me get loot.<br />
<br />
So diary, me sad after such a good day. Me root self like stupid Barbie, me cry for help like a sissy elf, then me hide behide skirt of skinny girly wiz. Me so ashamed!<br />
<br />
But tomorrow be 'nother day. Me go have a Gnome sandwich and me try forget it.<br />
<br />
I think I have some more of these lying around. If people like this (and if I find the others) I will post them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats good stuff! bring it on, nice for a cup of coffee and a 2min break</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grun's posts rocked!  There was one he had describing a trip he took somewhere in RL, but he threw his troll slant on it and it turned out really funny.<br />
<br />
/e kicks self for not saving more of the old MB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This reminds of that Stampi video with trak hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Diary,<br />
<br />
Me still Grun.<br />
<br />
Today better day than yesterday. Me go back to rathe and kill more puny HG's. Me thinks 'dey lots easier if me root 'dem and not me, so me root 'dem from now on.<br />
<br />
'Dey no gud loot today. Me thinks they gamble with Inkies last night now they all broke.<br />
<br />
Me see funny looking flying thing there today. It wear funny hat and look like lion with wings. It flew over to me guildmates Rashana's group and 'dey all fight. It fun to watch! Pow, wiz, splash! There I think six puny peoples in Rashana group. Me shiny cleric guildmate Ress there too.<br />
<br />
Me watch and some cyclops hit me, so me kill it and watch sphinx thing some more. Me think Rashana and Ress group having lots fun, so me sit for few more minutes. Me have fun watching punies try to fight too.<br />
<br />
But then their group mate yell for help, and Rashana say &quot;This is bad&quot; (that exactly what she say). Grun think someone big and strong should go help the punies. Then Grun remember Grun is big and strong. Grun pound chest and say &quot;Me Here! Me Here!&quot;<br />
<br />
So me poison it two time and send doggie it. It die so easy. It look mean but it die easy. Me no mean too, but me got the xp for it. But that no big deal -- it only have 7 gp.<br />
<br />
The puny group say they had three of them charmed and were scared. May be Grun lucky it so mad at them it no charm me, so me get lots of poison for it to eat.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it much better day. Me glad me help the skinny wiz this time. 'Dat is more like how a day in Rathe supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anyone here ever read MMDN back in the days?  There was one post from a necro I think, that he turned into a story.  Basically it was about his experience with an &quot;ebayed&quot; noob who wanted sow.<br />
<br />
It was the first story I read on the boards that actually made me almost wet my pants.  I kept a copy for a long time, but regrettably it is gone.<br />
<br />
Would love to re-read that gem if anyone has a copy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just because I wub joo, Lori:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see <br />
the message: &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;. <br />
<br />
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb <br />
(hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at <br />
best. <br />
<br />
Boy was I ever wrong. <br />
<br />
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes <br />
behold? Only myself and the petitioner. <br />
<br />
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; <br />
<br />
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, <br />
carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE <br />
dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, <br />
I'm not a druid or a shaman.) <br />
<br />
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; <br />
<br />
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; (um..pardon..I <br />
meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;) <br />
<br />
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? <br />
There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level <br />
31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl. <br />
<br />
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began <br />
dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while <br />
deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;. <br />
<br />
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i <br />
couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you <br />
dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;what are they&quot; <br />
<br />
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... <br />
<br />
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would <br />
probably want.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me dick&quot; <br />
<br />
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level&quot; <br />
<br />
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other various <br />
and sundry communication facilitators. <br />
<br />
I didn't answer him. <br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;??&quot; <br />
<br />
Found it twice...good for him. <br />
<br />
He repeats, &quot;???&quot; <br />
<br />
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of <br />
months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;!&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;,&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;***&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;????&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't respond. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his <br />
feet. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they <br />
began randomizing zone locations.&quot; <br />
<br />
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. <br />
Just snippets. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says &quot;why&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; <br />
<br />
I nod. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;thx&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;why&quot; <br />
<br />
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your <br />
collection of boogers. <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;oh&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. <br />
<br />
He says, &quot;yeah&quot; <br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <br />
<br />
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <br />
I still haven't heard from him. <br />
<br />
Getting curious: <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] <br />
<br />
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;no&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was a guess, but an educated one. <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;found it&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;north&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. <br />
When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;ok&quot; <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up. <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; <br />
<br />
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, <br />
just keep running.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. <br />
<br />
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
As if I didn't know.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;east ***???&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;?&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 'You have <br />
entered [zone]'.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; <br />
<br />
After smacking my head against my monitor.... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Get this.... <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot; <br />
<br />
/ignore petitioner <br />
<br />
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <br />
<br />
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened. <br />
<br />
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;***? where you been&quot; <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; <br />
<br />
My conscience somewhat eased... <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot; <br />
<br />
I scratch my head a few times. <br />
<br />
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; <br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this <br />
week&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly <br />
before my dog dialed 911. <br />
<br />
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; <br />
<br />
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attack of the Killer Gnome<br />
<br />
I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed a young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though it looked like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I decided to help the guy out. <br />
<br />
I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to type: &quot;I'm mesmerizing the lion for you.&quot; I got as far as: &quot;I'm &quot; when I remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of Effect mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC enchantress. Gulp. <br />
<br />
My movement keys are mapped to &quot;w a s d&quot; so I frantically stabbed at my keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell. <br />
<br />
I forgot that I was in typing mode. <br />
<br />
The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she promptly charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying to *save*. I watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife flailing like a crazed sushi chef, chased the little guy down and stabbed him to death. <br />
<br />
I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a nice weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed when I told him what happened. <br />
<br />
He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. One minute he was fighting a lion, the next minute a strange gnome appeared out of NOWHERE, announced: &quot;I'm wwwaaaddd&quot;, then sliced him up like Freddy Krueger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those that missed this story... this is the imfamous story of Fansy the Bard.  This story started coming out after Sullon Zek was released.  When it was first released you couldnt kill anyone under 5 lvl (if I remember correctly) in any zone.  So someone had the great thinking to make a bard and mess with people in the Oasis shortly after release.  Because of this guy they lowered the level 5 protection to &quot;safe zones.&quot;<br />
