<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) The links to all the guides (Blood of Nadox, Stoicism, Canna2) are dead, as well as all the other links in that post. Where is the mine of information been moved to!<br />
<br />
2) Killed Ancient Megalodon tonight after 1 wipe with 11 people, but the second time round a guild enchanter discovered that if you were sitting when you were sit by AE, you were not stunned at all, although you do take the damage from the spell. Not been stunned allowed our clerics to heal up the damage faster and we did it almost flawlessly after (the damn little man in the hut aggroed me, and then proceeded to interupt 3 critical heals that got me and a group member killed :)<br />
<br />
So for those who struggle on Ancient, sitting before AE works a treat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey, thanks for the info.  We are planning on doing this fight 3 times this up coming week.  I'll make sure that everyone knows about this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Strange - which links are broken?<br />
<br />
I just tested the Nadox, Stoicism links and they worked fine for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They're all dead, from whichever browser and computer I try them from, Glor. Have been since Valentine's day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neither myself nor my shaman guildfriend can open the links<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay - that's why I asked for clarification. I was looking at the Nadox/Stoicism quest links in the Quest section and they are still active.<br />
<br />
I usually use the quest FAQ links:<br />
