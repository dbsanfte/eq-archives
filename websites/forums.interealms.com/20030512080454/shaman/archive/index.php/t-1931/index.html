<br />
I have heard ardent opinions advocating BOTH SIDES; that it DOES NOT have any effect on succesfully landing our main spells and that it is VITAL.  <br />
<br />
My own experience points to it helping significantly, but one is a very bad sample and the improvements I've noticed may well be due to chance.  The more imput the better.<br />
<br />
Please respond only if you have experimented with your Charisma Stat and landing spells like slow.  Im not interested in theory, or what people believe, or what they heard...Im only interested in what you persally have experienced.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from what i can tell with my own personal experieces, cha doesnt do much besides affect the duration of my charm spells. mal, slow, etc showed no noticable difference with high vs low cha.<br />
thats my 2cp.<br />
seems to help a lot at merchants, but even then over 100 cha is pretty much overkill.<br />
btw ive seen chanters argue over this more times than i can count...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.<br />

Personal experience?<br />
<br />
Raid guild with two high playtime shaman, me (60 barbarian) and Cannibaal (60 troll).  Cannibaal has a troll's lousy starting cha AND an Eye of CT (-25 cha).  <br />
<br />
There is no difference between our abilities to land debuffs and it's a guild joke that he often lands his debuffs before mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the great input.  What Charisma levels are we talking about when you say you see no difference between your Troll and your Barb?  Im experimenting with CHA over 120...and this I where Im observing the difference, prompting my question and the post.  Again, I'll be the first to dismiss my own experience as a poor sample.  <br />
<br />
So if you see an effect, at what Cha level do you observe it?  And if you dont, Im still interested in what your Cha is at normally.<br />
<br />
I value your experiences, thank you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no idea, charisma is useless, so I don't pay attention to it unless I'm buying or selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe that the Charisma effect has been disproved via long parses that didn't make it to the new shaman board from the old one.  This is one of those EQ myths that keeps popping up, but there is no discernable difference between slows landing with and without charisma buffs.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you think it makes a difference (and you're not at a raid where you may run into the 15 buff maximum), put the charisma buff on.  Personally, I don't think it matters, but if you think it does, then enjoy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theres some threads over in the general forum, if you do a search, will net you those, and the discussion in them.<br />
<br />
And for the one talking about cha levels, I've gone anywhere from 45 cha up to 162 cha, with zero difference.</div></div><hr />
