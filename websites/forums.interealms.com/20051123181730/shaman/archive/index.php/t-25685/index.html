<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I mean its almost the European release and I was just wondering is the lag fiasco over in America or still going?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it is. i never knew what people were talking about when i saw them complain about lag all the time. Then i roleld an alliance char cause my friend joined the game. There are so many people on alliance the lag is unbearable in most cases. Weekend evenings in ironforge are unbearable. hell the whole dun morough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ironforge is by far the worst zone in the entire game, and I'm sure this is true on every server.  It takes me roughly 30 minutes just to travel from one end of the zone to the other (and its a really tiny zone).  If I look at auctions, add another 30 minutes onto that (and thats not browsing time..thats lag/load/wait-for-server-lag time).<br />
<br />
The worst development with the lag was when I started crashing when entering the more heavily populated zones (my friends also crash - so its not just my computer).  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong though, I enjoy playing the game, but the frustration level is really high due to lag at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is this lag on the server/network side or is it because general systems cannot handle 400+ players onscreen?<br />
<br />
Edit: Or both?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play on Silverhand and the lag, server lock-ups, server queue's, server freezes and general crappy performance (nothing like getting booted to character selection and forced to wait in a queue - AGAIN) caused me to roll a toon on another server.<br />
<br />
However, my patience with MMORPG's has long been used up (Verant / Sony) and on 3 February my account runs out. It won't be renewed at that time.<br />
<br />
When they institute server transfers instead of &quot;We apologize, please bear with us,&quot; then maybe I'll come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, that sounds horrid.  I only briefly tasted that kind of lag when I played briefly on Kel'Thuzad (or something similar) a PVP server that's had a heavy load since week 3 or so...<br />
<br />
My main server has just started to edge over into heavy around peak PST, but it's still very playable on horde side.  Worst I see is a 10 second or so lag if I hit the AH during peak time, or maybe getting disconnected once or twice on the weekend (to pop right back in again).<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'd be irate if I had the kinds of problems mentioned above, but that's why we went with the lowest population server during our own peak playtime - after we'd gotten up to level 15 or so to find our server was on the crowded side of things.  I'm glad we switched early on, and I hope they get it under control soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Proudmoor has been a problem server since day 1. Weekends I don't even bother going near the AH the lag is so bad. Its all server side there as I have no problem rendering all the people standing around. I do have immense lag in ironforge doing anything that requires information from the server being spell casting, mail, and auctions. <br />
<br />
Outside IF, lag is minimal to non existant for me unless a server crash is imminent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Killrog I haven't seen half the problems that people are describing here. IF usually has my computer crunching away for like 20 seconds when I get near the bank/AH, so I just stand still, wait for the HDD light to stop, and it's generally pretty right.   Even in peak US playing times (which I only see on the weekends anyway) I've not had any real issues with lag at AH. Maybe a 5 or 10 second delay in some things in AH, but that's pretty much it. <br />
<br />
Maybe I don't notice these things as much because I am so used to sitting at 400-500 pings due to being in Australia. Have had the occasional server disconnects, no queues (at all, ever) when trying to log in.<br />
<br />
As Darkpaw said, outside of AH area, only time I've encountered lag is if the server is about to go bang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">damn thats a bit annoying, hope the European launch goes somewhat better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The lag should settle some in IF area once they add the AH &quot;branches&quot; to other cities as well. Basically the AH is the main reason of the lag, all the mules and people messing around it.. No problems with lag anywhere else in the game, but in IF and the closer to AH, the worse it gets. Server side lag at that, e.g. have no problems moving around and such, but all commands coming or going to server are way delayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dun morough is pretty horrid also.<br />
The problem is too damn many people play alliance. It is supposed to be the best experience of this game because of the more finished somewhat better looking lands etc but as it turns out it's less enjoyable cause of the lag. You start to cast the spell and wait and wait and wait and wait sigh. FOR THE HORDE.<br />
<br />
Horde hardly gets any lag<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Blackrock really needs a split.  Hopefully the low levels will get a clue and reroll on another server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My suggestion is to go with a Horde character.  I play on AD (a high pop server), and I rarely have any lag problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since the last patch, and hotfix to our AH, Deathwing; which is high pop runs pretty smooth.<br />
<br />
*edit* I'm Horde though, and can't say what it's like in Ironforge. Maybe I'll try in stealth in to give a report :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Supposedly, they finished putting in a lot of new hardware yesterday.  I'm looking forward to logging in to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Didn't notice a difference on Garona last night. AH still laggy as ever.<br />
<br />
I thought they postponed the maintenance/upgrades to next week though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They posponed the patch because they added the hardware and software upgrades. They didn't want to force the extra downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh well in another post i mentioned i felt myself being drawn into playing WoW rather than give up MMORPGs altogether.<br />
But after reading this thread I think ill be leaving it another few months at least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Korrundar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was on Doomhammer, however the server issues and lag were unbearable.  I moved to a RP server, Cenarian Circle and have'nt looked back.  No problems (yet) on CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Would be interesting to see if European servers will experience same lag problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Would be interesting to see if European servers will experience same lag problems.<br />
<br />
Nearly all the English Euro PVP servers are High load, and are starting to get queues.<br />
<br />
Once you get on though there's no lag as such. Obviously you do get some in the auction house in Origmar, but not enough to stop you browsing auctions. I can't speak for the alliance side though, but who cares about them anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">stable here, no crashes, rare instances of dealable lag, no server ques. Cant complain on my server anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Come to Bleeding Hollow, with your new character you'll only have to sit through 601 slot queue. Buy the movie tickets right around the 400 mark.</div></div><hr />
