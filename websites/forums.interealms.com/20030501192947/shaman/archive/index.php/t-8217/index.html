<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else noticed that SoW, IVU, Grow and Shrink potion prices are dropping?<br />
<br />
Why is this. People still buy them quite a bit. The fail rate is still about the same. Components aren't any cheaper.<br />
<br />
All we're doing as a community is hurting ourselves. Undercutting prices may mean you're selling, but it also mean a lower profit (on an already small margin) and then people expect all shaman to sell for cheaper than usual.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm overreacting, but has anyone else noticed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Generally, I've found that cheap potion merchants in the Bazaar are a plat whore mule. Usually some druid wanting to get a supplement to quadding giants. Seriously, look at some of these merchants... Most are naked or dressed in leather armor (or have the Bloostained Tunic / RMB / GEB leetness outfit) but yet somehow had the several k to make 40 10-charge SoW potions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye. They get them high enough to make thier potions and then /mule on<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They use MacroEQ so they aren't even clicking on the potions... they just do /makesow and come back to have it all done.<br />
<br />
GRRR.<br />
<br />
I don't make shrink or grow or sow anymore.<br />
<br />
I do custom orders, gate potions, haste potions, lev eb ivu, damage shield, and sell my back stock of titans that I made while skilling up.<br />
<br />
As I cut back more and more on my stock, I got more and more custom orders... :O.... I seem to have a following :) It's nice to be asked for by name.</div></div><hr />

(stupid word.. what is it.. price fix thingy )  but not many of them seem willing.. i sell them ok at 90 but everyone else sells at 80-85 so i don't sell as many as i could be (angry fingers).... it didn't matter when i was just sitting back making some cash b/c i had some for my jbb but now that i got scammed outta 10k i need to make more cash fast b/c i am about to hit 45 and want my jbb. so guess i'm goin bakc down at at least 85 for awhile.. sucks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I posted this elsewhere, but will post here too.  I made a pricing guide for Potions.  I also give you several options too.<br />
<br />
http://members.aol.com/shokaroffreeport/alchemy2.html<br />
<br />
Now, here is my philosophy on potions.  I can make 40 sow potions on about 42 attempts, sometimes as high as 43.  Selling at 100 is a pretty nice profit, or SO IT SEEMS.  My price guide, works like the medical industry's pricing guide.  It does NOT cost $100.00 to make some drug, what you are PAYING for with your $100.00 is the research, and development costs.<br />
<br />
It took me MUCHO WASTED PLAT to be able to make 40 sow potions in 42 attempts.  I made A LOT of potions that I gave to my Paladin, or sold to vendors at a loss.  I had A LOT OF FAILURES TOO!<br />
<br />
So, in my pricing guide, I use the cost of ten potions, add the cost of 3 failures (development cost) then multiply that by the profit margin I am looking for.<br />
<br />
Lower cost potions should have higher profit margins, and higher cost items LOWER margins, thus stabilizing the overall inventory control.<br />
<br />
Feel free to use my guide, post it, publish it or whatever.<br />

On undercutting:  When a Shaman spends 1000 plat per two skill points, any idiot selling potions at greatly reduced costs is, well, an IDIOT.</div></div><hr />

Stinging wort, acts like HOS/Tali but you can consitently overwrite it by using it over and over.. 1300 hp per ten shot potion which you can speed use if you hot slot it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not REALLY Cheal but I still refer to it as such since it's very easy to have a warrior take 1 and use it when a cheal is going to miss or they take a flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, Stinging Wort's 300hp per dose.   3k hp in a 10-shot.  Regen won't stack on top since it has a DoT component to it.  Severe lag can eat a dose or two when you click, BTW.<br />
<br />
Take 1 - 10 doses at a time as needed for pain and bleeding.<br />
<br />
Possible side effects may include, headache, nausea, drowsyness and anal leakage.  May be taken with meals.  If pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your local shaman before use.  Keep out of the reach of children.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I always price SoW potions at 90p, regardless.  And they're always gone within a day if I leave my mule up.</div></div><hr />

When I played UO I was selling arrows way under the price my neighbors were selling for. I always sold out within hours of filling my vendor. Who was my biggest customers? The neighbors, they would buy me out and resell at their price and turn a profit for very little effort.<br />
<br />
My suggestion: Buy the undercutters out and resell. Both you and your compition are happy.<br />
<br />
I do tend to sell lower than than the prices stated here. Why? Because I can't leave a mule up for hours at a time and want to sell fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still get old standard prices when I sell outside of the bazaar. just like we used to in EC, just /auction or /ooc sow potions, for 100pp. never get any tells or attempts to talk down price, always pay the 100pp rate. Not as convenient as parking in the bazaar and going afk, but making profit. just got to feel out the diff zones to sell in. if you have PoP; PoK or PoT work fairly well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sepherina:  I did this for a while but the guy was either extremely bored or using macroquest.  There was a very active trade war in sow potions, I would buy the guy out and by the next morning he would have 40, 10-charge potions on his mule at the same price.  I couldn't sell mine before he would restock, then his restock was marked lower so I either had to buy his again or wait until he sold out before people would buy mine, etc.<br />
<br />
I just got out of the war, there was a point where 3 or 4 of us were competing against him by lowering our prices to match and he went as low as 60pp for a 10-charge.  At that point I just assumed he's using macroquest to dominate the market, and he won.<br />
<br />
Last I checked prices were back around 85 but he's still there, always 5pp lower than anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sepherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Taladaen; Sorry to hear about your experiences. It is possible that someone else will be out to control the maket, but most of the people out there selling below the 85p line are really just trying to sell out quick (As i do). In you case its probably best just to close up shop in the Bazaar and sell in the zones. Hear I do charge 100p for a 10- slot but it is more time intrusive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If I saw someone doing that, I'd report to the GM that you suspected that they were macroquesting.  I'd also keep an eye on who the supplier of that mule was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">price 10, 10 stacks at 90pp, sellout w/in 24 hours<br />
price 10, 10 stacks at 85pp, sellout w/in 24 hours<br />
price 10, 10 stacks at 95pp, don't sell in 1 week.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the price should be 90pp in bazaar...  that whole undercutting thing sounds baaad, macroEQ (or whatever it called) sounds nasty.  although i must admit i almost went over to google to check it out.  *slaps hand* bad kanelan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">alot of times i can sell pots for like 10-15 plat more then the cheapest just by auctioning outright.  i would like log on and auction while i'm summoning food and have ppl buy like 3-4 sometimes, at the more expensive rate even.  then i gate to pok and go ahead and auction and somtimes i sell a few more.  if so i run out of them b/c i don't like to make too many at once, just boaring, so if i run out i go buy the ingrediants and auction them while i make the pots.  run to nexus auction, baz auction, make a few in the baz auctioning, sh auction, back to pok finish them up while auctioning, and sometimes i sell out again.*shrug* you don't have to sell as cheap as everyone else =)<br />

I /auc in SH sell some SOW/Damage shield pots go back grind a littl emore, make some potions..KEI in Nex sell some more potions.  I get 100pp per SOW and 220pp per damage shield (10 shooters) just be patient!  I am not trying to powergame my alchemy it's just something I do while hanging out.  If ya wanna powergame go to Ultima Online, macroing and powergaming (bugs/3rd party programs) killed that game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, with EQ macro it's very easy to make SoW potions I hear.  I've not gotten this program, but there is one Shammy on Ayonae who sells his SoW potions in the bazaar for 74 PP.  I can't buy him out, as he usually has 30-40 of them on his vendors.  He alone has dropped the market and screwed us other Shamen over.<br />
<br />
When he runs out, he has another full load within 30 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aye, similar to what I've run into on Sol Ro except the guy seems to check his mule once during the day EST (while I'm at work) and once at night (while I'm asleep) so I'm guessing he's overseas from me or possibly Pacific.  He's always the cheapest in the bazaar by 5pp and the only real hope you have of selling some is people have bought him out &amp; then look for other sources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, MacroQuest is public enemy number one for any honest player and ESPECIALLY for a hard working trade skiller who did it the hard way. Observe the macroquest/ebay cycle:<br />
<br />
1. In the beginning level 1 mules macro'd trade skill items for many millions of plat and sold it on ebay. This has been cracked down on but the damage to the economy was done.<br />
<br />
2. Now ebay people can afford to pay high prices for sow potions. Unfortunately they can pay HIGH prices for that Malo or Torpor you wanted to buy.<br />
<br />
3. The macro people can still make potions while afk, corner the market, and collect their platinum back from the ebay people.<br />
<br />
4. macro people re-sell platinum on ebay.<br />
<br />
5. You get a big fat nothing.<br />
<br />
My conspiracy theory is that &quot;The Company&quot; is only interested in keeping you paying for that next month. Paying people to fix this problem would be unnecessary overhead, its not like there's going to be an EQ strike.<br />
<br />
And since I'm ranting, I have to ask y'all alchemists about the new stat potions.. do those sell well, or was that &quot;upgrade&quot; a total slap in the face? Terribly sorry if this has been gone over before.<br />
<br />
personal for Bubub the Troll:<br />
&quot;If ya wanna powergame go to Ultima Online, macroing and powergaming (bugs/3rd party programs) killed that game.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hate to tell you this Bubub but the future of powerleveling may not be quite what you think.....</div></div><hr />
