<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used the search feature and read the posts regarding this but perhaps I missed something.  When people ask about MQing the tear people say that if you are a shaman and have max TS faction then you are good to go.  What about a wizzie with max TS faction?  Is that tear useless?  Will Rak will eat the tear?  Sorry if I have asked a question that has been asked a million times before but I guess Im just looking for confirmation as nothing I read said specifically that you CANNOT do it if you arent a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If this wiz has a tear already, try it and report back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me tell you from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,  it doesn't matter if you have max ally TS faction, if you are NOT a shaman, Rak will eat your tear and tell you off.<br />
<br />
Sorry.  Please make sure only shaman loot the tear, otherwise, you might as well let it rot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can also vouch for this. a bard i know had a tear, he spent 4 days doing faction, and in the end all we got was an eaten tear, an upset shaman, and some friends of mine that were mad at said bard :p<br />
So yeah, only shamans can MQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so let me get this straight? the bard went thru all the trouble of raising a faction he would never need? went out of his way to MQ it for you and if got eat so you got upset for loosing somthin you never really had in the first place and your friends got mad at said bard because....why? did he ninja loot the tear or somthin?<br />
<br />
[edit]nm just reread that seems like your saying the bard looted tear for a friend of his and it failed not for you, k makes a lil more sense now, too bad to was gonna have my bard friend try that for me when a tear droped for their raid with no shaman present</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, acctually he was MQing it for me. people were mad at the bard, because he asured everyone that it would work as a bard. though he read these boards, and would have seen it was impossible to MQ it as anything but a shaman. and yes, if for a week you thought you were going to be getting your epic from an MQ (which isn't cheap, by the way) of course you'll be upset when the tear is eaten.<br />
Does that clear things up for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea its clear, but lemme ask somethin...who would have looted the tear if the bard didnt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WiniMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently was told by a friend that you are not able to MQ the tear anymore...<br />
 <br />
I have a tear to MQ for this friend and I dont want to destroy it if it is still mqable...<br />
<br />
Can anyone verify if I am able to do this still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The question's been answered here many times lately, WiniMM -- nothing has changed about tear MQ. All you need is max Truespirit faction.<br />
<br />
So where does your friend get this wrong info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the confusion is perhaps due to the change, whereby upon completing your epic the faction is reset. <br />
<br />
Thus, there are very few new shaman entering the game who will ever be able to help you, you will need to find someone who completed their own epic before this change was made (not sure when this is), or someone who has worked their faction back up.<br />
<br />
So - the current situation is, as before:<br />
1. You can MQ the tear<br />
2. The hand-in must be done by a shaman<br />
3. The shaman must have the requisite true-spirit faction.</div></div><hr />
