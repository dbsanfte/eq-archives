<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was wondering if any high level Shaman has soloed the dreaded Moss Snake ? <br />
I heard of a Shaman doing it with some of the new ancient spells like Spirit of Gerbil and Feet like Sloth. <br />
Is it possible for a Shaman to solo this mob ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This was an attempt at humor, or...<br />
<br />
?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A feeble attempt apparently, guess I'll stick to serious questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I once soloed a moss snake, I had epic and JBB, pretty sure an iksar couldn't do it cause they don't have the JBB......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think this post was meant for Ranger's Glade<br />
Since pretty much if  it cant be soloed by a shaman it cant be solo'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My goodness. Doesn't anyone have a sense of humor anymore?</div></div><hr />

They, however, can swim in circles around in while foraging uber loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i solo'd stone snakes in sfp,which i think strong than moss snake<br />
k thx la~ <br />
=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I remember seeing a level one warrior wacking moss snakes with a wurmslayer.  If the enthusiastic, but confused twinky only knew something about damage caps he would have realized he could do more damage with a fine steel scimitar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Liars!!!<br />
<br />
No one can solo A Moss Snake.<br />
<br />
It cannot be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've heard of this fearsome mob.  I've always been to chicken to approach it tho.  I've heard that some uber guilds can actually KILL this creature!  But they used 'sploits I heard.  And uber buffs.  I hear that Skin like Kleenex and Talisman of PeeweeHerman are absolutely REQUIRED  for a fight of this magnitude.  Not to mention Spirit of the Hamster for the tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah those might be required but how many of us are actually going to get Skin like Kleenex and Spirit of Hamster to drop. How many of us are in a guild strong enough to attain these rare spells ? And Talisman of PeeWee Herman, who has that spell ? I heard that it was priceless or selling for an ungodly amount of cp. I heard that Epic+Jbb+Ancient spells+Torpor+Form of the Slug might be enough to take a Moss snake. I think those guys are on crack though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stop! Please!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah, you all know nothing.  Nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Here's a hint:  You find Acumen of Dar Khura, then you'll find all these other spells.  They are in the same place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">there was a thread EXACTLY like this on ... <br />
<br />
oh, four or five other message boards, including this one.<br />
<br />
i can't take it any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Moss Snake is now on the unslowable list.  Anyone know of any uber guilds that have made an attempt since Verant made it unslowable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild has taken this fearsome beast down many times! I won't give away our secret strategy, but all i can say is even this ( UBEREST of mobs) still won't drop our spells.  All we get is mala! Curse you moss snake!</div></div><hr />
