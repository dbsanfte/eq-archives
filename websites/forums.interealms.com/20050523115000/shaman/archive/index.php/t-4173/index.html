<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 3 initial attemps, I finally defeated Yeldema solo! No outside buffs or help was used other than rezzing my sorry ass. Big thank you to Zydane, Maraya, Isha/Ayisha, and Bushiin/Celetss on TM...thank you soooo much!!<br />
<br />
Heres some shots of the fight. Unfortunately the final pic of me standing over her didn't take as I was out of space on my HD. :P<br />
<br />
For those wishing to try thier hand at this feat, here's what I know.  The main problem that I encountered was dealing with the adds. On the third fight, Cargalia came by and pasted me with a 1300 pt grav flux. :P Amcilla and Cargalia are the only two dragons that path by there and they only do so once an hour. The way I finally dealt with it was to pull Yeldema straight west off the cliff, where dogdog was waiting in the water and fight her there.<br />
<br />
Pull with Malo. Then Slow, Cripple, Insideous Decay, Pox, Epic, JBB (ad infinitum). Rinse, repeat. After the first set of spells landing, I had about 60% mana left, and then reapplied Slow 1:30 in to the fight and then Pox once more. The rest of the mana was saved for Torpor. The big lifesavers were the mana free epic and JBB and dogdog (w/ Focus).<br />
<br />
Yeldema quads for 219 max, but her average hit was about 177, and frequently hit me for 56-100. She rampages, but only rampaged twice in that fight, and each time the hits were all low (50s) or missed. She has 24k hps, and is a warrior class. Doesn't gate, or cast any AE, but she does summon, which was fun when pulling. :P<br />
<br />
I only had 1056 AC fully buffed and 2249 hps. Thats not alot. :/ I will need to work on that. I had to Torpor myself at about 1k hps in order to get it off in time. If I waited any longer, then I ran the risk of any interruptions killing me before Torpor took effect.<br />
<br />
Anway, she dropped her Talisman, 5 AC, 4 to all stats. Dragon meat (gave it to a guildie (cuz I always eat the damn food) for staying up so late with me and porting Maraya in from Seb to rez me), Shroud of Death (55 SHD spell), Call of Fire (55 RNG spell). <br />
<br />
This was SO much fun!  The challenge itself was worth the deaths.  Now to try a different dragon =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gratz on slaying the beast.<br />
<br />
On a side note, that custom UI you have is incredible.<br />
<br />
Anway you could post it? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cheers for posting that Az.  I been sat in WW a couple of times staring at yeldema wondering whether or not to try it.  Self buffed I can hit to 1k ac (just) and about 2450hp.  I dont have poxx so am gonna have to use BoN instead.  She sounds like she could be fun :D<br />
<br />
Naz, I believe it is the same as:<br />
<br />
http://webpages.charter.net/damaged/Quartz1_2.zip<br />
<br />
It is the Quartz complete ui set and can be found on www.eqskins.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats, thats where I have been pulling her to also. Time for me to go back and do it without clicking my barbed rubi bracer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, its just a modified Quartz skin.  I just added the extra chat windows to control the spam.  <br />
<br />
That fight was alot of fun. I highly recommend it if you're getting bored with EQ. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah..thanks Kronen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try bratavar next, he drops mantles =)  All the rest ae, so get some insta clickers and go to town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had my first attempt on Yeldema.  Got her to about 50% health, still had around 60% of my mana and got an add so had to gate :(  Was very lucky as I had that damn Gate Collapse thing on the first gate attempt, interrupted the second, then managed to get to the bazaar with &lt;100hp and no buffs :)<br />
<br />
Havent got Poxx, but have all my other important spells.  Next time she is going down.  Must admit, casting malo to start the fight didnt half get the adrenaline pumping - havent had that feeling in EQ for a long time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phallax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe grats Az</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Managed to take her out on the 4th attempt today.  The killer is the adds, the first 3 times I had to gate because of them.  I ended up working out that there is a 7 minute gap between the scar guardians that wander through the pull point (I didnt want to kill them incase they gave a negative CoV faction hit).<br />
<br />
Pulled Yeldema with Malo, sent in Dog, slowed, pulled her down the cliff, crippled, BoN, Epic, then JBB.  Re-slowed about halfway through.  At 7 mins on the dot I got an add of a Scar Guardian.  Thankfully Yeldema was fleeing so gave me time to slow the add.  Rooted Yeldema, dopped on a BoN and managed to kill her.  Had to gate as there was no way I was gonna be able to take the add. <br />
<br />
Cheapskate didnt drop anything other than 6pp :(<br />
<br />
It may have been done before, but what a rush :) My hands are still shaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FYI Yeldema doesn't quad attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The best spot is right off the cliff near yeldema where the land juts out a bit right at the edge of the water.  Maybe 1 wanderer an hour there.  Gratz, I just recently started trying the AE dragons, they are lots of fun :p .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is where I was and there were 2 scar guardians that wandered through there, one about 1.5 mins after the first, then the first one was back about 7 mins later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, the fastest I have had between wanderers was once I had Glati come through, then 30 mins later a wyvern.</div></div><hr />
