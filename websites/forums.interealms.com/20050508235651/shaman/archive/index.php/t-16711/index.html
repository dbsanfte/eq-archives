<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The guild I'm in is a bit directionless right now so I'm looking for advice. Several weeks ago we were working weekly ToV-HoT raids and were doing really well. On just our 3rd raid there we decided to crawl rather than pull to the door and we totally owned the place. We could handle 2-3 adds without a problem. It was some of the most fun I've had in EQ. However, the very next week we had only 2 groups show up and we got our asses kicked after a gater got us 4 adds and spent about 5-6 hours on CR. We haven't been back to ToV since then :(<br />
<br />
Since that time we've killed DS twice, Vindy once, Zlandicar and Cazic-Thule once, Xanomech twice and about four BoT tower bosses. Over all though we don't any long-term goals and barely raid once a week. I read posts here about how guilds usually progress from HoT-&gt;WToV-&gt;NToV-&gt;Ssra-&gt;VT-&gt;elemental but we seem very stuck right now on that progress :) A few of us are working on VT shards(I've got 7) but most don't seem interested. It's a casual guild with many married people but on any given night we actually have quite a few online but most seem content nowadays to just hang out in PoP zones and AA or go on LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
Is there maybe another route we can take to eventually work our way up the ladder? The issue with dragging corpses in ToV making for long and nasty CRs I think means we'll sadly we'll never be back. How much harder is Ssra in comparison? Doess Ssra have the same problem with corpse dragging? Can we get away with just raiding BoT tower bosses and the occasional Vindy raid? Are there other smaller raid targets I'm missing alltogether? <br />
<br />
Our guild consists of(from the top of my head):<br />
<br />
3 65 warriors with epic.<br />
3 65 bards (2 with epic)<br />
3 65 rangers(2 with epic) but only one of those is usually online regularly.<br />
3 65 enchanters(1 with epic). <br />
2 65 epic wizzies but not usually online.<br />
2 65 mages<br />
5 63-65 clerics (3 with rezz sticks). Good news is that they are almost always online.<br />
3 62-65 shaman. 2 with epic. I don't have epic but have almost a full spell book. Just lacking FA and RGC. <br />
0 rogues of raid level :(<br />
1 61 beastlord <br />
1 65 epic monk but started school so he's busy.<br />
2 60-65 SKs.<br />
4 65 paladins<br />
5 60-65 druids. All with epic<br />
<br />
Tanking and healing isn't a problem but DPS can be seriously lacking when the rangers and wizzies don't show. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Recruiting / levelling up a Necro or two and some rogues with SoS would help immensely with those CRs and raiding in general.<br />
<br />
Add Statue into that list of stuff to kill.   If you can do Vindy, statue IMO.  You just have to have heavy healing up front until you get him slowed, but from there it's cake.  Take a shot at Tormax if you can find him up too, good stuff to be had there.  <br />
<br />
For a taste of harder Luclin stuff give IV a shot.  It's not a hard mob once you get the strat down, but it does require your raid to all be paying attention.  One stray melee or caster can bring a ton of hurt onto your raid there, so it's a learning experience.  <br />
<br />
You might also wanna start taking some shots at NToV mobs when you have a decent raid force online.  Ikatiar and Eashen then Aaryonar once you have little problem with the first 2 and on to the rest of NToV once you down Roy.<br />
<br />
Rhag 1 &amp; 2 probably would be easy enough for you and could net some copies of RGC which will be needed as you get into Luclin.<br />
<br />
You're at a point right now where there are probably a TON of targets that would be a decent challenge and net you upgrades for your guildmates.  Recruit some rogues/necros or level some up or whatever, but do it either way.  They'll make those CRs a WHOLE LOT more bearable and faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitly get some necros.  CR in ToV becomes simple, all you need to do is summon corpse to zone in.  Rogues with SoS also make for simple CRs, but the cant drag to ZI in ToV.<br />
<br />
In addition to IV, try doing Evovled Burrorwer in AC (2 grps needed), Rumblecrush (not that hard, just Malo him while he is being pulled to ZI and then have him slowed any means necessary), Greig, Paffa in CoD (2 grps), along with BoT.<br />
<br />
What about looking to increase your raid days?  There will always be something up to kill and that will make it easier to recruit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also you may want to consider keying up for ST to get your melee's some prismatics.  That's what my guild is focused on while taking shots at BoT towers, luclin named, and PoP bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With only raiding once a week, as you stated, it's really important for the officers and the members to sit down and really discuss what they want out of the guild.  If you've got alot of members all with different goals, things could fall apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For other targets not yet mentioned, just so you don't burn out--Lcea Katta, Nathan Illumius (whatever his name is in Katta), Mujaki, Overseer, the pig farmer in PoTactics, Sont, Dain.<br />
<br />
If you're not in PoTactics, work on getting flagged through the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I were you, I would do the simplest step first. Toss in the wtov named and ikky/eashen. Keep your faction up with SoV for easy cr/setup. It doesn't look like your guild is going to raid every day, just those 5 mobs should add enough extra action without pressuring what seems like a laid back guild to be all raidy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With only raiding once a week, as you stated, it's really important for the officers and the members to sit down and really discuss what they want out of the guild.

<br />
I agree with this statement 100%, get everyone together and formulate some plans, also set some goals (where you want to be, what you want to be doing and set dates) and try to stick to the plan as much as possible.  Do everything you can to make the plan work, level up scouts, keep lists of when mobs go down, etc.  Its not easy and it takes a lot of work from a lot of people sometimes to make the plan work, be very specific about who needs to do what things.<br />
<br />
Rogues with SoS also make for simple CRs, but the cant drag to ZI in ToV. <br />
<br />
I drag to zone in any time from anywhere in ToV, just drag everyone to the ledge, zone out and run back to ledge and continue dragging.  SoS rogues make just about every CR easy, and the entire raid doesnt have to be in the zone and grouped with the necro, its a lot less painless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Walruss is on the money - concentrate on getting Sleepers keys.<br />
<br />
If it is too much work to key everyone (and it probably is), just concentrate on your melee classes - just key enough other classes to keep em alive. Primal weapons for your core melee classes will nake the progression so much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">His original post mentioned key droppers so I am guessing his guild is already keying up for ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well actually it only mentions Zlandicar, which has other nice loot besides the ST key.</div></div><hr />
