<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Sony went back and changed it so now all the Affliction Foci only work with DoTs. No more slows, snares, roots, cripples, etc. I am kind of hot about this. <br />
<br />
Great, so tell me again what the point of Affliction Foci is now? I get better longer dots, save mana on dots, and cast faster dots. Great, but um, I don't cast these all that much in raids or xp groups (if I am the sole healers). I feel jipped.<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />

Read about it here. (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5014)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What total BS this is.  All the gear I sold and swapped to get affliction haste and effiicency.  I play an enchanter an it REALLY effects us.  Our mezzes/slow/charm IS ALL WE HAVE.  So basically we get NADA for foci that help our class any.  <br />
<br />
Its not overpowering for a wizard to nuke for over 20% more damage or a necro to save mana on a dot(their main ability), but I can't save a bit of mana on my WAY inflated mana costing mezz.  Total BS.  100% Unacceptable.<br />
<br />
They forgot to mention, haha, yeah ok.  Total cheese on this one.  They couldn't have mentioned A YEAR AGO that affliction wasn't going to work with mezz etc.  and it was a bug????  They haven't read the MILLIONS of post about what good foci to get for shamans and enchanters??  <br />
<br />
Verant you need to think about this change.  Is it really that bad??  Don't you think other classes deserve foci items too??</div></div><hr />
