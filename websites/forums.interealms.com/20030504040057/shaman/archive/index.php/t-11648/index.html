- Changed Strength of the Diaku to a single target strength and dexterity buff.<br />
- Changed Talisman of the Diaku to a group strength and dexterity buff. <br />
- Replaced the shaman spell Aim of the Ginda with Talisman of Alacrity, which is a group haste spell.<br />
- Replaced the shaman spell Talisman of the Gindan with Tiny Terror, which is a group shrink spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the key question is .... if you have Aim of the Ginda and Talisman of Gindan before patch, do you automatically get Tiny Terror and Talisman of Alacrity or you just lose 2 spectrals ?<br />
<br />
Group haste spell logically should last a lot longer than Swift like the Wind too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">36 min duration! Shamans are the new raid hasters.<br />
<br />
Patch also changed Pure Blood quest reward for Shamans to Blood of Nadox, which is a group cure spell. Disinfecting aura is back to its original effect -- faintly better than Pure Blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bathemael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had both Gindan spells banked prior to the patch and when i logged on they have automatically been changed to Tiny Terror and Talisman of Alacrity.  The Diaku spells are indeed stacking with Focus of Souls.<br />

<br />
Patch also changed Pure Blood quest reward for Shamans to Blood of Nadox, which is a group cure spell. Disinfecting aura is back to its original effect -- faintly better than Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, let me get this straight.  Disinfecting Aura now removes both Disease and Poison like it used to, and the new spell Blood of Nadox is a group cure of what?<br />
<br />
And is Pure Blood still in the game?  This one is the same as the old Disinfecting Aura, with slightly different mana costs or cast time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pure blood is still in the game and Blood of Nadox is a group Pure Blood(-18 poison and disease counters for everyone in the group).  Like all of the other new group buffs we got, it suffers from the limitation of not being tgb-able or mgb-able but it still is better than the alternative..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So now the question is can I get both Pure Blood and Blood of Nadox if I have not done the quest already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No. Shamans now get the Blood of Nadox spell from the Pure Blood quest. Druids and Clerics still get the Pure Blood spell from the same quest. It isn't decided yet what to do with Shamans who already scribed Pure Blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Talisman of Alacrity is, for me anyway, self only. THAT SUCKS!! Send in those bug reports!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Talisman of Alacrity is, for me anyway, self only. THAT SUCKS!! Send in those bug reports!<br />
<br />
They already know. It has been fixed on Test. <br />
Guess we will probably see it Live next patch...</div></div><hr />

Is this intended or does anyone know if this will be changed to behave more like the 60- spells?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard that this is indeed what they intended.  Or else I don't see any point of wasting 2 spectral parchment on 2 spells that increase about the same amount of str/dex of my lvl 39 buffs. =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oshbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I heard that this is indeed what they intended.  Or else I don't see any point of wasting 2 spectral parchment on 2 spells that increase about the same amount of str/dex of my lvl 39 buffs. =b<br />
<br />
The amount of Str/dex is the same as focus of souls, this is increased over Focus of spirit by like a hand wave.<br />
<br />
Old version of diaku did NOT stack with FoSouls. Made it a completely useless spell. (one of 4), glad there is only 2 left  now.<br />
<br />
If they are stacking I assume they will take them out. I don't remember any str/dex buffs in our line that was ever entended to stack with HoS/FoS line.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Str/Dex of Diaku is half what Focus gives, so apparently they are intended to stack.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Diaku: Str+45, Dex+34, 63 min, group<br />
Strength of the Diaku: Str+35, Dex+28, 72 min, single<br />
stacks with everything except Rabid Bear<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh: HP+544, Str+75, Dex+70, 80 min, group<br />
Focus of Soul: HP+544, Str+75, Dex+70, 80 min, single<br />
<br />
Looks annoying having two separate stackable buffs that affect the same stats. Nice that they combine Str and Dex together into one buff, but now it's back to two buffs again. Aarrgghh.</div></div><hr />
