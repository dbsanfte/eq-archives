<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A helm dropped in Cazic yesterday, Shaman only. I don't remember the exact name but it has basically the same stats as a SS helm except 4 less ac, svp instead of magic, and has 45hps. Also, it looks red and is a cap and looks hella lame in the new models. So....if you had a SS helm already but needed hps for cann 5, would you wear it? I hate losing the ac and the mr and it looks soooooooo lame. I guess I could stay in bear form all the time.<br />
<br />
next question, I have been playing around with the chetari wardstaff. Anyone use this much? It procs knockback which seems like it could be useful to interrupt casters. Does it work on any mob? Will it interrupt if you are just blasting something into a wall? It seems to blast things pretty far so could be deterimental rather than helpful on a raid because then the melee have to re-orient and by the time they get back on it, it might could cast again anyway. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, I'd wear the helm.  No, knockback won't inturrupt a caster if the caster doesn't move.  OT: What does your sig mean?  I've always kinda wondered what that quote is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">would seem to be a joke on tatterback apes (bw right? or ej, or both, whatever)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">45hp &gt; 4ac<br />
<br />
Yes I'd wear it over SS, I refuse to use up gems on an SS helm, it's not a great piece for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to hijack the thread, but I had some questions about this staff and 2 others.<br />
<br />
For solo'ing purposes, which would be a better choice?<br />
<br />
Granite Face Grinder 29dmg 36delay 10str/10wis/10int<br />
<br />
Staff of Living Sand 24dmg 42delay 4ac/wis/sta 40mana procs smothering sand dex/agi debuff and 140dmg dot<br />
<br />
Chetari Wardstaff<br />
<br />
Right now I'm using the Living sand staff as it only weighs 1.0 and I don't lose all my stam from swinging it compared to the gfg.  The proc is pretty nice.  25 damage initally and the rest of the damage is done within 1 min.(or there about)<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 28 right now, so I'm anxious to see how much more damage the gfg will do once I hit 30.<br />
<br />
But looking at the Wardstaff, it looks pretty nice.  Could use the knockback to root the mob and blast him a few times before he gets back to me.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When Kunark was first released we spent WAY to much time in Burning Woods.  Of course we then spent lots of time in Emerald Jungle.   He always teased the puller, which back then was me, about those Apes when the inc message was given.<br />
<br />
I think the apes warped my poor LB... naw he was already slightly cracked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shameless bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go with the HPs if you can.  What is your overall gear picture?   Is taking off the wolfcallers helm going to put you just under 1000ac, or 1100ac?   For me the decision to wear HP item in the head slot was the difference between 1875hp and 1925hp or 1005ac or 1012ac.   The HP difference is clearly more important with canni5.<br />
<br />
I wear the Circlet of the Falinkan, because of a botched up MQ I ended up with it.<br />
<br />
Circlet of Falinkan: +12 AC, +7 Str, +5 Dex, +5 Wis, +5 Int, +5 vsMg, +5 vsFire, +5 vsCold, +50 HP, +75 Mana - now has afflicition spell haste 3 focus effect.<br />
<br />
Now with the focus effect this is slightly more valuable to me.  However, if I found another hat with same HPs or even slightly less and much better AC I would bag the circlet except when casting Bane and Pox.<br />
<br />
Also--Our warrior wears a hideous salmon pink colored raldukan helm because it has nice HPs.  I think funny hats add character.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have Stronghorns horn, which also procs knockback.<br />
<br />
Ive used this pretty much in Sirens Grotto, thinking it would interupt their gating. Ive knocked back sirens at least 10feet, but they are not interupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would go with the 65 hps.  Except for the fact that you said it was ugly.  To me 65 hp &gt; 4 ac.  But 65 hp &lt; 4ac + looking good.</div></div><hr />
