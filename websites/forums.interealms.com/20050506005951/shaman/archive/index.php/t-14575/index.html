<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so I tried to log on just now, and before it even got to the auto patcher it says &quot;could not establish connection&quot;, check your network connection or contact sony@waitfor30buisnessdaysforanautomatedresponseandthatisouronlytechsupport.com&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet... I am posting here. My internet connection is fine. And in fact, my other computer which was running my trader mule had stayed on Tunare (my server) connected the whole time... I just cant seem to get past the patch server it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem? I'm supposed to be raiding...</div></div><hr />
