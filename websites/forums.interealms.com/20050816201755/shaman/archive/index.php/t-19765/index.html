<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this on alla Muramite Linked Armour (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26113) .<br />
<br />
gear for time and ele equiped players i expect . would it be an upgrade for you time / ele folk or a waste of 'time' so to speak  :p <br />
Shame the only way lower players can get armour this nice is by getting carpel tunnel vision in LDoN.<br />
<br />
quest text garb (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2719) perhaps the new velious armour .. /shrug - just here to post what i know<br />
<br />
for anyone who like's yeast products on toast  &gt; my mate muramite !!!!!<br />
<br />
sorry had to ghet that in b4 someone else did .. i know . very poor  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
ohh on another note , i feel very bitter about Sony tm ' the ultimate in wisdom ' providing the only useful shaman god spell in Ancient form .. As if we havent paid enough of our time hitting the same canny key over and over again for 65 levles and lots of aa's ( at least bards get to hit other keys aswell :p) .. kinda winds me up &gt;&gt; hoping for changes or am quitting and goin out into the big wide world and getting a life , along with a new girlfriend , posh car , fat slag of a missus and a few other things that have been missing since i found i could hotkey canny dance (hohohoho /sarcasm off )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The stats are pretty much identical to an elemental bracer.  If the BP is of similar quality it would be of interest even to the time player, everything else is rotware once you're past phase 3 of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bp maybe, otherwise it looks an awful lot like a clone of ele armor to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Allakhazam's says it is dropped in Ferubi.  I don't think it is quested because it is not class specific.  After what they did with ornate and EP armor, I would expect them to make each piece of armor individually tailored for the class receiving it (i.e. why put 15atk on a shaman bracer)<br />
<br />
Either way, though, it looks nice.  I hope it is something that can be obtained from 1-grouping or a small BoT-towers style raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From the way the quest is described, the link above is the STARTING point for the quest armor, so the final quest result should be definitely above elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that would be an interesting approach if the starting piece is a really good piece of gear like that that you upgrade via the quest combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">are you saying you can't use more atk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guys... thats a COMPONENT of the new armor. Its like the equivalent of the unadorned/decayed armor from Thurg/Kael/Halls of Testing</div></div><hr />

If it comes from Ferubi it is allmost certainly from the raid mobs there. I doubt it would be one groupable.<br />

Btw, last night was the first non-raid night we had, so I had a chance to putter around natimbi for a while. A couple of the mobs dropped &quot;armor&quot; and I'm pretty sure that one of them was &quot;muramite vambraces&quot;, or something like that. I'll have to check when I get home. I also got two shoulder pieces (dented pauldrons or something like that). Both types were tradeable, no stats, and merchants offered the same price (~2gp). I'm betting that these are the components for the armor quests, which implies that the armor is likely relatively low level, nothing like the ferubi drop.</div></div><hr />
