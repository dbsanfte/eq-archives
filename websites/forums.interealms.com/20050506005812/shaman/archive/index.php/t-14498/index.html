<br />
Well, at least I'm not the only one. Been playing since July of 99 and still never killed Vox or Nagafen. A druid guildie and I did go with a group on a Nagafen raid once, but after the 30th retard trained lava duct crawlers to the assembly area because they were trying to catch up, we both said fek it and ported out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you're missing being a n00b.  Why else would anyone miss FP faction?  It's so easy to jet to damn near any city nowadays, that FP is a real non-starter.  And Vox/Naggy?  When did you start raiding?  How many peeps 52- had a CLUE about how to properly raid and maintain raid dscipline?  Usually, those raids were clunky messes that ended in total disasters.  I killed Naggy three times, but never finished off Vox.<br />
<br />
If ou liked those dragons, go beat on their bigger clones, Gore and WuSushi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually woushi isn't naggies clone.. she's a poison dragon.. Talendor in Skyfire is the nagggy clone.. also ragefire :p<br />
<br />
anyway, my guild likes to kill naggy, I think we've killed him 3 times.. still haven't tried vox... we like killing these cause every other dragon that pops on the server is ganked by a group of 3 within minutes :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya Rodahn ... I hear you on having regrets.   The most painful to me is building relationships with people and then watching them burn out or/and weird out.   Second is the numerous guilds I've seen from in and outside complete fall apart over stupid things ( mostly greed ).<br />
<br />
I don't think some are getting the point on a couple of the things you listed.    Changing faction that can't be corrected does limit each Avatar's ability to interact with the game.   So what if you can create another charactor ... for some people each charactor is a &quot;work in progress&quot; creation based on careful thought and planning.   <br />
<br />
One suggestion on doing Vox/Naggy raids.  My guild enjoys doing Vox/Naggy runs with our Dragon Alts.   We have a team of lvl 52 alt's that are only used for doing these dragons.   It's been very interesting to build my alt's for this purpose with gear and spells.   We have also had great fun doing them with small groups struggling in some cases near death on both sides ( Dragon -vs- team ).   6 people standing up to a Dragon for the first time is a interesting feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Eh, everyone has to learn to crawl from time to time. And there little more exciting than your first big kill. Granted, I killed nagafen and vox for first time around kunark's release, so perhaps I have a bit fonder memories since there was little bigger than those two. And yes, I have a few bad memories, like getting to nagafens lair and there being no damn dragon there (HOW many ranfgers and druids and bards were on that raid?!), and &quot;THE VOX&quot;, that tore the server a new one for an entire week... and wiped dozens of raids. My corpse was under her for a day i think before people said enough, and grabbed their pitchforks and torches and nailed her. Wasnt so fun at the time, but make amusing stories to tell in retrospect.<br />
<br />
My regrets<br />
Not gm'ing smithing on my dark elf before the ethereal brick nerf (or berfore in fine plate). Got a few last points on Flabbo the easy way, started on the inky, and said screw it. Now half my guild and lots of my pals are dark elves... could have hooked them up, and made a mint from tons of others. <br />
<br />
Not making my bl a female troll. White beehive &gt;&gt;&gt; all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe not quitting the first time around and restarting on a new server, but if I hadn't of done that, I doubt I would be still playing anyway because I was lost the first time around.<br />
<br />
I sorta wasted my starting points after I put the first ones into WIS, but that's not a huge deal.  Although I wouldn't mind the extra STA right about now.</div></div><hr />

Instead of playing other classes I could have had my shammy in his 60's with some nice AA's.

Bah screw this dang thread for bringing it back up these regrets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I regret letting people bother me in the guilds I was in.  I've been in 7-8 decent guilds with one or another of my toons (leveled a druid to 51, then retired her and leveled a cleric to 56, then started shammy).<br />
<br />
I always let people whine to me in tells about them not getting loot, then I would stick up for them in /gu and get my ass handed back to me, and would deguild.  Or I would be chatting with an officer and have 3 other officers sent me tells to stop yelling at the other officer (/boggle) and I would deguild.  Or a guild leader would tell me to camp my shaman out of a group that I formed so that her boyfriend could play and I would deguild.<br />
<br />
I need a guild that just raids and does the occasional exp groups with friend guildies and there's none of the dramatic bullsh!t.<br />

<br />

<br />
That's exactly what my guild is =] The only bad thing is expect to raid A LOT like 5 days a week 3 hours a day.. if you can handle something like that join a high level guild and you'll see, no whining, no complaining, no one is an ass. People want xp, and they know their guildies are &gt; other people out there so guild groups a plenty. and last side note, I've seen where if there is a cleric/shaman/warrior, most people go for dps, but my guild /gu any dps available if no one responds they then look for other guildies that are bad at dps to join, the success of a guild is not the individual but the whole guild and they understand that...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Regrets...hmmm.  I regret letting my roommate have access to my shaman when I was at level 10 cause he gave his brother (level 8 necro) my Spine Chill Spear who instead of giving it back to me, gave it to his pet.  I regret not being able to remember and talk to all of my old friends who helped me out before I switched servers.<br />
<br />
As far as best choices in game that I ever made...there is a few.  Start off with creating my shaman.  Leaving my family guild to join a bigger raiding guild..and even though this guild would soon merge with another guild...this led the path to where I'm at today.  I'm glad that I left that guild to merge with the other one when some of the members decided to not move and instead rebuild.  I'm glad that instead of moving to the Legends server like I almost did...the server transfer came up and I moved (I was on the AB server and being on American times I was never going to be able to raid with any decent guild and see the stuff that I wanted to).  I'm glad that I was able to get into a good guild when I moved and able to see up to all of the elementals in two short months.<br />
<br />
EQ been very good to me in the year that I've been playing.  Can't really say that I have many regrets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My other regret is never meeting anyone in the game in real life.  I have such good friends in EQ and would love if they all just lived down the road and we could all go chill out after a raid and have some beers.   Often times I log off and feel alone cuz i'm off at my new job 3hours away from all my rl friends and I don't know anyone here and the people at work are all old (40+...sorry old people...but 40+ is old to us 21 year olds)... so i dunno...<br />

<br />
Ro- You don't know how may times I have been badgered by guildies to come up killing in PoG.  I always told them that at least a few of us should keep Tunare faction.<br />
<br />
I also stayed 52 for weeks while trying to get in on a successful Naggy AND Vox raid, thank goodness AA points had been established by that time. ( Even though I start my Shaman soon after the game went live, I have taken a number of 2-3 month vacations from EQ so I have leveled slowly)</div></div><hr />

By the way, for people who talk about Vox and Nagafen as &quot;noob&quot; stuff, I submit that you are a  noob if you never did them. The people's coattails you have ridden on during EQ learned by doing &quot;noob&quot; stuff like Vox and naggy when you were itches in your Barbarian daddy's pants. Vox was a serious pain in the ass back in the day when hardly anyone was level 50, took as much skill as 30 10,000 hp people assaulting some poor goddess' panties.<br />

This might or might not sound fast lvling to you but all i did was pretty much level. No quests, no raids, just level. Now that im 61 i don't know NEARLY as much as some 55ish people about zones/mobs/quests. Just to let all of you out there know, Its NOT just about lvling. Just take the time to sit back and enjoy it, do a quest, makes some friends, go to a raid even if you need nothing there. Its fun!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">biggest regret is that my old HD crashed 2 weeks ago before i could backup ANY of my data, losing thousands of EQ memory pictures in the process... from level 1 to level 65, from west freeport to the plane of fire, from crushbone to ntov, from kedge keep to sleeper's tomb, all those good times i had, all the pictures, a mere pile of bits and bytes on a dead HD now  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">No regrets.  There's thing I wish I had done, things I wish I hadn't done but I will never regret them and never let myself regret them.  Remember, We do what we do because of who we are and if we were to do otherwise we would not be ourselves.</div></div><hr />

Regrets? hmmm, let me think on that one. Prolly my only regret is (and only Torv peeps would understand this one (I think)) my not kicking Ninja's (Mariela's) ass in RL.</div></div><hr />

Not putting my beginning pts. into wisdom on my FIRST shaman.<br />
<br />
Quitting my 1st shaman, to correct this to mistake; now wisdom doesn't really matter anyway *smacks forehead*<br />
<br />
Playing for over 3 years and only being lvl 61 with 14 AAs<br />
<br />
Not putting people higher level than me that had only been playing for 2 months on ignore when they acted all superior and tell me how to play the game.<br />
<br />
Not doing MORE vox/naggy raids, i did my share, but only a few<br />
<br />
MY lack of guildage through most of my character's history<br />
<br />
All those hours i spent looting shields off of dead ogre guards on my first ogre shm, back when ppl killed ogr guards for exp. hehe.  I made 300 plat off those things, thought i was the richest bastard ever( i was only like lvl 5 ).<br />
<br />
Not going after the inkie mask.<br />
<br />
Well thats all i can think of right now!</div></div><hr />
