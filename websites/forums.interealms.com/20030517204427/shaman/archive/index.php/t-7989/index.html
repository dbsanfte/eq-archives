<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rarra09</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just need alil confirmation if I'm on the right track here.<br />
I'm pretty sure the next things I'll be needing will be no drop from wherever.<br />
<br />
I've been a dirty lurker for almost a year now and appreciate all the knowledge provided here. <br />
<br />
Thx for your time and any inputs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you peek at my dream profile?<br />
<br />
/whine on<br />
/cry Why can't I have equipment like this? /sniffle<br />
/whine off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd be a bit worried about hp in the long-term - you have a lot of items there with no hp at all, e.g. legs and arms. AC vs HP is always a tough call though. Generally looking good other than that :) Others can give better advice than me, I'm still a newbie :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you have plat and are looking to upgrade, here is what I would do: sandwich of foul smelling herbs for range slot, I never saw much point in the gantru charm. Hardened Grey flesh sleeves, barbed dragonscale booties, heiro cloak, barbed rubicite hat, smoothmetal torque/velium bs/7-6-30 talisman or something decent for your neck unless you really need whatever focus it gives. If you can find them, Veteran's Chain Leggings drop in PON and are damn nice legs(29ac 45hp/mana some wis and sta etc) or barbed ringmail legs.<br />
<br />
That would give you a nice chunk of hps while keeping your ac close to what it is now and only giving up a little mana. <br />
<br />
Dont forget to get your epic :)<br />
<br />
After those you will be moving to mostly no drop type things or things that are quite expensive like lizard ears and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice gear, you have some very expensive stuff... <br />
<br />
Girdle of Mithandrael, DROOL. Ok, I want that. 45 more hp than my spider fur (I get 3 hp per sta point), plus 10 wis? Want, want, want! (Pity I am broke from buying malo)<br />
<br />
My profile:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=419952<br />
<br />
It says your god is Tunare, but if you're a cat, how is that possible?<br />
<br />
Two things about my magelo... <br />
1) I am 2 pieces away from my 8th shawl, which will add 74 hp to my profile and zephyr of brell (EE IV), so the shawl is not a waste of a shoulder slot <br />
2) I am 1 piece away from the circlet of the falukaen (Damn you vilefang), that will add another 50 hp, ish, plus more wis and affliction haste.<br />
<br />
I have my eyes on some SS armour... I want SS arms and legs and boots and bp. Been on 9 ToV raids, no chain has dropped besides bracer. Sigh.<br />
<br />
My main weekness is my bp and my arms... bp is only Barbed Ringmail, and arms are just +20 hp. I'm having trouble finding quests/or mobs of my guild's strength to replace these items with. If only the ToV dragons would hear my prayers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rarra09</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your input guys.<br />
<br />
Yea, it's hard to find a balance between hp/ac. So I'll take a few of those ideas into consideration.<br />
<br />
The necklace I like though, has EE3 on it which keeps me away from my buffing duties alil longer.<br />
<br />
As far as being a Tunarian Kitty Shammy, well, I am.<br />
Started off on Sullon Zek hell after a long break from EQ.<br />
(Can't be agnostic w/ the 3 teams on that server, religon based teams)<br />
Now I'm wandering around on Stormhammer. Weee~! Well, I'm having fun. Thats all that counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe<br />
<br />
You<br />
1591 hp<br />
2747 mana<br />
938   ac<br />
<br />
Me<br />
1816 hp<br />
2548 mana<br />
939   ac<br />
<br />
It's liked we swapped our hp and mana over each other.  :D <br />
<br />
What Slargg said, and maybe a heiro cloak instead of the turtle shield.<br />
<br />
/envy fungi<br />
<br />
Where's fungus patch vest from exactly anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rarra09</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea, gonna work on HP big time now. Mana pool can spare enough.<br />
<br />
Vest is from a quest in Fungus Grove here: <br />
Kill da beasties quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1570)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, read the guide.  Do you get the &quot;rewards&quot; after you kill all of the waves, or wha?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rarra09</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres a chance when handing in the 'spawning' items, that a named mob can appear in one of the waves. These are what drop the loot.</div></div><hr />
