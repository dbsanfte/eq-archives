<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qatrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering where the best place to level a 58 shaman would be if he was duoing with a 66 ranger. Now that I have the new Kragg's mending spell I was hoping a few places would open up. I know Griegs end is an option but I am looking for the best one.<br />

I did most of 60-65 in Plane of Justice on death row down near Mauvain.  Steady XP and the cash drops worked out well in the long run.</div></div><hr />
