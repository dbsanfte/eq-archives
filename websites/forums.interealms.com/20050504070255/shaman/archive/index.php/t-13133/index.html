<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like the title says. I carry my toys around with me in a rallic pack (Tae Ew hammer, Barb Spiritists hammer, and a REIF). I was poking around in CT yesterday with a pally friend, and I we set up camp in the maze. I summoned petpet and proceded to hand him some FS weaps I'd been carrying around in my rallic pack as well. First up was a FS sword, then I handed him a FS spear - or so I thought. The second I pressed 'give', I realised that I'd just forked over my REIF to my dog.... /cry! It was no catastrophe, as I can get another one but man did I feel like an idiot!<br />
Has anyone else done this? Please? Anyone?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">reminds me of the time when I was level 10 my roommate gave my Spine Chill Spear to his brother's necro to look at.  All of us being new at the game..didn't really know what we were doing, except for the fact that we had a RL friend who had given us half of our equipment.  So, his brother went to give it back to my roommate and gave it to his pet.  We have a nice screenshot of his pet carrying around my spear till the bastard went LD before we could figure out a way to get it back.  <br />
<br />
Oh..and was I pissed.  I went around for 15 levels using almost nothing as a weapon because of it.  Still to this day I hold it over his head what he did to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However...<br />
<br />
The other day I made a Xanthe's Earring in the forge, and I'm pretty sure I put it back in the forge instead of in my pack. :(<br />
<br />
I got all the way to Rebecca in Fungus Grove, then spent a panicked few moments searching all my packs. I sprinted back to the forge, but there was nothing there. People were in and out using it though, so I guess someone had a lucky surprise.<br />
<br />
It was late and I was tired, so I suppose it taught me not to stay online when my concentration starts to slide. But it was a painful lesson. :(</div></div><hr />

If you leave a no-drop item in a public tradeskill combiner it will disable the &quot;close&quot; button *but* if you walk out of range the item poofs.  That was the compromise of having no-drop tradeskill components without letting players use forges and ovens to exchange no-drop items.<br />
<br />
I know a guy who lost his no-drop Val-shir smithing tools because he stepped too far away.<br />

<br />
Nope, that doesn't work.  Summoned pets don't leave corpses.  (although someone can give a charmed pet weapons, break charm, kill it and loot them back).</div></div><hr />

On a more recent note, I gated out of a raid last night with my handy dandy gate-to-bind potion.  *scream*  It looks EXACTLY like my 5-pack of gnome illusion.   /sigh<br />
<br />
Not quite a REIF, but still embarrassing as all get out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favorite joke now is, &quot;Why did Goner cross the road?&quot; &quot;Dunno, why?&quot;  &quot;I don't know eitehr, but he looked good riding your horse . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
He petitioned twice, though, and did get it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd ask again about that money you gave to a banker..I made 7k once MQ'ing a SS bracer (hey..he offered.  Who am I to correct him?).  I was SO excited since it was about 3x what I thought it was worth that I gave the money to the banker instead of banking it. It was like 3am and i was exhausted.<br />
<br />
I /petitioned and wrote a note on EQlive.  The next morning (saturday) I /petitioned again when i saw a real GM online.  Five minutes later the GM asked me to tell him what happened.  I explained what had happened, and that I had written a petition on the website.<br />
<br />
After 5 minutes of silence my trade window opened and there was my 7k..no GM just a trade window.  Must be nice to be outside the Matrix.  The GM /told me this was a one-time deal, and to be more careful in the future.<br />
<br />
Sometimes things work out..keep trying.</div></div><hr />

Yep, they both did. What I think I did is click on a forge slot rather than a backpack slot, thus putting them back in the forge..? Is that not possible?<br />
<br />
I didn't realise know they'd poof if you walked away. What a waste. :( I can see why though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Destroyed my Spear of Fate instead of a fishing spear. Didn't realise until 3 hours later, soloing in PoI. <br />

/gu Oh *£&quot;$!!!<br />
<br />
Got it back about 4 hours after that, after sending an email to the server GM on EQLive and petitioning. I was under water talking to good old Abe at the time. I already have a tear in the bank for a future MQ, although I don't have the faction yet, so figured I'd just go through the thing again. Was very pleasantly surprised at the quick, no nonsense and friendly response. She did tell me not to do it again though! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When I did the Stoicism turn in I buffed up before handing the rock back to the indifferent spirit.  I had DogDog standing next to me buffed up and ready to turn Flotsom and Jetsom to fish bate, but when I handed in the rock...  Nothing Happened!?!?<br />
<br />
So I petitioned, and 4 hours later when the GM arrived on the scene he handed back my rock and said, &quot;This time read the name of the NPC you're handing it too and don't give it to your pet ;)&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope I never have to watch Goner pass a &quot;Rock&quot; again.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">SK friend of mine gave her pet her MoSS back in the days they ran about 7k. not remembering that, I loaned her my Ikky breastplate so she could use it to regen when FD'd during bad pulls. recently she decided she was leaving the game, so wanted to give it back. We were in Katta, and after making sure neither she nor I had a pet up,  she traded it to. . . the necro sitting in the corner, who promptly then passed the BP to HIS pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">After I got my epic, I spent time killing the darkpaw gnolls. I went to sell all the FS from them and I accidently sold my REIF. Didn't notice till the next time  I got online and went looking for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well lets see here...embarrassing? After camping the Tormented Vah Shir skulls (Sheild of Bane Warding quest) for around 16 hours straight (watched the entire Star Wars trilogy and Alien 1-3 LOL) and getting some guildies to help in Katta for the 8 reanimated spawn, I decided to go do the turnin in Grimling. Now, since I had been nipping on the bubbly, oh, ALL DAY...i decide &quot;well, I'm a shaman, I can solo these guys.&quot; the result...... *LOADING....PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
Then , just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, and after camping the 8 skulls AGAIN...and killing the 8 reanimated AGAIN....I forgot to combine the skulls in the crate, handed it to Roshawna and she gave it back to me......empty. At this point I cannot believe my monitor survived the ordeal, rather than being smashed in a million pieces on my floor.<br />
<br />
However, after several /petitions and an e-mail or two, I was given the skulls back...and was given a pretty good reprimanding by the GM, which of course made me snicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, I emailed Sony, figuring it couldn't hurt. Got an email from GM Teatraux saying he's checked the logs and I had left it in the forge. He returned it for me. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jhael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Sorry to hear that Spritabe, thats just poor customer service.  They are either too lazy to check logs or being mean.  Ive worked in customer service for a long time and anyone with half a brain knows that the value of a customers future business is worth more than one transaction.  Thats why you can return any food item your not happy with and get a new one or your money back.  Most department stores will take returns, no questions asked.  So why in the world would a company not give you an item that you lost, that costs them nothing to replace...  You could just let this go, but if you have some free time on your hands, I would go ovr the GM's head.<br />

I should have realized something was wrong if I'd been watching since I doubt the vendor gave me as much for the Ikky as for the plate BPs :(<br />

I go, get all his Really Nice Stuff, and he warns me how rare some of it is...especially Ivander's Hoop.<br />
