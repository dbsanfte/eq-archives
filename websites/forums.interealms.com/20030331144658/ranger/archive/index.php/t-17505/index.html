<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vindikael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard the arguement go back and forth of what weap you should put in primary and what you should keep in offhand. <br />
<br />
What I have been lead to believe is that in your primary you should have a fast hitting / low delay weapon. In your offhand you should have a heavy hitter. As you can see from my magelo profile that is how I have my character setup. <br />
<br />
Could people who maybe have parsed this or know from experience .. anything like that ..  what is the best setup; please drop some advice.<br />
<br />
Edit| I mostly solo so I dont know if it makes a difference if grouping or soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At your level, you may do slightly more damage with the weapons switched. It depends on things like your Dual Wield %age and the MR of the mobs, but that will tend to be low. This isn't necessarily a big difference, though.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep the LSoEE in your off-hand, I'd get a Jagged Blade of Mourning for primary. They go really cheap, and you'll do more damage with it than you will with the Lammy until you are well into your 50s and have more haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damage Ratio is what you want in the second hand - not high DMG.<br />

<br />
The difference when soloing is that you don't have to worry about aggro management - only damage output. This means that procs are actually good, and you shouldn't fear using fast weapons and high haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Takamatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, Ive found faster weapons in the off hand do more damage.  I used to time my kills solo, and now I parcer them ,and with my equipment it still holds true.  Fast weapons with a not so great ratio, like the barbed scale whip, have out damaged ones that are slower but have a better ratio.  I wonder if that's because the speed of the weapon some what conpensates for lack of proficiency in the off hand, but end result being more damage with the weapons I tested.  Swiftwind does out damage and I have been using that as to date, but it was a lot of fun testing weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">typically, you put the low dly weapon in your primary at higher levels bc of your high dmg bonus.  it doesn't matter so much for your offhand bc there is no dmg bonus for the secondary.<br />
<br />
hence, low dly primary and good ratio secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Note that the above poster said &quot;at higher levels&quot; . . .<br />
<br />
At lower levels, you want a good ratio in both hands, and to heck with the low delay; because either you don't ahve a damage bonus or its not large enough to be significant.</div></div><hr />
