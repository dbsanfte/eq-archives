<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i can't seem to go anywhere without running into another shaman. not that i'm complaining, just it makes getting groups harder in PoP. on my server , it seems that thier are more shaman out there than even druids these days. i know PoP has been the reason that most people have started shamans (mobs must be slowed), but i can't believe that shaman got so popular , so soon. the question is &quot;is this a bad thing?&quot; unfortunatly i think it might be. a eq guide friend told me that one of the reasons monks were nerfed was that &quot;they were too dam popular, everyone had one twinked out, and they tanked too well.&quot; while i hate nerfs of any class, i never am suprised when a class gets hit with the nerf bat. could shaman be the next victim if they get &quot;too popular?&quot;<br />
<br />
what's everone's view of the most popular and least popular classes today.<br />
mine view is<br />
most pop...<br />
sham<br />
dru<br />
monk ( many have quite so they prob aren't in top 3 anymore)<br />
<br />
least pop.....<br />
cleric<br />
enchanter<br />
bard <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree.  I cant walk through Halas anymore with out getting begged for money/items/buffs from at least 2 new shaman with names like Suprslowr and Drgnsolor.<br />
<br />
Its a pain to sit in the Nexus/bazaar for longer than 10 secs because of all the frogs hopping around.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Just like the monk craze, this too will pass.  VI will continue to give poor upgrades and lukewarm support, and all but the truly dedicated will eventually move to the next &quot;neat&quot; class.  <br />
<br />
My money is on that next class being Beastlords.  Ive already seen some shaman here say they are gonna go to the darkside, so its only a matter of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on my server there seems to be a huge shortage of clerics. I'm not sure what it is but it's like they all dissapeared. Whenever I form a new group, I usually have to wait like an hour just for a cleric to come online who will join, regardless of where we're going or who's in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha, this is really quite annoying, in my guild (UK) we had a period of having a horrifying number of shaman turn up to everything (Most raids were 6+ shaman and at a few we actually broke the 10+ shaman mark) and it basically brought me to the brink of quiting through pure boredom at raids as I had maxed h2h was tempted to bring along tradeskills materials so I actually had something to do.  Instead I took a short raid afk and leveled a cleric up so I would have a useful backup character to play, lo and behold, I get the cleric to a raid useful state and suddenly we have 101 bloody clerics and the guilds suffering from lack of shaman.  I should have pl'd a wizzy instead =(</div></div><hr />

maybe you see so many shamans in those zones because we are all stuck in like 4 zones to get XP in. At least after you hit lvl 62+.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild, too, Sebazy.  For a while we were treehugger heavy (druids, rangers), then tank heavy (wars, pals, with a few sk), but now it seems we/they're all shaman.  Which isn't a bad thing, per se, but it kinda makes you feel useless.<br />
<br />
But hey, at least I'm capping all my melee skills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shaman class has always been popular on Karana, especially barbies. It's even worse today because of all the froggy shaman. I swear at least 50% of the peeps in my guild have a froggy shaman alt now in their mid 20s and leveling rapidly. Most of them have melee mains who get tired of LFG for hours on end and have seen how shaman are both excellent soloers and always wanted in groups so I kind of understand why they are doing it. Especially if you can twink a shammy with nice equipment and have the funds for KEI making you a great soloer from day one.  I sure couldn't solo very well back in the days of crappy equipment till I was 40ish.<br />
<br />
However Leetlords are slowly getting more popular too hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been noticing this too...Seems like shaman is the new bandwagon class. PoP brought a greater &quot;need&quot; for shaman and it seems they are easier to twink now with all the new shaman wearable items. I'm not crazy about all the PLing, but we will have to get used to it.</div></div><hr />

i think it's just the frog thing, you have to pick one class and a lot of people picked shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I semi retired my monk - changed to shaman - and am extremely happy.  Very balanced and strong class no wonder it is popular.  I too see a lot of shamans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the up side is that many of these Shaman are PLed and not very good.  This makes the skillful Shaman look that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild is a small guild, probably 20 ppl average. 7 of them Shaman level 50+. I have noticed on Karana there is a severe lack of enchanters willing to do anything but sit in nexus selling KEI. I can't tell you the number of raids that have been cancelled because of the lack of enchanters around. They are either level 20 or all level 65.</div></div><hr />

I hear that.  Tho I wonder how many are name changes of ebayed chars that have been around forever?  Shaman isn't the easiest class in the world to PL.  Not unless you have access to a high level necro or enchanter or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zybann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My main has always been my cleric who is 65 w/ 71 aa's. Although i have many alts &gt;52, the cleric was always my curse.  I have a 65 necro, which i play now for mainly $$, and 61 monk, which is way overdone, and to this date, too many exist. Shaman are abundant, but it seems I am more attuned to the priest class, and I think its due to the fact that having been a cleric for so long, my &gt;LFG&lt; time was always short if not immediate tells for groups. My 52 sk, i just cant seem to be patient enough to sit and &gt;LFG&lt;.  The monk was the same, but his solo-ability was always there.  Rogue 52, is the same. 57 druid, bleh need i say more.<br />
  My 53 shaman is the return to the short &gt;LFG&lt;, and if I want to, I can solo in many zones.  As stated regarding PoP, the slow is a must.  A group can last longer with out a cleric than without a slower.<br />
  So, my new Main is zybann.  If there becomes a complete overabundance of them /shrug who knows.<br />

<br />
A run-of-the-mill group wants a Shaman for one reason - Turgurs.<br />
<br />
A smart group wants a Shaman for one reason : His flexibility to fit and adapt to nearly every possible group composition and environment. Our spellbook is like a swiss army knife: Heals, Slows, Debuffs, Buffs, Crowd Control, Damage. Every group has its strength and weaknesses, and a smart Shaman is able to figure this out and adjust his spell setup and playstyle to fit its needs and maximize the groups efficiency.<br />
<br />
As long as all those new L 65 Shamans popping up thinking that their only job-description is to slow I am not worried about getting into groups.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You know, on a point related to the whole debate on how many shamans are needed per raid . . . I'd say quite a few.  Lately with Q and Tnargs (and maybe healing AAs and a Imp Healing IV item) shamans are quite good at healing groups and secondary spam healing the MA.  This becomes quite important in PoP, specially in the elementals and beyond, where the clerics are busy doing a CH chain, the druids are busy healing the rampage tank/s, and the shamans have to keep everyone alive thru the AE.  Or, for some mobs that proc nasty 3-5k DDs, you really have to spam heal the tank or he could go down between CHs.  So shamans are useful for that as well.  <br />
<br />
And if nothing else, a shaman can contribute some DPS thru different sources.  Like doubling up rains can yield quite impressive DPS without the aggro usually associated with such dmging shaman spells.  Or just chaining Velium strike.  With a bit of SCFury and an improved damage/Fury of Eci item, you can really crank out some respectable DPS thru this.  Certainly more than the third warrior, often more than the rogues or beastlords.  <br />
<br />
I would have to set the cap on shaman needed per raid a bit higher than others.  I'd say for a 60 person PoP raid, I'd wanna have at least 4 shamans, and up to 8 shamans total.  Any fewer than 4 and you're relying on ranger heals to keep groups alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Come to Stormhammer. We don't have enough Shaman. Really.<br />

Cough Pali heals cough (and much better for ae then shaman I might add)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What I find annoying isn't that there are more shaman around.  It is that there is the same number  of shaman mains around, but a ton of shaman duo box toons.  Lately is seems like every other melee character has a shaman he likes to box for exp.  Then they think that cause they can hit assist, malo, and slow that they can do everything as good as a main shaman, even though they are doing 0 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Shamans, like clerics, don't stack well in exp groups. But honestly, I've seldom had a problem finding a group. I would strongly disagree with the first person saying clerics are one of the least popular though, clerics are more popular than shamans. A group can have an enchanter or beastlord slowing, but most still want a cleric to heal. However capable they are, a druid or shaman is only a last resort.<br />
<br />
Kunark brought the rise of the enchanter. Crowd control in KC and Sebilis was so important, an enchanter would get a group instantly.<br />
<br />
With Velious, the warrior/rogue/cleric trio became the top 3, other classes were necessary, but melees were gaining power.<br />
<br />
After Luclin came out, with archery AA, rangers came out of their Kunark doldrums and became very popular. They still haven't lived down the &quot;ranger down&quot; jokes, which is probably the only reason there aren't even more rangers around, but rangers today are not the paper tanks they once were.<br />
<br />
With PoP, and hard hitting mobs with lower HP, the shaman became more visible as a desired class. But to my view, the shaman has never been undesirable. These days, though, there are more of us around, more shaman alts becoming mains, and more shaman bots. There are more cleric bots too, for similar reasons.<br />
<br />
The thing is, when you need certain classes for your group - a tank, a healer, a slower - then if you can't get one, you struggle to form a group. Even a shaman or cleric bot can make the difference between being able to get exp and not... or at least, convincing people to try. It is often the less desirable classes that start these characters to 2-box with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;new shaman with names like Suprslowr and Drgnsolor&quot;<br />
<br />
OMG LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have noticed that suddenly a lot of people in my guild are making baby shaman. I attributed it to them seeing me solo everywhere and having a blast while they were LFG. (There was only one active shaman in my guild before I came in, a friend who got me back in EQ...and he retired two days before I joined it. I have all his stuff.)<br />
<br />
I still haven't run into an overwhelming number of shaman in the areas I travel in, but it may be coming. I know I have been on several smal raids where I was the only shaman, and several larger raids where there was only two of us.<br />
<br />
I've never understood the big draw for druids. Yeah, you can quad if you have enough space. You are screwed in dungeons, and melee only works in short increments because you can't take a beating. But hey, you can be a port bitch and make phat loot with thse 5pp donations.<br />
<br />
Monks look fun, but I love playing classes that let me gate and heal myself. I'll probably make one some day, but I have too many other things to do right now.<br />
<br />
I have a level 13 enchanter...he was fun, but I never had time to properly play him. I'll get back to him one day.<br />
<br />
Bards look very good, but I'm not that damn coordinated...I could never twist properly, so it isn't a class for me. I suspect that may be what is holding down their population.<br />
<br />
I dual box with a Cleric, and I absolutely love him. He is now my 'Second Main'. When I started him, I had intended to just get him to 50 and epic then pull him out for raids and rez runs....not anymore. <br />
He is a blast to play. Melees decent, can take hits like my shaman can, better heals, able to rez players (and then my shaman buffs them to help keep them from dying again)<br />
<br />
Granted, though, if I didn't have my Shaman to stand behind him keeping him safe and not LFG, he probably wouldn't be as much fun as he is. I know most clerics get burned out because it gets to the point where all they do is med and heal....and watch someone else do all the looting.<br />
<br />
I can see where that would quickly lose it's appeal, and Duhikae thanks Shazzog daily for freeing him from that living hell.</div></div><hr />

As much as it pains me to say this - Monks are the baseman on the class totem pole in Norrath right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">It's a misconception, it was actually good to have mobs mitigate because the alternative was complete immunity.<br />
- That is true, however it had a very nasty side effect by putting Enchanter and most importantly Beastlord slow within nanometers of shaman slow.<br />
<br />
Why whould you want in XP group Plane of Fire or Earth a shaman anyways if you have enchanter or beastlord ready? Get a solid DPS class instead and you are way better off. How about Solusek's tower? Same crap. PoV? Go Beastlord. HoH? Who needs shaman to slow? No one.<br />
<br />
Mitigation reduced the effectiveness of slow and put much more value back in to CH. With a good cleric/druid, lack of shaman slow can be totally negated, hell I am sure even mitigated slowing can be negated with a well timed CH, lot of warrior + bot cleric teams duo in Fire or Earth. Instead a cleric getting 2-3k CHs landing when mob is slowed, he will land 3-4k CHs. Same spell, same mana used, same cast time. Advantage gained: no need for a XP soaker.<br />

Some of your points are well taken, and certainly, in certain zones, having a Enchanter or Beastlord already in group may negate the need for a Shaman.  However, the real question to ask if you are trying to determine the relative value of the class is, in a specific zone, which would a new group rather have, a Shaman or a Beastlord.  The answer to this question is obviously much more complicated and must be based on the zone, mobs, group composition and roles already filled.<br />
<br />
I can assure you, and as a lvl 65 with over 100 aa's, I'm sure you know this, that if a group is light on healing they will take me over a BST.  If they need the high end buffs, they will take me over a BST.  If they are melee heavy and already doing good DSP, they will take me over the BST.  Not to mention that in some zones a pet is less than ideal and sometimes troublesome.  <br />
<br />
Granted, at your level, many of the BST will have 65% slow.  However, prior to level 65%, Shaman have 66-75% slow, and the BST only has 50%.  I realize some of you uber Shaman have been 65 for a long time, but don't forget the months of play time it took you to get there.  There is still a lot of enjoyable game time prior to 65 and the higher level planes where a Shaman is one of the best group members to have.<br />
<br />
Also, let's not mistakenly think that slow is the only skill we have that is of value, it surely is not.  That would be like saying an Enchanter only has mez, or a ranger only has a bow.  The Shaman is one of the most versatile and useful classes in the game, that is the main reason I play one.<br />
<br />
So, please, lets not define Shaman simply as slowers.  Yes, we are the best at it, therefore people tend to use it to define our class.  However, we are also the best stat buffers, second/third best haste, third best healer, and have a pet.  Not bad, even in the higher level planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I am going to take this a step farther.  <br />
<br />
Why not eliminate the the cleric or druid in favor of the shaman and have the BL as well?  Healing a decently equipped tank with some defensive aa's has not really been a problem for me so far (granted, I am not elemental yet...only SolRo).  <br />
<br />
This situation gives you a quick slow that is rarely resisted (damn BL's) to start.  Throw Q on the tank, slow the mob with Turgs and burn it down.  If there is a bad pull it is much easier to deal with two or more (quickly) slowed mobs for obvious reasons.  Besides, if there is a BL in the group, it means that I can actually take an AFK if needed...like all other classes (dealing with drama queen enchanters about slow is just not worth it).<br />
<br />
Just have a guildie come throw virt on you every so often...hehe.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I generally only group with guildmates.  We really don't care about the group composition.  We adjust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of your points are well taken, and certainly, in certain zones, having a Enchanter or Beastlord already in group may negate the need for a Shaman.  <br />
- That was not my point. I probably wasn't clear enough. Warrior + Cleric can duo in many very high end XP zones (hell, a BST guildmate 2 boxes with cleric in EarthA), in these same zones mobs already mitigate slow. Adding a shaman over beastlord or enchanter would be very inneficient. I am not talking about groups with enchanter and/or beastlord already in them.  Same choice goes with warriors vs knights. If you had a choice to pick one for XP group, who would you pick? I'd sure tell the warrior to beat it and get a knight. If you have no BST/ENC then pick the shaman, you have no choice. That's not the issue, issue here is when you have a choice, you would be crazy to pick a shaman, same way you would be crazy to pick a warrior for tanking. <br />
<br />
 If they need the high end buffs, they will take me over a BST.  If they are melee heavy and already doing good DSP, they will take me over the BST.  <br />
- This is what wrong with EQ. People have no clue about basic game mechanics, basic knowledge of spells and really suck at elementary mathematics. More DPS means more kills, more XP, less tedious mindless boring zombie XP grinds. And just what &quot;high-end&quot; shaman buffs are you reffering too? That uber FOS that gives melee ... wait STR/DEX is capped at 220 already, wait ... meaning that uber buff gives melee what? 540ish HP? If you XP in high end zones (Elemental, Solro, Tactics) and your melee are not at 305 STR already then ask some serious questions. BST can get a nice hp buff too and they got their own FA clone (Ferocity). Not to mention far superior DPS compared to a shaman and gives stackable FT9 to group. I won't even get into enchanter spells, they simply destroy our spells if you comprare their utility looking at countless parses in the past where a 75 STR buff was equivalent of about 5% DPS increase in melee. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that in some zones a pet is less than ideal and sometimes troublesome.  <br />
- In raid situations sure, we wiped a few times because pets aggroed or pushed mobs the wrong way. This is however your mundane XP groups where pets are not just usefull but I would kick out from group or simply leave if any pet class that isn't pulling doesn't have his/her/it's pet out. Not to mention a direcharmed/charmed pet with Vallon or BST pet with some other nifty BST pet buffs will do far superior DPS to the whole shaman arsenal.<br />
<br />
Granted, at your level, many of the BST will have 65% slow.  However, prior to level 65%, Shaman have 66-75% slow, and the BST only has 50%. <br />
- I definitely agree with you that prior 65, shaman slow is very nice. And BST is a non issue. However, as time passes by, more and more people WILL get 65, they will get their spells, and then they will start realizing how good BST are in groups and how BST or enchanters put an &quot;obsolote class, or close to it&quot; tag on shamans.<br />
<br />
Also, let's not mistakenly think that slow is the only skill we have that is of value, it surely is not.  <br />
- Again, if you have no choice to pick a group member, shaman will surely fill the role, we are a versatile class. But if you have a choice, PoT9 or Virtue is FAR SUPERIOR to FOS. Enchanter haste with ATK or Ferocity is far superior to any shaman buff, yes even FA. BST mana regen buff plus ghetto Focus and superior DPS is again superior to shaman spells/abilities. What else you bring to groups? Healing? No thanks, Paladins heal better than us, not to mention clerics and druids. As a shaman I can't keep up as main healer efficiently in elemental planes, sorry that mitigated slow and POS CH clone don't cut it, especially since after every slow I have to tank a few rounds also. <br />
<br />
Then of course if you think you can bring uber DPS to group, think again, you can't, unless you feel like being a mana sponge and tank. If you are using disease DoTs then you have no understanding of what an XP group is, or you feel like wasting your mana on a 2+ min DoT when mobs die under a minute. Poison DoTs? Sure? Let's tank 750+ hitters that partially mitigate. Rains? Too many resists. Nukes? Yeah ... ok, bring out the worse nukes for any caster.<br />
<br />
However, we are also the best stat buffers,<br />
- Useless garbage. Countless parses indicated that 75 STR is a meager ~5% increase in DPS. Not to mention with elemental+ gear everyone and his mother is stat capped. I rarely get asked for STA on raids nowdays. So we have uber stat buffs, too bad most of them are utter crap and/or are capped already.<br />
<br />
third best healer, <br />
- 4th. Cleric, Druid, Paladin then Shaman. <br />
<br />
and have a pet.  Not bad, even in the higher level planes.<br />
- Nice pet for sure, but when it comes to the competition for groups (BST/ENC), their pets destroy the poor little dingo.<br />
<br />
Point was: slow mitigation is GREAT for the game, however it had a bad sideffect: It's slowly making shamans obsolete.</div></div><hr />
