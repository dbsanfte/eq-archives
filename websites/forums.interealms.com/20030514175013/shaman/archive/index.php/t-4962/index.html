<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to let everyone know about this earring I got today: it's AC 6, Agi +3, HP +10, and Lore. Pretty nice (no more Forest Loop for me), but the best part is it drops in Jaggedpine Forest off Level ~40 Griffons. I also looted an Eye of the Griffon (Wis +10 in Primary/Secondary/Range, Lore), good for tradeskills or just to sell to Druids.<br />
<br />
So I know the ubers will laugh at this item, but I think it's great considering it's attainable for anyone Level 40 and up. Oh, and yeah, I had to kill a lot of Griffons before it dropped :-P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, rarely. But again, not more rarely than other griffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best part is it drops in Jaggedpine? whenever I've tried to hunt griffons there the massive animal aggro forces me to run or wipe out... and I'm not comfortable having a druid wolf form me every few minutes just so I can hunt there.<br />
<br />
Fighting anywhere in JP other than the gnoll caves is a huge joke unless you're a druid or ranger... good thing the gnolls are good exp though :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not bad at all with the animals. There is a large clearing on the other side of the hill next to the poacher camp, where you can park the pet in the corner, on the hill, and pull Griffons to it. Just use the third-person camera, zoomed way out and looking back at you on the hill, to watch for incoming animals, and move out of their way (none of the wolves, bears, or panthers are social with Griffons, so they'll ignore your pet). When pulling, just keep your eyes open for animals, and switch frequently between first and third person so you're looking in different directions. If you get aggroed by an animal far from your pet, just root the thing; it will give up once you move far enough away. Even if you are attacked by an animal, only the panthers are any threat, and since they're low blue or light blue you're getting experience anyway, hehe.</div></div><hr />
