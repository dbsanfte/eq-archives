<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not a major problem just something that bugs me.<br />
<br />
Live in Germany.<br />
Up till a few months ago i was using the aol inbuilt browser.<br />
Decided to install FF and love it.<br />
Now the big bugbear for me is with FF every page that has ads on it etc are French ads.If i go to google.com it redirects me to google.fr<br />
This never used to happen with the aol browser it would be German ads and google.com etc would take me to google.com not some French site.<br />
Any ideas if this is something i can change in FF or am i stuck with it.<br />
<br />
