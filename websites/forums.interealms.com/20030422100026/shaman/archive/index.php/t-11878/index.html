I'm getting tired of reading whiny posts from all the high level and uber people. Umpteen posts on spell imbalances for level 60+ peeps. Too many races to get to dragons, bosses, etc. Alchemy at skill level 180+. PLing to level 50 in a week. Or to level 65 in the case of one well-known frog. Class imbalance posts out the gazoo. Good grief people - do you actually play this game anymore?<br />
<br />
EQ used to cost $9.99 a month. Now it's $12.95 a month. That gets you as many hours per week as you care to play it. It's quite a bargain. But a lot of the posts on this board consist of complaints and what SOE needs to or should do to correct things. And nearly ALL of these complaints come from 50+ or 60+ level peeps who can't seem to get [fill in your favorite thing] they think they deserve out of the immense amount of content in this game.<br />
<br />
If the high end content and situation just isn't working for you, here's a solution - start at the beginning again. Start a new char, maybe on a new server, and DON'T TWINK IT. DON'T JOIN YOUR OLD GUILD. DON'T EVEN LET ALL YOUR IN-GAME FRIENDS KNOW IT'S YOU. Go back to the old world and play like you just learned about EQ. Remember how it feels to die fighting a bat, spiderling, or beetle. Look at level 20 content from the view of an untwinked level 15. It looks a LOT different than from a level 60+ perspective. Lose a full bulb of health when that mob whacks you for 45 damage. You say you've already been there and done that? I bet there's some combination of race and profession that will take you where you haven't been before. <br />
<br />
Too crowded at the top? Most of the low level zones, old world or new, are scarcely populated these days. Getting a group is a challenge in itself. Do you know the &quot;old&quot; content so well that all of it represents nothing but boredom to you? Have you ever tried some out-of-the-way spots for leveling and avoided the well-known high exp per kill areas? Remember when guards were your best friends?<br />
<br />
I know some of you have done just what I suggested. But I don't think enough of you have. Give it a try. And do it with a single PC. Multi-boxing is not allowed. Play the game, don't game the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you know what they say about colors and tastes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont hate the player hate the game =p<br />
<br />
 Not the 2boxing either ive liked eq more two boxing than prior. Me going and playing a newb isnt going to solve some of the real problems of eq just may make some people deal with it better. Doesnt fix stuff though that really sometimes does need to be fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just fixed a spelling error. I finished 2nd in a spelling bee once. Been downhill ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm another rant about rants ... gotta love it.<br />
<br />
(oops fed the troll)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eqphreak - Well, at level 32 with no alts and 2 months playing time (real life time), I can't rant about the high level stuff. Can't rant about content I've never seen, spells I can't use, equipment I can't wear, etc., etc. By the time I get to the planes (old or new), there won't be anyone  else there. They'll be on to expansion 7 or something for level 75+ peeps.<br />
<br />
So to join in the fun, I have to rant about the rants. Even the good rants will be old by the time I get to 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well i know this , i have many lightly twinked , meaning not naked alts. They can never find groups. The bulk of the players are in the higher end game , so you cant enjoy the game at lower levels like you used to. I log to my alts so many times wishing i could just play them with a group and explore somethign , but no go 99% of the time. I have a bard/monk/sk/wizzy/ranger/warrior/shaman( lowbie )and im forced to solo them all. Now i like to solo , but it would be nice to get a group and explore split paw like the old days. Its just not there anymore :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have to agree with Litgruv there.  I have a few lower level alts that I play on occasion and the only place to find groups is under 30 is usually in non-dungeon zones where its safe.  I love dunegon crawling as a low level.  Now adays no one wants to do it.  Took a Erudite Shadowknight to The Warrens.  Nobody came in for over an hour.  High end game is a completely different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yet another person who thinks that someone who plays different than them for fun is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, this is coming from someone who had no choice but to start over.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with what people are saying about the lower end game.  Quite frankly there is no such thing as the lower/mid level game anymore.  To many its just a way station to the 50+ game.  Back when I had my 57 shaman, pre luclin sure there were a lot of people doing the LOIO/OT/DL circut, but there were also people who were willing to explore dungeons like Dalnir, and nurga, and even kedge keep.  Now i go to these old world dungeons and they are completely empty.  Even lower guk, which used to be one of the busiest zones in the game is now nothing more than a damn farm fest to get faction for a stupid wood elf illusion mask.  I happened to like guk..... and sol b..... and especially kedge, even though it was a BYOG zone.  Nowdays all people want to do is hunt in outdoor zones so they can get safe, easy xp so they can get to 50+ and go to the planes.  <br />
<br />
Frankly, i dont see why people continue to hunt in the OT.  I happen to find the xp there horrible, compared to any other zone and dont even mention the idiots there.  It just seems like people dont care about grouping anymore and just want to get thier arses pled so they can head to the planes to get the phat lewt.</div></div><hr />
