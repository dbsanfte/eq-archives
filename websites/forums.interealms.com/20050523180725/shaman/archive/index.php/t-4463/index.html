<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A great big Hullo to all my fellow shamans out there! Long time reader, First time poster.<br />
<br />
I just hit 58, and I just found a good guild that I fit into well, that also has the manpower to raid for loot/spells. But I need some serious help and advice from my fellow shammies.<br />
<br />
Most of my levels were solo'd, and I tend to be flat broke all the time. Im desperatly looking for advice on where I should drag my guild for gear upgrades for myself.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88646 <br />
<br />
As you can see, I am truely a patchwork shaman. Everything here I looted or bought with whatever meager amounts of PP I could scrounge up.<br />
<br />
Self buffed, I can get my ac to 922, and HP's to 1776. Minor gear changes can get my hp's to 1850. <br />
My wiz is just plain embarrasing at 179. (My megalo profile stats are not entirely correct, havent checked my naked stats in about 7 levels)<br />
<br />
Im not a wiz shaman, I Prefer hp's and ac, (hp for canni, ac to stay alive IF slow gets resisted) but I realize at my level, my wiz should be closer to 200+.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are very welcomed, but please dont laugh at me. I have a tough time asking for help as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, welcome.  :)<br />
<br />
Second, I'll try posting some upgrade suggestions, but generally your gear is fine.  I'm going to steal from this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3404), but there are a bunch of them out there.  You might also want to check out this list of shaman magelo profiles (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1379) (a good resource, even if my particular link on that list is outdated.)  :)<br />
<br />
Onto the self-plagiarism...<br />
<br />
You're rapidly approaching the point where gear upgrades aren't going to be cheap, especially if you're looking for gear that gets you to a strong AC, strong WIS, and decent resist level at the same time. I'm in a very similar place right now, so I know what you're facing.  <br />
<br />
Couple notes before I get started. First, I'm only listing stuff you can purchase outright. There might be better and cheaper multiquest/camp options for some slots, but I tend to buy my stuff (habit from my tunnel rat days, I suppose) so I'm more familiar with tradeable items. Also, some of this stuff is expensive. To get where you want to go, I'd suggest picking one or two of these out and figuring which would make the biggest impact. For a &quot;What the the next cheapest version that's still good&quot; option, check my profile (these are mostly the upgrades I'm looking for- Note: This isn't so true anymore- I've got most upgrades I wanted- thx Bazaar!.) Oh, and prices vary by server... so my Karana prices might be a little off for you. <br />
<br />
Ears: Ditch the Forest Loop (if nothing else, a vendor will give you almost 300 pp for each one)- replace it with another Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (this is an easy one- increases your WIS and AC- and super-cheap, 100 pp each max- player made.) If you have the funds, the quest components for the Earring of the Solstice are down to around 10k (I saw Misty Thicket Picnics for 15 pp yesterday- I about fainted!)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Face:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=1625&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Enshrouded Veil&lt;/a&gt; is your cheapest upgrade (500-800 pp), followed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Crystal Spider Eyes&lt;/a&gt; for 1-1.5k.  Moving on up, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3997&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mask of War&lt;/a&gt; is better, &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8990&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Death Mask of the Elysians&lt;/a&gt; arguably better still.  The latter two will set you back a pretty penny (8-12k, prices vary widely.)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Neck:&lt;/b&gt;  I (until just a couple days ago) wore the same one you do, and still keep my ivory collar in my resist bag just like you do.  :)  I found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25554&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Crystalline Torque&lt;/a&gt; for 4k, and the Mana Preservation III effect is too nice to ignore.  Keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Fingers:&lt;/b&gt;  I'd ditch both rings, and replace with at least 6 ac/65 hp player-made rings (400 pp each- you can probably break even here.)  With a little more money, I'd grab a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shadel Bandit Ring&lt;/a&gt; (got mine for 2k).  <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Wrists:&lt;/b&gt;  Your upgrades are pretty pricey here.  Of course, the JBB is nice... but is better from 45-55 then from 58 up.  That said, it's still a nice bracer to have on your wish list.  Other pricey upgrades include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8971&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bracelet of Sense&lt;/a&gt;  (great stats on this one, good AC, WIS, and saves!)  Another great option are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=23668&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artificer's Ringmail bracers&lt;/a&gt; (player made) - either choice will set you back around 15k each.  In between (4-8k) look for one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=dragonhorn+bra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dragonhorn Bracers&lt;/a&gt;- a nice combination of ac and wisdom (e.g. ac 12, +8 wis on the lowest-end one.)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Shoulders:&lt;/b&gt;  Again, pricey.  For the AC and resists, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4394&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Imbued Granite Spaulders&lt;/a&gt; can't be beat.  Prices are falling a bit, too... they've fallen from 15k to closer to 10k lately (Note: I got mine for 8k), now that the Obulus Death Shroud is becoming more popular due to the focus effect.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4315&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;death shroud&lt;/a&gt; doesn't offer stats like the IGS, but 10% less mana for all of your spells is a nice effect (same effect as the Crystalline Torque).  Priced similar to the IGS.  Your super-cheap option is the tattered mantle (few hundred pp, so you'd make money while increasing your AC)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Chest:&lt;/b&gt;  Your only real upgrade here is the fungi.  <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Back:&lt;/b&gt;  I'd keep the arctic wyvern as a &quot;WIS cloak&quot; - for an AC/HP cloak, get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=24736&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak&lt;/a&gt;.  Upgrades from there include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=1622&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Heirophant's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; (around 10-15k) or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=22816&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lodi Shield&lt;/a&gt; (30-35k)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Waist:&lt;/b&gt;  You're good here- chitinous belt is awesome.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Legs:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=dragonleg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dragonleg Breeches&lt;/a&gt; are around 5k for the cheap ones, and provide nice AC/STA, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=4534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jaundiced Bone&lt;/a&gt; provides great AC and mana/Wis, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=23676&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Artificer's Ringmail&lt;/a&gt; (player made, probably 25k) provide great AC, Wis/mana, and HP<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Boots:&lt;/b&gt;  Not a lot of good choices here.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25029&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barbed Dragonscale&lt;/a&gt; (around 5-8k) would be a minor upgrade.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=27882&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flowing Slime Boots&lt;/a&gt; are another (expensive, 20k? Note:  Ha!  More like 50-70k, what was I thinking?) alternative- with bad AC but FT3 and nice mana.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Weapon:&lt;/b&gt;  Your epic will help- it's your next major stat upgrade for this slot.  &lt;img src=&quot;images/smilies/smile.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Shield:&lt;/b&gt;  If you don't need the disease resists of the green dragon shield, I'd seriously consider selling it to raise funds.  Replace it with a (cheaper) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=9205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarnak Battle Shield&lt;/a&gt;  (nice ac/hp/resists, and cheap at 2k or so) - upgrades from there include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=6440&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bone Braced Buckler&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=31837&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shield of Bane Warding&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25098&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orb of the Infinite Void&lt;/a&gt;  (in any case keep the SBS bagged- as the upgrades don't have the SBS's resists.)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Range:&lt;/b&gt;  Eye of the Griffon is a nice piece, but if you're looking to increase your AC, I'd recommend heading back to ME (4-arms camp) and try to score a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32323&quot;&gt;Stone Idol&lt;/a&gt;, or even hit the Goranga Chieftain camp and pray for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32307&quot;&gt;Divine Inspiration&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you spend much time outdoors, let me recommend a horse.  JBB + Horse = a blast !!!<br />
<br />
One more comment- you comment that your wisdom is &quot;just plain embarassing&quot; at 179- I disagree.  179 is fine- I wouldn't concentrate on increasing it at all.  When you move up to the next tier of gear, you'll find it all has Wisdom on it, anyway.  Most of the ubers on the board complain that they have too much Wisdom, and are trying to shuffle it out for more AC/HP.  I have less than 180 Wis (more like 150-160, depending on gear) and I'm just fine.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Biggus, you always do really good upgrade suggestion posts, nice one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, VERY nice suggestions. Thanks for your effort! <br />
<br />
As for my epic, I have to wait for our cleric to get her clicky stick, then Im next in line. Mine should be cake.<br />
<br />
I love yer suggestions on Bracers, think those and rings where I'll be starting first. My best EQ partner is a GM jewler, and I supply most of her gems, so I can get those easy.<br />
<br />
My dragon shield Im debating keeping for the dis/poi resists, plus even if Im not uber, I like people thinking I look uber (dragon shield looks like Lodi shield, hahaha!)<br />
<br />
Im gonna beg my guild to let me roll for the IGS, as we have one tucked away in the bank and all our main tanks have those already. Considering Im the main shaman, I think I hold a lil sway for that item ;)<br />
<br />
Thank you sooo much for yer suggestions! You've been a great help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the kind words.  :)<br />
<br />
If you're looking for the lodi shield look, another (cheaper) option is the Shield of the Senechal (ac 20, +20 hp, +5 sta, +7 str, +5 agi, +3 to all resists) - usually available under 1k.  <br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My recommendations are a bit different. <br />
<br />
For shoulders, I would recommend Elder Wolf Hide. You should be able to solo for one if you like, or can buy for around 1k. AC 10 Wis 4 HP 30. Not bad at all. The bazaar is your friend :)<br />
<br />
For Neck i would say Dusty Soriz Amulet (may be able to find it in the bazaar for about 1k. 5 wis decent ac and +hp. <br />
<br />
Face crystal spider eyes is best stats to price ratio. Dont waste time on mask of war imo. <br />
<br />
All i can think of off top of my head. good luck :)</div></div><hr />
