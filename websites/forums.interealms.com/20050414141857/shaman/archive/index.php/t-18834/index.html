<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry, for anyone who read this being afraid of something or anything else like that, but my issue is actually very annoying.  I'm pretty young, so i got tired of EQ and just stopped for a couple of months (this having not much to do with age) anyhow i made the mistake of telling my older dick of a brother.  He then procedeed months later to begin to play him, and i wanted to play him so i did.  I tryed to log on about 1 month ago to find out the password has been changed on me!  So now im waging a war against him, and its a losing fight.  Him and his friend are paying for it now claiming its &quot;theirs&quot; even though they are ignoring my 40 days of playtime i put in.  Anyone got some suggestions as to how to get it back or do something that will get it back?  If anyone has some suggestions please say.  If you dont a simple &quot;tough luck&quot; will do. Thanks friends  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/tell mom and/or dad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well I've already tryed that out, they seem to just try to not listen to what I'm saying, so if thats the only real option than I guess im screwed =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have the cd's , you can use the numbers on them to email sony and get your account back.<br />
<br />
There might be repercussions to doing that though.<br />
<br />
It's pretty cheap to buy a boxed set that has most ifnot all expansions (assuming they are still available) and so that is an option as well to get an account for you to play on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Much as I hate to say it, you can probably pick something up on playerauctions for the same or less than you'd pay for a new boxed set, anymore.<br />
<br />
My guess is that mom and dad are less than concerned, since if you get the account back, they'll be paying for it again, instead of your brother.  *grin*  Trying to pry an EQ account from an active player is like trying to get a wolf away from a fresh kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Me and my brother finally came to a good compromise, thanks for all advice but ignore this post from now on  :D . Thanks for advice friends!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did the compromise involve you holding him down and hitting him in non-bruising areas until he gave you your account back?   :D   That's what I was gonna suggest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of a hot poker.</div></div><hr />
