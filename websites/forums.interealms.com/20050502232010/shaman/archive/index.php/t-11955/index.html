<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, back before I left (pre-PoP) the general consensus was that the best route to power was to get 60 first, because torpor was so uber, and then work on AAXP.  However, now with PoP I'm wondering if the same logic holds true or not, because if it does than it means I have to gain another five levels after I get 60 before I can start working on Cann V.<br />
<br />
My current plan is to level to 61, then delevel to 60, and see which of the two levels I prefer for AAXP.  Then if I choose 61, I'll repeat the process for 62, etc.  But if I could save some time by getting other people's advice that would be great too.  Obviously, AAXP points take the same exp at any level, so what I'm really asking is, do the better spells you get from 61+ make up for the reduced number of blue mobs out there at that point?  Is there some middle ground (61 or 62) where most of the good level 60 spots still work, but certain spells (maybe new pet) really increase our DPS?<br />
<br />
As always, any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was 60 with like 8 AA when pop released, I leveled to 61 (I was like 90% into 60 already) then got canni5, then went to 65 and began AAing again.  I highly recommend stopping at 60 or 61 to get canni5, then moving on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was like 57 or 58 or something when PoP came out.  Maybe 59, whatever.  Had 0 AA.<br />
<br />
I leveled to 61 for pet and greater group attraction.  Got 23aa, dinged canni5, then moved on.  I got 4 aa in 62 (RC1 and SCM1), and another 4 during 63 (SCM2), just 'cause I felt like screwing about.  If I was going for max efficiency, I'd have shot to 65 as soon as I got canni 5.  I'm not planning on doing any more AA til I get canni 5, cause Fo7 and FA are just too good to wait any longer for.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would go to 61 and sit and do AA for a bit. the new pet is very very nice for solo'in and replenishment is also very nice. also you can still hunt most of the places you did at 60 for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For power and fun you should go to 65.  Stuff will green out but you will be very capable to handle most tasks.<br />
<br />
If the best you can do is get to tier 2 and simply want lots of AAs, then I highly recommend stopping at 61.<br />
<br />
I used to level up my AAs at Plane of Justice Deathrow.. killing mobs easily and getting 2% AA per kill.  Once I hit 62, 63, and 64 it was game over-- PoJ DR is now useless to me (.3-1% AA per kill maybe).  Now I need to find a tier 2 group just to get almost 2% per kill like I used to be able to consistently and easily in PoJ (and got to keep all the loot too-- when I group I never loot so now I'm dirt poor too).  I had 50-60 AAs when I got flagged for PoV/PoS --- I think I levelled to 62+ prematurely.  Should probably have waited til I had about 150 AAs or so.<br />
<br />
Do I regret levelling past 61?  Not anymore-- I used to.  My reasons behind levelling was because I just got flagged, and I was getting bored of grinding PoJ DR and PoI entrance and PoN and PoD over and over again even though it was good xp, and also that I was getting crappy xp in oldworld places regardless of whether or not I was 61 or 65.  But I really hated having to find a decent tier 2 group to get what I used to get-- which sucks because I have to commit to 3 hours of playing at least instead of starting and stopping at will =/  But the added power of levels and not really caring too much about xping in general lets me continue playing.  I have fun doing quests and tradeskilling and all kinds of stuff now.  My xp and AA xp bars barely move per week now... but it's still awesome to have the power of being level 64.  Tnarg's was a great boon at 62... as well as Focus/Boar.. and now we have a bunch of new buffs too.  Tears of Saryrn is sooo good... Very cool stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One major consideration is what kind of a guild you are in and where you like to hunt. At Lvl 60 AA's in the tier one PoP zones come pretty fast, and when ya get sick of PoP there are a lot of other zones to go play in and still get decent exp.<br />
<br />
But once you pass Lvl 62, even most of the tier one PoP stuff starts to go light blue. So then ya need to get through the PoJ trials. Of course that means you are now limited to 2 exp zones, unless you are in a high end guild that can get ya flagged for the rest of the PoP stuff. Still at 62 most places pre PoP are light blue or green, severly limiting the places to exp.  <br />
<br />
And if all ya want to do is grind away at AA they come a lot faster at Lvl 60 then at 61 or 62, but I still went and Levelled to 62 and am now working on AA. Course thats partly because I 2 box with a Warrior and the 62 spells were worth going after.<br />
<br />
But if ya have the support to get flagged for PoP, they say the AA exp at Lvl 65 can be amazing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
This originally wasn't a hard choice for me.  Most of my good friends were below 60, with a few above.  So I stayed.<br />
<br />
I levelled from 55-60 extremely fast in PoP, mainly in PoI.  Then I switched to AA's.  I had heard the stories of entire old world exp zones going light blue and green, and much of my guild's raiding still took place outside of PoP.  I stayed 60 for a long time on purpose.<br />
<br />
I was a guild officer, and felt it was my duty to group w/ my family whenever possible.  Levelling beyond 60 might have improved my personal power level, but it would probably have hurt in the long run, as we already had some stratification setting in between those above 60 and below.  <br />
<br />
At 60, I could still get decent exp in pretty much ANY zone that those still in their 40's or 50's could.  I also had the strength of Torpor/Malo to help carry some of the younger 50's people in PoI, giving them some of the best experience of their EQ careers (up to that point) while still getting enough for myself that I didn't mind the fact I didn't have the &quot;best&quot;, &quot;strongest, or &quot;fastest&quot; exp. group. <br />
<br />
After the 2nd shaman in my guild levelled beyond me, I went ahead and hit 61.  I then stayed there for a longer period of time, getting more AA's (not tons of them, but steady) and enjoying the first decent pet we get.<br />
<br />
The guild I was so happy in and proud of disbanded abruptly w/o any notice, leaving me not sure I would continue playing, even though the last few months had been some of the most enjoyable time IG.  I levelled to 62 right about the time this happened.<br />
<br />
I'm just a member in a smallish guild now, and we have rather severe level disparity between a half dozen of us at the top, and a smattering of folks in every range from 20's-50's.  It is tough to make raids challenging enough that those of us in our 60's don't fall asleep at that will also be fun for those in their 40's-50's to attend (&amp; where they won't be a liability from aggro radius).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'm powering to 65, come hell or high water.  I picked up 63 this week and dinged 64 today. :(  It wasn't hard.  I just had to endure pick-up groups in Valor to grind away.  I can solo inefficiently (&amp; with some danger) if I have to, but grouping is where the exp is for me right now.  Pickup groups can be rather picky about who gets to fill that 5th or 6th spot.  Once I have a group, I'm golden, but nobody wants a second shaman in their group.  (But 3 rogues is fine...)<br />
<br />
The guilds that are doing the things I want to try on E. Marr all seem to have a 65 entry requirement, despite the fact I'm already an Elder.  So I'm punching that ticket in a hurry and will see what I want to do after that point.  The difference between a Valor flagged 62 shaman &amp; one 65 w/o any spectral spells doesn't seem to be that big to me.  The zones that green out at 62 will still be green at 65.<br />
<br />
I've made a conscious decision to go to 65.  It wasn't made lightly.  I understand that when I group with my friends still in their 50's, I'll be doing it out of friendship and no small amount of exp charity until they reach Tier2.  I'll be stuck grinding in Tier2 for exp anyway, so it won't be much different doing it at 65 than it was at 62 in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think carefully about what you want to get out of the game.  If you want to try some of the higher end content, you'll have to have lots of AA's AND be level 65.  Whether you get those AA's at 61 or 65 is up to you.  If you can't get beyond Tier2 easily, I highly recommend staying at 60-61.  Enjoy the 61 pet, grinding in both old world and PoP zones, and seeing steady AA improvement over time.<br />
<br />
Here's the entry requirements for the most powerful guild on my server:<br />
Level/Skill Requirements: For all classes, we require 65th level and 100+ alternate advancement points.  General requirements: All applicants must have the following alternate advancement skills: Innate Regeneration (3), Natural Durability (3), Planar Power (5). Casting classes are additionally required to have Spell Casting Mastery (3) and Innate Enlightenment (5).  Shaman High HA3, MC3, MGB, Cannibalization, RC1  That's pretty severe if you ask me, but they are #1 for a reason.  I know I'm not that serious a player, even though I have a very high playtime.  They set the bar high on purpose for new recruits, because it is EASY to just get to 65.<br />
<br />
65 and few AA's will not make you better than someone 61 who  has critical AA abilities you do not possess.  I'd agree with those who say level to 60 and then stop until you get Canni5.  Push to 61 if you want the new dog, but that's already cutting off major old world content for exp opportunities.  <br />
<br />
SOE says they are going to change this, so that the level disparity for exp isn't as great 61+, but it hasn't happened yet that I'm aware.  Until it does, you might want to wait until that happens to level beyond 60.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">C5 is amazing.<br />
If you have a copy of Torpor, and the PoP expansion, you probably want to get the C5 skill at level 61.<br />
You have access to the new spells, and can hunt in the better xp zones.<br />
If you don't have Torpor, then C5 isn't so hot, since you have to rely on the Kragg 2k heal, which is kind of dangerous.<br />
You might want to level up to 65, and buy a copy of Q from one of the uber guilds on the server.<br />
On our server, runes sell for about 50-55k.<br />
I'm not sure what individual spells cost, but the cost of Q is less than it used to cost for Torpor.<br />
That, and paying for a copy of Torpor if you plan to buy it, then levelling up to 65 and sticking it in the back of the spellbook in place of Q is kind of a pain and rather expensive if you can't get the runes yourself.<br />
<br />
So, IMO, get 65 if you have Q, then go for c5.<br />
If you have torpor scribed, go for c5 asap.<br />
If you have torpor but not scribed, you MAY want to try selling it and upgrade to Q, and go for 65 first.<br />
If you don't have torpor or Q, then getting c5 is kind of crappy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest doing this with torpor as it's quite a bit riskier without it, but still doable.  Summon dogdog, arm him with weapons, buff up, and kill the first enforcer in the entrance hallway (the usual.. turgur, pox/bane/curse.. root, torpor as necessary, rebane).<br />
<br />
After that, rest up a lil then paralyzing earth one of the punishers.  Then send pet at (if you're afraid) and slow the other.  Targetting is much easier now now that you can switch between the last two targets (I set that button to 'Q').  Now switch back and malosini the first because that will make paralyzing earth stick easier and turgur it as well for when root does break.  Solo the second and root park whenever necessary.  Then finish up the first (I wouldn't rootrot both of them at the same time because you want to split the spawns).<br />
<br />
Rest up a lil, finish up the last enforcer.<br />
<br />
Once all of this is done you have a perfectly split up entrance hallway to DR and there is little risk.. the first enforcer will appear after a little rest period.  The spawntime on these mobs is maybe about 13 minutes.<br />
<br />
If someone is already hunting this hallway, you may want to try DR itself.  Three Cautions: there is a wraith on the left corner that is triggered if you get too close to there.  If there is one wraith already there it's even worse because you will trigger yet another wraith and two will be there.  I would recommend often triggering this trap to get rid of the wraith.  The second caution is that the second enforcer easily aggros through the door and can cause complications.  This issue can be resolved by sitting further away from the door on the opposite wall of the wraith (near the Dreamthief door).  DR is done similarly to the DR hallway punisher split.  I tended to root the left and turgur the right..  The third caution: if you click on any of the doors in the DR room you will be sent into a prison room where a mob will attack you.. and it *tends* to drop nothing when you kill it.  One of those mobs drops a metal speckled sleeve or something if I remember correctly but that's it.  If you happen upon a giant cell, remember that you need to be in melee range to cast on it.<br />
<br />
Expect to kill maybe 2-3 rows before having to come back and kill the wraith and the hall enforcer (I try to agro the enforcer by coming into the opposite corner of the wraith)-- try your best to kill the wraith separate from the enforcer either by grabbing the wraith before enforcer repop or by not triggering the wraith before pulling the enforcer, then triggering the wraith to finish that off.<br />
<br />
I've found that cripple lowers the damage but eventually I did this place so much that I didn't even bother since torpor was good enough to keep me alive-- I just concentrated on dotting it to death (or experimenting with rains and such).<br />
<br />
Loot includes peridots, random junk (enforcer stones, ceremonial daggers, etc) that may sell for 50-70pp, raw diamonds/diamonds for 210pp, blue diamonds that I've sold for 400pp at the bazaar, weighty polearms which are now crap, buncha research stuff now, and ethereal parchments.<br />
<br />
None of these mobs run.<br />
<br />
Do not drag these mobs near any of the high guards or that big guard in the back (though I doubt you can solo your way there without a lot of back repops to complicate your return).  High guards are level 60 and hit for 400-500? and in that hallway before the DR entrance hallway, they tend to come in pairs at least.<br />
<br />
If for some reason a high guard agros you after you pull a punisher in the entrance hallway, then forget it-- come back another day.  I've never had this happen but once they're bugged you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
One last thing.  Sometimes people come barging through -- be understanding -- they are probably just coming through to get flagged by Mavuin (Mauvin?).  That may screw up your spawn schedule.. good luck. hehe.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I recommend doing this with a horse.. it's harsh without a horse.  Also if you're doing the hallway and someone is in the DR be wary of the second enforcer-- you may need to sit in that spot when he spawns or he will agro the group in the DR room if they're stupid (or smart) enough to stay close to the door to agro him.  Enforcers (not punishers) have extremely large ranges btw.  Keep this in mind when you are root parking.  You can also use this to your advantage-- since they may attack you from a distance you can cast rains on them directly. hehe.  But not much of an advantage, you could always have targetted your rains on your pet.  I seemed to have a much easier time using dots instead of rains btw.<br />
<br />
Also get Virulent Paralysis if you can to help with the emergency rooting (in case root or turgur's resists) .. if say you root the left punisher and it resists, and you send your dog at the second, then the first will come at you-- try to turgur him, then virulent paralysis or root the other and back dogdog off and turgur the other.. malosini and apply paralyzing earth.. then resume solo.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is okay to help speed things up if you seem to lag behind in the spawn schedule.  Control your spawn schedule.. kill speedily or slow down your kill accordingly to adjust the spawns to the most comfortable level you can manage it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/salute Frekkels<br />
I was horrified to hear about your guild.  /comfort I wish there were something I(anyone) could do. *sigh*  Thanks so much for all your help and advice, you've always been an elder to look up to.  /kneel<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway...about leveling:<br />
<br />
I'm currently sitting at 99% into level 60.  I'm 100% aa at the moment and I'm amazed at how fast they come.  I don't have a lot of play time but I can manage to get an aa in two days(about 5 hours playtime if that) without even grinding hard.  I intend to stay 60 until I get Canii V and possibly even past that.  My reasons are the same that Frekkels' were.  I have a lot of friends in game and the large majority are either, A.) under 60 and/or B.) Not flagged.  That coupled with the fact that there is a lot of the old world that I haven't seen, and there's no way I could possibly handle limiting myself to the plains.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, while doing juggs/reets(have 1 spell from 59-60 so far, need more badly) I accidentally dinged 61.  I died the night before and had forgotten to switch back to aa xp after recouping the xp loss.  I realized this and decided immediately that I'd delevel when it was safe.  I did mem the lvl 61 spells I had with me though and I have to admit the new dog is very, very nice.  It is not, though, worth the change in aa xp speed.  It seemed that it was near half again as long to get the same amount of aa xp that it was at 60.  Perhaps this was a misperception, but it was much slower.<br />
<br />
I am in no rush to get to 65.  I'm a casual player and I enjoy the game because of the people.  I love hanging out with my friends online whether that be raiding, xping, or just goofing around.  For anyone considering the options at this point I would offer them the same advice that Frekkels did.  Look at what you want from the game, what kind of player you are.  If you're like Frekkels, and have seen much of what there is to see in the old world and don't mind the thought of being stuck in the planes(or whatever comes out next) for the rest of that char's life...then level, you will be much more powerful from it.  For me, and most casual players, I would highly recommend staying at 60(or 61 for those that NEED to have that new pet 8D ) and working on aa for a while.  Enjoy your time, enjoy your friends and don't worry about being the most uber shaman on your server.  If a froggie cleric can get leveled to 65 in a week...there will always be someone bigger, tougher and better equipped.  I say just enjoy the game, and for me, that wouldn't be possible if I were stuck in PoP 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Be well all,<br />
<br />

Based on everyone's feedback, I'm going to level to 61, mem my spells, then delevel to 60.  I plan to do this so I can get 61 easilly if I am on a raid and want a better pet, but the rest of the time I will stay 60, because I haven't had my fill of old-world zones.  I do have tier 2 friends though, so after awhile I might go to 61-62, or possibly even to 65, but it won't be until I at least have gotten Cann V.  Thanks again :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am 60 right now and pounding hard for 61 and new pet, but considering coments about aaxp between 60 and 61 I may stay very close to 61 and delevel to 60 for exp grinding.<br />
<br />
I want the pet bad for farming drops for trade skills but I would hate to have problems getting aaxp.<br />
<br />
I did a big chunk of aaxp at level 53 at a rate of about 3 to 4 hours each.  Grinding aaxp at a slower rate then that will just be very painfull and considering that most of my grinding is solo, I would rather be very strong for my level then strong because of level.<br />
<br />
I can see going to 61 and farming untill I can't stand any more then going back to 60 and exp grinding untill It stinks and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think that for a shaman level is everything. Can 5 is nice, so is mgb.  Too bad if you can't use it because noone wants Khura's anymore, or brute.  I also notice a strong difference between slow resists 60 - 65, and that sepll still is our bread and butter.<br />
AA Exp at 65 in PoV IC or BoT is easy to get, maybe not as easy as PoI deathrow at 60, but still enough to not getting bored.  And that nice feeling of not caring about death anymore ;).<br />
Unless you are fixed to soloing your way through the game of course, then I'd stop at 61, and camp death row till Xmas or 100 AA, whatever comes first.</div></div><hr />

ups, typo, its in plane of justice. It's the area bevore Mavuin's cell, the NPC you need to talk to do the the trails. It has punishers and enforcers, which you can usually single pull. The guardian at the end in front of Mavuin's cell does not assist.  Might bring a chanter or some other cc for your first attempt, till you know the area. Be carefull, of the banjee that spawns in the left corner at the entrance, she's usually the add you forget about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ive found that the utility of level 61 is irrelevant to the stuff I am killing for hardcore aaxping.  There is no practical reason to stay 61 when soloing non-summoning mobs that hit for 300-500, or when grouped in valor/storms.  Depending on your available means of xping and your spells/toys.<br />

The loss of available xp spots, less xp per kill, and lack of power 61 has over 60 for what I like to kill isnt worth it to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's much better to simply level and get your pet at 61 and Tnargs at 62.  <br />
<br />
I do agree with Juujuu.  If you got Torpor, detouring to Cann 5 is worth it.  Otherwise, go to 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 65, less amount of resists = more mana saved and you resist spells alot more<br />
<br />
I went the MR route of boosting Innate MR and Marr's prot myself just because magic resistance is critical on SZ, and it also helps having 30 more during PvM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lor, I went to 60, did a couple AA (finally), then 61 and a couple AA... and never looked back.  Replenishment, the 40% disease slow, and that lovely dark blue pup make 61 ideal for me.  My guild's mostly 60 - 61, so we do Tier 2 quite a bit.<br />
<br />
If you get bored again, pause for Spirit Call.  I swear by it.  It's saved me a few times now, and it's just FUN!<br />
<br />
I second that. Replentishment and the lvl 58 dog dog is worth his weight in gold. I agonized over it when I did it and here was my reasoning.<br />
<br />
1) Exp in non PoP zones sucks. If you are going to EXP then you maight as well do it in PoP. This means going to 61 is a non issue here.<br />
<br />
2) Tier 1 hunting grounds. PoI sucks. Stay away (Unless you get into factory). Pod CY and castle has no exp difference between 60 and 61. Goos/rats are less exp. However you can easily solo them at 61 with dogdog where it was a Pita at 60. PoN exp doesnt chane for hobos/gargs.guardians, basicly naything across the river. Trash mobs again you can no solo easily, so no reaon to group on them. PoJ. The stuff upstairs sucks. It was eaisly soloable at 60. Some is LB now. Go downstairs and do punishers/enforcers. Exp is the same. Grouped or some solo pulls.<br />
<br />
For PoV/PoS the exp is teh same.<br />
<br />
For old world the exp blows, but, as stated before, it already did. So you will be able to still raid there, but exp was never a raid issue anyways. You wil lbe that much more powerful on raids because of resists.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but you can do some cash camps much more easily at 61.<br />
<br />
If you are exping mainly with your guild in non PoP places you really arent exp. Just grouping for fun. Thats ok. Nothing wrong with that... But if you are truely exping you are gonna be in pop anyways.<br />
<br />
Its a no brainer decision if ya think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you raid a lot, get to 65.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, stay at 60 and get AAs.</div></div><hr />
