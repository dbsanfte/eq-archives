Both of these boards have &quot;find all posts by this user&quot; functions, and I found it interesting to see what the reps who've been visiting have had to say.  Please post any other relevant profiles from this or other boards.  I found the posts on the cleric board to be pretty illuminating.  The response to Brenlo there, as here, seems to be &quot;stop asking us for suggestions, we have MONTHS worth of ideas here already, read what we have!&quot;  I feel for ya, clerics.<br />
<br />
We're a community.  We've always come here to help and be helped by each other.  Let's help each other keep track of those who say they have the power to fix things.  Personally, it'll make it easier for me to simply check for what I want to see, instead of dwelling on the (understandable) fury of my frustrated shaman brethren.<br />
<br />
Please post any other SoE rep profiles, posts, etc. you might find.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You forgot Absor. I seem to recall a thread based on comments by him about not needing all spells... Hmmm, it'll come to me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brenlo's comments (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21676&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=4) <br />
<br />
It was actually Brenlo that made the statement I think you are referring to.<br />
<br />
While it may be true that you do not have to acquire every spell to play the game, we do understand that it is nice to have them. For many players it is a goal to acquire them all. I think you will see some changes to allow for easier acquisition of some spells in the very near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PrathunEQ has also posted regarding LDON (&lt;3 Prathun).<br />
<br />
Brenlo did not make the original comment about &quot;needing spells.&quot; That was Absor on the GU forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ry(t)an on Bane of the Dragorn and Balance (detrimental focus extension apparently not working properly):<br />
<br />
<br />
I went and checked this out on test and it seems to be working normally.  <br />
The base duration of Nihil is 15 ticks and the bonus for the detrimental duration focus is a random 1-25% increase which will give you a bonus of 1-3 ticks or 16-18 total. (The math rounds down any fractions).<br />
<br />
I cast it several times on NPCs on test and the duration was always between 16 and 18 while using the focus effect.  So it seems to be working as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
If you're still having problems with it let me know and I'll look into it some more.<br />

Thanks - always happy to have Sony people visit (proving that attention is being paid), even if we (often/always/sometimes) don't like what we hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vahlar has posted several times as well, in direct response to questions about the shaman epic quests. &lt;3<br />
<br />
I completely agree with Samanna, I love it when SOE representatives post here. Even if I don't agree with the answer, it's nice to KNOW the truth, rather than just guessing.</div></div><hr />
