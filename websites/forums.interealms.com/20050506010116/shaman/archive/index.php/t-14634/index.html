<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Bear gazed around him. The snow blew across the tundra in a lazy fashion. In the distance, he saw the great mamoths searching for food in the desolate wilderness. The sun broke into a thousand colors, glistening off a tear, creeping unnoticed down his great white snout. Forgotten was the dispute with the dragon goddess which drove him from his homeland. Today the Soul Winds didn't blow, so he knew that Lady Vox slept, he was safe here at the moment.Weary paws lead him to the edge of the ice, a deep breath and a splash. The icy waters envigorated him, bringing back memories of cubhood. His mother gazing at him fondly, giving him a playful swat on the rear, to help him swim faster. The underwater cave loomed in front of him.<br />
<br />
He heard the giggling of the skeletons in the distance, their toe bones clicking on the rock floor. They didn't concern him, as they stayed out of his are of the cave and wouldn't bother him. At the mouth of his den, he faced forward one more time, and great muscles bunching smashed the side of the cave with a wide paw. Small rocks bounced off his head, but he ignored them, concentrating on his task. Several hits later, he heard a deep groan running through the cave. He quickly backed up, awaiting the outcome. Nothing happened. However, another smash by the great paw saw him retreat into his lair, pursued by a cloud of dust. <br />
<br />
As the dust cleared, he could see that the lair was now blocked by many large rocks. He was safe. Weariness washed over him like a drowning wave. Turning his back on the small openings the rocks left, he brushed off a space to lie, with a tired, sore paw. Turning around several times, he sank onto his side, not to rise again.<br />
<br />
He didn't know what the future held, but for now, he was safe and he was tired. Now was the time for sleep, As the blue eyes closed on a dark and silent cave, a last glint of light twinkled off a small piece of ice, stuck to the stainless white fur.<br />

Three and a Half years in the game was more than I ever expected to last.  I went from a n00b with a club in EF to killing every mob in VT.  It's been a great ride, but now it's time to call it quits.  My guild suffered a major loot problem when we started doing NToV easily (caused us to disband) and it happened again when we were easily doing VT.  I just don't have the energy or desire anymore to log in and play for hours and hours.<br />
<br />
Will I go to SWG?  I don't know.  All I know, is it's time to spend some time offline.<br />
<br />
Will I continue to keep up with The Crucible as Shaman Emeritis?  I probably will, for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck in real life.  I have always enjoyed reading your posts and am glad you will stick around to post a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As I stated before the boards went down, you will be missed brother. your witty, insightful  and no nonsense approach, will be impossible to replace.<br />
<br />
Peaceful journey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the sentiments guys, but it won't be hard to replace me.  Put your paw in water and pull it out, and watch how fast it freez......  wait wrong metaphore  ;)<br />
<br />
The Bear is now the Boogying Wookie on Eclipse (at least I got to chose my lip size!)  So far, it's VERY beautiful and fresh, we'll see how it is in two weeks though (so much for me going offline for awhile :)).<br />
<br />
On a side note, EQ was NEVER this buggy on its first days....  If you haven't done SWG yet, you don't KNOW buggy  (try healing someone for over an hour and then get it wiped out, THREE times).</div></div><hr />

You most log in and more along...constantly and repeatedly. Nightly if at all possible.<br />

Seriously though, know how it goes. Once the course is run...<br />

I don't know that I can stop posting....  It's the bear.....  He just keeps on walking and looking, it's HYPNOTIC!  I've just sat there for 30 secs watching him before, and said, &quot;WHAT are you doing, it's only a little gif!&quot;<br />
<br />
I bless the day I went trolling for something to make a good signature (couldn't pay Wally to make one for me now, could I?)</div></div><hr />

Hairy, animalistic, strong and a bit dumb looking .... think about it  :D <br />

On a sidenote - now that you don't waste your time with this addictice Evercamp, you have more time to post on messageboards, not less  ;)</div></div><hr />

Why?  I look at the boards at work..... that's because the boss frowns on me playing EQ :)</div></div><hr />

When reading long highly opinionated posts there are a few names I always look for while skimming though: yours is one.<br />
Sleep well Final and return to us if and when you are able&#8230;</div></div><hr />
