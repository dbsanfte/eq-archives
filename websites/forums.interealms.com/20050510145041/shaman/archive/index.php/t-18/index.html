<br />
A few questions for my fellow shamen (is that the correct plural for shaman?)<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Damage output - I'm currently hitting around 20-23 with my slime-coated harpoon (piercing and offense are maxed). Is this typical for my level?? It seems decent, yet I find creatures hitting back in the 40's at a comparable level to myself.<br />
<br />
2) With level 24 just around the corner is regen something that I should always keep up? It seems highly advantageous (especially with cana) but also very mana-intensive for such a relatively short duration spell. How do you use regen?  (mind you this is my only source of regen at the moment).<br />
<br />
3) hunting question (I know this should be in the hunting forum, but that seems to be down at the moment)- the crocs in oasis are quickly turning light blue (even the deepwaters). I really don't want follow the &quot;fast track&quot; route and go to LOIO. My playtime for the next few weeks is sporadic and limited so I need a good place to solo (something like oasis where I can login and bag a couple gators and log off). Any recommendations?<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use a Slimey as my main weapon of choice at 37 and my max damage on that is 27, and piercing is maxed. So, 20-23 damage sounds about right at level 24.<br />
With a weapon like a Slime Coated harpoon or most piercers for that matter, they have fast delay so you'e not going to hit as hard as the mobs do. You'll just hit more times than they do, if they are slowed. When soloing SLOW is a must. <br />
<br />
I keep regen up at all times when soloing, it helps for cannibalizing. Even more so when grouping. At 24 I kept it up all the time. <br />
I don't worry about it when I have full HP's, I'll canni to 50% then cast regen, and med up. <br />
<br />
Not sure what to say about fast track in LOIO...I'm an Iksar and I didn't have much choice I hunted in LOIO until 30. It yielded some of the best exp I could find at that level. I looked to other places as well...I also didn't want to follow the &quot;fast track&quot; but, it turned out to be a very good option for me.<br />
You could try Warslik Woods giant fort, it really depends on where you are(old World-vs-Kunark-vs-Luclin)  Staying in Oasis may not yield you much exp. <br />
One place you could try in the &quot;Old World&quot; that is relatively abandoned is Runnyeye. It's a dungeon but yields pretty good loot and good exp. Or the spires in the Karanas. <br />
Other than that I really don't know much else about the &quot;Old World&quot;...I spent 19-30 with both my SK and Shaman in LOIO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a 10 damage weapon I barely hit harder then you at 54 with piercing at 197.(once in a while I can poke for 40 if Im lucky and buffed to hell hehe)<br />

<br />
Well.. Im sure everyone has a different opinion on this.. but I generally at that level would fight and fight till i was oom and nearly out of health.. finda  safe place.. cann enough to drop a regen on myself and go afk to get a pop.. cann some more.. etc heh. Im somewhat lazy though =p<br />

<br />
Stonebrunt Mountains(off of odus) is a nice(and almost totally empty) place that I found wonderful to solo in. Personally I loathe LoIO, Oasis, Dreadlands and the entire &quot;fast track&quot; list heh.(probably due to my server.. those are all death traps =p). Killing kobolds in stonebrunt can rack you up a few bags of &quot;forlorn totems of rolfron zek&quot; which has 5 chargers of holy might(dd+stun cleric spell) that is shammy useable and has a pretty fast cast.. awesome item and NOT lore.. save up as many bags of these as possible.. will be WONDERFULLY handy as a higher level shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The amount of damage that you're doing seems about what it should be. I have a good spear and piercing is at 172 but I don't consistently hit for much harder. I average in the high 20s/low 30s with an occasional strike around 40. As your skill increases, your damage will increase. Also, being buffed and debuffing your opponent will influence how much you hit for. As to the question of keeping regen up, I try to keep it up at all times (chloro now). At your level, regen is pretty costly but it really does help if you are going to have to cannibalize alot. I group with alot of melee-types and if I don't consistently cannibalize, it's hard to match the pace. With regen up, you can do it though. Soloing, it's still very useful. It can help you if only because it can spare you from having to heal yourself after a fight. I'm not sure where I would recommend for you to hunt as I was in LoIO at your level. Although you have to endure tons of stupidity (annoying shouts/oocs, trains, etc..) if you pay attention, it is quite easy to solo there. You could easily log in, kill a few mobs and log right back out. The mill is a good place to rest/camp although you may want to avoid it (or endure endless sow/buff requests). I was happy to leave the lake, but the experience was good and it was an easy zone to solo in. I didn't do much dungeon crawling during those days so I can't say with certainty where you should go, but Runnyeye does seem like a good option. Also, Stonebrunt is great experience and with the occasional gem drop, the loot is pretty good too.  Just some ideas from my own experience. Hope they help you. Good luck in your travels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Output seems about right, as far as intake, consider changing your MOB diet. (I.E. If you can take the beatings AC-wise and have access to Luclin try Marus Seru Grayhoppers) I pull them to zone line and take my beating there. It hurts a bit, but exp is ridiculously high. If you can't take the beating, another good area to consider is Stornburnt Mt. I average half a blue in Dark-blue con's. And with only about a dozen people max in zone there are plenty of Mobs running around.<br />
<br />
As far as Regen goes, I also Solo most of the time due to limited playtime, I can't wait for Regen. I play in an old server which means that the economy is a bit out of whack, I have been saving up my pennies for an Ikky BP. Seen then go for 4-6kpp in NFP. I hate having to run from MOB when all they have left is &lt;100hps. But when they hit for avg 40hps and you are down to &lt;20. And OOM not much you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, shaman is the plural.<br />
<br />
regen is not very efficient as fodder for cannibalizing.  I always kept it up, though, and I think the habit of cannidancing was well established when I got chloro.  Also, if you solo, you probably don't wait for full hp, so it is a good heal yourself tool, even when not cannibalizing the mana back.<br />
<br />
at your level I was sitting on the treant camp in SK - best money I had ever made!  I stopped by there one morning (I like to buff the trolls and ogres there  heheh) and it was empty ... for the heck of it i killed for a while - made 100 pp in an hour .... if only it was exp, too !  the treants are level 22 to 25, so you are not going to solo them - groups were easy &quot;back in the day&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As the others said get into the habit of using regen. When soloing I keep it up at all times. When doing the root/dot routine, the mob breaks root then hits you a few times before you root him again. After you root you can just sit and let the regen work or canni if you need mana. As you lvl and get better regens it gets better mana wise.<br />
<br />
As for places to go. At your lvl I was in South Karana. If you can get the south spire at paw, the spawn there is single and respawns about ever 6 minutes. This will give you the time  to get your mana back up. Good exp here. If you want better exp you can go inside Paw. If you get a good group you can ride this place to 35 easy.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thing of note on the regen question, when you are low on hp and the mob breaks root, you can always kite it around a bit while regen works on bringing your HP back up to a level that you can go toe to toe with the mob to finish it off.<br />
<br />
As far as a weapon, at that level I think I was using either the Slimy or a Beetlestinger, and the average damage done was about the same as you have here. Now I am lucky enough to be the proud owner of a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang. It is something like 12/19, very fast (with a haste spell on me and slow on the mob I hit something like 8-10 times to the mob's 1), and I get hits in the 40's. Not always, but enough. I think the average damage would be about 30ish,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the feedback!!<br />
<br />
I hit level 24 last night (woot!!) and spent the rest of the evening playing around with my new spells.  The regen actually lasts longer than I thought and it REALLY helps while I solo (I fought a couple of deepwater crocs that were still dark blue). Canna doesn't seem terribly efficient at this level, but I do see where it could be useful if I go OOM. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the regen thing - if you are the primary healer in a group, you will want regen up on the MT any time they are not at full.  Regen is much more mana-efficient than a heal.<br />
<br />
As far as on yourself - if you are willing to cannidance, regen/cann is a slight profit even at 24, but if you just stand there and chain-cannibalize I believe I saw an analysis on this board that said it's approximately the same as just sitting and medding at your level.  The efficiency of cannibalize does get a bit better with more levels.<br />
<br />
Cannidance is a clear mana win, but it's time intensive and some people would just prefer to sit there and spend their time chatting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">More on Regen...<br />
<br />
Regen is your most effiecient heal.  If you are less than 100% health, or if you will soon be taking damage (or have less than 100% mana and will be canning) you should have it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I use Regen all the time with my Shaman. It has saved my WoodElf Tree Hugger Druid many'o times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Around level 24 the mobs start hitting harder than you do.  They will always do this, 20 40 80 100 220 it doesnt matter.  I have a 42 damage weapon and it hits for about 120ish max, and i miss a lot.<br />
<br />
Always keep regen up, use canni so you are a never quite at max hp (unless you are max mana).  This way you will me takeing full effect of the spell.  It costs a lot of mana now, but its good and it gets better.<br />
<br />
At level 24 you can seriously solo most anywhere you can find mobs to kill single approiate to your level.  You new posion dot is great, and you have regen/canni so your good to go.  Level 24 is when a shaman comes of age, and life doesnt suck anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drexzil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My personal favorite 24-30 solo spot is in Warsliks Woods at the entrance to Dalnir (pos 3500, pos 3950). When you go in you'll see three forks, left is a dead end, center is a three spawn of Skulking Brutes, right is a two spawn of Skulking Brutes and the entrance to Dalnir. The Brutes should con blue to even at 24, maybe a rare yellow. They will not aggro, even though they con KOS, and you can kill them right infront of each other because they do not assist. Pull with Walking Sleep, then Malise (they tend to be quite resistant at times), E Breath, Affliction (optional), Root and step back and med/regen while the dots go to work, repeat dots/root as needed. These things hit hard for their lvl, you will not be able to melee through the whole fight. Just remember, if you get into trouble, the zone to Dalnir is right there. Just be ready to zone back out of Dalnirs quickly, there is usually a lvl 30ish caster mob right inside.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of advantages to fighting here:<br />
1) They drop good loot (commonly drop gems worth 1-5pp each 2) This is an underused zone, usually the only people in it are <br />
Grachnist farmers, and maybe an occasional giant fort group. The best thing about this obviously is you are far away from the ignorant newbie /ooc and /shout spam of LOIO. :p <br />
<br />
Good luck and safe journeys</div></div><hr />
