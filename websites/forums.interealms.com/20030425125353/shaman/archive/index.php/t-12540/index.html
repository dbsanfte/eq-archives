<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once you combine the six reports from the City of Mist in the booklet you get from the Spirit Sentinal, is the combined booklet and reports a NO-RENT item?  I'm not actually to the point in the quest where I do this step, but I should be able to get the booklet since I spent some time redoing the Envy/Woe/Marr's Promise step of the quest to get up to max ally True Spirit faction.  Hurting for inventory space you see, it would be great if I could turn those six reports into a single item, instead of storing them seperately untill I get to the point that I can do the turn in.<br />
<br />
I suppose, technically, I don't even need to bother with all this since I already have max ally faction, but well, I'm enjoying doing the quest, and would like to do it through from begining to end.</div></div><hr />
