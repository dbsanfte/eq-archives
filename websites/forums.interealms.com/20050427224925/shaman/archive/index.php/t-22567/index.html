<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went out to EJ to talk to the senital spirit and do the turn in for my clicky SoW boots.<br />
<br />
I noticed the whole zone (at least what I saw of it) Con'd either LB or DB.<br />
<br />
I went back out there yesterday and solo'd for about 2.5 hours, netted myself a good chunk of experience (just over a full yellow). I only had to gate out once because I had about 5 DB adds.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this as a good soloing spot for lvl 52-53. The mobs don't hit that hard and even if you end up with 3 or 4, they don't resist anything, they weren't breaking root...  Me and Puppy were able to handle around 2 to 3 mobs at a time with ease. Gotta watch adds though, they tend to just pop out of no where. <br />
<br />
The cash isn't anything to write home about. But I still got a few plat and some vendor trash along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tbh ur better off going into COm.....has a higher zem, better loot and the mobs easier to pull.<br />
<br />
com is good upto 54 then quite alot of lightblues start appearing.  The upstairs in com is db till 57/58ish....u just need to get past a certain black reaver!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah. I'm just not sure about how easy it would be for me to solo out there.<br />
<br />
That's what I like about EJ... I can sit out there by myself for hours and not worry about getting into tooooo much trouble =)<br />
<br />
I might try going to CoM tonight with a couple of guildies and see what I can get myself into</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EJ..i never hunted there besides some dragon. i usually went to TT to kill some named =)<br />
ill try EJ with my wizzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've duoed and trioed with friends in EJ and it's a lovely little zone that's mostly empty any time we've been there. However, I have two huge problems with it, one reasonable and one not.<br />
<br />
Reasonable problem: It takes at least as long or longer for me to zone to and from EJ as it does to zone into the Plane of Lag (aka PoK) or the Bizarre (aka Bazaar). On the order of 125-220 seconds of zone time. That's ridiculous. Even if you're just travelling through to get somewhere else, that travel is painful because of the zone time.<br />
<br />
Unreasonable problem: The gorrillas and apes bug the heck out of me. Completely illogical, but the realism of the graphics for the flesh-stripped or diseased ones (tottering?) is disturbing enough that I have to really work to divorce myself from how they look and keep repeating &quot;just a game...just a game....&quot; I hate that it has such an effect on me because it makes me feel like a complete pansy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL, yes! those Gorillias are the absolute worst. They creep me out to no end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">reminds me that i still have an open issue with that green dragon :)<br />
i guess ill hunt him down and then leave EJ for good.</div></div><hr />
