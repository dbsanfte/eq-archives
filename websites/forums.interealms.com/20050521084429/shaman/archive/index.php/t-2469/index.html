<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have two accounts and two PC's and decided to start a twink character that I will power-level with my Shaman.<br />
<br />
The idea is that I will eventually play both characters at the same time.<br />
<br />
Couple questions...<br />
<br />
1. Which class? <br />
I started with a monk, and figure that is the best choice, but with all the new pet changes I am wondering if a Necro (or Mage) and his pet would be a viable choice. Also, what is it about a monk/shaman duo that makes it better than a warrior/shaman duo?<br />
<br />
2. What are the level limits for grouping?<br />
My shaman is 52 now, what level would the other character need to be to be able to group with the shaman? Is it 5 levels less?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would either choose a monk or sk.<br />
<br />
Monk for the damage and ability to mend.<br />
<br />
Sk for the tanking,damage and fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Both can also FD pull to help break camps so that's an added bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk or SK...best duo for a Shaman..hands down.<br />
<br />
Necro is also a great choice for Shammy duo..both pets tank and Necro and Shaman stack DoT's and fear kite...dangerous combo. Necro can also FD pull and be used as mana battery.<br />
<br />
Casters are hard to PL with a Shaman though...spell skills fall behind. Melee twink is much easier to PL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyntol12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Believe it or not I like rogue. Or at least once they get within level range of the main shaman. I dual box this setup, pull with slow, run back to the second box rogue just like he was your pet. Root mob in front of him, step in close and so rogue can never get aggro and backstab away. Step back if you need a heal or just want to med while your second box rouge tanks enough to get up his defensive skills. This seem the most effecient duo I've tried. rarely use any mana but cheap roots, a slow per pull and chloro. No special gear needed, rogues got trak tooth class weapons at 45, shaman has a iksar regen bp and odd pieces of jaudiced, no bracer, and still some rygor chain at 52. <br />
<br />
Admittedly I'm not fighting yellows or anything, I'm just pulling the same dark blues my shaman would solo, but killing them MUCH faster and will relatively no mana compared to the solo dot/root or dot/tank doggy route. Basically picture a backing stabbing dual wielding, double attacking pet who's actually worth casting a few buffs on:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like pretty much any melee class to duo with, it gives a different variety.<br />
<br />
If I had  a choice though I would say Monk, Ranger or Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
If you like outside zones more I would say Ranger over all.<br />
If you like Dugeons more then I would say Monk or Shadowknight over all.<br />
<br />
Also a Bard is nice but kind of difficult to play while playing another character.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that playing a monk will be the easiest boxing vs other classes, say a Necro for example where you have to consistantly cast spells and be alert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The minimum level your duo will need to be to group with you is 35. I think the formula is duo's level/2 + current level? ex: 35/2 =17.5 rounded off is 17. So 17+35 = 52.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, everything as been said about how melee's are easier to level etc... Personally, I'm laid back and a mage seems fine to me. The pets are nice tanks when you have a shaman, and I don't see mages that hard to power since they have damage shields and good pets. When the mage is caught up with you in levels, it should be a very nice combo. <br />
<br />
You have alot of what the magician doesn't, so you can fit in well. Regen for health, mana regen for extra damage, plus the mage has mod rods. The pet can tank or you with slow - if you tank, you could let the water pet backstab. Shamans usually take bigger mobs down kind of slow since you have to dot most of the time, with a mage, you could speed that process up with the nukes they get. That's a few of the things I was looking for. I didn't touch on the other spells they get, DS, CoH, also they get tons of nice summoning goodies.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on your play style. I'm kind of laid back, so I wanted a class to help with damage output, but I didn't have to put too much work into. I like putting effort into my shaman the most, so mages fit well - probably the best class as far as not needing much in equipment terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SK or Ranger hands down.  I'm not too sure about an sk, but i've spent the last 20 lvls and a pile of AA duoing with a ranger and snare is priceless.  For lvlin' up an SK might be the better choice because of the FD, but at 60 a ranger is a better companion imo.  Weaponshield and Trueshot/am3 are a pretty powerful combination.  <br />
<br />
Either one of them would be a nice choice, but snare is what makes both of these a better choice than a monk.<br />
<br />

oracle of test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rasaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually the formula for the minimum level of the duo is 2/3 the higher player's level... for 60 its 40 etc... may work out the same way... but imo this one easier to remember =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Monk - High DMG, FD, takes less dmg, Mend - No snare<br />
SK - Med DMG, Self heal a bit, Snare - Needs heals, lowish dmg output<br />
Ranger - High DMG, Track, Sow, Snare - Ranger down!<br />
Warrior - Good DMG - needs heals, desired in guilds.<br />
Paladin - Stuns (not good on paladins but they are rather good at the highest levels for sure)<br />
<br />
Only other class that I dont know as a melee for a shaman is the bard. I know their dmg output isnt that high but they do have some nifty songs.<br />
<br />
I would prefer any melee over a caster for a shaman partner though the best would be a necro i suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The rogue is an incredible class for a shaman to duo with and when I was around level 54-55 I power leveled a rogue on a second computer to 50 in a months real life time, about 7 days played and even spent time in that span raiding with the rogue, helping out with crs and practicing skills.  Besides that rogues are really fun to play with all their cool abilities and they dish out a ton of damage.  Just root the mob on your pet or yourself so they can continuously backstab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm currently dual box PLing a warrior and love it. He makes a level every 20 - 30 min, while still keeping his skills up to max.  Took him to PC at 15 yesterday evening, he's 20 this morning.<br />
The advantage of the warrior is the large number of hitpoints. At 20 my warrior has around 1000, so I don't have to worry about his health a lot. And if he needs a heal he can use the full superior withouth waste of mana. And with HoS and alac on he mows the lawn even without serious twink gear.<br />
I think the avantages of a monk as duo partner don't come till much later, when you can really use the FD ability to help with camp breaking.  But until then it's a lot of work keeping him alive at low levels due to the low HP (my warrior still qualifies as a hardcore character).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mez partner wid a warrior all da time now... /target Avaa /hug... and she is great, but if mez was going to pick a class to box with it would not be a warrior.<br />
<br />
The primary reason is safty.  Warriors have very limited choices when faced wid a bad pull,  a) run b) fight.<br />
<br />
An SK / Monk can FD while da shaman gates to safty.<br />
Necro can FD or gate also.<br />
<br />
Warrior is a guud partner and we have a lot of fun.  We form the core of a guud group...  add Rogue and a Monk and we can kill a lot.  Add some CC and Evack and we can go a lot.  So Gerka happy Ogre,  but if mez just optimize for 2 boxes then mez pick either SK or Monk  (probably SK).<br />
