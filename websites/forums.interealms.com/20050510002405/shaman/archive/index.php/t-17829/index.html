<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not elemental access yet, so I have no frame of reference about them.<br />
<br />
But I think I like Agnarr the best so far.  He looks very cool.  I wish I wasn't so lagged in that zone when 100+ people are in it.  <br />
<br />
Magnetic Behemoth is a close second, because it can be so quick and easy.  <br />
<br />
Bertox is the worse.  It was hard to stay awake.  It should be interesting because it's busy, but it's not for whatever reason.  I'm mostly swapping buffs for folks who keep dropping along the way.  <br />
<br />
I've died 3 times on MM so far, so getting that one will be good.  I wasn't there when the guild did drop him.  He also looks pretty cool, but the graveyard aggro is a bit of a pain.  <br />
<br />
VZ (the archer one) is fun, because I like his fighting animation.  He hunches over his bow and lets it fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agnarr is my favorite so far. I haven't done saryn, bertoxx, or sol ro myself, so can't comment on them. Also have not been to elemental so can't comment on those either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have not done Agnarr yet but MB is my favtorite by far.  Its crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tallon Zek is actually the one who uses the bow.<br />
vallon is the one who clones himself at 50 life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like Solusek Ro -- easy to get to, fast fight.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule is another fun fight IF you can get everyone to PoNB in one piece, which is usually a pain.<br />
<br />
For a little wildness, Behemoth is fun.<br />
<br />
Worst?  Bertoxx is awful, I agree.  I'll also stack Saryrn up there because the mobs on the way to the god really shouldn't be harder than the god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Coirnav because there is no CH cycle and it just takes 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Bertoxxolous when you can AoE everything and do it in an hour.<br />
<br />
Both are none stop action and not the standard keep the MT alive and win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think one of the best fights is xegony .... and MABY  rathe  yes call me psyco on that one  :D    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes it does suck doing rathe with 2 shaman heh but it keeps you on your toes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like any fight that breaks from the standard debuff, CH rotation.<br />
Most the big mobs with standard cleric CH rotation are just  :o <br />
<br />
Saryn, TT, Rallos Zek are all pretty fun in that regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">MABY  rathe  yes call me psyco on that one  :D    <br />
<br />
<br />
Learning to do the Rathe was fun, enjoying doing the Rathe is definately psycho though =P<br />
<br />
Although I hate PoW (I just hate underwater zones) I would have to say that Coirnav is the most fun &amp; satisfying fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not elemental here (just missing RZ) and just got to Sol Ro so cant comment on those.<br />
<br />
I dont particuarly like the ones after the first time that reqire a lot of fighting to get there or spawn the boss, so that takes Saryrn and Bertoxx out.  The scripts for Agnarr, TT and Saryrn are kinda neat, but all easy/boring once you know what to do.  VZ is a neat idea, but like the others, pretty easy.  They were all fun for me the first time, except VZ.<br />
<br />
I guess if I had to pick, I like any of the fast fights that dont have much of a script attached to them.  Aerin`Dar, Grummus, Behemouth, TZ and MM (he looks the coolest, throwing his glowing sword in the air).<br />
<br />
If I had to vote for 1 fight, Ill say MM, that place can be a mad house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thoroughly enjoy TT, and TZ (also for the animation, but as well for the emote of pinning bodies to walls :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well my favorite so far has been Saryrn, sorrowsong keeps things interesting ... hate getting to her tho.  . Agnar fun too but we havent beat him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some people may hate this one, but Dust in Plane of Air is becomeing my favorite.  The clearing in air is boring as hell, but once you get to the archwalkers, then it becomes fun.  Every member of the raid needs to know there, when to attack, and when to back off.  As for Sigismond, he is just a sick mob that can chew up a MT in about 3 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So far my favorite pop fight has to either be Terris Thule, or possibly RZTW. All the clearing for RZTW is annoying (especially the gindan guys that split) but the fight itself was and is still a tremendous adrenaline rush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Coirnav, win or lose yer done in 15</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I &lt;3 Xegony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">rathe and coirnav.<br />
<br />
my least favorite before i quit EQ was xegony, because i was generally the curer for the tank :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like Bertox. I guess it's my chanter background talking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm.. well<br />
<br />
My all time favorite fight is still Tallon Zek in Tactics.  I mean, his animations just rock.  There is just something about a mob that shoots you with arrows.  Hell, i don't even do a lot of dmg in this fight, but I love watching him work.  <br />
<br />
Second fav would be prob Coirnav, cause I get to pull and cause give or take it is over in 15 min.  3rd would be PoEb Warlord.  This is the only mob where I just go full out using AE rains and see how much dmg I can do in it.  Very very fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'll agree with TT, lots to keep shamans busy in that fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Quarm without a doubt, i love seeing the heads drop off one by one...<br />
<br />
We had a GM tagging along by our raid recently who did an ae gnome illusion just before we engaged Quarm.  U can imagine the hilarity that ensued from a load of gnomes ganking one big one called Quarm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Defintely Rathe.</div></div><hr />
