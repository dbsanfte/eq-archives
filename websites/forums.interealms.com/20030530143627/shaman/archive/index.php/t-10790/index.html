Just an FYI.<br />
<br />
And dont say because he gave his ac**** info out to so and so because it wasn't from that. I know some fool is going to claim this, just getting it out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a tip (not saying that what you are reporting to us &quot;can't&quot; be regarding EQIM, but imho i seriously doubt your friend has been hacked because he is using EQIM..) but you should recommend your friend to get a firewall (and antivirus if he doesn't have too).<br />
why? well, some of the new trojan just can install themselves on a computer using some of microsoft &quot;way too many&quot; bugs. no need to clic on a file nowdays to have a virus.. a computer with a lack of security (wich means often: default installation !!) is the aim of this new worms/trojans.<br />
once on the computer, they grant full acces to a computer wich is not protected.<br />
regularly updated antivirus  could detect and eradicate them, and if they failed on a brand new virus/trojan.. well, at least the firewall would block their attempt to communicate with the internet and whoever is trying to gain acces on your computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree with Kowalsky's scenario.  However it's not due to bugs - bugs are simply errors that prevent the code from performing as it is supposed to.  Microsoft's problems are in design - their abyssmal security holes are typically pure and simple design oversight - that they then band-aid over with equaly leaky patches.<br />

Hi, Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sinjura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depending on the firewall it could be using a general assumption or rule, classifying that type of traffic within a certain port range as Trojan Horse attacks, etc. It really depends on the firewall software.<br />
<br />
If you wanna really be safe setup a *nix box as your gateway and configure your own firewall.<br />
Granted majority of people won't know what the hell I'm talking about or how to do it, but lol hey that's about as secure as I can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is his firewall detecting, and blocking, a Trojan Horse virus being sent to his computer <br />
<br />
First off firewalls don't detect trojans. This is his firewall seeing UDP packets coming from EQIM servers and, because of a default rule, alerting as POSSIBLE trojan activity. Going by the above traceroute, there is nothing suspicious about the packet in question as it is originating from a sony ip.<br />
<br />
Most untweaked intrusion detection systems or firewalls will alert/block UDP packets in the reserved port ranges. Especially for ports like the above, not registered as being used by a legitimate program. EQ itself communicates on ports in this range also.<br />
<br />
There are really only two realistic ways to have your account compromised. 1. Give out your account info to someone else or 2. Leave your machine unprotected without an antivirus program and allow a trojan horse to be installed. While there are other ways than these 2 I don't think you willl see anyone go to the effort the other options entail just to gain access to an EQ account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&gt; What does that all mean Panamashammy?<br />
<br />
It merely means nothing SOE writes takes into account firewalling at all. EQIM uses exactly the same network protocols as EQ itself does, and is thus no more or less secure than EQ is.<br />
<br />
[ This has many drawbacks, among them being that it is one of the least firewall-friendly software packages imaginable and it has none of the features you might reasonably expect from a messenger program. On the plus side, lots of IM software has too many features and many of them are so ill-conceived that they constitute substantial security risks. Overall, it's a wash. ]<br />
<br />
In this case, the firewall is pointing out that the source address on the Sony server happens to use a port number that is the same as that used by a well-known trojan horse program. The same thing happens when you run EQ, and it's perfectly benign; it happens because the EQ server code and network protocols were not designed with the existence of firewalls in mind and thus they generate all kinds of false alarms.<br />
<br />
Sony could change the EQ network protocols so that they don't generate traffic which can be mistaken for threats, but clearly they don't see doing so as being sufficiently worthwhile to them. <br />
<br />
In the specific case of personal firewalls (such as the one the above log comes from) you can get around this by configuring it to recognise the EQ or EQIM program itself and give it specific permission to bypass the firewalling. Alternatively (and for firewalls running on separate boxes) you have to configure the firewall to treat any traffic going to the specific IP addresses Sony uses as being &quot;trusted&quot;.<br />
<br />
&gt; If you wanna really be safe setup a *nix box as your gateway and configure your own firewall. <br />
<br />
EQ is so firewall-hostile this would be an exercise in pure frustration; the same problem will occur, namely that the port numbers used by both the client and server ends of the connection are chosen by the host OS, and so virtually any combination of port numbers can occur. That means you have to let any traffic to sony's network be unfiltered, and you will periodically have to reconfigure your firewall when Sony happen to move the IP addresses of the servers around (as they do from time to time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heck... my virus scanner quarantines trojans just about weekly... and the ONLY thing I download is the EQ patcher stuff... don't have EQIM.  Let's face it... the gaming connection is NOT safe, no matter what game you're playing.  EQ is better than many... but still not 100% safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shanelle, your virus scanner is detecting trojans weekly?  Norton and McAfee (on different systems) have detected ONE virus on my system in the past 3 years of playing EQ, and that one came in via Outlook and had nothing whatsoever to do with EQ.  If you're getting that many, you need to figure out where they are coming from, because it's not from EQ.<br />
<br />
You need to run Shields UP!, a great little utility from http://www.grc.com, and see if you have shared devices that are accessible from the network.  It is possible that you are getting trojans &quot;pushed&quot; to your machine from outside.<br />
<br />
I'm with the majority of tech-savvy folks here, the traceroute above doesn't prove anything; this is more than likely a simple false alarm reported by the firewall software in response to an unusual but technically legal use of UDP packets by EQIM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tetarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have worked in a network admin job for 9 years now, and 'stolen' user passwords are something that we have had to deal with many times. I would guess that upwards of 90% of passwords that are stolen (or in this context accounts that are &quot;hacked&quot;) are done so through simple social engineering. <br />
<br />
Yes, even if you don't want to hear it, that means that 9 times out of 10, no matter how much the user screams up and down that they didn't, 90% of the time they told their password to someone else. Even if they only told their best friend, or their son or daughter who &quot;wouldn't do anything like that&quot;, they never believe you until you show them the connection logs, the date and time to the second of the connections and the IP and IP addresses used. And still, after you show them the logs with the IP address of their friend's computer, they still don't believe you.<br />
<br />
Just from these cases that I have investigated, again I would say at least 90% of unauthorized account usage is by someone who has been willingly given the password. About half of the other 10% is owing to poor password selection (picking an easily guessed password, such as your birthday, dog's name, wife's name, something stupid like that), or a password being written down where it can be found by someone else.<br />
<br />
I would compare the chances of someone using actual technical computer skullduggery to get your password to those of being struck by lightning. No matter how much you trust whomever-it-is, if you give someone else your password you are a complete and total fool, and are just plain asking for it. No two ways about it.</div></div><hr />

It was really strange though after he got his account back because whoever hacked him had planned on keeping that account for a long time. He made a twink on the account and put a bunch of equipment on him, some equipment that wasn't even from that account. Had him parked in Grimling Forest and was trying to get the Claw of Sonic Howler earrings.<br />
<br />
I was once hacked through AIM. The guy stole my yahoo mail account and my ICQ (both which I got back). And how do I know it was from AIM? It was the only thing that I had up for an extended period of time. I left it on when I went on vacation and that is when I got hacked. I had never given out the info on those accounts.<br />

Is there any negative effects of having a firewall?<br />
<br />
Answer: Absolutely positively yes.  If you don't have a firewall of some sort (hardware or software based) your computer will be attacked and likely compromised.  If you would mind having your hard drive erased, your quicken files stolen, your machine used to attack other machines, or a trojan installed to record your keystrokes (like your EQ account and password), please get a firewall.<br />
<br />
Only negative affects are the complexity and getting some programs to work that don't like firewalls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Urdegish:<br />
<br />
Definatly have a firewall program up.  Windows is insecure by design (MS chooses ease of use over security) and people find new exploits all the time.  All they need to do is find one new exploit, install software on your machine &amp; can snoop passwords.<br />
<br />
Just something as simple as a firewall to report all inbound &amp; outbound connections will allow you to atleast stop unauthorized transmissions out.  If you see a program you don't recognize sending out data, tell the firewall to halt it &amp; see if it breaks anything.<br />

This helps for stuff outside coming in, ZA catches bots installed on your PC from reaching out.  For the price (free) you can't beat it.  With EQ functioning in WINDOWed mode, you can respond and authorize the programs requests for internet access.<br />
<br />
If you have a intelligent EMAIL package that stupidly executes foreign matter attachements, you also need Virus Protection.  <br />

Lastly, websites are getting way to clever with pop up code.  when you are surfing, you need something that denies pop up execution like ADAWARE or PROXOMITRON.  It would suck to get hacked by a bot placed by an ad.<br />

<br />
Most people give out their account info, from there, they typically WRITE DOWN YOUR ACCOUNT NAME/PASSWORD On some form of media.. typically a COMPUTER FILE?<br />
<br />
a VERY large portion of internet users use Cable connections... without firewalls...<br />
<br />
so... an experienced hacker could somewhat easily get into the grouputer, look through files... check your &quot;my Documents&quot; folder.. see &quot;EQ Passwords.txt&quot; and walla, more accounts hacked...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
or, People d/l &quot;EQ Parsers&quot;, which then record keystrokes and see what your password is as you log in...<br />
<br />
<br />
or people d/l trojan horses...<br />
<br />
<br />
99% of time hacking is because of end-user lack of security... Sony is rather strict on recovering account names/passwords..<br />
<br />
1) You need CD Keys to get password, ok if those are stolen..<br />
2) Your 'new' password set for you account is sent to your CURRENT e-mail address (before you have a chance to change if it you loose it, so someone cant change your e-mail address then request your password obviously)<br />
3) If neither works, you have to give them:<br />
First/Last name, Credit Card, account name, e-mail address(that they have on record), CC experation date, And i think even mailing address... and if a 'hacker' can do all this listed here, you have a LOT more worries about the hacker using your credit card and running up a HUGE bill then you have to worry about him using it to get your pfft, EQ account info...<br />
<br />
<br />
so again, most 'hacking' is actually someone not securing their computer/connection, downloading 3rd party EQ programs, or downloading Viruses(sometimes disguised as programs)</div></div><hr />
