<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redseal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would like some advice on where to hunt?  Or anyone know of a spot that works well for this duo, which are two-boxed.<br />
<br />
Would like to hunt in Velious.  I have COV faction and Dwarf faction, and wants to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Both characters don't have too good of gear though.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Ry'Gorr fort in EW has some good drops.<br />
<br />
Ulthorks in EW would be good XP for the 44 and excellent cash from the Ulthork tusk quest.<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadow is always an option.</div></div><hr />
