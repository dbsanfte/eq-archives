<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, big accomlishment.  They griefed The Dating Game.  If they were funny about it might have been worth reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That was LAUGHS! I was crying near the bottom of the page!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was laughing so hard I was crying.<br />
<br />
I don't know what's funnier - the poor souls playing, desperate for attention hoping to get cybered, or the responses from the smart a$$es.<br />
<br />
That one goes into the fav's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I damn near crapped my pants, some pretty funny stuff in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOl, i remember laughing soo freaking hard when i first saw that on somethingawful...<br />
<br />
i also remember falling backwards out of my chair and nearly knocking myself unconsious because of it :X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So bad, it was funny.  :D<br />
I felt my IQ dropping the entire time I was reading it, yet I finished the whole thing.  I miss that kind of juvinile humor.<br />
<br />
I give it 2 brain cells down, way down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After going to the Something Awful site, I decided to go to the Sony site to take a look at some of their games. That dating game is just as funny as those screen shots! I love it when people mess with those types of games. :p</div></div><hr />
