I assume you are just saying these things would be nice because there is no way in hell we'd ever get them.  How about a right click 2 second strike of solusek?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You  know, when I got my BP I thought I would NEVER use the SLTW clicky. But, during a short notice raid (big 3.5 group) to raid the tower bosses, I found myself in the middle of tell hell. You want Speed? Pfft! ask a chanter...What? NO CHANTER!!!!<br />
<br />
click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, <br />
<br />
WOOT! Raid has speed! <br />
<br />
Well, I don't expect it to be used often, but it did come in handy once! The only problem is, I had to have another shaman slow because I was continually re buffing the raid with speed...<br />
<br />
Yep, that effect REALLY needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />

Talisman of Alacrity and be done with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The ornate was actually a step back for me in most slots, but you can't beat the effects.  IH4 and especially the MP4 (that is 400 mana for me) are just godly.  I used to be a ToA fan, but now, with the clicky SLTW I haven't loaded it in months.  Not sure about the pants, only piece I'm missing (but for the barf helm).  I'm getting used to PE holding the mobs rooted for a decent time, not sure I want to go back to GI. So there is a change I'd like to see.<br />
Gloves effect gives me a faster casting nuke at same mana and better DPS then VS. No real problem there, so spell haste 4 would have been nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yah i wear the arms and boots.  Overall, I'm at about the same number of hps as before, but the effects are a help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, ToA sux.  I never use it.  What's the point in lowering group dps by 10% ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would rather &quot;ToA and be done with it&quot; personally because the constant cast and recast on SLTW will slow me and my group far more than the 10% people lose in haste.  <br />
<br />
Cast times alone for hasting with BP, or with spell will chew gaping holes into your canni time, which will hurt your mana production, and slow your ability to do DPS and heal.  I don't know about anyone else here, but I do consider my DPS to be valuable, and 10% less haste on a haste that lasts an hour for one cast for everyone is a fair trade.<br />
<br />
Also realize, if your group consists of say priest, shaman, melee, melee, caster, caster, you are only losing a little haste off the 2 melee, it doesn't affect your casters damage at all, so it does not represent nearly a 10% reduction in group DPS.<br />
<br />
If anything it keeps DPS more consistant since the melee don't have to bitch every few minutes when SLTW fades yet again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have the legs and I love the clicky root.  comes in very handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have the breastplate, the arms, and the gloves.  I find the breastplate effect to be very useful (more so in experience groups than raids, though I have used it on raids when enchanters were unavailable or low on mana).  The arms have so far not proven to be tremendous, but more healing for the same amount of mana is still more healing for the same amount of mana any which way you look at it.  I expect these will seem more useful when I finish getting the healing adept AA points.  The gloves I find useful because they make spear of torment more mana-friendly.  As much as I like the big numbers of Velium Strike, I have to admit that Spear Of Torment is faster and interferes less with my canni-routine (which means more mana in the same amount of time).  <br />
<br />
I prefer petrifying earth to greater immobilize, so I'm not -too- interested in the legs.  They would be nice to have, as an emergency root when virulent paralysis fails (and also to free up a spell slot) though.  <br />
<br />
I would like the headpiece, for the permanent acumen.  What can I say, I just like acumen.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SCRM makes SLTW bearable, same goes for avatar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the bracers with FT2 are very useful.  I went for HP when I had a chance, and now I find I'm behind with FT items.  The bracers have pretty decent stats and the FT effect helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OR, SCRM makes ToA even better.  Not to mention Blessing of Replenishment.  It was funny, last night we went down to do the 2 non-dragon HoH trials.  I buff up the group when we get to the crypt, we wait around 10 mins for stragglers to run/get CoH'ed in, buff up, etc, we do the trial, random off 5 spectrals, everyone invises up, travels over to the Virgins trial, a few people hit see invis, we drag bodies, kill some aggro mobs, and start buffing...<br />
<br />
err, all my buffs were still there.  Including BoReplenishment.<br />
<br />
THAT made the 20 AAs worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Change legs effect to snare...<br />
change tunic to gate to nexus<br />
gloves --- summon weapon<br />
bracer --- fd<br />
boots --- summon true spirit (chain pets)<br />
arms --- rapture<br />
helm --- illusion female dark elf<br />
<br />
I'd have to put all these under the never happen category and most of them would be steps backwords compaired to current effects.<br />
<br />
Boots- Not an issue for me personally but for most people giving up Mana pres for free summons of our crappy pet is a bad trade. Unhasted unbuffed no weaponed our pets pretty much suck. Being able to haste them, buff them and feed them weapons is what makes them useful.<br />
<br />
Arms- rapture, useless spell. It's capped at level 60 mobs so would be mostly useless in PoP or other high end zones and Improved healing is actually a nice focus.<br />
<br />
Tunic- gate to nexus is worthless. We can already gate anyway. You want to gate to nexus just bind there. If you want to be able to bind else where and gate to the nexus just do the necklace quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had no difference in xp loss using ToA vs. sltw.   If in a heavy melee group, that's what they get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There's no excuse to use ToA.<br />
Use sltw, if you have more than a group to buff actually mem it instead of clicking bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I laugh at you shaman that use ToA.  Do you ask for c2 instead of c3 as well because it costs less mana?  Do you ask for aego instead of Virtue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have often asked for KEI instead of VoQ because it lasts longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I laugh at you shaman that use ToA.  Do you ask for c2 instead of c3 as well because it costs less mana?  Do you ask for aego instead of Virtue?<br />
<br />
When you get 4 AA's in a few hours with either ToA or swtl in Fire or Earth plane, your laugh is pretty pointless, Juujuu.   Whatever works for efficiency, with the same results.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Also, ToA sux. I never use it. What's the point in lowering group dps by 10% ?<br />
<br />
/set mode = pedant<br />
<br />
Even if you assume that you melees have no haste items, you don't reduce the groups DPS by 10% by using ToA instead of SLTW.<br />
<br />
Base damage = 100<br />
SLTW Damage = 160<br />
ToA Damage = 150<br />
<br />
ToA damage is 150/160 = .9375 = 93.75% of SLTW damage (6.25% reduction in damage)<br />
<br />
If you melees have 41% hate items, it becomes :<br />
Base = 141<br />
SLTW = 200 (cap)<br />
ToA = 191<br />
<br />
ToA = 191/200 = .955 = 95.5% (ToA is only a 4.5% reduction from the SLTW damage)<br />
<br />
That doesn't include any damage from procs or spells. Neither of which is going to be reduced by a lower haste.<br />
<br />
/set mode=normal<br />
<br />
That being said, of course SLTW is more effective than ToA and I would (usually) chose SLTW to buff melees.</div></div><hr />
