<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetingss all,<br />
    Well here goes, I was messin round Power Levelin a Beasty friend of min when i discovered this but heck i may be behind the times. We were pullin fast (well i was pullin em with slow hehe) and were starting to get a heck of a pile of bodies around us i had my pet parked and sitting there so when it got to less than 50% the Mutt would go in and finish the job.  Anyway we had a lot of corpses around us and i started looting them to clear up the area alittle. I was giving the weps to my dog but i had &quot;others hits&quot; off and my BL friend said to me &quot;Hey why is your dog Slashing now?&quot; so i turned on the hits and he sure was... Fast Forward to the next day in Echo Caverns. I was hunting at the Taskmaster area and my friend Fireclaw poped I smacked him around alittle and when i finished him off he had a tallon. Now i was holding one to give to my BL friend later and didnt really feal like ditching it so i /ooc-ed that there was a Tallon in the Taskmaster area. no responces and i have an ethical problem with letting items rot. then i remembered that my pet could use weps so i was like &quot;hrm wouldn't it be neet if he could proc the effect....&quot; so i threw the first Tallon to Goner and looted the recent drop for my BL friend. Well Poor Goner's will wasnt strong enough to command that weapon (LVL 49 pet) but that made me start thinkin bout an old (and Cheep) rogue weapon that i used to use... The Serrated Bone Dirk it begins Procing Engulfing Darkness at LVL 27 and is Rogue only.  so i ran off to the Bazaar and picked one up for about 20pp then went back to Echo and went to soloin in TM area again now i always buff my pet with HoS, Alacrity, and Cloro and that poor dog was spending more time casting Engulfing Darkness then i was Cannin hehe.<br />
<br />
The Serrated Bone Dirk has now become my Favorite wep to give to Goner when i am soloing in an area with runners and they are not Lore so i usually keep a backpack of them on me :) Anywho this may be some new info for some and some of the more wily shamen might have other ideas on Weps to use for your pets...<br />
<br />
2 questions now<br />
1) What are some of the pet weps you like<br />
<br />
2) Does the Mage/Necro trick of giving a High Dmg wep (Weighted axe) work with the dogs?<br />
<br />
Thank ya and Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ... not so much of a secret anymore, but the pet using weaps is a known bonus for us.  Giving it it 2 weaps allows for it to dual wield and it attacks more.  First weap you give goes to primary, next to secondary.<br />
<br />
I like the following weapons for my pet:<br />
Serated bone dirk<br />
dagger of dropping<br />
gnoll hide lariat (dualing these a pet is a spellcasters worst nightmare)<br />
velium weaps when I'm not going to root park (dualing velium weapons with focus and primal up my pet procs about 10-12 times per 2 minute fight for some free damage)<br />
<br />
BTW, I tried to give it an axe of frost and the attacks were all bites and no slashes, as well there were no procs.  I figure the pet wasn't using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres some nice mage summoned weapons now with procs and hp's and stuff.. <br />
<br />
Fist of Ixiblat - procs a 150dd<br />
Kedge Sword - procs and 50hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always buy up all the Gnoll Hide Lariats when I hit the bazaar.  They are quite often 10pp or less and If I know its gonna be a long hunting session, I give a couple to the dog.  Absolutely amazing, especially against casters.<br />
<br />
I will have to look into the SBDs for those fleeing monsters, never thought of that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's the coolest thing I've ever heard!!!!<br />
<br />
But I have a question, do I have to buy a weapon for each time I want Goner to use one?  Or is there a way to recover weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You'll have to buy them Durdend.  Buying 2 regular daggers will enable dual wield and will increase the nuber of attacks on our lvl 55 pet (the one we summon with the 55 spell).  I'm not sure if this feature exists on lower level pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll test it on my pet tongiht and post results tomorrow on whether it applies to lower lvl pets.  In all likelihood, the lvl34 pet will not be able to dual weild, but the weapon will increase attack speed and will proc if the proc lvl is less then lvl24 (the lvl34 pet spell summons a lvl24 doggie everytime right?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You might not want to spend the money on a procing wep for the LVL 34 pet as its base level is 22-27 but with the new pet mod i think he will always be 27 the SBD begins procing at 27 or 30 (might want to look it up on alla's) so you may be getting the &quot;your pets will.....&quot; message alot. Also i dont believe that our pets get the Dual Weald untill the 44 or 49 pet (not sure on this one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Confirmed! Code Alpha!<br />

My level 44 pet is a go. Velium weapons and Lariats proc as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's at least intentional enough that VI has never addressed the situation as a bug and has indirectly acknowledged it because our pets are using the /guard command correctly and only warrior models can use /guard.</div></div><hr />

I turned on &quot;other hits&quot; and Doggy was hitting as hard and harder than me...I think I max at 45 a hit with my REIF right now.<br />

Outstanding.  Must test project alpha at earliest convenience.  Will report results as they are confirmed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">question : does it matter in what manner you give the weapons to your dogdog? do I put both in one 'give window', or give one weapon to him at a time?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I JUST dinged 44 today and I can't even describe how excited I was to read this and find out not only could my doggy weild weapons and proc, but he can DUAL wield. [face_shock]<br />
<br />
Bloodgill Goblins beware!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You have to give him one weapon at a time, first one is primary second one secondart. My favorite thing to do is give him a good procing weapon first then a velium weapon in secondary since the secondart wont proc as much but it is good to get the dual wield and increased DPS. Dragonhorn Yaks are great for primary.<br />
Interesting enough, I gave pet fireclaw talons and since it is a H2H weapon his DPS was not as high since he is a warrior not a monk or bst, also he would not dual wield with a slasher in secondary after the talons, all hits were H2H :(</div></div><hr />

Much love for mob xxx getting hit with velium ... hehe<br />

Though mage weapons work just as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im approaching level 34 and looking forward to dogdog, when can improved alpha dogdog be a go?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">what things in GD drop velium weapons, might try it out, close to 34 now, although im gonna do DSP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Giants in GD drop velium weapons.  Actually, coldain do as well.<br />
<br />
Can't comment on the 34th pet, but the 39th pet dual wielded everytime.  Just turn other's hits on and give Dogdog one slash weapon and one piercing weapon, and watch to see that he does both.  Alternately, you could give him two weapons with different procs and see that both proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hi ho telosk, if your in DSP give me a tell as thats where i'll be after 10pm UK time and i'll sort you out with that shoulder item and earring. Its damm good XP in DPS, at your level grab c3 in the bazaar and solo the mushrooms at the mushroom temple, they will give you 1-2% XP per kill. You can usually pick up a group there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm on giant faction so for about 1/2 daily I slaughter dirfs for their weapons to give to goner.<br />

Its cheap, its fun... and at 65 painless</div></div><hr />
