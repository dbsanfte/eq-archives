<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok -- I need to get some drops for Shawl 7 from Siren's Grotto and have never been there, save to succor through on my way to WW. Should be good XP for 50s folks -- and with luck, we'll learn how to navigate the zone as well (for those times when succor just isn't available).<br />
<br />
Drops needed for Itchy are <br />
<br />
* Swordfish Tooth (no drop, lore)<br />
* Molkor Hide <br />
<br />
Runed Sea Shell (Enduring Breath) would be a spare at this point.<br />
<br />
All are welcome -- Members, Recruits, and their guests. EB gear highly recommended. I can supply Waterstones, though can be dispelled. MR gear valuable if we decide to play with Sirens (casters - they charm).<br />
<br />
Timing dependent on getting an experienced guide.<br />
<br />
Trying for something this Saturday or Sunday, working around the scheduled guild raid on Saturday night.<br />
<br />
If you want to join in, or can serve as a guide, please respond here...<br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />
