<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started to play again after over a year off and rolled up a ranger first.   Well i have gotten him to lvl 52 and was thinking of starting up a shaman to duo with him.  Before i quit i had a 65 shammy with around 60 something aa's and my guild was just starting to break into the elemental's.  I gave my old account away as selling it just seemed wrong.  Since then my shammies name has been changed and sold twice from what i can gather.  I know that the game has drasticly changed since God and OoW have come out and was wondering if a shaman could do much of anything post 65 without his GoD spells.   Especially the innate resist mod slow spell Nihil something or other.   I was thinking of letting the shaman tank and the ranger do dps as i'm very familiar with how hard it is to kill a shammy.   My main question was with the new changes due to spell lines especially the panther lepeord line do you think it would be viable to even roll up a shammy or just kinda let it be?  I would do very few if any raids as my time is very limited.  I play less then 10 hours a week.  If i'm lucky i can spend some time on the weekends.   My old guild is far into OoW and very seldom does anything in the time i am alloted to play so twinking from them and pling just isn't an option.  Please post your opinions here and give me an idea of what the new game is like post 65.  Before that i know that it would be very easy to duo the two toons thru just about any content.   Once i get may ranger up to lvl 62 with eq and am3 and headshot mobs will die very fast.  My concern is post tier 2 tier 3 pop would i be gimped?<br />

Just look at some of the jaded old has beens floating around here whining about it all day........ Best bet is to find a class board that isn't crying and play that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>necrognomicon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe every class whines and moans and cries about this that and the other. <br />
<br />
Personally i like the idea of making shamans being able to slow most mobs one step further than other classes ie normal mob that can only be partially slowed by chanters etc can be mostly slowed by shms. Might make us more appealing especially with bsts supposedly getting their better slow. <br />
<br />
Only a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">post tier 2 tier 3 pop would i be gimped?Whatever class you try, you will not have raid-drop  equipment unless you raid.  So compared to people who raid, you would be gimped:  there would be things that high-level-raiders can do that you won't be able to do, because they'll have a few thousand more hp than you will, as well as additional focus and mitigation and so on.<br />
<br />
If your goal is to have the same equipment as raiders, then you will not succeed.  You will only frustrate yourself.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is some pretty good equipment at this point that is obtainable with single-group activities.  Check out Samanna's website to see what kind of stuff is available.<br />
<br />
On the other other hand, if your goal is to have fun, there is nothing that needs to prevent that.  There will be plenty of places your shaman and ranger can go, plenty of projects that you can accomplish.  <br />
<br />
The key question will be, can you be satisfied having fun in Everquest without having ever-more-impressive equipment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My personal opinion is that shaman are respectable in the current game .<br />
<br />
Someone , in anouther thred .. I forget who describes shaman as &quot;in the middle&quot; as far as class balance goes ... Some classes are stronger but there are some in worse shape too . I would agree with that .<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that with the release of GoD Shaman truely WERE the worst off class in EQ . At that time i think we were &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; but I think things have gotten better for us since then .<br />
<br />
In short .. To ansewer your question &quot;How Gimped are Shaman in todays EQ ?&quot; ... My answer to that is .. Not much at all .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a shadowknight who regularly boxes a shaman and makes an effort to group with them, I would say they're not particularly gimped at all.  They are versitile, yet not watered down by that versitility.  Content and class balance are closely tied, and the nature of the content in GoD was very hard on shamans, just as it was SK's, but OoW and DoN have moved toward content that is much more friendly to both classes.<br />
<br />
They're not perfect, but they have a lot to offer.  In trivial content like much of DoN, they can fill both slower and main healer roles simultaneously, leaving an extra group slot open for DPS.  In harder content, they function well as slowers and backup healers.  Shaman buffs have been somewhat revitalized with OoW spells; they can now buff past stat caps and have buffs that add directly to things like damage mods and avoidance.  <br />
<br />
They could use a few tweaks, such as slows being mitigated a percentage rather than a flat amount, and potentially a small increase to their fast heals in view of the imminent boost to hybrid healing, but overall, as primarily a member of another class, I would say shamans are in fairly good shape right now.  Sure, people bitch - they do that on every class board, but they're a solid class that's still part of almost the top several 2-box combinations.</div></div><hr />
