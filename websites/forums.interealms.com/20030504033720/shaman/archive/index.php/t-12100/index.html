<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bulder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, since I'm too tired to read through everything (again) and obviously I'm not comprehending at the moment.<br />
<br />
Is the scroll for Stoicism no drop? If no, can a class besides a shaman do this? I was thinking about doing the quest on another character while I'm at a raid, or on my friend's shaman while I'm at the raid.<br />
What Focus Effects help improve the valuability of the Torpor line? I've seen snatches and glimpses but I just can't remember where they are nor can I really think right now :)<br />
Thanks much in advance, and sorry for being a lazy bum :p<br />

<br />
Focus items don't affect any spells with that short of a duration, due to artificial restrictions. AA Quick Buff shortens the cast time by up to half, and AA Spell Casting Reinforcement extends the duration and therefore the healing amount by up to 50%.</div></div><hr />
