<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This level is getting pretty tough for me. Honestly, I cannot get a group in the planes to save my life. I have friends there, guild members, etc, but it is still really tough. Mostly people are looking for Cleric/Tank/Slower/Crowd Control, and if you arn't one of these, you get to LFG with everyone else. Most of the places like Sebilis are fairly empty, or I would have to travel and waste time to get to them just to find out that they are either empty or one group is there with no room.<br />
<br />
Most of the people I know *can* get pickup groups in PoP, and I throw my name in the hat and get to join them when someone &quot;non-important&quot; leaves. Usually I am on my own for finding a group. there or elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I was able to solo in Jaggedpine for previous levels when I couldn't get a group, but now at 56 I am left with only a few mobs that remain dark blue, and the exp there is now really really slow. <br />
<br />
Dawnshroud peaks Rockhoppers are almost all light blue, unless I go way back in the caves in which case I would need to find a way to pull past all of the light blues, even still the dark blues would be few and far between. <br />
<br />
I was at Western Wastes to try some velium hounds etc, and my only problem with that area is that it seemed to be camped and pretty sparce in mobs, basicly you had to run for 5 minutes to pull something and get it back to camp, kill it, and run for 5 more minutes. Not very fast exp wise, I could be wrong because I wasn't there long. Other problem with WW was that it wasn't very easy to get to by myself, if I wanted to get there day to day I would have to find a port and do the run or get a succor across CS, and blow a thurg gate potion each time to get back easily, IF I couldn't find a group somewhere else. Also I do a lot of helping for epic hits and such, where the mob may be pop and I have to be mobile pretty quickly. I couldn't get back to this soloing spot as fast as I would like to.<br />
<br />
I am working on swiftwind, if things worked out perfectly I would be able to have it done in a month or two as far as when my guild/friends are planning on doing hits, but for now I don't have it. I mention this based on the fact that a lot of areas are easier to solo obviously with epic(s).<br />
<br />
 I have a few toys but nothing serious, I have an Iksar regen BP to reduce downtime a little, the clicky snare earring, earring of the solstice, Tolans Bracer and BFT, Tolans Arms and Helm, Swarmcaller. I even got the extended range 4 item from PoN on one of my few groups there. Have resist gear to get Fire, Cold, Magic above 100 unbuffed. All of that stuff I carry in bags for when I need them, but wear better gear in most slots for day to day use. I currently wield a Tox axe and LSoEE, and SCHW for haste.<br />
<br />
So where is there to go for pure exp solo in my position? I would love to find a place at least as good as Jaggedpine was for soloing, a place I could run to easily from a PoP book when I couldn't get in a group, to plow through some soloing to at least get exp as opposed to LFG for hours. I haven't tried soloing velks spiders as of yet, but I would LOVE to find something easier to fearkite, or something to pound on much like the Bloodgill goblins in LOIO back when those gave exp. Something static spawning is always preferrred if I am not fearkiting animals, the less searching, the more time you can spend actually getting exp. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am hoping to get over the hump and get to 60 as soon as I can, just to be able to be more productive in groups, and hit more of the areas with effectiveness that my guild and I want to do. <br />
<br />
Obviously getting my epic will help more in these endeavors, but please don't post &quot;get your epic&quot; and be done with it. For a lot of us we have a whole guild worth of people that need help here and there, and we have to try and spend time getting everyone to where they want to be. <br />
<br />
Please fill me in with any info you can provide on soloing spots you were at, there has to be a secret one out there somewhere that won't take 3 years worth of time to get a level at!  :D<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

Read that. Then do it. Then be happy. hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also might want to try the Elites and Chief at the Rygorr fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fearkite rats in PoJ.  After doing this, you'll find there are no other options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What level can you start fearkitting rats in PoJ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can do at 55, but do not pull past the first hall or you will get adds 99% of the time causing a zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">was experimenting today with pulling all the way back to the zonein courtyard.  Got zero adds when doing this, pulling from both first and second sections, nice and out of the way.  rats flip around a bit out in the courtyard, but on the stairs down and the corridor they go in a nice straight line.  could be worth trying if your having trouble with adds.  Only thing is whether this is frowned on by others, since zonein is supposed to be a safe spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I solo em at level 55 myself. some of the first area rats are light blue so i tend to grab em from the second area beyond fear spot and just pull em back,. usually theres a group there fearing other mobs so if i get low on health or whatever they usually throw me a heal or if they need a replacement member i usually get an invite. I love the exp in poj wether grouped or solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xakorik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is possible to do the rats near the zone out at 51. I have done them a few times when I couldnt get a group. Nice xp but risky because if the rats get close to the hallway with the cells you are guaranteed to get adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you dont like fearkiting there grab a shammy partner.  Mobs dont hit that hard so its pretty easy xp near the zoneout.</div></div><hr />
