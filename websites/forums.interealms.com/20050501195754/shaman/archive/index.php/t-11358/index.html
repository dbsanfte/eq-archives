<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone has checked out the new zones yet and what looks promising.  <br />
<br />
With all the new stuff to do I can't decide what to do first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No graveyard.  Mobs hit in the 100s and have more hp then Luclin.  Killing in the incubation chamber (mobs were db to 65) gave 1%aa exp for a duo.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of corpse runs yesterday when I was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was in a 2 group pickup raid doing some event 3 zones from guntak (I forgot the name of the zone).  Anyway, the idea is you clear out all the mobs in the room ( 24 mobs I think) then the boss mob (Overlord) becomes targetable.  We pulled him and killed him but wiped to backspawn so nobody got his very cool loot (unless one of the people ninja'd it during the CR recovery - which I doubt).  His loot was a FT 1 ring for hybrids and a very cool belt which had some good stats and a regen effect when worn.  I kinda did lust after the belt, wish we hadn't wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We tried that overlord with one group (SK, War, Shm, Drux3)<br />
<br />
One of the druids died, and his proc lowered everyone's spell casting level.<br />
<br />
After about 10 fizzles, one of the druids got Evac off :)<br />
<br />
Looked like a nice little event.  With one group we barely cleared the mobs in time to spawn him.  2 groups is ideal for sure.  Can't wait to try again.</div></div><hr />
