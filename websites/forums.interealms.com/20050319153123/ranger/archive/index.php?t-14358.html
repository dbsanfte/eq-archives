In other words is lvl 62 harder than 61 or is 63 harder?<br />
How do you rate the lvls?<br />
I'm 11% from 62 and wondering what I have to look forward to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">11-24-2002, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My theory is that each level requires the exact same amount of experience, however, as you level up, if you continue to kill the the same mobs, they give less and less experience per kill due to the level difference between you and the mob. It seems to be about 5% percent per level.<br />
<br />
For example: Lets say you have a level 62 and a level 61 in group killing a mob. The level 61 will get 5% more experience then the level 62 due to the relative level between themselves and the mob they just killed.<br />
<br />
Thus, experience would seem to slow down 5% per level from 61 to 65.</div></div><hr />

Only covers up to level 60, but interesting nonetheless.<br />
<br />
It still shows hell levels, but the actual amount of XP needed to reach 60 is still the same regardless, as the hell levels were redistributed.<br />
<br />
I find it fascinating (and someone irritating) that it would take me, a Half Elf Ranger, 616,000,000xp to get to 60, where it would take a Halfling Warrior only 526 million :P<br />
<br />
Nice boon there, having to level almost a full 1/6 less than everyone else :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dranex Tical</div><div class="date">11-24-2002, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I'd add to confirm it's accurate (or at least pretty damn close) that at 55 it says it would take me approx 290 kills vs mobs 7 levels lower than me (i.e. Velks Spiders) to ding.<br />
<br />
This is quite accurate, as it takes me 2 - 3 spiders to gain 1% XP at the current time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dranex Tical</div><div class="date">11-24-2002, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On another note, if there are any 60+ Rangers out there with bots that primarily duo things with their bot ungrouped, it would be nice if someone kept track of how many of a given mob they had to kill to complete a level.<br />
<br />
Or much more simply, see how many mobs it takes you to get 1% solo, off what mobs and what level are they approx.<br />
<br />
Could give a good idea how to calculate the 61 - 65 levels. If the numbers are anything like 50 - 60, then it should follow a roughly steady curve, so some semblance of a chart could be made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lvl 61 I would lose 4%<br />
At lvl 62 I lose 7%<br />
<br />
That must mean something but it's late and I'm to tired to figure it out.<br />
I think it would mean there's less exp needed in 62 than in 61.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Death mechanics - In EQ when you die you lose 11% of the prior level's total experience cost. This is what made death in the &quot;post-hell&quot; levels so bad. Since the hell level was so large, often 2-3 times the size of a normal level, death in the next level would be very large.<br />
<br />
The fact that you are losing 4% in 61 means that 11% of 60 = 4% of 61. Do the math but 61 sounds almost 3 times the size os 60. And losing 7% in 62, which equals 11% of 61, means that 62 is about 75% larger than 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharidann</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">death in 65 costs you about 6% regular xp. Roughly. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestra</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think its harder, but if you stay in one zone it will seem to take longer because the mobs will become lower level and thus less experience as you level.<br />
<br />
My advise is to move to new zones as you level if they're available to you. Don't just stick to PoV if you don't have to, go to Halls of Honor, CoDecay...etc.. The experience will flow faster there as you level up.</div></div><hr />
