<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the most efficient way to quickly buff a raid, and more importantly, rebuff freshly rezzed people?<br />
<br />
Currently, rezzed people are supposed to send tells to the appropriate buffers, but this is far too chaotic and time consuming.  I proposed a buffing channel, but no one else in the guild seemed to think much of the idea.<br />
<br />
My guild just started playing around with the RZTW encounter, so that should give you an idea of where we are.  Most of our buffing classes have MGB, so that's not really an issue.<br />
<br />
So please, if you have a simple and efficient method, I'd love to hear it before I go insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sending tells for buffs after dying is the best way of doing it. Training the raid force not to ask for buffs in the raid channel is a big big plus.<br />
<br />
Designating someone to rebuff people after deaths is nice if you can find people who do it. Having a shaman channel with people communicating who they're buffing helps out. Communicating who has MGB up and when to use it helps as well. Having recruit shaman who are eager to please handling rebuffing is a big plus as well.<br />
<br />
There's a danger to being the best shaman buffer, you're going to be the one who gets bugged the most for buffs on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Announce a buff bish for each class at each raid. If you need buffs, you send that person a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can try assigning a buff to a person, so if you need focus, send a tell to X, if you need sta, send a tell to Y. This is okay, but people tend to forget who to ask.<br />
<br />
What we do is try to spot people being rezzed, and buff them. It's almost a game among my guild's shamans at times, trying to buff people first. We announce just their name in the shaman (debuff) channel, and that works because we all know what it means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best way is to have people send a tell for the buff they want. That way you just hit /rt and they are targeted if they are in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is the most efficient way to ... rebuff freshly rezzed people?<br />
<br />
In our shaman channel we just announce who we buffed when they are rezzed.  No spamming the guild, no need to send tells, and it is fast as most people are buffed before they are finished looting.<br />
<br />
/1 %t done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tells work so much better than any buff channel ever could.  /rt and buff, if OOR then I do a quick reply of oor and if/when they get in range they can ask again for said buffs.   <br />
<br />
Granted, it is nice when you can spot people being rezzed and rebuff them asap, but that's the bonus plan in action.  When possible, we do what others have mentioned and call out in our shaman chat who we're buffing to minimize redundancy as we buff the freshly rezzed.  Ultimately though, it's up to each person to make sure they aren't missed.  And there are certain rules I push as well.<br />
<br />
Things I have tried to emphasize in my guild:<br />
<br />
-Only group leaders should be asking for group buffs.  If the group leader is afk or just being a dip****, then you tell me who the GL is so I know who to target and I can ignore the 4 other tells that the rest of your group sends me for Fo7.<br />
<br />
-Be specific and tell me exactly what buffs you want.  Some people want CHA others don't want to waste the buff slot on it.  Some have maxxed STA others don't... etc.  YOU should know what buffs you need. <br />
<br />
-If you are going to send me a tell for a buff, do a /tar sciek first and make sure you are close enough for me to /rt and buff you.  I am not going to go running around to find you.  Be in range or don't bother me.<br />
<br />
-If you ask me for agility, I will put you on ignore for the rest of the night if not longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When the raid force is assembled have the Guild leader announce to start the buffing.  People that want junk buffs have to do it themselves.  If you don't have a way to junk buff then too bad for you.  Send tells to the appropriate class for buffs if you come late or have just been rezzed.  <br />
We can normally get a 40-50 person raid rebuffed after wiping in a matter of 5-10 mins from the first Clicked Rez to the last buff needed.  The key to that is how many are AFK awaiting a rez.  BTW Having BL's with MGB Paragon is the key to a fast rebuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my guild, the Shaman are probably the most organized group. We have our channel in which people are assigned to Slow/Malos/Cripple what ever is needed. Or if we are getting to the boss mob we have the Shaman force we assign a Shaman to MA and the first couple of offtanks. This works Very well.<br />
<br />
Buffs are assigned at the beginning of a raid and Shamans Volunteer during raids to buff the rezzed. This really isn't an issue anymore since institution of the memspellsets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What we do is try to spot people being rezzed, and buff them.

<br />
Works pretty much exactly as we do.<br />
<br />
If we have spare shm and we know we are going to get lots of deaths, we assign 1 or 2 shm to rebuff dead ppl on rezz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Our guild has assigned buffers, 1 for each. This way folks don't have to stop mem and re-mem spells. I can keep FoS (or whatever buff I am assigned) memmed and not worry about it. <br />
<br />
We also have a &quot;Send tells for buffs&quot; policy. If I see someone get rezzed in, I hit them with my assigned buff, but its not always that easy. Sending tells does 2 things. It keeps /raidsay clear of some spam and it allows easy targeting. I have a little macro set up:<br />
<br />
/rt<br />
/pause 10 (in case of a minor lag spike, 1 second delay)<br />
/cast 5 (the spell slot my &quot;assigned buff&quot; is in)<br />
<br />
Works like a charm. I have also suggested to the &quot;high volume death people&quot; (Bard and monk pullers, wizzies who never learn, Chanters, etc) that they make up a quick macro themselves:<br />
<br />
/tell Blazz FoS please<br />
/tell Cleric_01 Symbol Please<br />
/tell Shaman_02 STA please<br />
/tell Druid_01 9 Please<br />
/tell Chanter_01 VoQ please<br />
/tell Chanter_02 Haste please<br />
<br />
The names can be easily edited for each raid, as buffing duties rotate. I also keep a macro for:<br />
<br />
/rs Blazz for Focus, Shaman_02 for STA, send TELLS. <br />
<br />
and spam it a couple times after those ever-popular &quot;1/4 wipes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

LOL Missed this little gem. Biggest beefs I have are this (folks asking for AGI), Warriors asking for FA (sorry guys, rogues, then monks, and MAYBE the MA but thats his groups Shaman's job) and people asking for PE. <br />
<br />
PE I will do, if we are standing around waiting for inc, or recovering and I didnt die, or we are just starting, etc. But during the raid, especially during a fight, I get these tells &quot;PE please, I wanna make my Primal proc faster&quot; tells and just type in /reply &quot;your kidding right, /boggle?&quot;</div></div><hr />
