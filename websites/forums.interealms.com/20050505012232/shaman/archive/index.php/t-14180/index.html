<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently started a barb shammy on Prexus as I am looking to join a guild there.<br />
<br />
Already made it to level 21 and have so far managed to save about 200 pp after decking myself out with banded and low level armor. The best item I have is the spider fur belt which I managed to buy at only 10PP!! OMG The rest of the stuff are all banded or stuff off the bandits in PC. No earrings. <br />
<br />
Weapons are needlite stin ger, Glowing Wooden and I used the necklace that summons a 1hb hammer.<br />
<br />
I have not been a real noob for years and am so used to twinking that it's been a &quot;shock&quot; so to speak to really &quot;earn&quot; your stuff lol. Just wanted to know what's the best way to go about upgrading my stuff and earning pp.<br />
<br />
Are there reasonable quest that give nice upgrades without requiring you to spend days completing? Is it better to just spend time farming silks and pelts and sell it and try to buy gear in Bazaar or are there quests/kills that would be worth going for?<br />
<br />
I have become very adept at spotting spiderlings in EC after the last few days lol but theyy reap significant rewards at 50pp a stack yummm....<br />
<br />
Any advice in going about being a noob is appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

Thats how I used to buy Bronze for 2pp/ac and upgraded to uber Crafted. Watch for that evil werewolf =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">most likely you'll be able to farm silks and/or other tradeskill stuff for pp and buy much better gear than you could possibly consider questing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh okies. Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
Lookslike I will camp in PC till 24 and go farm silks and pelts for the pp.<br />
<br />
Was thinking of heading to EK to kill crag spiders but thats quite far for the trouble hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Leather padding goes pretty well on mature servers, like 20-25 pp per on bertoxx, and that's just a LQ xxx pelt and a silk thread (2 spiderling silks).  Trivials at very low tailoring, like 37.<br />
<br />
You can also sell the component bits, but seriously you make a lot of money for getting your skill to 50 or so and doing the combining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow!<br />
<br />
Sorry I am not a trade skiller and thats a decent amount of pp per item. <br />
<br />
hmmm.... I get 2.5pp per silk and 5pp per LQ/MQ skin/pelt so about 10pp.<br />
<br />
How often do leather padding sell? Thanks for this new insight to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They sell pretty well. You need them not only for the high end cultural armors, but also to make fine plate which is the primary skillup route to get your smithing to 188 on the way to that point.<br />
<br />
I went through probably 300 or so of them getting my skill to 188.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha with the trouble BB has been having I made a new toon on Layns (something like that)  It is fun to start with nothing .. when a toon runs by and buffs you up its actually appreciated!  I have to admit it is very easy when you know how the game works compared to day one .. took me like 3 years to hit 50!  I think I was in SK and Lake Rathe for 2 out of that 3 years =)<br />
<br />
Tradeskills are a great way to be part of the game vs the normal bloodlust /evil  The biggest thing I can suggest is spend time questing stuff which is well documented today on many sites ... hopefully the distractions will make the game fun!  I think you would be amazed at the items one can get from simple quests .. knowledge is power =)<br />
<br />
Gosh I remember seeing a troll in full bronze back in the day .. Damm he was good .. Umpalumpa or something like that was the guild creator of grobb skwad /cheer  He used to goto Najena!! **** those crazy uber lvl 26 players!!  I wish they could recaptue what made this game what it is today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, getting to EK is not very hard at all.  My ranger runs it all the time.  Take the port book from PoK to Misty Thicket.  Run past the wall and across the zone to the entrance to Runnyeye.  Zone in and follow the right hand wall to zone into the Gorge of King Xorbb.  It&#8217;s an extremely short run through Runnyeye, past very low-level goblins.  Once you are in the gorge, just follow the left hand wall and you&#8217;ll eventually zone into East Karana.  This is a longer run and there tend to be a lot of wondering mobs, but at 21 most of them may leave you alone.  But if not you should be able to outrun them with SoW.  To be honest I think the run is shorter then running from the elven tree city to the dwarven docks and I used to run that all the time back in the olden days.</div></div><hr />
