How about no way? <br />
<br />
How about the 4 or 5 high end guilds combine to 1 or 2 instead of merging servers and facing the same over-crowding, mob spawn racing, competition between guilds, etc, we have had in the game for some time.<br />
<br />
There is no reason any guild shouldnt be able to make SOME adjustment. If you lost too many to sustain the guild, then you should probably look to be absorbed by a guild that didnt. I like the idea of GUILDS merging before SERVERS merging, myself. I like the less crowded atmosphere of my server now.</div></div><hr />
