<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the DPS put out by the JBB, I've been experimenting with 2hb as my medium to phase this item out.  I do this for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
1) I have a 171 2hb and fount it wasting away ;)<br />
<br />
2) In multi-group situations, I lose more time to having to duck out and not channel my JBB still.  <br />
<br />
3) I can't cann during this where I can with 2hb swinging.<br />
<br />
4) I like hitting things in the face.<br />
<br />
This being said, with buyable items, I've used the Tae War Maul (33/36).  Will the DPS, at 200 2hb, actually catch up to the JBB foregoing extreme damage mitigation of Luclin mobs?  If this isn't feasible, is there a weapon that WILL?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt it will match up...<br />
<br />
even w/ 33/36 Club, its not really 'stable' enough damage in my opinion.<br />
<br />
You always know how much the JBB will hit for(well, most the time atleast), but our still gonna whiff w/ the Club</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug, on lots of higher lvl things I solo, my JBB dmg fluxuates alot.  I see alot of things like this, 263 54 3 263 150 230 40 263 263.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would try with a barb spiritist hammer with uber dex.  I really dont think any regular 2hb even with a good ratio is gonna compete unless used with rabid bear or has a significant proc.  Not sure how often a barb spiritist hammer would proc with max dex and 200 skill, but i still believe it will be better used for hits in between JBB blasts for a chance at a proc. Of course that isnt an option for iksars.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, with a Bone of Bertoxx and Rabid Bear.. I hit 52 DPS.... but that's situational :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got a Facesmasher at 48/42 ratio.<br />
I'm missing item haste though.<br />
I'll see if I can borrow one and test my damage output with and without Avatar.<br />
I'll also test my damage output with Righteousness (that 20/22 1h blunt with 100dd proc from Rhag1)</div></div><hr />
