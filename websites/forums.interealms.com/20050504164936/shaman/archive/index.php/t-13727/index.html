<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have been looking without any luck sofar for a command you can put into one your hotkey sequences that triggers another hotkey.<br />
<br />
For example, on raids I have a target hotkey for the MA &amp; the SA, &amp; I have a separate regular ASSIST hotkey. So what I would like to do is when I hit my MAtarget hotkey the last line in that sequence I want to trigger my ASSIST hotkey.<br />
<br />
I have all my hotkeys set up on my keyboard number pad, so my MAtarget would be (6) &amp; ASSIST would be (5) on the number pad.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense &amp; I am sher there must be a command that will let me do this, just haven't had any luck finding it yet. Any ideas would be aprreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can just make a hotkey that says<br />
<br />
&quot;/assist Maintank&quot;  and its basicly the same as targeting the MT and then assisting him.  On my hotkeys i have a assist MT and a normal assist key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">off topic here...but has to do with hotkeys and commands....is there a command to sell to a vendor? or a way to make the sell button a hot button. It's getting damn annoying after 3-4 hours at the IG's and 8 packs full of crap to have to click the item, move cursor over, click sell, back to next item, etc etc.</div></div><hr />
