<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warning:  reading the following may actually cause you to lose I.Q. points.  That being said I've got about 6 diet cokes in me and thought this one up while killing time.  I'll probably move it to OT in the morning, but it struck me as something amusing to do at 4 am.<br />
<br />
Here is your scenario:<br />
<br />
A powerful Elven Wizard experimenting with travel spells manages to forge an unstable one way tunnel from Norrath to Earth.  En route, the portal collapses and the resulting magical backlash slays the wizard, whose remains land on the Earth side of the now closed portal.  Said remains are packed in ice for research, and the decision is eventually made to (re)create the elven race here on Earth.  The Elven DNA is extracted, studied, encoded, and implanted into a blank fertilized embryo.  A human woman is chosen as a surrogate mother and human milk appears to be fully compatible with Elven physiology.  Nine months later, a healthy child is born.  <br />
<br />
Assuming you've stopped laughing, muttering, and shaking your head, this child is:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since 100% of the DNA would be Elven derived, the child would be genetically Elvish, but enviromentally Human. Unless you are a Lysenko fan and believe enviromental traits like scars are also inherited. Hmmm, except the Mytochondrial DNA which I believe is egg derived. Arrrgh! My brain is hurting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">genetically, the child is 100% elven.  as we know though, personality is 50% genes and 50% environmental, so in this sense, the child would probably be half elven.  si?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to add the option:<br />
<br />
Im a Zeker, the child would be kos to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im with Asta on this one, death to the yellow team :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">why not just res the wizard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly, Elves suck.  Buncha pointy eared fairies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good point Munkee and translocate him back to Norrath, good ridance, bloody elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why not crossbread the DNA with troll DNA?  You could come up with 2 possible outcomes.<br />
<br />
1. a super dumb fairy dork, very fit to be a druid.<br />
2. a super strong super wise ultra shammy (with troll regen), poised to rule all norrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why did a wizard have to die? it would be alot funnier if this had happened to a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">True, let's change it from an high elven wizard to:<br />
An Xteaming, quad-kiting, whiny, wood elf dr00d!<br />

Wow, my hatred really shows through...<br />

I'm not the only one to find this funny, no? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At last!  The origins of Thantu have been revealed!  Guess Diet Coke has weird effects on the Elven physioligy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think Thantu got ahold of the Cough Syrup AND watched Species</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok - you all missed this one.<br />
<br />
The child's DNA in the nucleus is all from the Elven parents.  But the DNA in the mitochondria is obviously from the egg donor, a human.  So - less than half human - maybe 85% Elven ....<br />
<br />
and as any fan of Niven knows, all the mana on this planet Earth has been consumed in the past ages, so you get a skinny, weak short-lived Elf with no compensating magical capabilities.<br />
<br />
I think it is being raised out West, in Area 51.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you shoulda used  a Troll for the egg donor - like that idea!</div></div><hr />

you are frightening me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eclectik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The child would obviously be some kind of weird half-elven hippy type, and would forever disgrace his former form by becoming a pot-smoking, poncho-wearing, un-bathed, hippy...and he'd have pointy ears=/</div></div><hr />

...and this would be different how?</div></div><hr />
