<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi - I am looking for some advice on where to go with my 48 friend and help him get through the hellish beastlord level 48 so he can get is level 49 pet - which rock compared to their 39 pet.  It is a shame they don't get a pet every 5 levels.  <br />
<br />
I have been to PoJ - but I have never pulled there.  I know we can't handle the enforcer/punisher camp.  What about the exit, and if so, how and what do you pull there?  I have done the exit a few times when we didn't have the DPS, but like I said, I have never pulled.<br />
<br />
Is Plane of Disease an option?  I have never been there.<br />
<br />
As I have mentioned in other posts, on the mac server, hollowshade is broken on our server so you can't zone out - therefore can't go through to katta - teneb - grimling - twilight - scarlet etc without wizzie port, and I would like to hear about options in the planes.  Also - we do not have LDoN nor Yeshka.<br />
<br />
I do not have a JBB, but I do have a horse to help guard against sit aggro and keep my mana up.  No canni 2 :(  I play on the new Mac server, and am 52.6 and am about to tie with the highest shaman on the server (level wise)<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing all of your knowledge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've dou'ed with a paladin a few levels under me.  when I was about lvl53, and he was about lvl47 we were working the Luggald's over in the caves in Dulak (Legacy of Ykesha).<br />
<br />
It was very good exp by the Soulstealer camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Durdend - Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately all of the expansions are not yet available for the Mac version yet.  We don't have LDoN or Ykesha.  If you have any other advice, I would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Janribet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">jaggedpine forest in the gnoll caves are great exp for that lvl. There is a spot that is just past the drop off or pit that you both could work really well. Just hug the right wall all the way in till you drop down to a pit. Invis up and you should have no problems getting to pit. May have to fight your way out due to some mobs see invis but it is good exp and there are some nice vender items that drop too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could try Vampyre Bats in Maiden's Eye.  I was douing those easily at lvl55 with a lvl47 paladin.  From the Dawnshroud Peaks zoneline, head right.  There's a hill that overlooks a Coterie Castle, don't pull the coterie, as they are a real pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
Set up on the hill, back up near the zone wall so you wont get any roamer adds.  Then pull the wandering Vampyre Bats from below.  Slow, EB and dogdog - not too hard at all.  Exp isn't too bad, but there's TONS of bats so there's plenty to pull.</div></div><hr />
