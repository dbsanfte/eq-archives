<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My old friends from Patrons of Valor are going to be attempting the hand-in to Kurn in The Hole this Saturday. These are great people that share many of the same values as we do. Glazgar has been scouting with his gimp for a month now and is getting the nerve and force up to achieve success.<br />
<br />
If the guild does not have &quot;business&quot; that evening (calendar says &quot;RAID&quot; right now), I will be supporting the event myself. I would welcome any other KoE interested in this endeavor to join, as would PoV. Who knows, you might meet some solid 50s players who are full of enthusiasm and have some fun in the process!<br />
