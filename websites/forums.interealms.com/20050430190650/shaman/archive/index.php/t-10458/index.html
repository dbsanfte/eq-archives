<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how does this work and what does it do?<br />
<br />
does it mean i can cast a single-person buff (ex: Nimble) and if i have the mana, it will make everyone in my group get it, without having to cast it 5-6 times?<br />
<br />
please explain if i am way off base. thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">once you toggle /Targetgroupbuff on, then you can cast a GROUP spell on another group (one you are not in) by targeting a player in that group and casting...will land on everyone in that group.<br />
<br />
Does not convert a single target spell into a group spell.<br />
<br />
The ability to cast a group buff on another group saves valuable time/mana on raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Back in the day (TM) you could only use group spells on the group you were in... this was a very convenient change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, because you had disband your group to get in that group, and someone was displaced and didn't get the buff.  Pain in the arse to keep track of.</div></div><hr />

I wish somebody would keep us oldtimers in the loop....<br />
<br />
grrrr... <br />

Missed that one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They patched it in about a year or so ago. =P<br />
<br />
And a patch or 3 after they put it in they put in the shortcut, and made it remember.  Originally you had to type /targetgroupbuff (whole word), every time you cast, then it reset.  Really got old after about 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />
