I'm pretty nervous about not having the right faction when it comes down to obtaining my epic.  I started this quest back at lvl 34 so I have invested quite a bit of my time to it.  I have done every step along the way.  I'm assuming that because Kirn attacked when I handed him the icon my faction is right on track.  I was kindly considered by him just before the turn in.  I have the ring for Neh and the Iksar childs tear.  Is it safe for me to assume that if Neh also attacks upon ring turn in that I'm ok still?  I guess it's just nerves but I don't want to have to go back to Fear, so from what I've read as long as I'm ally with Rak before giving him the tear I should be ok.  <br />
<br />
Also does anyone know how long it will take to do this final raid?  I guessed about 3-4 hours.  The break in can take a little while, and then their's the matter of pulling and killing all the Reavers.  I've been on Reaver raids but I want to make sure that anyone who says they will help know what they are in for.  Also is Rak on any special timer or is he every two hours with the Reavers?  There could possibly be two shaman epics completed on the same day with a joint effort from guilds.  I want to make sure it's possible to do it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and input,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since Kirn attacked, you're doing fine. They say that a good way to check your faction after Neh, is to ask &quot;what spear of fate&quot;, and see if the spirit gives you the answer. So I've heard. At least, he answered for me.<br />
<br />
The Reaver raid itself can be done very fast with a high powered group of 60's. There's no need for a &quot;break-in&quot;, if you have a high level puller who can pull them out of the castle to the gazebo area.<br />
<br />
Assuming you already have the tear, the whole Neh/Rak thing took for me, about an hour. Part of that was getting everyone there and ready.<br />
<br />
I had a wonderful 60 necro who pulled, she somehow was able to get past the door without a rogue, so we didn't need one. We had 1 60 cleric, myself (60 shaman at the time), 1 60 necro, 1 60 mage without epic, for ghiosk and all the other reavers, up to popping neh and rak.<br />
<br />
For neh we had the addition of a 56 cleric and a 56 mage.<br />
<br />
For rak we had another 56 mage join us.<br />
<br />
So in total, we had 7 people. Now with the modrod change, you'll probably need more clerics. But there's no need to break-in to the castle... I've found reaver bits for the shammy epic go so much faster if it's a group of people doing it, as opposed to a guild raid. Once it's a guild raid, you end up with 10 druids and rangers getting in the way, making everything more complicated than it needs to be.</div></div><hr />
