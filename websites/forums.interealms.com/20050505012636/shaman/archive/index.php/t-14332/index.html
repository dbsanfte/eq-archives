<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brakins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that Lost Dungeons is comming out, what class is best suited for dungeon crawling? I know LDoN is for group dungeon crawling but what class you think makes the best dungeon explorer solo?  My pick is SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How did you decide that SK was the best class?  I can't think of anything they can do solo that a necro can't do better, except tank.  SK tanking doesnt work too well solo, because they take more damage than they can heal with their taps - they will have downtime.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I would honestly say that we are the strongest dungeon soloing class.  Dungeons are difficult because you do not have wide open spaces to work with.  We do not require space in order to solo.  A fear kiter does, a quad kiters does, and a charmer does.  If the mob summons, we can tank it in teh face.  If it doesn't summon, we can root it a few feet out of melee range and just dot it down.  Runner-up for the prize of dungeon soloer would be necros, imho.  Also, beastlords might be good at it, but I have never seen a beastlord soloing in a dungeon so I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think Shaman too, since we take time to longer than some, but we solo effectivly.<br />
<br />
Remember it may be a dungeon crawl but they have said THERE WILL BE NO RESPAWNS IN PRIVATE DUNGEONS! - So you wont have to go fast and can have as much downtime as you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a nifty interview with gamespy about the whole expansion, and at one point he says &quot;these dungeons will be for 5 to 6 people&quot; when asked how many they will support.  I don't know if he was just saying the max, or implying that you NEED a full group to go through it.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm quite excited, I've always liked single group content, and have a good group of friends that we try to do 1 group things with.  PoP really killed that, we did all the key quests, then they took away the flags, and other than a few mini-bosses in planes, there's no goals to work toward for 1 group of us.  This should bring back a lot of fun like crawling to the dog pens in Chardok when our average level was 55 and other similar tasks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Given the new private dungeon technology this does become an important question.  AA points and other developments have also changed how we look at dungeon crawlers vs. outdoor hunters.<br />
<br />
The top solo crawler has to also be the top Root-Rotter and that belt is held by the Necro.  I think that we edge out SK by a bit.<br />
<br />
Necromancer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shaman&gt;&gt;ShadowKnight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The top solo crawler has to also be the top Root-Rotter and that belt is held by the Necro.  I think that we edge out SK by a bit.<br />
<br />
A necro may be a slightly better root-dotter than we are, but they do not hold a candle to us against summoning mobs.  I could be mistaken, but I believe that mobs deeper in veksar all summon, which leads me to believe that most or all of the mobs in the next expansion might very well summon, as well.  Even if they don't, it is still a close call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my limited experience, I've found that necroes are able to handle slighter tougher mobs than shaman when playing solo. However, once a necro is in trouble, they're dead. My shaman is a viable opponent right down to the last hit point thanks to melee, slow and speed spells. When I see a necro down at 20% health, I'd better help them because one or two hits from the mob and they're out. In the reverse case, I'm still well in the fight.<br />
<br />
So if you play it safe, I'd say a necro. As long as they don't overpull (and engulfing darkness sticks), they're remarkably strong. If you're prone to pulling tougher mobs by accident, I'd take a shaman any day of the week. You'll die less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best crawler?  depends on the dungeon layout and demands.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Most capable Crawler?   Hands down, shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
  In specific dungeons we will probably be outdone by certain classes just cause of a need to split all pulls, plenty of kite room, or other oddities.  But overall, we can take on any dungeon that any other class can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For solo crawls, it's gotta be necro. They can mez, snare, feign split, succor, and have nice DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on the mob.  If they are summoners I would say shaman, if they are runners I would have to say necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">with saryrn's kiss (tap dot heals for 1500 while doing 2k damage over 48 seconds) and touch of mujaki 850 hp lifetap that casts in 3.2 seconds, you'd be amazed what a necro can solo.<br />
<br />
and alot of the mobs deep in veksar are undead so necro's can 70% slow those aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Necros just have way way too many tools to compete with.  Right now, I would guess that the toughest traditional dungeon area that is soloed by anyone is Cazic 4c, and as far as I know that is only done by (a few top end) necromancers. <br />
<br />
Until shamans get harmshield, fd, snare, levant and instaclick invis, there ain't no way we die less frequently solo than a good necro, and pulling issues will just render too many areas simply off limits to us.  Until we get resurrection and summon corpse, there ain't no way we recover from a dungeon death solo better than a good necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bards are actually pretty good dungeon soloers. Not as good as outdoors kiting, but a good bard is very effective indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Uggok, you been back to CT since 65, Q, new pet and 2 non DD dots?<br />
<br />
   I solo all over in CT lately (trying for research of GRC components).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Depends on the mob.  If they are summoners I would say shaman, if they are runners I would have to say necro.<br />
<br />
If the necro has a pet on the mob, the mob won't summon the necro.<br />
<br />
Veksar is a necro playground right now, and they are ripping through 51+ (undead) summoners without breaking much of a sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No I have not been in CT much at all since new levels/spells.  I have a very hard time seeing a shaman soloing all of 4c though.  <br />
<br />
A shaman vs 1 mob and a necro vs 1 mob, shaman can do harder mobs (but where the necro can kill, she will kill faster).  But a shaman vs 4 mobs and a necro vs 1 mob, no contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree, Bards are the best at dungeon crawling.  They can lull everything and single pull, and fade if they screw up.  Mez and charm are great.  Add a shaman and it's total heaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Any FD class.<br />
<br />
A Necro has tons of &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; cards.  Their utility is also unsurpassed.<br />
<br />
- Harmshield/QVox<br />
- FD/DP<br />
- ForceShield<br />
- ST (Mezz)<br />
- Snare<br />
- Root<br />
- Undead Slow<br />
- Instaclick Invis (CoS)<br />
- Instaclick IVU (AA Skill)<br />
- Summon Corpse<br />
- 93% Rezz<br />
- Gate<br />
- Lifeburn <br />
- Awesome pet heal at 64.<br />
<br />
While a Shaman can slow, but a screwed up pull can really suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Now, combine shaman and necro.  Ain't no limit to what you can do as a duo!  All the utility is there.  All the DPS is there.  All the CC you need is there.  And all the wipe-recovery utility you need is also there.  EE's are freakin cheap these days, 300pp is nothing.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If the necro has a pet on the mob, the mob won't summon the necro.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be cool if it really did work that way? Not sure if you've ever actually played a Necro (or a real pet class for that matter) but the mob will always summon whoever it's maddest at, which is always going to be the Necro himself over the pet.<br />
<br />
I've played a significant portion of my EQ &quot;career&quot; with two Necros, and I can tell you I'd much rather be a Shaman when push comes to shove. They get 3 mobs at the same time and they're in a pretty sticky situation. We get 3 at the same time, we just slow them all, Q ourselves and wait for them to die. Shamans are probably the hardest class in the game to kill. The Ornate pants make it sickeningly easy to keep almost as many mobs as you want on ice for an unlimited amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Havent tested it with pets per se, but I root things all the time to keep from getting summoned when duoing with my wife's monk.   A rooted mob fighting a pc wont summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Necro, Hands down. No comparison. <br />
Good Gear, AA, focus items and spells61-65 have made necros unsickly powerful at going anywhere they please.<br />
<br />
Most &quot;level appropriate&quot; dungeons have groups of mobs bunched up and a shaman has no great way to handle multiple mob pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just a function of out-aggroing, the same as if when I play my lower level mage if my pet doesn't have aggro, the mob runs for me and ignores pet. And when the pet gets aggro I can peacefully sit and watch the pet tank.<br />
<br />
What I may not have been clear in stating is that an unengaged mob will always summon.  Someone. If the pet is on the mob, it won't necessarily summon. It CAN summon if the necro over burns, but it won't always.  Same aggro management problem you have when there's a tank on the mob not a pet.<br />
<br />
Amusingly enough, in Veksar this weekend, the mage's pet got summoned first after a gate.  Not the mage.  Not the tank.  The pet. Maybe it's a Veksar thing (summoning pets).<br />
<br />
So I guess it can work that way and it's pretty nice for necros soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd bet on the necro for exploring a dungeon he's unfamiliar with. <br />

2 words... Feign Death.<br />
<br />
Shaman may have more surviveability but when it really hits the fan Fd is a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're duoing, shammy plus necro or monk. You can pretty much go wherever you want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nefarious Method</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ugh, I hate to say this because I also have a shaman who I love but for soloing nothing comes remotely close to a necro soloing in a dungeon summoning mobs or not.<br />
<br />
They can fiegn split, levant, snare, mez, root, harmshield, forceshield, strong pet, heal themselves....every tool you need you have. Now after that consider that the necro has near the best mana regen in the game and unsurpassed killing efficiency and DPS in the long term.<br />
<br />
Here is Yag soloing Venril Sathir. confirmed as kill on real VS, not triggered. VS just ran out of spawn point<br />

<br />
The combination of Saryn's Kiss which is near a 2000HP heal over 1 minute and 850 point lifetaps summoning mobs aren't as much of a problem as they used to be depending on the mob of course. Add forceshield for extra protection if you want against normal xp mobs that summon.<br />
<br />
Just two box shaman and a necro and have everything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">yep necros probably best ;)<br />
<br />
Shaman are still capable though, I solo'd comm1 in ssra the other day, including clearing into right tube and keeping spawn clear until one popped, was much easier than I expected, but i don't think too many classes could do that at 65 solo.<br />
<br />
We are still kings of small dungeon groups though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I totally forgot Feign Death. Please ignore the previous bollocks I spewed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have both. Both sitting at 60 right now. No class is above those two. But if i had to explore a dungeon with either, without a doubt I'm picking my necro. Every point raised here is so true. When I explore, its usually on my necro, sometimes on monk and hardly ever on shaman. Learn a new camp? necro. Want to try something difficult? necro. I can do things that few, if any, other class can do on shaman. But I can do it on my necro and there are things on necro I can't do or do as fast or as well on shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman/necro duo = nothing is impossible. /agree Landrag</div></div><hr />

My Necro can solo the 300+ hitter without any problems, because they are undead and I can slow them. My pet can tank them very well and I can tank them too if it is necessary. With my Firedots and my Undead nuke I can do alot of damage. On the other hand disease and poison dots dont work on the undead mobs, so shamans are little handicaped on these type of mobs. I have problems with the &quot;hand&quot; type mobs, because  I cant slow them and they summons too. But duo with my shaman there is perfect.</div></div><hr />
