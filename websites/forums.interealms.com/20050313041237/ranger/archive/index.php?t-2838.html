<br />
Anyone have a list of them sitting around? Never can remember those things without writing them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Linuvan</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Sean I thought I had it as well but cant find it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I don't have that list, I can name some tweaks off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
First, turn on texture cache of course, set your VideoModeBitsPerPixel in Eqclient.ini to 16,<br />
Setting UseUmbra=False may help, also, depending on your video card, setting UseTnL=False may help as well.<br />
<br />
In your system.ini, put the line<br />
ConservativeSwapFileUsage=1<br />
<br />
Turn off all thsoe god-awful new models.  Or at least, the half elven ones.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually was more looking for some of the specific number settings they had on there... was two different articles with em. Thanks though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torth</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this is what your looking for Sean, but I saved an old file for Luclin settings.  I always like to keep a back up of something :)   Might be something useful in there<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
Win95/98/98se/ME Shadows of Luclin players READ!! <br />
If you have over 128mb of RAM, which we all should if we are playing SoL, read this article and apply the suggested line to your system.ini file.. It made a WORLD of difference for my system.. <br />
<br />
www.aumha.org/a/memmgmtz.htm#conserve <br />
<br />
I have a P3-1ghz CPU, 1gb of RAM and a GF3-Ti500.. After loading SoL, my system would pause every 3 seconds for about half a second.. I was getting really really frustrated to say the least.. My disk was doing a lot of swapping and I really felt like my machine should be performing better then it was.. So I did some surfing and found this fix.. It links right to an MS article that in so many words says that all the extra RAM you have in your system is basically doing jack and **** without this entry.. <br />
<br />
First, you set Windows to manage your Virtual Memory.. Secondly, add this line to your system.ini under the 386enh section as the directions say.. I zone substantially faster, the new textures load substantially faster and I have far far FAR less lag when I am in large groups of people that before dropped my framerate down to hideous rates.. Basically, this will make SoL run almost as fast as it did before the new engine in my honest opinion.. <br />
<br />
Give it a shot, it worked for me and has done great things for a number of my guildmates as well.. Its very worth it.. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
After this mornings patch and some additional tweaking on my system I'm happy to report that all of my systems can run SoL with only a minimum of lag/issues. I thought I'd post all of my configs here in hopes it might help a few others. <br />

UseTNL=TRUE <br />
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16 <br />
UseD3DTextureCompression=FALSE <br />
EQ Options: (the &quot;Options&quot; prior to logging in) <br />
Loading all 30 character models <br />
Texture Quality set to Medium <br />
Using 'original' textures for old world zones, Kunark, and Velious <br />
Windows system.ini settings: <br />
Added the following entries to their [respective] sections <br />
[386Enh] <br />
ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 <br />
[vcache] <br />
MinFileCache=16384 <br />
MaxFileCache=45056 <br />
I also ran Cacheman 5.0 to optimize/make certain registry entries for my systems cacheing. I highly recommend it. <br />
That's really about it. I'm convinced these settings work well since yesterday and the day before Shan's PC crashed every time I just went into Marus Seru for no more than even a couple of minutes. This evening Terren and I ran through that zone for quite a while and Shan's PC kept up with Val's with no issues at all. <br />
Some zones were still a tad laggy, but all indoor dungeon type zones had great performance. Mainly the humongous outdoor zones and the larger city zones (Shadow Haven, Sanctus Seru, etc) had a noticeable frame rate decrease. The Bazaar is a bit laggy too, but no where near as bad as it was prior to todays patch and the above tweaks being made to my systems. <br />
Hope this info helps someone else enjoy Luclin as much as I am now.</div></div><hr />

Make sure your hard drive is set to dma if it supports it and add xxx lines to your system.ini, can't seem to find it though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Win98, I'm lazy... I'll upgrade to XP eventually.<br />
<br />
Just put in a P4 1.7 to go with my GeForce 3... kinda funny, still can't run raids with full models on and have a &quot;decent&quot; framerate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadrien</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same problem here Athlon 1400xp 512Mo ddr GEforce 3 ti ...</div></div><hr />

Its very playable but still notchy, but thats still very bad considering the system being used.<br />
This all on a p300 spec game.<br />
Wonder what kind of cpu power EQ2 will require to be able to raid:) Hope they get them 5000 mhz machines out by then to play on the 733 mhz requirement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing with EQ's engine is its like 5 years old that was a bit behind the times to begin with... thats just been recoded over and over and over. Its really a piece of garbage.<br />
<br />
I don't think we'll have to worry about that mistake with EQ2... they're building it with much newer tech and much better understanding of systems, and building it as they go to be up to date for the future when EQ2 is released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadrien</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No more luclin skin here :p anyway Half elves look bad :)<br />
Bah i don't understand with my 2nd comp celeron 1100Mhz 256sdram  Geforce 2mx400 i am not freezing 5sec every 5mins... everything is faster ptached ect on my best comp. *sigh*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, all the gaming engines now are made better.<br />
<br />
For starters, they are generally made more extensible, capable of scaling.<br />
<br />
The EQ engine was never designed for a world with even multitexturing, let alone TnL, pixel shaders or nearly free AA.<br />
<br />
I, for one, am very disspointed in SoL's graphic revamp, with regards to how it looks, I think the artists really blew it, sorry to say.  I am impressed however with the fact they were able to add higher poly models and TnL to a game such that people with different era engines (SoL and pre-SoL) are playing the same MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Sure, it takes up a funny amount of RAM, and still doesn't perform well even with insane hardware, but those things are the price to pay for it evoloving and not being thrown out.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be suprised in the least if the EQ2 engine uses less RAM. I also wouldn't be suprised if the day it ships, on most hardware out at the time, it doesn't run *better* than EQ1 does.. Why? Cause it was targeted at pixel shaders and TnL,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, Sean, I went back to Win98 SE from XP.  Just to much stuff I liked in 98 that XP didn't support without having to pay extra.  With the proper tweaks (Turn that bloody Active Desktop crap off for one)  it runs quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hajime Saito</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why in the world would you want to run raids with all that crap on any ways. Spell casting from 50 people makes things hard to see and the luclin models are crap anyways. Plus even if your machine could run a raid with all of it on......you would have amuch better time with it all off.  Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I happen to like the new models far far more than the old ones, shrug.<br />
<br />
And well... no one sane plays with spell particles on anyways, too much screen clutter, thats worse than having annoying PC names on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andric d'Regor</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only have spell effects on if I'm soloing. Find seeing the earthcaller proc easier than looking for the text. Can't remember when I last had PC names on though.</div></div><hr />
