<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed someone over at the cleric boards did some wonderful number crunching of the boards Magelo list, was very interesting to see (I have a cleric alt) so I wondered about Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I really dont have the time to go into a much detail as this cleric did, so I settled for looking at the lvl 60 folk during my lunch hour. HP, AC and mana were taken from the magelo list that Soupy put into a spreadsheet for us a while ago out of this thread:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1379<br />
<br />
If you werent on that list as of this date, I didnt sample you - sorry. <br />
<br />
I excluded certain profiles: those below level 60, those not on magelo.com (even playing field) those with suspiciously low AC (not filled out properly) those with broken profile urls and the guy who's profile has soft porn as a background - Im at work, ta.<br />
<br />
Remember that this is by no means a representative sample of Shaman, those with nice stuff are naturally happy to display their profiles, not everyone reads the Crucible and certainly not everyone was in that spreadsheet.<br />
<br />

It is interesting to see the &quot;average&quot; Iksar compared to the &quot;average&quot; Troll. Looks like that extra 40ac doesn't show up all that often, nor does the higher wisdom. <br />
<br />
No, I'm not trying to start a flame, just interesting to see that layed out there. And, of course, wondering if it will change anyone's argument when another Iksar vs. the world discussion comes up :D</div></div><hr />

interesting and all...averages for Crucible Posting Oracles.<br />
<br />
The sample size for iksar/ogres/trolls leaves much to be desired.  I would really hope that people don't start jumping all over it in today's &quot;why iksar should get the JBB debate&quot;.  :p<br />
<br />
Of course perhaps I am just bitter, as I was thinking my gear was about average these days.  Hopes dashed away again!  *sniff*<br />

<br />
There is one major flaw to this &quot;study&quot;. It doesn't separate shaman by classing them in different guild tiers. A level 60 Iksar shaman that isn't in a raiding guild will never have the AC/WIS of any other shaman that is in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You know it will Henora ;)<br />
<br />
I know in the exact same gear the AC bonus is still there. Anyone who really thinks about it will see that. However, in the same gear, Iksar still have less HP :( And with the way the game is going, and with the Cannibalize AAXP skill, that is a bit of an obsticle. Not a huge one, but it's there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What Zorlac said...  I'd venture to guess that this 'average' represents more of the raiding guild shaman than otherwise.  Plus, you have to consider that many of the non-iksar shaman are some of the top shaman on their server and have been playing since long before Iksar were even around.  Hence, they've been level 60 longer and had more time to accumulate those nicer items.  Hell, Jenamdar alone skews the whole damn thing! :p</div></div><hr />

Yup.  My Shaman is my alt char but never gets any loot (nor really has a chance to), so all that he has is from my or small group efforts, except my Spiritweavers BP from a PoG raid.  AC so small.  But I like the HP.</div></div><hr />

/sarcasm aside all this does is illistrate the point that iksar do better because of thier abilities... I mean look how close they are and they havent had the time to catch up on the old world shaman's time gather equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hrothgarr, <br />
<br />
You assume that Seredith was trying to prove that the Iksar AC bonus really doesn't matter at level 60. I don't see her writing that down anywhere. You're being rude and ascerbic because you've yet to unwad your panties from all of those other discussions on the JBB. <br />
<br />
Let's take the post at face value and not imbue it with our personal baggage, ok?<br />
<br />
There are a number of conclusions and hypotheses that can be drawn from the data. Here are a couple:<br />
<br />
1. Perhaps the 40AC bonus that Iksar have at level 60 doesn't really mean that much after all. (I support this one very much, personally).<br />
<br />
2. Iksar are behind the other Shaman races because they've had less time to gather equipment (I also believe that this one might have a little to do with it -- when we get enough level 60 Vah Shir, then it'll be really interesting to assess this idea again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Rofl.  Hroth, that is so wrong.  It's been 2 years since kunark came out.  There are so many more 60s on all the servers, that almost all the ubermobs are permanently camped and dead.  Things die so much faster and more easily, that it's insane.  High end equipment is falling from the sky comparitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look how close they [iksar] are and they haven't had the time to catch up on the old wold shaman's time gather equipment&quot;<br />
<br />
Good lord, man.  There are iksar out there with 200 days played.  My play time isn't that insane and I have 120 days played.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't believe you posted that.  Hopefully it's sleep deprivaton kicking in again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">*shrug* There are no iksar shaman in my guild.  There are no iksar shaman in the top two guilds on my server (Magister and Midnight Fury).  You're not going to break 3K hitpoints unbuffed unless you are in a top notch raiding guild with access to multiple NTOV/Velious boss mob/Ssraa temple/VT loot.  <br />
<br />
When you started your character is a factor in what guilds you have access to, what guild you are in plays a HUGE factor in what gear you have access to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the highest AC listings Magelos for troll barb or whatever... Iksar can wear EVERY SINGLE peice listed in ~98% of the ones you check out.  Again I dont see the point here except for what will *probably* develop into another Ikky JBB thread...  If you look at the naked HP for a 60 ikky and a 60 barb it is ~150hp... not as much as you would think from reading these type of threads...</div></div><hr />

Yes I think ikky shaman will be somewhat behind still... not much but while it would be plausible for an uber rading ikky to still be collecting Vellious items it would be alot less plausable to say the same for a old world old timer uber raider... there have been 2 expansions released relatively fast and another on the way...  I didnt mean to say it was scripture, ikkys falling behind, I just didnt subscribe to the theme that the poor poor ikkys actually have an AC hole...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason iksar got worse stats is simply cuz on average they havent been raiding as long.  I consider my gear pretty good as an iksar, but Ive only been raiding 1 yr.  Trying to compete with ppl that have been in uber guilds for 2+ yrs there is really no way to make up the gear differnce.  And the gear difference overshadows the racial differences by quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good thread btw.<br />
Maybe Ikky did have the time to get in top tier guilds to raid with them, but they are overal beeing looked at as twinks. Unlike Iksar monks, Iksar shamans are a not so common race/class combo, so maybe the top guilds view us as twinks that were created with RoK release and thus they're not sure what to do with us? Dunno if this is true.<br />
 It's like the kitty shamans now, when I see a kitty shaman in full totemic the first thing that springs to mind is: twink. Maybe this is his first char and he just got very lucky on the drops and did it all by himself, but that's not what comes to mind first.<br />
<br />
When ye do a /who all iksar shaman on Prexus (my server, yay), you get a list with a few lvl 1-5 players and like 1-4 Iksar oracles, nothing in between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything the data set was too small because it was based on the magelo thread before it had been updated. I re-averaged the Iksar just out of interest after Soupy updated the thread and it came out at more like 2000hp and 1050ac.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to re-examine the data from the updated profiles/threads then feel free, I've a feeling the overall averages won't change much :)</div></div><hr />

Everyone knows most ogurs are pimps and/or pornstars irl.  I find this study biased towards non ogurs and refuse to recognize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I would agree that the iksars disavatange on the averages there is more related to the fact that on average iksar will be newer characters. Meaning they are less likely to be in a &quot;uber&quot; guild and even if they are they have had less time aquiring high end loot.<br />
<br />
As for the hps different it may or may not exsist at all at the high lvls depending on gear selected. The only difference in hps between an iksar and an ogre is going to be because of thier base hps. Given good enough of the right gear that both are maxed out on sta with buffs they will both have identical hps with the same gear on.<br />
<br />
As a barb shaman I'm currently wearing exactly one peice of gear that our iksar borthern couldn't wear, IGS and barbs are the only ones that can wear that. It's also a peice of gear I'm looking to change out soon too for something that has some hps on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">quite a few of the non iksar shm's here have played since release or at least before kunark, naturally more time to enter the high end game, as well as being there first.<br />
<br />
i was one of the first 50's shm's on server, so i had an easier time than newer shm's, there just werent many choices for the raiding guilds:), iksars come in later and will naturally be less represented in the top guilds(we have none, 1 monk is about it on iksars i think, nor do we have any vah'shiir mains)</div></div><hr />
