<br />
In moron terms please explain why this AA gets such rave reviews?<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's handy if you like to invis and move around in a zone. I bought both levels just because it's a handy tool to have if you need it. I like any AA that has a noticeable effect and adds to our arsenal of utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or...<br />
<br />
Buff up a pet toss him weapons and Suspend him...summon another buff him up.  Pull big mob send unsuspend pet at him for road bump slow/malo etc.   Then resummon first one for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am a boyscout.  Not in RL, but in game.  I like always being prepared, and being able to have half a dozen tricks in my sack should the fecal matter come in contact with the rotating wind-projection pannels.<br />
<br />
If your in a zone for a while, this AA will give you an extra dogdog right when you need it most... when things got bad enough for you first Dogdog to go kersplat.  Buff, mage equip, suspend, summon new dog, buff, mage equip.  Couple these two pups with spirit call, and you can hold off a really bad pull for a Long time.  Long enough to peal them all with slow, and root park em.<br />
<br />
Not saying it's the greatest AA in the world, as probably no one has it in their first 150AA list, but it still is another trick up the sleeve.<br />
<br />
Plus it's really fun to use to throw people off in the arena.  /roleplay, click an illusion potion, and suspend that puppy.<br />
<br />
Or just have one suspended, and one out.  If they manage to root your first pup, just tell it to go away, and unleash the new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its nice if you are a farmer, and to bypass lots of killing of mobs you can just suspend minion-invis. It  has very limited usage for raiding/grouping purposes. I would love for this aa to work through zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very handy just for moving around while hunting the new GoD zones, where traveling with invis up is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question ... while this wont be in my first handful of AAs to get , i can see it may have some use for me kind-of.<br />
<br />
My question is, if you buff a Dogdog and suspend it, do the buffs wear off while it is suspended if the time wears off?  Or do they stay in limbo, so to speak, until you bring out the Dogdog?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After having spent a little time in the GoD instanced zones, I can see this moving up on my list...</div></div><hr />

No they do not buff timer is also suspened on the pet. But you have to have lv2. At lv1 the pet loses all buffs and wepons each time you suspend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pets tend to lag behind and sometimes they get stuck on stairs.<br />
Whenever i have to move a distance in a zone I always suspend my pet.<br />
Going from upper acylia to inner acylia requires you to suspend pet so he can cross over with you.<br />
<br />
It's not a must have AA, but it makes life a wee bit easier at times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, you don't need SM to get puppy to come with you in to Inner Acrylia.  If I remember correctly he does it on his own if you /pet follow, and even if he doesn't you can always use that spell from east commonlands that summons your pet to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I Find that SM comes in handy many times even for groups.  If your pet is suspended when you are Coth'ed in zone you get to keep your pet.  If your pet is suspened when Rezzed you get to keep your pet.  When you are going be pulling several mobs and you dont want your pet to get in the middle of it till you got things under control you can supsend him.  I say for grouping and soloing SM is very handy AA to have.  If you like to explore then it becomes a near requirement as it allows you to have your pet and still use invise with out the lose of your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing tho. If yer pet has been attacking a mob and you attempt to suspend it before said mob is dead, it will not work. You get a message that &quot;your pet is the target of some creature's attentions.&quot;<br />
That is a shame because if you could, it would be like having your own personal monk to &quot;FD pull.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">this AA (at level 2) is very useful if you are camping in a densely populated zone where you are &quot;making the rounds&quot; of several named, and have not got time to clear all the trash in between. Case in point - Veksar: There is a nice cycle of 5 or 6 named that you can keep clear if you have SMII, but if you dont it is a painin the ass to keep IVUing and recreating dogdog at each mob...</div></div><hr />
