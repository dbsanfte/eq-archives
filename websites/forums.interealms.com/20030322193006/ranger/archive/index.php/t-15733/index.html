<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Night before last, I went with three friends to Skyshrine and did the turn-in for the Friend of the Kin quest to Sentry Rotiart.  Handed in dispelling device...&quot;Rotiart has turned into a Kromzek warrior!&quot;....and....nothing. <br />
<br />
We waited, checked track, but nothing ever showed up to kill.<br />
<br />
I reported (/report Rotiart!) and /petitioned, and am still waiting to hear back from a regular GM.  (Well, a GM did send me one tell, but I was in the middle of killing Jaeil, and when we were done, the GM had logged.)   <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this kind of behaviour with Rotiart lately?<br />
