<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thornwhistler</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 2 failures and a bunch of scrounging up the best 24 we could find online, we finally beat Relv's quest.  We expected something grand out of this, perhaps entrance to bastion of thunder.  When Falto finally dropped we went nuts, loot was linked - <br />
<br />
Spectral parchment, some 40 hp/mana boots, and a thunder crystal, oh my.<br />
<br />
I was (happily) awarded the crystal and we all gathered around Relv.  Chatting got no unique responses, so we turned the crystal in.  <br />
<br />
You have gained a character flag! .. well no not really, one could only hope.<br />
<br />
instead we got this (relatively speaking) piece of **** - Ruby Pendant with a Gold Chain<br />
<br />
Magic Lore<br />
Slot: Neck<br />
Wis: +8  Int: +8  HP: +75  Mana: +75<br />
SV Poison: +15<br />
Recommended level 53<br />
all/all<br />
<br />
at first glance this is not bad, probably the highest hp/mana droppable neck item in the game.  But then you look a bit closer.. this is the 1 big reward from Relv's quest?  Perhaps you don't know relv's quest.<br />
<br />
24 people max limit.  3 hour time limit.  Kill 120 mobs, 30 level 62 mobs that split into 3 level 58'ish mobs when they die.  The boss is Falto, and among other things quads for over 1600 and has the classic turgurs immunity that most warrior-class giants in storms have.  Let me refer you back to that 24 person max limit.<br />
<br />
The quest takes a solid four groups, the reward is totally out of balance, and through our best efforts we've found zero link between Askr and relv, or any other plots in storms.  What that means is Relv's quest is purely a loot quest, theres no side benefits, it's a one shot one-necklace deal, with a horrible risk/reward ratio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup its a not so bad weapon, and cheap because the ppl doing the encounter already have better (20K on AB already).<br />
but it is good to have these exist, other good droppable weapons prices drop too (for example amygdalan staff 2HB 37dmg 36dly was 50K before windblade invaded the bazaar, now down to 17-18K).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thornwhistler</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The necklace itself isn't that bad, I'd say drop 10 hp/mana off it and stick it as a rare drop from the giants around the zone.  It is however completely inappropriate as the final hand in reward for Relv's quest.  I hope they change the result to a *no drop* preferably cyclable reward geared toward pure melee's / hybrids / priests / int casters.  Just adding 40 hp/mana, some saves, and aob on it would make it appropriate to the quest.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be so mysterious now would it? :D</div></div><hr />

We ran it last night and basically got the loot that was described in the original post.  Anyone do it lately, have any better luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ran it today, no new loot, did drop a spec parch at the end along with the neck and an 2hb staff. <br />
<br />
no flags or other items gained</div></div><hr />
