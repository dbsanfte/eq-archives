<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every Screenshot on DAoC I have seen is so horribly dark, I can't see anything.  Is the game really that dark?<br />
<br />
Sounded like a lot of fun tho. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah Grinric, it's just that DAoC captures screenshots as Targa (*.tga) files, and few of us bother to touch them up when we convert them to  JPEGs.  I have yet to see any screenshots that do justice to the DAoC graphics.<br />
<br />
I've also bumped up the gamma correction and brightness on my video card drivers, so &quot;night&quot; is probably brighter than EQ night with Ultravision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valfaroth GoldenHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">those pictures suck.....I was standing right there in one of those screenshots but they don't show me...(i was stealthed 90 % of the time) heheheh there's a couple things i don't think is right in the game with stealth.....first off your own realm SHOULD be able to see you....just to be able to know where you are....yeah it's realistic that they don't but oh well 8).....the other thing is when something NEUTRAL (will not attack) to you walks close to you it drops your stealth....i wish that didn't happen unless i was hit....but this is the first time i've ever seen what my stealth looks like to other people and i must say.....I'm pretty damn invisible 8)</div></div><hr />
