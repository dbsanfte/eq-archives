<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torquil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wonder if anyone in England can help me with which ISP to use.<br />
<br />
I've always been on Virgin Net - hardly ever any problems, but paying by the minute.<br />
<br />
Cable and ADSL are not viable for where I live, so I need a cheap dial-up ISP where you are not cut off after two hours.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any help ?  I heard AOL don't have a cut-off time, can you use them for EQ ?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
