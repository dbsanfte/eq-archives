<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">alright, i'm pretty sure i know what rampage is...but can someone clarify what ae rampage is?  and also, might as clarify what normal rampage is too. <br />
<br />
i've always thought ae rampage was just like an AE, except melee, he hits everyone within range on his hate list...not sure though.  help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rampage is an ability that allows a MOB to attack the first person other than the MT, and within rampage range, that attacked it.<br />
<br />
AE rampage is AE melee, where when the MOB rampages, it swings for a round at everything nearby.  There are some MOBs where there's a little window for melees to stand where they can still hit the MOB, but are themselves out of rampage range.  There are other MOBs where this is either impossible (that is, the AE rampage range exceeds the player-hitting-MOB range), or not worth it, because of rough AEs or other mitigating factors to make keepers players just outside of melee range a liability.</div></div><hr />
