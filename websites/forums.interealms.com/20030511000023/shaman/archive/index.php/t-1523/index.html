<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a list of what faction level you should be at during each stage of the quest?  I think it would help everyone immensly and hopefully avoid all these horror stories of people doing a part of the quest and their turn-ins being eaten.<br />
<br />
If there is no list, maybe we could make one?  I wish I had thought of this earlier :\  here is my contribution:<br />
<br />
I have done every section of the quest (as given by belgar's walk-through) up to the point in emerald jungle where the sentinel spirit is waiting for me to come back with the com reports.  I luckily managed to get in on a fear raid last night, and I was the only shaman there.  Just before I killed the iksar broodling and took my tear (:D) I conned her and she was considering my kindly (she sure is cute :)).  Sadly, when we killed the third golem, another broodling spawned (terror and fright i think spawned them, not sure).  Like I said, I was the only shaman there.... the patch ate that broodling :(<br />
<br />
I will return to this thread and update with my new factions as I do the remaining parts of the quests.  Hoping to get my epic done this weekend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
This indeed would have been of great use to me tonight.<br />
I successfully turned in the combined reports booklet.  I was kindly both before and after.   Received the proper text, faction message and exp.<br />
<br />
Immediately afterwards, the pond sentinel ate my Ghiosk books. :(<br />
<br />
I have no idea why, but I had it CONFIRMED by my server GM (who was really VERY nice about it) that it was a faction issue.  He let me turn the 3 books in again (he replaced them and gave back to me) in his presence to verify.  I had been hoping it was a patch day problem.  :(<br />
<br />
Previous to this step, I'd gone ahead and done the Tiny gem a few extra times since I've been camping Gornit for alchemy toes.  The Test of Patience, Wisdom, and Might I did only once.  THE ONLY deviation from the Golan Trevize compilation Epic guide was that I had the Shield of Falsehood, Envy, and Woe already in inventory as a gift from friends and I didn't personally obtain them, though they turned in just fine for the test of Wisdom. :P<br />
<br />
I have since gone back to CoM and am now once again waiting for that blasted courier to give me his Student's Log again.<br />
I also went back to Rathe Mountains and whacked Tabien the Goodly.  No faction hits, but I have another shield to turn in.  Glaron the Wicked was nowhere in sight at loc +2900, -1900.  Rangers in zone didn't have him up, so someone must have whacked him.  Any idea on his respawn time?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can possibly think is that sometime WAY back in my youth before I ever knew about the epic was that I killed some mob or helped on a mob kill that lowered my Truespirit faction.  I was rather indiscriminate in what I whacked early on, and would buff someone who was fighting as soon as look at them.  I took some big hits on the Karanas residents for buffing Miller campers way back when. :P<br />
<br />
This is very depressing.  I already have my Tear and the Icon, and guildmates &amp; friends standing by capable of helping me through the final 3 battles.  The tiny gem faction hits must be tiny, and I don't care to whack the black dire a bunch of times.  Ghiosk books are easy to come by as my guild is raiding reavers regularly and has it down to a one group science, but if they're just going to get eaten again, there's no point.<br />
<br />
No way am I going to draw allies into the Hole just to have Kirn eat my icon the way the spirit sentinel ate the books.<br />
<br />
Any help with the budding faction guide or my personal epic conundrum would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">unless they have changed things in the recent shamn nerf patch, then u cant have TOO much faction.  Maybe try repeating the shield stage?  then whe u can hand in the books from ghiosk ok  do that bit twice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is useless. Here's why.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's say you have to be &quot;ally&quot; to Rak Ashir before handing in your scale. Well, there are many shades of &quot;ally&quot; and SOME of them will fail and some will not. I have known shaman who got to &quot;ally&quot; who failed the handin because they were shortcutting, and I have known shaman who were at ally but succeeded because they did every step in the proper order (but were not max ally).<br />
<br />
Every faction &quot;con&quot; (indifferent, amiable, etc) is actually a RANGE of values. It's really not going to help you to draw up a table.<br />
<br />
Just do ALL the steps in order and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Glaron and Tabien are two hour spawns. Not entirely sure, but I seem to recall reading that from somewhere on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Didja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just got my epic after doing the solo style faction skip using the sheild part to max my faction.  Took me 12 times to receive the message &quot;Your faction could not possible get better&quot; or something like that.  When that clicked I knew there was no going bad.  Sure enough Rak agroed on turn in and had my peice on his corpse for me after fight.  I wouldnt risk it by guessing at faction especially if your skipping any parts.  Doing the Shield part a few extra times can't hurt and is pretty painless really.<br />

I will keep track of my faction as I continue during my quest.  Anyone who does the steps in order to this point, if you could report your /con before and after any of the steps, it would be helpful, and maybe we can start putting something together :)  Also, Frekkels, I understand, from friends, that killing the wandering spirit should take you down to warmly...good luck all :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is what I could find in my logs on True Spirit faction. I did every step according to the book, didnt get too much faction either.<br />
<br />
Before turning in items to wandering spirit in West karana: Indifferent<br />
Before turning in the sparkling gem you received  from the wandering spirit: amiably<br />
Before killing Black Dire: Kindly<br />
Before Handing in the 3 books Lord Ghiosk dropped: kindly<br />
After Handing in the 3 books Lord Ghiosk dropped: kindly<br />
After killing high Scale kirn: Warmly<br />
Before turning in Neh`Ashiir Diary:Warmly <br />
Before Turning in Tear to Lord Rak'Ashiir: Max ally**<br />
After Scale turn in: Max ally<br />
<br />
** On turning in the tear to Lord Rak'Ashiir I got the message &quot;Your faction standing with Truespirit could not possibly get any better.&quot;, which implies I already had max faction before the turn in. This means that you &quot;should&quot; be able to MQ this step as you do not need the factions changes from the turn in. <br />
<br />
Here are the faction ranges so you can see where the big steps are:<br />
<br />
    -xxx  to -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack<br />
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly<br />
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously<br />
    -100 to    -1    ...looks your way apprehensively<br />
         0 to    99    ...regards you indifferently<br />
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably<br />
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you<br />
     750 to 1099   ...looks upon you warmly<br />
   1100 to   xxx    ...Ally<br />

<br />
Doesnt that mean you did NOT get any faction changes? If you did get faction changes with this message, I believe it would be misinforming.<br />
<br />
If you have max faction, you would be informed that you couldnt get any more, but if you where 1 under max faction, you wouldnt get this message. <br />
<br />
Here is a test you can do if you have just reached ally to CoV, but not max ally. Go kill Statue of Ralloz Zek, he is a 500+ faction hit. Now if you dont get &quot;Your faction standing with Claws of Veeshan could not possibly get any better.&quot;, it means I was correct, otherwise you were, Grippa.<br />
<br />
Banana: Correct me if im wrong, but how can you MQ the Scale turn-in? Its ONE item, and I would believe turning it in, means the one that does it gets the item, not you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fatsow - good point, either of us may be correct. I'm in no position to kill the statue so I won't do that test just yet :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
People that do the entire quest in order don't need a faction table. The point of a faction table would be to help people skipping parts of their epic.  The problem is,  there are many differnt levels of ally, amiably, kindly, ect.  This would be a cool idea if there was a way to see what faction you are, but you cant.  Even showeq doesn't show exact faction standing anymore, so what is the point of this table?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">To me, such a list would be quite useful at the time I did my epic. This is because I used the epic walkthrough from Belgars, and it was stated I needed warmly faction for turning in pelt from black dire. I was actually kindly(as I should have been). But I was a bit confused, thinking I had missed one part. I asked some other shammies, they didnt know what faction they did have(odcourse they didnt). Finally I turned the pelt in, and it did work.<br />
<br />
The thing is, people wants to know if they have done everything right, and dont want to **** up when for instance they have killed kirn. Such a list as this may not make you 100% certain you havent f****d up some part, but it would certainly have made me more confident.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Indrii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/agree Fatsow<br />
I did all the steps correctly and in order, but the Ghiosk books didn;t work.  I was at Kindly.  So I repeated the shield step.  Bumped me to Warmly, book turn in was successful.  So therefore, it may be possible to screw up, especially after the patch, without ever really screwing anything up....if that makes sense :)<br />

Fatsow is correct, you don't receive the max faction message until after you've maxed your faction. You could be at max and not know it until your next faction message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of us started our shamans as real, live, true noobs.  Which means we had no idea what an epic even WAS, and all we thought after killing the wandering spirit in WK was &quot;that's one sturdy wisp&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, rather than doing what *I* had to do ... dragged the folks to the hole, used up the ball of golem clay, had my scale eaten, called in an epiced shaman to get the scale from com, run his butt to the hole, and spawn the guy correctly so I could get my @#* ring .... why NOT max ally out before you do something really frustrating like that?<br />
<br />
I did all the steps, but was left to guess about how I'd gummed up that faction back before I really had a good idea of what faction was FOR, much less caring about it.  heh.<br />
<br />
Max out on envy and woe.  Don't risk wasting your friends' and guildies' time on eaten quest pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Glaron the Wicked was nowhere in sight at loc +2900, -1900. Rangers in zone didn't have him up, so someone must have whacked him. Any idea on his respawn time?<br />
<br />
<br />
about two hours. he doesn't wander or anything, when he pops he will stay at the flag thing (looks just like tabien's spawn pt) in the northern of the two ruins in the area north of the feerrott zone (area 11 on the eqatlas map of RM i think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vauk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I also have no clue where my faction &quot;Number&quot; was at prior to starting this quest.  I could have been 100 points below mid indifferent, vs whatever you start at if you have never taken a truespirit faction hit.<br />
<br />
If the point is that you need to be on friendly terms (Max ally, Ally or whatever), then do the quests that seem easiest.  As we all know, you only need the tear from fear and faction to do the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
Yes, our epic is easy compared to others, but if you read the rogues epic thread.....you have to collect a few things, fight a mid level battle and then kill generel.  All the other stuff can be MQ'd or bought.<br />
<br />
My question is.....did they remove the Max Ally bug where you would fail if you had too MUCH faction?<br />
<br />
I also skipped the hole.  No one goes to the hole, no one wants to go to the hole etc.  I did woe/envy a few times, gem part a few times and plan on doing the jboots  a few times.  I got my child tear last night  and want to make sure everything is right with my faction before I go for the final fight.<br />
<br />
Don't blame shaman that did not &quot;walk the path&quot; you walked.  Granted, you'll always hear, &quot;I had to do this and this, so should they&quot; but remember, we learn from previous mistakes.  As most here have done, you followed a walkthrough (Im sure there are some that contributed to solving it or dont use spoilers) and didn't suffer the mistakes the Spear of Fate founders suffered.<br />
<br />
If they made the quest so you had to have items from each of these encounters to do the next encounter....then it wouldn't be an issue.  But they didn't and obviously faction was the guiding factor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Doing the steps in order does not garuntee that you will have sufficient faction.  My Troll shaman friend did all the steps in order but had to do woe and envy a couple extra times to be able to talk to the black dire, I as a barbarian shaman on the other hand did not have a problem talking to him just doing the steps in order.  I don't know if race has anything to do with truespirit faction or if he may have killed some random mob that lowered his truespirit faction as a youngster.  I do think that a table would be nice to avoid getting pieces eaten accidentally for those of us that do follow the steps.</div></div><hr />

I've done the quest from the start, all steps. Killed the pirate/bandit, got the gem, went to FP, was at the ocean bottom, and so on. Gave all items to dogs, never was anything eaten...<br />
<br />
And now I have the Tear, and all I need is the fight with Rak. I just hope that the faction is good enough for me, I have been after this tear for 6 months already.. Would suck to lose it for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

No. That mob lowers faction with Scaled Mystics and Legion of Cabilis, it has nothing to do with Truespirit.<br />
