<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My system's about the same as yours - I JUST got this problem yesterday after I splurged on a new monitor and was able to push my resolution up to 1200 by... 1280 is it?  For what it's worth, I had the same problem you're having as soon as I bumped the resolution up over 1024x768 ... <br />
<br />
Didn't really get a chance to fiddle with it, but I was going to see about verifying the refresh rate in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm ive always had the resolution that high.. wasnt that.<br />
And its a flat panel so no changes to refresh rate...<br />
I do know it happened right after a windows update..../rude bill</div></div><hr />
