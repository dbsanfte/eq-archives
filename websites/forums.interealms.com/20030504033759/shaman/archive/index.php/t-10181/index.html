<br />
I am wondering how slow mitigation works:<br />
<br />
1- Do the mob has a &quot;slow cap&quot; or just reduce the slow by some %?<br />
<br />
2- Anyone has an idea of what % slow refer  mostly, partial succes?<br />
<br />
I am asking this because i tried in Temple of Marr to slow some Honorable dogs, and they are dam high MR, but disease slow seems easier to land. In any case, i have &quot;partial succes&quot; on slows.<br />
<br />
So that why i am asking, because if the mob has a &quot;slow cap&quot; better use disease slow since it is easier, faster and less aggro, especially if mobs are &quot;partially slowed&quot; and high MR. If it slow mitigation affect in % the effectiveness of slow, then turgur is always the best slow, even if its harder to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the mobs that mitigate only are affected by a certain percentage of that slow spells maximum effect.  Some Sony person mentioned that the best slow (Turgurs) will still slow by the highest amount</div></div><hr />
