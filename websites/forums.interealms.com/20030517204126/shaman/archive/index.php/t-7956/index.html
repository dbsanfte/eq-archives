<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm referring to those shaman that have Canni5/torpor, and of course a viable alternate BP to wear instead.  i.e. You have a Vindi BP, canni5, and torpor...  How often, if ever, do you put that Fungi on anymore?  <br />
<br />
I'm still clinging to mine for the moment, but honestly I don't remember the last time I put it on after I got canni5.  I have a Vindi BP and the extra hp do make those big canni5's a little less painful, plus I like having good resists all the time since the resist changes.  What to do...  I don't know of any tradeable equipment I'd really need to buy with the funds from selling my fungi, but I've been wanting one of those fast horses for travelling around just for fun and about the only way I see me raising the pp I need for one is dumping the old fungi, so it's been tempting lately.<br />
<br />
What to do!?!?! :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i wear mine....regen beats all in my book, even with torpor...<br />
<br />
plus, at least for the vest, it looks so darn cool....<br />
<br />
Jag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">put it on a twink!<br />
<br />
I just got mine back from a friend I loaned it to (soloing ranger) and I haven't missed it in the months I haven't had it.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've kept mine around for those fights where trying to resist the AE dot is pointless and the extra 15/tick might keep me alive 1 more round.<br />
<br />
Other than that I don't bother</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't have a twink... Heh, I've tried a few classes both twinked and untwinked, but none have been fun enough to follow through for me.  I've always hated the mind-numbing xp grinds and preferred to take a group somewhere hard and try the impossible even if it wasn't the best xp, and soloing drives me insane with boredom after about an hour so the whole twink thing just hasn't ever really appealed to me.  I am still thinking about throwing a couple weapons on my wee monk that's been sitting inactive for about 8 months now as well as the fungi just to give it one more try...  hrmmmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only play twinks when I need a little tiny break.  Well I only have 1 twink, actually.  A little rogue, with all Hennys old stuff heh.<br />
<br />
She's a twink that's invincible and can solo for mad exp.  That is really fun to play for an hour or so when you just want to hide out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to use mine for soloing indoors. The combined effect of fungi + fungi staff + troll innate would mean I'd never even have to torpor myself killing shrooms.<br />
But now with PoP, my old solo haunts are too low, so its all outdoor EXPing in PoV and the like, so I prefer HPs on vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Once you have torpor, fungi regen is pretty much trivial.  1-60, its an amazing item.<br />
<br />
Of course, againts amazingly hard mobs you could theoreticly stick on fungi, regen potions, etc, and achieve a grand total of around 100HP a tick w/out torpor, so thats 400 with(I dont know stacking issues with potions of course), then add those 300hp insta click heals that are pretty nifty, and you could theoreticly reach amazing amount of healing power, but that alone will cost you several k :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anything that gets my health back up. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I got torpor and Dinged 60 I gave my Fungi to a monk friend for a &quot;Gratz on 60&quot; pressie.<br />
<br />
However now with the new 25/hp tick regen that would mean fungi + replenishment = 40/hp tick regen.<br />
Which would be VERY handy for raids where you got a continual AE DoT wearing you down or just for mana regain.<br />
<br />
AC/HP/Resists on ma Vindy BP are hella nice though :)<br />
<br />
Possibly I could try to duo or trio the FG caller quest on &quot;slow&quot; setting with another level or two and some more AA's. <br />
Then I can try to net a SoL Fungi tunic. $$ F@#% paying 100kpp for a new one (old one was only 22k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a big fan of the fungi, even with torpor.  IMHO, it's still the best shaman BP in the game.  You have 20 slots to add stats with but only one for permanent regrowth.  A smidgen of AC or HP's is nothing compared to be healed 24/7 and a good shaman is always wounded.</div></div><hr />

There is a similiar discussion going on here. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=7855) <br />
<br />
I'm only 60 w/ Torpor/Malo.  No Canni5 until lots more AA points are earned. :p<br />
<br />
I returned my loaner Fungi to my guildleader last night, shortly before the patch.  I was a little worried they might do something drastic like make them NO DROP instead of just MAGIC. ;)<br />
(A little paranoid...maybe. :D)<br />
<br />
I wore my Hate BP &amp; didn't notice a difference since I have Torpor.<br />
Kept up with mana demands just fine raiding Kael arena &amp; Throne room.  Damn that Royal Kromriff blood!  Someone pp'd it.  Wish they made THAT tagged MAGIC! :mad: <br />
<br />
I'll be jaunting off to CS to finish my BP quest (see other thread) today. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
