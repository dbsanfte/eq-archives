<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm a pretty tough customer.  I'm always looking for a good buy.  As a shaman I think I got ripped off in Luclin.  I enjoyed the content, but other than Group Focus, I think my shaman got a lot less value from Luclin than other classes, like um, rangers, wizards, enchanters to name a few.<br />
<br />
So what will get me to plink down my plat for Planes of Power?<br />
<br />
1.  First, fix all the broken stuff, especially shaman Kunark spell drops.<br />
2.  Fix alchemy.  Raise the skill cap, lower the costs.<br />
3.  Fix shaman AA skills.  Make rabid bear useable.<br />
4.  Finish caster balancing.  Give me a liberal sprinkling of focus effects on stuff I already have.  Right now I got, oh my heck, summoning haste II on my shadel bandit ring.<br />
5.  Fix caster melee abilities.  Right now a froglok kor shaman can take more of a beating than I can.  Well, if I'm as naked as him, that is.  And he sure can hit better than me.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, those items aren't NEW features.  Sheesh.  Well here's some ideas for new features:<br />
<br />
1.  Give me some decent spells.  I want a sta/agi/ac buff to go along with Focus, both individual and group versions.  I want a new poison dd.  Some other creative spells like curses would be nice.<br />
2.  Give me some decent shaman equipment.  How many monk-only items drop in NToV?  Lots, but mah Shield o' Wurms is the only shaman-only thing that drops.  Heck, monks can even wear Cloak of the Sky.<br />
3.  Give me some new, fun, well-balanced abilities that I don't have now.<br />
<br />
I know the content will be there.  It always is.  Nice new monsters, quests, and encounters.  But I need fresh air.  I need to see my character in a new light.  I need to get out of the old, stuffy, slow mastah, buff-o-matic in groups/raids, jbb-epic solo routine.  Give me some choices of different things I can do or roles I can play.  I can still do the old stuff if I need to.<br />
<br />
Show me something new and exciting for my shaman, and I'll show you da money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmm, not sure I'd want an agi/sta/AC buff...chances are it wouldn't stack with aego.  Since 90% of my time is spent raiding or at least grouping with a cleric, that would render the agi/sta combo useless.<br />
<br />
For me, the two big selling points of PoP are:<br />
<br />
1) Ease of transportation.  They seem to be opening all the firepots in all cities and making them two-way.  I hate waiting for ports, I hate waiting for boats, I hate waiting on the Nexus, this is a big seller for me.<br />
<br />
2) I heard they are making zones that &quot;split&quot; for multiple raiding groups so no one has to share or fight over mobs.  I don't know if this is true, or just a rumor, but this would be a big deal to me.<br />
<br />
I would like a better DD though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will probably buy PoP when it's released just because it's out and I don't want to miss out on anything...lol...<br />
<br />
I, too like the idea of the expanded firepots.  Getting around quickly anymore is almost a neccessity rather than a luxury.  The game is getting so big it might take you 30-45 minutes to get to where you want to group, even with ports...<br />
<br />
I would like to see alchemy enhanced to where it was acutally a valid tradeskill...<br />
<br />
A better DD might be nice but I'd just as soon they give us a new line of very quick casting (2-3 secs), short duration (15-20 seconds), virtually unresistable Dots (curses maybe???) that don't have a DD component tied to them...<br />

<br />
Oh, good point.  Ok, drop the AC and let it stack with Aego.  Or, to be a bit creative, make it a sta/agi/cha buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sta/agi/cha buff<br />
<br />
haha! I love it, spirit of Giraffe anyone?<br />
<br />
edit: oh btw, I've not been keeping up with PoP interviews etc, someone please tell me they're not thinking of upping the level cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blah, no more buffs.   Would like PoP to present us some more variety of debuffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will never happen.. now just an Agil stam buff might be possible but Shaman have never been the &quot;masters&quot; of AC buffing, that is the cleric arena.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 2. Give me some decent shaman equipment. How many monk-only items drop in NToV? Lots, but mah Shield o' Wurms is the only shaman-only thing that drops. Heck, monks can even wear Cloak of the Sky. <br />
<br />
Searching ToV for shaman items<br />
<br />
... 66 items found<br />
<br />
Not real sure why it must be &quot;sham only&quot; for you to think you can't use. A good portion of the stuff in north is All/all. Many shaman get defaulted Onyx gear from north.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd like to see an agi/sta combo buff, other than that I can't think of any buffs that I'd like that they'd actually give us (dmg shield would be cool for solo purposes, maybe self-only, but we won't ever see). Group shrink, as mentioned in another thread, would be really nice too. Maybe some kind of pet buff, hp, long lasting haste + disease dot proc or something.<br />
<br />
I'll get PoP for the ease of travel alone. Sounds like they're putting a huge story line into it too, should be interresting for those that like doing something other than killing uber_mob_84. The new zones and ways of fighting in them sounds cool, hope they're not making them too hard to get into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">New DD sounds really cool.  The new combo buff, i dunno.  As a high end raiding shaman I dont even bother with agility buff, just G focus and G stamina.  I used to do agility as well but a) people where droping it from lack of buff slots b) the benefits are minimual.  if I cast it on myself ac goes up like 10 max less for tanks etc.  So i guess it would be nice to have a sta/agi buff but far from neccessary in my opinion.  And when orginal poster commented on AA points, ummm canni5  is very very very nice.  makes up for rabid bear and alchemy mastery :) <br />
<br />
Also making alchemy more usefull would be cool. same for focus items though we all survived without them can keep doing it if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You already know what my answer to this would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still want snare and stun so :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Combo STA/AGI buff would rock and a group version at 60th. I would LOVE that. Make it last the same duration as FoS and group FoS.<br />
<br />
Other then that.. I dont want a thing.. except maybe a little fixing of the rarity of our (kunark)60th spells and a liberal dosage of druid screwing over =p(always makes one feel warm and fuzzy inside!)</div></div><hr />

If they fix both I am in for PoP, if not, adios.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Very easy to do, Anarchy Online does have a similar system. <br />
<br />
EQ already has a scion mechanism that can be used for that purpose:<br />
<br />
- Make a Plane of Fire scion (Nexus Scion clone).<br />
- You can buy from it Staff of Fire, unlimited charges of some summon powerstone gizmo. Costs about 2 million plat maybe even 3. Has an unique serial number on each staff, so each powerstone has the same unique identifier. Powerstone is Lore.<br />
- Whenever you access Plane of Fire, scion checks if you have a powerstone. If not it ports you to the FFA plane that everyone can access. If yes it ports you to a copy of the plane having the same serial number as your staff, your guild ports to you OWN PRIVATE plane, eliminate the bull**** races, KS, trains and other crap from other guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starts at hmmmm 85% and fades in effectiveness... hhehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What's with the firepot thing, I've never heard of that.. ? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You mean, never heard of the firepot room or haven't heard of their plans to expand the functionality of the firepot room in PoP?<br />
<br />
1) Firepot room - room in TD with 12 firepots, each leading to an Antonican or Kunark city if you click on them.  For a brief time after Kunark, you could bind there.  Then, for a long time you couldn't bind in TD at all.  About a month ago, they allowed casters to bind themselves there again and I've been bound there ever since.<br />
<br />
Destinations include:<br />
<br />
Halas<br />
Felwithe<br />
Kelethin<br />
Freeport<br />
Kaladim<br />
Cabilis<br />
Rivervale<br />
Grobb<br />
Ogguk<br />
Erudin<br />
Neriak<br />
Akanon<br />
<br />
It's GREAT for tradeskilling, great for banking/selling.  It's not too bad for getting to Luclin, since it's a quick gate to TD, click on Kelethin, run to Gfay wiz spire.  It's annoying to try to get to Velious.<br />
<br />
2) It's been hinted that PoP will expand on the firepot idea, adding more and making them two-way.  One of the planes (Tranquility?) may also serve as some type of &quot;firepot&quot; room, allowing easy access to all old world cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nope.. I hide in luclin<br />
<br />
Thanks :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have decided to boycott PoP until I have my spells from three expansions earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Me too, WTB torpor 30k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A 60% lure slow would rock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">probably have no-drop kunark spells on venders in pop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't even spend much time in Luclin, due to the lag. Not sure<br />
if I'll spend the money on another expantion unless they can<br />
do something about reducing the lag. I don't give a damn how<br />
pretty the graffics are; if I have trouble with basic game <br />
mechanics, the expantion is not an asset. <br />
<br />
Now if they chose to reduce the number polygones and &quot;static<br />
art&quot; (like trees), that would entice me. The &quot;private zones&quot; might<br />
be a help in this area, due to less people in the zone. Unless we<br />
have to cram 36 people into one room (like Hate). <br />
<br />
Yes, when Luclin came out I followed all of the lag reducing<br />
suggestions. I even play without sound now. The new engine<br />
is in actuality LESS emersive for me.</div></div><hr />
