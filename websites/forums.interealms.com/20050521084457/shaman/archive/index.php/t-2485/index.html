<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where's a good place (forum/board) to meet and get to know folks on Innoruuk?  I work a lot during the day and I'm trying to restart there after coming from DAoC for a year.<br />
<br />
I have a couple friends there and I've been given some decent gear to start out with, so I'm not after gear or anything, but the folks I know are casual players and I'm not.   Before DAoC I was a very strong shaman on Xegony server named Ciccero with 200+ days played and hundreds of hours of high end raid experience.<br />
<br />
I'd like to find a solid guild of folks who aren't so greedy and bloodthirsty for the latest trinket or bauble it's scary to watch 'em, but who are active and strong enough they can do things like ToV and other raids in general.  I'm working my way back up the ranks as a troll this time around.  I want to get to know folks and I'm working on it, but I'm still GM of my guild on DAoC and principle weaponsmith for my server there, so I'm having to slowly transition myself off there and make sure my guild and realm are taken care of.  DAoC just isn't shaping out to be what I'd originally hoped it would become.</div></div><hr />

It is really funny because we are very similar.  I used to have a 300+ days played shaman on Innoruuk and left for DAOC.  I enjoyd it a great deal for a long time ( 41 shaman, 50 skald), but have finally returned home to EQ (random server pick = Rodcet Nife).   I too have picked a Troll this time around.  Good luck, and Garth is a pretty good resource on Inno in all things shaman.<br />
