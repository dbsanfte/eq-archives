From what I recall, though, it was already made public long ago that there could be no inter-realm grouping.  They are apparently trying to maintain the whole good vs. evil aspect of the game.  As far as inter-realm warfare, I just figured it would be an optional part of the PvP side of the game.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, they will implement enough PvE content for the high end game to keep the game fun for those of us who don't plan on participating in a pure PvP environment.  If not, I guess I'll just get bored and have to try something new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I think the RvR system in DaoC is very well done.  It could use a little balancing, but the system itself is great.  If you were in the mood for pvp, you went to the frontier and fought alongside your buddies.  If you weren't in the mood, you didn't go and were safe from harrassment.</div></div><hr />

Thats the thing i'm worried about. Blizzard was rescently bought by EA? and the original founder quit the company. They used to have a very good rep but give the change in upper management I'm not so sure thats going to hold anymore which is a shame. I've also bought pretty much every game they have made and they where all quality games even if they weren't my favorite games.<br />
<br />
RvR aspect doesn't worry me. If blizzard does it it's gonna be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">RvR done right adds something many of the current and coming mmorpg's lack - backstory. DAoC on paper looked to have this setup fairly decently, but failed miserably in execution. I won't go and jump on the WoW hype ship just yet, tho it is shaping up to be a pretty good game. Having an alpha build that looked and ran beautifully doesn't hurt as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its PvP?  Its not for me then.<br />

PvP in MMORPGS always seems to end up as Griefer vs. Player, with the player placed in a no-win situation.  If I want PvP I'll play an FPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP will only be enabled in a few zones,and a coupe of arenas .<br />
<br />
Players will not be able to walk into any zone they want and start griefing people.As there is no PvP enabling in most zones. <br />
<br />
The PvP will be consensual in the sense that all players will know what zones are PvP enabled . Enter at your own risk .<br />
<br />
These PvP enabled zones are there for exactly that reason...PvP . There is no requirement , loot,travel or otherwise that will force players to enter these zones.<br />

Nope. Go check the Blizzard company information. They're still owned by Vivendi. :)<br />

<br />
Ok, lets clear this out once and for all... The &quot;founders&quot; that quit the company where NOT blizzard founders. They where part of a company that Blizzard BOUGHT and renamed to Blizzard north who`s ONLY job have been to work on Diablo (they where developing Diablo 1 when bought and have since then done the expansions and Diablo2). They are in no way connected to WoW, nor does them leaving affect WoW in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mamluke256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Still, with uppermanagment leaveing any company like that something must be going on.  They may not have anything to do with WoW, but maybe they know something we dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok I never RvR'ed or PK'ed in EQ, but I do in DAOC - A LOT.<br />
<br />
DAOC's RvR is designed around 3 realms (Midgard, Hibernia, and Albion) fighting each other in designated areas.  These areas include: Darkness Falls (A dungeon) and the four 'frontier zones' of each realm. (One gets there by either: a) Walking through a gate to YOUR frontier or b) Buying a teleport ticket).<br />
<br />
There is no way (other than a hack or exploit) for somebody to get into the n00bie area inside your realm. Now, if you are a 'young un' and out in the frontier - yeah, you are fair game.  (There is a supposed exp bonus to frontier hunting).<br />
<br />
Darkness Falls is a different animal. It is a dungeon whose 'ownership' changes hands depening on the number of keeps (Located in the frontier) owned by a particular realm.<br />
<br />
However, it is possible for people to fight in DF. Stealthers (People who can go 'invisible' (Sorta) make their living fighting and being fought in DF. Anti-stealth groups form and hunt out stealthers in DF.<br />
<br />
DAOC PvE blows donkey nuts. It is horrid, slow, tedious and not exciting at all.<br />
<br />
DAOC RvR is well done and a blast. (Unless you don't like that in which case you're probably playing the wrong game).<br />
<br />
IF You are into hand-holding, touchy-feely crapola then the DAOC &quot;cooperative&quot; server is for you. All three realms work together to take keeps in all three frontiers and groups can include members of Midgard, Albion, and Hibernia and they can communicate with each other.<br />
<br />
I played on the co-op server for 3 days.  Paint the walls with my brains. Same stuff as regular PvE.</div></div><hr />

I guess the question would be...since &quot;the game isn't even in Beta yet&quot; how in the hell do YOU know &quot;it will be good and ALOT of people will play...&quot;?<br />
<br />
Hmm? Well?<br />
<br />
One shouldn't slam others and then turn around and make the exact same type of assumptions they're slamming the other person for. No?<br />
<br />
Personally, I've never cared for PvP in any form that I've encountered it in to date. Granted, that hasn't been in many games, but it's the absolute SUCK in the ones I have. I'm not passing judgement on WoW yet, but I will say that PvP games have historically been a big turn off for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The problem with DAOC in my opinion was the lack of balance, not only just character v character (remember left axe then those those inflitrators Mill??), but sheer numbers.<br />
<br />
It really is no fun 10 vs 15 or 20 players at a time, which was my DAOC experience.  Sometimes we would own them, sometime they would own us.  Skill means little when its 2 on 1.<br />
<br />
When it DID work it was, very, very cool.  Was in some epic, balance fights that were a real blast.  Trouble was they were VERY rare.<br />
<br />
Don't know how WoW will correct for player number imbalances.<br />

Ya, two things bummed me out, Zergs, Albs and Hibs in my case, and infiltrators. I studied many, many logged fights and the difference was crazy. I would deal out about 300 damage a round, Infil would deal me 450 + poison, owies. That is actually what made me quit. No fun playing on a field that isnt even.<br />
<br />
But still a great pvp game, the fort batles were the most fun ever as a SB, could climb up walls, stab an archer in the head, jump off, etc. People were always scared to stand still, well done.<br />

<br />
Not exactly. Three of the people who quit were founders of the company that became Blizzard North after Blizzard bought the original company.  While they had nothing to do with Blizzard South games, their part of the company is pretty much gutted without those three people. (And the worth of Blizzard as a whole has taken a hit, whether you thought the Diablo games were much good or not.)  The fourth person, Bill Roper, has had a fair bit to do with development in both halves of Blizzard, as both a team leader and spokesperson - it's hard to think of a single person more publicly identifiable with Blizzard.  I'd say Vivendi's already somewhat desperate attempts to unload their games division (which stinks aside from Blizzard) are due to become more desperate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Vivendi owns Blizzard? Vivendi's finances are in the toilet. They're<br />
currently trying to sell off their TV networks (USA and Sci-Fi), movie<br />
studio, and theme parks to reduce their debt. Wouldn't be supprised<br />
if Blizzard changed hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">DAoC PvP balance was non existent and there was not enough PvE content.  Not only were there problems of one side outnumbering another, there were certain classes that ruled.  I quit back when mez/stun were the factors and you couldnt resist them.  Archers would kill in single shots without worry of being captured, same thing was basically true with all stealthers, made PvP pretty crummy if you werent one of those classes.  <br />
<br />
Overall, it was fun until you learned you werent one of the kill classes and the xp grind wasnt worth going back to make one of them.  The only good thing about DAoC was that Verant/Sony took a lot of great ideas from it.  I quit feeling I had given them plenty of time to balance things, that had to be 8-10 months after release suffering through 'you are stunned, you are nuked to oblivion' or 'one shot, you have been killed by griefer_archer98'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
huh... are you smoking crack?  Vivendi owns arguably the top 2 out of the top 3 gaming companies out there for PC's, Blizzard and Sierra.  Counterstrike has outsold and outplayed any game out there by a hell of a long time, it revolutionized the FPS field.  It is still being played 5 years after coming to the market?  <br />
Sony rounds out the top 3 in my opinion.. EQ is a moneymaker.. 50 mil a year in profit i think.  Even though alot of people here don't like it.. SWG added alot of &quot;new blood&quot; to the mmorpg stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Talabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">&quot;Face it, once your hooked on evercrack youre not going anywhere.

I had no idea I was such a masochist. whens EQ2? &quot;<br />
<br />
It's the loot/content and zone/mob verity. Believe me I know what I am talking about. I have tried them ALL and find myself wishing for things EQ has.<br />
<br />
DAoC - Great idea but died off cause of content and loot. Not until spell crafting and alchemy entered the game was a player somwhat unique. Everyone was a carbon-copy of everone else.<br />
<br />
SB - Another nice idea but again lack of content/loot. The best loot in the game could be purchased from your guilds vendor. And once again there were carbon-copies of toons. After attacking and baning a city 10 or 20 times it got boring. There was nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
Face it EQ (in it's current state) has more loot/content then ANY game made and that is why it is so successful. Even in the beginning EQ had epic battles that made you want to keep coming back. Personally I think the only bad move by Sony/VI was PoP. Kunark put a hurting on EQ but they came back well from it but PoP just made the game suck. The forgot what made EQ so great with PoP IMHO.<br />
<br />
WoW seems to understand what &quot;works&quot; in a MMORPG.. They took the best of every game and put it into one. EQ loot/content (So I read) and DAoC PvP/RvR. I think the game will be very successful and I'm looking forward to it. But when it comes down to it I can't wait for EQ II..<br />
<br />
Sorry but we are all loot whores..  :D</div></div><hr />
