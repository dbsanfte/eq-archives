<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Hill giants toes can be used for alchemy, as can ice giants and fire giants (or so I believe).<br />
<br />
What about frost giants toes from giants  in Kael Drakkel, Great Divide etc - can potions be made with thise?<br />
<br />
If so, what potions, and what other ingrediments?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hill, Ice &amp; Fire giants are old world - they were in when old Alchemy was created.  Kunark was added after the revamp - so probably not used for any potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience Storm and Frost Giant toes are not components for any potions. Though if anyone has an info to contradict this I would be very interested in it. Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Storm and Frost Giant toes are DNC with any of the gypsy herbs.  I have not tried them with the other few dozen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SOmebody better Caaaaaaall somebody!!<br />
Just add a BALM herb and 1 ICE GIANT toe for a BAD ASS potion!!<br />
Its a INSTANT +350 HP potion and adds +15 str!<br />
<br />
Yes....INSTANT +350 hp!!   <br />
Gonna DIE?   Hot key this button, live and run;)<br />
These sell in stacks of 10 for 2k on my server!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*nod* the potion is called Calimony.  It just plain old rocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
We use them on raids to keep the cheal chain back a hair to save aggro for the clerics.  2 of them do a fine job for the MT to cheal once (well, almost)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Callimony is not the potion here. It does not give this effect,<br />
<br />
Which potion gives this 350 life??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stinging Wort is the potion.  Calimony is the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you.. yes Stinging Wort.. semantics.<br />
<br />
It basically acts like Talisman but like talisman, when it leaves it leaves the valid HP's and then reassigns more as it adds them. <br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't use it as a ditch potion as a shaman.. If I'm in that situation in the first place 350 hp aren't going to save me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm just barely where this potion is combining more often than not.  (I was stuck at 106 for over 200 combines... then got unstuck!  WOOHOO!)<br />
<br />
Very handy little potion in the 5 and 10-dose flavors.  The true beauty of it is that you can just click away the entire stack for 1500 or 3k heal.  <br />
<br />
Made a 5 dose for myself the other day.  Gonna have to go back and do more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can get a lesser effect from Undead's Recourse also.<br />
<br />
150 hp with a buff icon, instant click. Lasts ~5 mins.<br />
<br />
Need Warbone chips -- which drop off skeletons in Unrest and possibly Rathe Mountains, Butcher Block and Lavastorm -- and Damiana, which is only sold in Shar Vahl. Should cost about 25pp per potion i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gah, I don't think the potion effect for hte Ice giant toes potion has ever been correct.  I went to alot of boring effort to get Warbone chips; at least with icegiants I get a little xp and some coin, as well as Essence of winters.  Ok.. back to Everfrost!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nope this one was fixed.. we use these on BGH's to keep the cheal chain back one heal.  Drives the pallies ape (no Divine Whatever buff) but other than that the Clerics seem to love it.<br />
<br />
The Stinging Wort that is</div></div><hr />
