<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This SUCKS.... there is no fast way and smart way to get to elder in 24 points for your class abilities.<br />
<br />
See obviously you go for:<br />
<br />
9 into MGB<br />
5 into Cann5<br />
<br />
and i really like the idea of topor in 3 sec :) so <br />
<br />
Quickbuff 1<br />
3<br />
Quick Buff 2 <br />
6<br />
<br />
thats 23!!!! one less than needed for Elder<br />
<br />
ANd the next quick buff is 12 points away so i have to wait that long for ELder<br />
<br />
<br />
I refuse to rabid bear and pet discipline and dont do alchemy that leaves us with spell casting mastery at 8 points but i need spell casting reinforcement in arch so im scrwed there too<br />
<br />
WHat do i do!  i could prolly do quick buff the opposite way instead of canna 5 but blah i want MGB and Canna 5 first since they are the most usefull<br />
<br />
any advice?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats pretty much where i'm at. Got run 3, regen 3, MC 3, cann v and mass group buff with one point to spend right now. I want to get elder because I hate venerable but Quick buff 1 and 2 leaves you one point short and needing 9 points for quick buff 3. I don't care for pet mastery, alchemy or rabbid bear and buff reinforcement require you spend 12 points in arch type first. At this point I'm probably gonna go for quick buff 3 just because and get my title altho my aa points have really slowed down since getting mgb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fastest way?<br />
<br />
18 -- quick buff3<br />
6 -- pet<br />
---------------------<br />
24 total<br />
<br />
that combo is really suck  hehe, or try this way for fastest way inclucde best skill:<br />
5 -- canni5<br />
9 -- Mass Group Buff<br />
5 -- Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery(+12 for Archetypes)<br />
5 -- rabid bear (for fun and title, then get quick buff next)<br />
---------<br />
24+12 = 36point total !! <br />
<br />
or<br />
5 -- canni 5<br />
9 -- mass group buff<br />
18 --quick buff (3+6+9)<br />
---------<br />
32 total<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement + mastery cost 17 while quick buff cost 18point, Topor heal 1800hp &gt; half the casting time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think spell casting reinforcement mastery costs 8..not 5. <br />
<br />
?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah,<br />
<br />
go MC3 then Canni 5<br />
<br />
Put one point into SC Reiniforcment (to get extra torpor tick). Then whatever works like Quick Buff 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on what situations you are in when comparing Torpor in 3 seconds and 1800 torpor heal.<br />
<br />
Now, torpor for 1800 hp would save you some castings and some mana. 3 sec torpor would save you quite some interrupts and deaths. 1800 torpor would ofcourse help on that, but what if you cant get of torpor?<br />
<br />
Here is an example from yesterday:<br />
We where in HoT farming SS gear, we had a shimmering Drake in camp, Chanters where about oom and couldnt sieve, so the drake kept gating out again and again. Eventually we got an elder shard wyvern in camp(hits for 270, doubles, yellow con). Ppl started falling as we didnt have too many there, clerics where starting to get LOM. So decided to start tanking the bastard hoping I could do the healing myself without making the clerics even more LOM.<br />
<br />
So I tanked it for 8 minutes, for a total of 21078 damage, while the others took out the drake. Had generated so much agro on the wyvern though that he kept agro on me under the whole fight. Now, with torpor cast time of 3 seconds, I had no trouble whatsoever on casting torpor in between hits, and I was self healing without help for the whole fight. So, im pretty happy with fast cast 3. Although I will eventually get longer lasting buffs.<br />
<br />
If you where a naki fast cast ring, it doesnt seem to make it 2.1 sec cast time as it should be, still casts in 3 sec although it says 2.1 sec :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great story Fatsow! Thats what makes it fun to be a shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah was fun. <br />
<br />
Saw that other thread about Lodizal and a guy on test soloing him. I went through the log from when he started tanking him till end. Looked like Lodizal did 202 dmg average every tick. That wyvern of mine did 240 per tick. Lodizal hits for max 300, wyvern 270, but lodizal hits every 8 second after slow, wyvern every 5 sec. So I really dont see the big problem about taking out lodizal out, with some aa skills and some buffage(if thats still considered soloing him)<br />
<br />
As long as you can keep your mana pool relatively intact while dog is shewing on him, lodizal should really be a no brainer, unless im  missing something. Ofcourse you have to camp him and keep him away from other ppl taking him(pull him to a distant location where dog is parked).<br />
<br />
Havent tried to solo Lodizal yet though, but planning on doing it eventually, maybe with some more aa skills, mainly SCM3 and longer torpor time. Also some more ac would help.<br />
