<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild has gotten to the point where SoL targets are within our reach.<br />
<br />
While in Akheva Ruins we saw The Insanity Crawler up. So headed to him but by the time we reached him it despawned. So we decided to put him on our scouting list. Sure enough once again he is up but checking back an hour later he is gone.<br />
<br />
I have read all the posts about him and we have tried the killing everything method of trying to get him to spawn. Anyone have some good information on how and if he is triggered and if he has a spawn timer (i.e. we see he was up monday he will be triggerable again in 3 days?)<br />
<br />
I understand that if he is agro'd he will despawn 30 minutes later but my main issue is trying figure out how and what spawns him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He will also despawn even if he remains unaggroed.<br />
<br />
Also, so your trackers/hunters know, there is several traps that when triggered say the insanity crawler is up, these are just text spam from the traps and he is not actually up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">His loot is utter crap. Seriously, I wouldnt spend too much time trying to track him down and kill other than to say you did it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im still wearing his belt at level 61, its average loot at best but an easy kill a good training for avoiding AE's and keeping one tank with aggro.<br />
<br />
Usually the only method to get him is to have people hunting in akheva, hear the spawn 'Centi's run about scared, what could have scared them' or something similar, and to scream for your guild to rush to akheva, having a monk pull him along the corridor parallel to the first corridor and engage him there (clearing centis first)<br />
<br />
send me a tell serverwide for better description if you want im currently fighting a GW :) ;tell karana.urdegish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He's on a spawn timer just like VaDyn's.  I can't remember off the top of my head if it's 3 or 7 days though.  <br />
<br />
Once the IC is up, you have 1 hour to engage before it despawns.  It is slowable, doubles for 200ish on a defensive warrior, has an aoe mana drain, and spawns a bunch of little crawlers if anybody dies.<br />
<br />
If you pin him against the wall in the hallway directly north of his spawn point, you can hide your mana-users against the wall at the base of the steps.  Just make sure your tank is in range before the fight starts. <br />
<br />
Easily doable by 1 group of 65s or 2 groups of 55+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So basically if you don't catch him in time he despawns but is set on a timer. So if we could we can have a monk agro him and keep him busy for more then hour if needed.<br />
<br />
Yes his loot does suck but when you have a guild full of FT1 casters and Enchanters crying for KEI he becomes an easy solution mostly since the others guild on my server have all but left Aruins. Plus he is also a good training fight vs AoE and Death adds.</div></div><hr />
