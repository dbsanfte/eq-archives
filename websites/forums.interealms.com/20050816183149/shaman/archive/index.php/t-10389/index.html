<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took a look at the loot list on Allakhazam for the Royals in preparation for an upcoming raid, and imagine my surprise to find Malo and Torpor on the list.<br />
<br />
Is this for real?  If so, why aren't people discussing the Royals as a possible source for these spells the way they talk about the Emperor in Seb or Guardian Wurms?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, I saw Torpor drop from Queen once, quite a while back. <br />
<br />
And they aren't talked about because that crawl down to King is the suck, and the rest to the Queen is the ubersuck.<br />
<br />
Fudapuda<br />
Bertox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think it's a real common drop for either. I've been on ~6 Royals kills and haven't seen one drop yet.<br />
<br />
Like Fudapuda said, it's a pain crawling down to them. You need tight crowd control because because things can get outta hand pretty easily. Our puller is usually a 62nd level monk and except in a few cases, the pulls were more of a controled train to the group. <br />
<br />
The mobs are pretty tightly packed in a number of areas. If things go wrong, you can agro the king early, then it's bad news because he shows up with his entire room. We did it with one really good enchanter assisted by 3 necros. Even then there could be up to 6 mobs parked. It was a lot of fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Royals are a interesting fight.    Just a couple days ago I was part of a 6 person group that went down to Royals ent and then moved over to Herbalist for Necro epic piece.    65's were getting some dark blue mobs ... closer to Royals ent I was getting mostly DB's at 62.   <br />
<br />
What was fun on this was the 4-6 pulls without a Enc.   AE slow works great here for locking things down ... and the damage output of most of the mobs are a joke compared to any yard trash PoP mob.   <br />
<br />
Inside the Royals area does require some thought and care.    And getting close to Queen area can be a death warrant if not done properly.   But it's certainly easier nowadays than before PoP.    <br />
<br />
Lastly, I've done Royals at least 15 times and NEVER seen Torpor or Malo fall.    So don't count on it from a Shaman prespective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I won't count on it, but we're going down there anyway so it's nice to know there is a CHANCE at something nice for me, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Royals are for warrior, enchanter, cleric epic drops. Spell drops are just a side bonus there, not the reason to go.<br />
<br />
3 enchanters chain-casting AE stun is how we handle the Overking and Queen rooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Done the King probably 12 times.  Never has Topor or Malo dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seen Malo drop a couple times off the King...never seen anything great for spells off the queen myself...should be able to drop it just as common....or uncommon as the case may be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done the queen several times. She did drop avatar. The reason why you don't see a lost of postings is because she's a pain to get to, she only spawns every 2 hours, and for her to drop any spells is semi rare. <br />
<br />
The emp on the other hand pops 30 minutes, is a chump and you only need a small group to get to him. The biggest pain is the rogue factor for his room. <br />
<br />
G Wurm for me at least are even better because you can have 5 up at any given time, it's an outdoor zone, and they are rarely camped. Now I've had zero luck getting Malo of any of these bastids but I feel my odds are better from the G Wurms just for the total number at bats I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got my copy of Malo from the King. Then saw 3 more copies drop from him on different raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sucks for me then :) Last time we went we stayed for 8 hours doing the royals for our clerics. Avatar was it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did Royals last night for epic pieces and I have to agree that they are very easy mobs nowadays.  We had 65 paladin tanking and mobs pretty much couldn't scratch him with their melee. Queen AE is of course always a problem. Pull tactic was the brutal pull whole King room...kill...pull whole Queen room...kill... worked ok with one 65 enchanter with 1500 rune.<br />
<br />
Our guilds benefit in Chardok is that we have couple peeps with nonkos faction...me, rogue and a mage. So &quot;break in&quot; is very easy....just coth invissed raid to corridor before ramp to King room :)  King was down 15 mins after first coth and queen 30 mins. Slow landed from melee range to King on first try after malo (maybe I was lucky?) <br />
<br />
No spells dropped. Actually in Fennin Ro only &quot;sure&quot; resource for Malo I know is Severilous. Seve drops it quite constantly here. For Torpor I would say Emperor Chottal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bumbek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got my copy of Malo off chardok king a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We killed the king and Queen 3 or 4 times and got 1 copy of Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One copy of Torpor and one of Pox I believe, off Queen.  No idea with King.  We did the Mage/Rogue with good faction thing too.  With that you can have the raid killing royals in 15 mins.  Its well worth the faction work if you have a few epics still to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got my copy of malo off the king, about 8 months back.<br />

64 Shaman on CT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have been on 4 royals raids and we got torpor on two of them. Have not seen malo though. We have had 4 copies of torpor drop in the last 4 months off royals (2 copies), telk and sev but not one copy of malo (.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail,<br />
<br />
I also picked up Malo off of the Chardok King.<br />
This was about 2-3 months ago I think.<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">seen the king drop avatar once.<br />
<br />
Very one-groupable tho for king, and queen too if it's a group of ubers.</div></div><hr />
