<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long beyond annoying now. This is an entirely random thing. 3 times an hour, or 6 hours of gameplay with no crash. Essentially I just get booted to desktop, and win 2k notifies me that an error has occured in eqgame.exe<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting really irritated with this happening while im helping lead raids or do loot calls, or grouped with folks or pling my warrior.....grrr.<br />
<br />
I posted about this a while back and had tried trimming back some my my ram speed settings, slower than factory now and it has no effect.<br />
<br />
For the record ~ Athlon 2500+, 1gig 333mhz ram. stock mulitplier stock FSB settings. Geforce 4 Ti4200. <br />
<br />
Anyone heard of a fix for this? I know its happening to others as well. <br />
<br />
* mods please dont move this immediatly to tech *</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have no idea either, and underclocking my system by 300+ mhz is not what I call an answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My gf is having this problem too.  she is sitting right next to me and any time she plays her bard she is in for 5 minutes and kicked.  She can play her wiz for 12 hours straight but 5 minutes and 3 restarts later she turns off her bard. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont know if it's excatly the same problem that I had, seeing as you didnt include the entire error message. But I was crashing about the same way, with a similary system.<br />
AMD XP 2400, 1gb ram PC2700, gf4 ti-4200.<br />
The way I fixed it was to lower RAM frequence in the bios settings, I cant recall excatly what i set it to, but it shouldnt hurt to play around with for abit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know this sounds lame as hel|, but it worked for me.<br />
<br />
Turn everything down- underclock, RAM frequencies, video card clock, AGP multiplier, yadda yadda.  See if it works (much to my surprise, that fixed it for me... tested by leaving a toon in the bazaar 24/7 for a couple days.)  <br />
<br />
If that works, it's just a matter of turning one thing on at a time and re-trying.  Eventually you'll get the config that your machine can handle.<br />
<br />
In my case it was a heat thing.  I was faced with underclocking- well, really undoing some of the overclocking I'd done before- a couple hundred Mhz, or getting a new heat-sink/fan unit.   Since I'd picked out the HSF unit special to be extra quiet, I undid some of my overclocking, and all is well.<br />
<br />
It'sa pretty quick test- just turn everything way down- if you crash to the desktop again, you know it's not anything that tweaking setting will fix and you can move on to other potential problem areas (bad RAM, software problem, Direct X, driver goofiness, whatever.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not that these aren't great ideas... but this never happened before. <br />
<br />
I know of tons of folks that are having this problem now.  If it was just something with the hardware it wouldnt be hitting everyone at once and it wouldnt be hitting my old lady's bard but not when she plays her wiz.  something is all fookered up and it isnt on our side.... Time to look at SOE and put the blame on them.  We pay cash to play this game if it's not working right they should fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For what it's worth, I'm getting it too in the last week or so, I'd assumed my eqgame.exe was foobared, was going to delete it tonight and re-download it off the servers, anyone tried this?<br />
<br />
Ath 2400XP, 1GB 333 etc.<br />
<br />
Happened about 3 times in the last week, definitely the eqgame.exe file as XP wants to report it to Microsoft, hehe, just says it's a fatal error or similar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, happened to me too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tried repatching the file the other day, same problem.<br />
<br />
I refuse to underclock my system, more than just a minor amount. This is not 1987 and I do not have a &quot;turbo&quot; button on my computer for a reason. <br />
<br />
Fix it fix it fix it!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, and here I thought it was just me having a problem..  <br />
<br />
I had to replace my MB and processor awhile back when leaky capacitor shorted my processor out.  I went from a 1.33 gHz Athlon to an XP 2200+ (1.8gHz) processor, and EQ has been hellishly unstable ever since.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's hardware related since the only program that is unstable is EQ (well and SWG beta was unstable too..but it's a beta, I expected that).  I'm more than willing to try underclocking my system at this point and turning down both fsb and mem speeds is an option (running PC 2100 DDR at 266).  Thanks for the heads up that this might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, so not eqgame.exe, bah thatwas a bit of a hope. I can't believe these systems need underclocking, mines running perfectly fine temperature wise and merrily runs anything I throw at it, sounds the same for everyone else.<br />
<br />
 Perhaps check to see when this happens - for me its been while KEI'ing twice, I particularly noticed as I had to regroup to do it, I suspected some sound file/driver issue at the time, but it's not happened since, and appears to be a bit random. <br />
<br />
Hrmmm....it strikes me as odd as I have made no changes to my system in the last few weeks, no installs, nothing, but I can't pinpoint it to any particular patch as when it originally started I assumed it was just a Windows error.<br />
<br />
Anyone having this on a P4? Strikes me that we are all Athlon XP users so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, I am having similar problems.  My PC simply freezes up and stays right at that moment (no getting kicked to desktop or anything like that).  I have to hit the reset button and reboot from there.  It usually happens once per night but sometimes more or not at all.  I can be inh the middle of a fight or simply sitting in trader mode.  It is really frustrating as this used to never happen to me.  It's only started in the past few weeks (about 2 patches ago).  No new software/hardware has been installed on my machine and all else is the same as it always has.  Something broke this in one of their patches I am sure of it.  <br />
<br />
It's about time for the yearly formatting of my hard drive so I am hoping that after I do so my problem will be fixed but I am not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Are you using the in game MP3 Player?<br />
I have a problem of crashing after I use the mp3 player.<br />
I use it for a little then cut it off. I am fine until I zone or something happens that causes a heavy load on the computer. Also you may want to check and see what type of programs are running in the background.<br />
Alot of useless programs start automatically when you boot your PC.<br />
For Example<br />
<br />
I turned off a scheduler program<br />
System Restore (sucks but could prove usefull)<br />
 <br />
I got an extra 20% System Resources from them.<br />
<br />
I use a program called Tidy Startup that I found a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Re: &quot;I refuse to underclock my system, more than just a minor amount. This is not 1987 and I do not have a &quot;turbo&quot; button on my computer for a reason. &quot;<br />
<br />
If underclocking fixes the problem, the problem isn't with EQ- it's with your hardware/heatware.  I should mention that when I had this issue, everything else (Neverwinter Nights, Quake 3, Wolfenstein, Max Payne, yadda yadda) all worked fine... only EQ caused the problem.  Turns out it's because EQ will use every bit of performance your system will deliver (run a CPU monitor during an EQ session- it will report 0% idle time constantly.)<br />
<br />
Before I resorted to underclocking, I tried everything I could think of (including a complete reformat, different hard drives, different RAM sticks, etc.)   <br />
<br />
I've got a configuration that sounds very similar to yours, and have been in-game 24/7 for the past few months (bazaar mule- hehe.)<br />
<br />
Good luck.  :)</div></div><hr />
