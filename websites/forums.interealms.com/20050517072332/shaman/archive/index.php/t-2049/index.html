<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*If* you could have a zone redesigned to fix issues with pet pathing which would it be?<br />
<br />
For me, Crystal Caverns comes to mind.  I had my pet sit in a spot and then watched him slide through a wall and agro some mob way far away.  Other times he just poofed.  Same thing happened in Kurns Tower.<br />
<br />
I'm no programer, but perhaps they can do something directly with the pet graphics to avoid the problems any pet class/shaman has faced.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe thats why they gave the AA ability for our pets not to agro on mobs until we let them.   *shrug*<br />
<br />
Anyway, what zone has been the worst for you while using/trying to use a pet?  :)<br />
<br />

<br />
I still think you should get pet hold as a default pet-owner skill.<br />
I rarely use doggie because I am in moving dungeon groups, am the puller or he is just more trouble than he is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye CC is bad, I would be making my way through the geo tunnel when all of the sudden my pet would disappear and grab 5 spiders.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kedge.<br />
'nuff said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been hunting in Nurga lately.  It is pretty bad.  However, since the mobs take the same pathing, it is also pretty good. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ssra was actually originally designed by my old pet opossum, whom i had to let loose, 'cos he lost his left leg and contracted rabies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CoM is bad too.   I've been sitting down, everyone in the grou out of combat, with Dogdog parked happily in the same spot for 20 minutes, and he'll decide to just wander through the Temple for kicks.  That or trying to coerce him around some corner when he wants to go back the other way around the courtyard :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any inside area I just find it pointless to have a pet up.  If I do I use summon companion to move him about, and even then he sometimes just wonders off and aggros the whole area - and not because I have dont a /pet guard here either as I spam that button instantly after summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have lost a lot of pets in echo caverns. Often, if the mob turns to flee, I just call the pet off, having him go back to his guard spot and then I just root/jbb the mob to death or follow and beat it down. Otherwise, the pet may just disappear. I've had lots of pets poof here and it's quite frustrating at times. Of course, I've had a number of mobs poof also, which is scary since I never know if they're coming back with friends or not. *sigh* One day, pets will work properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Perma is bad for pet too..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any zone where the mobs Grav Flux.  My pets either end up pathing wrong or 10king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">of course keeping summon companion is not an option ;ppp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">City of mist seemed real bad to me a few months back with dogdog after killing a target running off as if to chase birds or something and then promply getting eaten. One time he ran off and agro'd the goo's pathing up to the second level.<br />
<br />
A few nights ago feeling brave I let him lose again but parked him in a off-angle spot not in the normal pathing lanes and he behaved.<br />
<br />
A few zones mostly SolB I have noticed that the pet will park itself in the wall and then say &quot;taunting attacker&quot; which is never good only to find out its fighting giants or lava guardians or whatever those efrit mobs are called.</div></div><hr />
