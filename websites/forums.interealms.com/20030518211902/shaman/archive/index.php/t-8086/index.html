<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After getting the malo and topor purchases out of the way I'm looking for tradable equipment to improve my current outfit. My guild seems unlikely to ever make HoT, so I'm stuck with aquiring tradeable stuff.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't help you much. :(  Your gear looks pretty good to me.  Stronger or the same in many spots than mine is. :p<br />
<br />
Consider trading Lodi for Heiro...but that's a fine line.  I switched, but my HP needs help, and a Heiro was an easy HP infusion for me.  I traded my Lodi for Heiro+5kpp, which helped pay off my Torpor debt. :)<br />
<br />
Range slot looks a bit weak.  Have you considered doing the Planar Beginners &amp; Intermediate Magic Manual quests?  I've been looking to do them myself, but have just been swamped by guild responsibilities lately. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Free bump to the top anyway.  Interested in seeing what others have to say, since we're wearing some of the same gear. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice gear! I'll have to see about a crystaline torque for myself... wish it had some other stats though.<br />
<br />
Your gear is actually better than mine in some respects - Orb of the Infinite Void vs my Shield of Bane Warding, Orb wins, your 8th shawl vs my 7th, your slime covered coif and mith's girdle. Which is why I was suprised to see we were within 10 hp points of each other.<br />
<br />
You might take a look at my gear and see where I have more than you. Here's where I think I caught up with you so to speak...<br />
<br />
Talisman of Beneviolence. Easy quest, 38 hp 15 wis, dragon faction can be done at amiable. If you could do the 8th shawl war, you can easily get people to single pull and kill the captain.  It is no-drop, but it is an easy afternoon's work and will be more wis/hp than your Goranga idol.<br />
<br />
I have 2 hp rings, you have only 1, you might try switching your wedding ring for a velium fire opal (6 ac/65 hp).<br />
<br />
Back piece. Lodi shield is nice, especially perma eb - so I dunno if you want to sacrifice it for hp. I have a vah shir specific cloak which also gives wis, so I wasn't loosing too much by going the hp route on my back, but then again, I have a amulet of the grey wastes I put on before I go swimming. (I cary it with me always).<br />
<br />
Chest piece - I wish I had a jb coat, but if you are going for pure wis, try a barbed ringmail, it'll give you 30 more hp. You can bag the jb coat and put it on for its clicky effect, then rebag it.<br />
<br />
Grandmaster Potter's Sculpture... ooo, drool. 222 pottery for me and working on it. Nice!<br />
<br />
We both have thurg legs. I also have thurg boots, it adds about 9 hp in sta, so that's really nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice gear! If you're happy with your hp. I'd leave it alone - keeping your wis at around 200 is good, I think. I am just lucky that a lot of the pieces I want for hp/focus effect reasons also come with wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like what everyone else said, your droppable gear is pretty nice. Our equipment is pretty similar.<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians is an easy upgrade. The Mask of War sells for almost double on Emarr.<br />
<br />
Here's some more costly earring upgrades for only a slight improvement: Raptor Tooth Bauble, Skull Charm, Lizard Bone Earring, Lizard Tooth Earring.<br />
<br />
Also interested in what others have to say :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's pretty good gear.<br />
Most of my gear is droppable<br />
<br />
Boots: Barbed Dragonscale Boots AC 19 +30 hp +9 Sta (48 hp total at level 60).<br />
Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves AC 16 +25 hp +6 sta/dex/str (+43 hp at level 60) - you wont miss the 3 wis.<br />
Cloak: Yes grab a Heiro cloak or the new dru/shaman/cleric one with +15 dr/pr. But keep the Lodi for Resists/Tradeskill gear maybe.<br />
Face: Grab a Death mask of Elysians, Veil of the Executioner or Golems Jawbone.<br />
Range: Yes do the easy 1 group Talisman of Benevalence quest (AC 7 +15 wis +55 mana +38 hp +12 svc/svm) - need high kindly CoV for this?<br />
<br />
That would gain you somewhere around 210 HP's+.<br />
You can camp the arms and the any of those masks.<br />
<br />
You've got a damn nice belt :) I was going to buy one but they've nerfed the HoH drop rate and the price has shot up again.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on how much money you have.  Mithril items are pretty nice if you have that kind of scratch lying around.  Mithryl helm is highly prized and lately with new VT gear and PoP items I have been seeing quite a few mithril items making their way to the bazaar now.  Usually between 100 and 200k depending on which item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look for some good stuff to be coming out of the tier 2-ish zones in PoP.  Circled Toe Bones are nice out of CoD - their price will depend a lot on how much people are in there on your server (I paid 5k, but my server norm is around 15k atm).  Silver Hammer Earring and the superior Skull Charm are both excellent earrings, but are both imo inferior to the Lizard Bone Earring out of CT (although THAT runs upwards of 100k on most servers).  Death Mask of the Elysians is an excellent choice (at less than your mask sells for), and Dreadfang's Mask (~15k) is even better - if you can actually FIND one.  I prefer Barbed Dragonscale Boots (5-8k, depending on server) to the ones you use for the extra HP, but YMMV.<br />
<br />
If you REALLY are wealthy ... White Dragonscale Boots are droppable, and I have seen sell (rarely) in the 250k-400k+ range.  Mithril is excellent (especially Helm at 200k ish and Gauntlets around 100k) and wearable, since you are not an Iksar.<br />
<br />
You might also consider some non-droppable gear well within the reach of a non-HoT guild.  The Talisman of Benevelonce is nice, but you will likely have competition with guildmates for the item.  If you are masochistic, the Chardok quest offers a Ring that is much superior to your DWB and is mostly un-arguably better than even Circled Toe Bones (much more HP), as well as Spirit Wracked Cords for the very patient.  Less masochistic individuals might want to look into the Circlet of the Falinkan (4 kills, none of which are challenging, requires CoV Ally).<br />
<br />
In any case, you are certainly not hurting for equipment... good luck as you continue to improve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for all the good tips.  I usually wear a 6/65 ring instead of the DWB, all depends on the resist/HP situation. I have a top notch kill group that should be able to hadle the talisman quest on its own, and we are all max ally CoV from farming the PoZs in the arena.  <br />
I have been thinking about the Chardok rings, but being max KoS to the sarnaks will require some serious goblin slaughter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm.<br />
<br />
I've been camping vilefang for 2 weeks now.<br />
<br />
Admitedly I only found out he was a static ph spawn  on Tuesday, and only got a group down there then, but still :) Vilefang is a REAL pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
I'm rounding up people for Vilefang: Round 2 this weekend, provided my favourite monk puller is around. She's moving house this weekend so that puts a crimp in my snake-hunting plans.<br />
<br />
Anyway. If your guild cannot handle HoT, they probably can't handle camping Vilefang for several hours. You need a strong team to get down there, and an even stronger team to hold it unless you just sit in the safe areas and don't do xp. <br />
<br />
It's not undoable. But you need to get a high 50's low 60's group to agree to camp vilefang for five+ hours, and that's where I'm stuck twisting arms and giving big kitty eyes at people. :)</div></div><hr />
