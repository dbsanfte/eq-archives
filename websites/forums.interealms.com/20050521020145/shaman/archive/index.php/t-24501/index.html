<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, so I'm definitely headed out to Fan Faire next week! Now that I know a few members of the dev team by sight, I hope to talk to a few about shaman issues.<br />
<br />
So - what should I ask them about?<br />
<br />
Here's what I have so far:<br />
<br />
1. Pure Spirit - What's the point?<br />
2. Putrid Decay - What's the point?<br />
3. Pet Buff Timers - please fix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Innate pet duel wield - Why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will be at FF as well, representing TM.    My 1 question would be about our invis(or lack therof).  At least allow us to cast on our groupmates, or make the old-school spell we have a set duration(even if it is only 1 or 2 minutes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">honestly, who cares about innate pet duel weild....the oow pet should have a larger base dps upgrade without duel weild.  (it would be nice to have duel weild innate, but not at the expense of ignoring the marginal difference between our 2 top pet spells when the pets are in full buffs and gear.)<br />
<br />
the oow pet level upgrade is fine imo, the hp upgrade sucks, and the dps upgrade sucks.  At this point the oow pet unexceptable.  <br />
the innability to still not shrink our pets is really stupid...fixing this would be nice...<br />
<br />
honestly i think shaman burst DPS really needs a good hard look.  As CC is again becomeing more of a neccessity, as opposed to during PoP,  we have issues useing our rain spells and are really struggling for burst dps.<br />
<br />
yeah putrid decay could use tweeked a little to make it a better upgrade.  prolly mess with the resist mod on it so that it is actually flagged unresistable.<br />
<br />
top priority i would say is burst DPS, then the &quot;weak pet upgrade&quot; issue, and then putrid decay.<br />
<br />
edit-about the invis: most other classes have a nice self only invis and a crappy targetable invise spell. rangers/druids/wizards/enchanters come to mind.  i don't see us ever getting a set duration invis that will be targetable.  honestly, i don't see this as a major problem considering everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ask about the borked aggro in the Catacombs and Sewers instances. Can they get the assist range toned down or something?<br />
<br />
Ask about a Echo (Returned to you message) When Healing boon fires. <br />
<br />
Ask about Making flurry and Rampage messages for warriors. Give them thier 5 seconds of glory. <br />
<br />
Ask about an increase in our healing potential since Every mob in Omens is at least 25% resistant to our slows yet our healing percentage of clerics is the same as pre mitagation.<br />
<br />
Ask about Making shaman HoT's and Cleric Hots stack so we can be a viable addition to cleric enabled groups rather than have a huge part of our arsenal overwritten.<br />
<br />
Ask about letting call of the wild restore 45% of lost xp. At the expense of a later Cleric res. And if Both a druid and a Shaman use the call of the wild on the same corpse it restoring 45% for each time. So we are working in conjunction with druids to not require a cleric for a return of xp. <br />
<br />
Ask about the stacking issues with Might and Champion. and with might and any Discs used by meele. Don't care if the effects are cumlitive or not but at least make the buff last through the short term effects of those abilities. <br />
<br />
Ask about why rangers getting a harmony upgrade is not feasable When the other classes that had the abilities got upgrades. Why not rangers. <br />
<br />
Ask about thier plans to finish the instances that are in Omens rather than just having them be a collection of almost worthless zones that pad the Zone count while not adding any actual gameplay elements other than whack a mole at a spawn site. <br />
<br />
Prolly lots more to ask. But All I cna come up with at a moments notice. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;honestly, who cares about innate pet duel weild&quot;<br />
I do.  Precisely because its trival, there's no reason we shouldn't have it.  Especially with enc pets hitting for more than ours now.  <br />
<br />
&quot;the innability to still not shrink our pets is really stupid&quot;<br />
I can shrink my pet with tiny terror.  use the pet shrink spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;honestly i think shaman burst DPS really needs a good hard look&quot;<br />
Personal preference here I guess.  But I'd rather see Buffs/Debuffs, then Healing, then dps evaluated, in that order.  <br />
<br />
Namely:<br />
Buff/Debuffs:  <br />
1.  Group haste - 60%, with 5% dmg modifier.  Not stackable with str buff 5%.  No clue why we never got a group version of swift like the wind.  And the new enc haste has melee crit on it, no reason ours shouldn't have an additional element.  <br />
2.  AE Malos or reduced cast time on Malos.  <br />
3.  Make our AC buff stack with Virtue.  I've never cast that buff unless solo'ing, might as well make it have some use.  <br />
4.  Perhaps combine some buffs at some point.<br />
5.  New Billy!  Ranger attack buffs, with their long duration, as well as beast buffs, have left the shaman relatively lower on the attack buffing standard.  FA attack rating didn't change from PoP, its time to suppliment it with a new attack sow.  <br />
<br />
Healing:<br />
1. Slow nerfage is here to stay.  Its time to re-evaluate the healing percentages of the priests.  We need a bigger fast heal.  Druids and clerics can keep CH as their exclusive property.  <br />
<br />
Damage:  More is always better... but I don't see it as a major concern...<br />
<br />
In terms of CC, it might be interesting to have a hastened VP at some point.  And/or neg resist checks on VP.  Seeing many more resists on VP in Oow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aren't they KOS to shaman?<br />
<br />
I'd seriously consider the faction hit.<br />
<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Champion.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't the effect stack with Spirit of Might.  If it is not meant to stack, then they should have different % modifier effects - such as strikethrough or combat abilities.<br />
<br />
Why, oh *WHY* did they not make a single target version of this spell?!  Better yet, why didn't they take the Shaman communities recommendation and go with a longer duration, shorter recast time, single target only spell?<br />
<br />
Shrink<br />
<br />
Add an acceptance box to out of group shrink already!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My list is similar to Ungkor's (only a bit shorter although all of his ideas are fine).<br />

3) Reduce our ice nuke from 7.8 sec to druids cast time of 6.35 sec.<br />

<br />
Putrid Decay in my opinion is very nice.  It will add extra poison debuff on top of malos already.  I like it, and use it on raids.  Not something that I'd prob use much in reg exp mode, but raids, it's nice.<br />
<br />
Don't know if effect of champion and might stack.  I know the icons do, but not sure about the effects.  I do agree thatthey should stack, however these two spells are great overall.  Group avatar is nice, and even with it's low duration time.. it's a group spell so it's not like it's hard to keep on many people at once.  <br />
<br />
I don't honestly have any big complaints right now.  I'm pretty happy with everything, even more than I was during GoD (and I think that I was still the only one defending our abilities in god).</div></div><hr />

Putrid Decay in my opinion is very nice. It will add extra poison debuff on top of malos already. I like it, and use it on raids. Not something that I'd prob use much in reg exp mode, but raids, it's nice.Necros get it also, and it stacks with Scent of Terris also. Us having the spell on raids is pointless, I'd so much rather have a new faster casting, faster Recast malos. And throw in some DR debuff! ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try using Tiny Companion which does exactly what it says and makes your companion tiny.<br />
Oh your pet is your companion so when you cast this spell on it it shrinks even though the word shrink is not used in the title of the spell i can see how this could easily confuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
honestly i think shaman burst DPS really needs a good hard look.  As CC is again becomeing more of a neccessity, as opposed to during PoP,  we have issues useing our rain spells and are really struggling for burst dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By CC im presuming you mean Crowd Control.If so how is giving us bigger nukes (which i totally agree we need) going to improve our CC abilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">- Putrid Decay should be stacking with Malos and MD, but I'd rather prefer them to merge the debuff lines as we spend too much tme debuffing as is<br />
<br />
- Our DoTs. Why do we not get a resist mod for them like the other DoT classes? On raids, the resist rate is up to 50-60% with Malos + Tash while anyone else hardly has problems landing them due to the resist mods being applied on top of the debuffs. This is true for groups as well, just to a lesser extent(30% resist rate with just Malos or just Tash). This and the insane hate generation severely limits my damage contribution.<br />
<br />
- Tacvi Shaman Weapon. Why is the effect on the Aged Hammer of Dragonborn better than the one on this high end weapon? They do no stack as they share the same timer. At the very least make the Tacvi weapon click from the inventory or change the recast timer so that you can use both, the VP hammer and the Tacvi one.<br />
<br />
Other things would probably turn too much into a balance discussion about certain aspects of my class, bu tthe above 3 things should be a no brainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">hahaha, samanna, that definitely made my day (and my co-worker still looks puzzled why i just laughed out loud :))<br />
<br />
btw, i want pet with wiggling ears, was in discussion some time ago, or?  :D <br />
<br />
but i would be for:<br />
-pet innate dw<br />
-pet hps<br />
-stacking problems buffs/debuffswise<br />
-long overdue bugfix to dot-aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1) Pet innate duel wield<br />
2) Change talsiman of alacrity to talsiman of celerity (60%)<br />
<br />
I would really like to see these two happen at some point. There is no balance reason not to change them, neither would change our relative power at all (as both can be done now also, using rusties and single haste), but they would reduce the tedious chores a bit (I just hate Swift Like the Wind, maybe even more than FA). There is no point in having an inferior group buff, it does not see much use and is there just to annoy us. :(</div></div><hr />

I have only the first level but I got two crits back to back for over 1k in MPG.  The next thing I knew I was watching the sunset in Nedarias Landing.  It is nice to crit with dots but the high agro and randomness of it makes it a PITA.  Wizards can nuke for 8k+ but I do a 1k crit and it is the end ..........</div></div><hr />

We have 5 years of clicking the box and thinking we are rezzed its a hard habbit to break not looting everything in the chaos of a raid.<br />
<br />
Also. VP needs to be checked in OOW at level 3 it should be able to do temporary CC well more than 3 seconds when it isn't resisted.</div></div><hr />

I would never use it on raids except by some miracle only the Shaman is left alive after a raid wipe which never happens seeing as we don't have FD or escape. Simple solution is don't use it on raids, let the CLerics or Paladins rez, or even necros if they feel like using a gem.</div></div><hr />

And of course the other items mentioned.  Am really tired of having to waste time looking for rusty weapons.  And for gods sake, 60% group haste is a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1)  DoT Agro still out of whack.<br />
2)  Spell line that combines all of our buffs into one buff, please...just like Druids get.  Focus was nice, but we're back to casting all these different buffs again, which is rather boring and tedious.  I thought the point was to make the game fun?<br />
(For the record, I'd just be happy with STA being incorporated into the Focus line.  Adding AGI would be nice, too, especially with all the new buffs allowing to go over the Stat cap.  This should have happened LONG ago.)<br />
3)  Lvl 67 pet that has some actual HPs, pls.  Innate Dual wield would be nice, too.<br />
4)  Please change Epic 1.5 and/or TA to be usable in Primary/Secondary/Range slots....I've got both now (within a week of each other), and I was going to start a thread addressing this issue, but it's ridiculous that I've worked my tail off to get these two great items, and I have to click one from Inventory.  Yes, it's nice I can click it from Inventory, but I would really much rather use the stats in my Secondary/Range slot, since both would be an upgrade for me in either spot.<br />
5)  I still feel like our healing is a bit weak.  I don't have Yoppa's yet, but most of the warriors in my guild are approaching 12.5K buffed.  I can't heal worth a hoot...even my 3800HP crits don't seem to move the health bar that much anymore.  (I'm a little tired of praying for a Crit Heal when all heck breaks loose in Uqua)<br />
7) MGB Shrink with an accept box.<br />
8) Where is our equivalent to SoE and FoE?  I'd love to have a single buff that combines Acumen, SoW and Levitation, is group castable, and is faster than SoW!!!  (Just give us the same spell...)<br />
9) Was the Innate Resist on rains ever removed?  Because I still get resists out the wahoo on Tears and Torrent, even with Malos/Sinia on a Target.<br />
10) Thanks for all the hard work, Glori.  This shaman certainly appreciates it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">1) AE Malo, something that will actually let our ae rains spells land. its been 3+ yrs, its time to fix that. we'll accept the malos/malo recast nerf then. just give us a viable ae debuff, it can be less of a debuff than malo.<br />
<br />
2) Pet - dogdog has a hp issue. stop worrying about shaman torp tanking with their pets that was 3 expansions ago, it doesnt work when mobs can 1 round our mutts.<br />
<br />
3) Group Haste vs spirit of might - remove spirit of might. Give us a 60% group haste, no damage mods, just a upgrade to ToA.<br />
<br />
4) Healing - increase our heals 10% while decreasing cast time 10% and mana cost 10%. we're being punished for slowing and slows are nerfed. make it right<br />
<br />
5) Epic 1.5, why does our hybrid have a better nuke foci on their epic than shms. why do clerics get a secondary and 80ac? Change sham 1.5 to primary/ranged and add 20 ac. Fix our cast time on ice nukes to reflect who is the caster, who is the melee, and who is who's hybrid. balance it.<br />
<br />
6) Hastened mgb aa. why should we even have to ask for this. this aa should have been ours 2 expansions ago.</div></div><hr />

9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
these are so mindlessly trivial that if the devs gave us these and nothing else it would be like sticking a knife in our backs and twisting it.<br />
<br />
How these &quot;vital&quot; things ever reached our top ten list I'll never know. People read these and think, oh shaman are alright then, they had to really think hard to come up with stuff for their top ten.<br />
<br />
We have so many legitimate improtant issues that need addressing that putting these sorts of things in our top 10 makes a mockery of us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I really dont get some of the people on this board.

and now you want more?<br />
<br />
Leave CotW alone.  It is fine as is.  It is balanced. <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, my main concern would be getting Heals bumped 10-15% in power at the expense of efficiency, upgrading DogDog (and even giving us access to pet focus) and fixing DoT aggro once and for all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and to the poster the mentioned ranger harmony issues, thanks.  The reasons why all classes with a lull for lvl65 mobs got a upgrade to 70 but rangers was absurd and a insult to rangers.<br />
<br />
One additional item that isnt class specific is the need for a Spirit of the Wolf upgrade for all classes who can cast SoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give the Developers the URL to this forum channel and let em figure out what are the most important things on all our lists. And thank V for the nadox fix if you see her.<br />
<br />
My suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Dot Aggro<br />
2. AE Malos<br />
3. Better heals to compensate mitigation<br />
4. Pet issues (we aren't looking for mage or necro pets but an upgrade would be handy LOL)<br />
5. better dps</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah us not able to use pet focus items still blows my mind.<br />
<br />
I do.This is a shining example of total laziness or anti shaman programming by the devs no more no less. <br />
i fail to see how laziness or anti shaman programming is what causes our pet to not get duel weild as innate.  obviously the pet is a weak pathetic pos, but duel weild isn't the best upgrade imo.  i think increasing the pet HP and pet max damage would be the first step in the right direction.  it would increase the life span of the pet, and increase overall DPS while still allowing for the potental to duel weild.<br />
when your with a mag get toys; if you really want to have an edge over other shaman when there is no mage carry toys or maximze dps, haveing pet toys on person wouldn't be so bad if the pet could take more than 1-1 &amp; 1/2 rounds of damage (which is one fix i was posting about.)<br />
<br />
Try using Tiny Companion which does exactly what it says and makes your companion tiny.<br />
Oh your pet is your companion so when you cast this spell on it it shrinks even though the word shrink is not used in the title of the spell i can see how this could easily confuse.[/QOUTE]<br />
first, i wasn't saying this was a real need...just more of yet another stupid thing sony has done...I was alluding to how the spells &quot;Shrink&quot; does not shrink the pet, or at least it didn't when i cast it last night and hasnt' for some time. as i generally mem shrink in groups (as everyone doesn't always want the group version to be cast,) that is the only shrink spell i bother to mem, and therefore the only one i have ever bothered to cast on the  pet /shrug.(this could be a quarky graphics bug for me, my computer has been known to do stupid stuff like this.  i tried it again today and it didn't work though.)<br />
<br />
[QUOTE]By CC im presuming you mean Crowd Control.If so how is giving us bigger nukes (which i totally agree we need) going to improve our CC abilities. <br />
my statement was refureing to the fact that rain spells are not viable DPS in a lot of situations anymore because there are mobs mezed or rooted in camp (more now than ever before, imo).  don't want to break root/mez and get ourselves, the cleric, or the chanter smacked down do we?  rain spells are seen as a good source for &quot;burst...&quot; dps for us, but are no longer as viable for burst dps as they were because of the increased need for Crowd Control (CC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hey guys, so I'm definitely headed out to Fan Faire next week! Now that I know a few members of the dev team by sight, I hope to talk to a few about shaman issues.<br />
<br />
So - what should I ask them about?<br />
<br />
Here's what I have so far:<br />
<br />
1. Pure Spirit - What's the point?<br />
2. Putrid Decay - What's the point?<br />
3. Pet Buff Timers - please fix<br />
<br />
Definatly address getting the cast time reduced, and/or the damage increased on our nuke.  I'd also like to see our blast heal be at least base 2k (maybe adjust Ancient one to reflect this?)<br />
<br />
Also ask them about the stacking issues with might and the group FA.  Maybe also you could see if they will consider combining a few of our buffs.<br />
<br />
Other than that, i'm pretty pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Brenlo - YES! They are, we in fact had meetings today on this. Now we most likely will not be publically releasing the documents publically. <br />

Also.  Why can't they share classs definitions with us??  Find out whats up with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Revealing what their idea of a shaman (or any class) is and how they should function would be a very bad move on SOE's part.  First, the entire player base would take issue with the definition, no matter what it was, and you would see a hundred down with SOE threads on the various boards.  Second, if they ever strayed from that definition to address a problem (or for whatever reason), you would see yet another hundred threads denouncing them for going outside the definition the player base disagreed with in the first place.<br />
<br />
You will never see SOE's full class definitions.  At the most, you might be able to get them to give the basics (i.e. is a shaman primarily a healer, dps, buffer, etc.?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">mhmm<br />
I think that I'll give them a nice dose of the &quot;end billing&quot; instead.  I'm tired of being jerked around because they refuse to admit they're pulling this stuff out of their bums.  If they don't at least cough up something decent within the next three months, there won't be a renewal from me.</div></div><hr />

Please enlighten me then what possible reason there could be for our pet not innately dual wielding.<br />
It can DW when we give it weapons so why not innately.<br />
Yes Project Alpha etc but if this were the case you really think SoE would have left the ability in for it to DW when we give it weapons if this were so ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'd like to ask you to ask about the tradeskill items from OoW.  As of now, I'd say around 70-90% of the tradeskill items are not flagged as such.  This needs to be fixed for one.  Second, the drop rates for the slugworms and discordant scoriae are fubar.  Really fubar.  I understand that SoE doesnt want everyone and their twink with them, but I have seen 1 discordant scoriae drop on my server.  That's it.  I didn't even see the kill, but I did hear about it and saw it for sale in the bazaar for 150k.  Why is this the case (well, besides pure greed, and yes, it was bought within 10 minutes of being up, during a work day even).  Drop rates for the combines of these, and the other tradeskill items needs to be upped.  A lot on the discordant scoriae rate too (from never to very rare, very rare being like you get 1 for a full days camping.  I've spent days at a time camping the 'known' dropping zones of it and never seen it yet).  I do not want to camp luclin shards, and this is even friggin worse.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">2 more words:  DoT Aggro. :)<br />
<br />
And of course the other items mentioned.  Am really tired of having to waste time looking for rusty weapons.  And for gods sake, 60% group haste is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
/agree.<br />
<br />
DoT aggro is way overboard for the DPS that is done.  When you can, at will, peel mobs off a Time+ warrior weilding with 2 aggro-proc weapons (both with anger augs, no less!), something is wack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">ask them about all the shaman mains who have hit that end billing button since God was released.<br />
<br />
Dog dog, lets see, the CHANTER pet is now a bigger bad ass and has been dual weilding since lvl 55<br />
the DRUID ****ING BEAR runs at soe speeds INNATELY yet dog dog STILL NEEDS OUR CRAPPY 30 MINUTE BASE DURATION SOW TO KEEP UP!<br />
in short ask them to kindly pull their heads out of their asses and stop pissing off a major portion of the player base over **** thats so trivial. really theres no reason shaman should get exited when they find a mob weilding a rusty weapon to kill for their endgame pet to use.<br />
<br />
dots, resist modifiers and agro reduction<br />
nukes, cast time and base damage<br />
heals base heal increase<br />
mgb shrink...this one falls in the &quot;so trivial its ****ing AGONIZINGLY DUMB&quot; catagory, no I dont think this is a top 10 item I think its a ****ing no brainer, put it in the game you stupid ****s<br />
group haste thats = to single target haste, add that to the &quot;so trivial its ****ing AGONIZINGLY DUMB&quot; catagory <br />
also cani14 or whatever they are up to these days is a 66+ spell, shaman should have this thing at 64-65 off a damn vendor<br />
<br />
<br />
ask about the CaniV change we talked about. make it a % of your current max hp instead of a fixed amount for those who have mana pools triple that of the luclin era when this came out.<br />

<br />
I love that idea, or give us some kind of Conversion foci for shm/nec...<br />
<br />
I say tell them to get rid of Spiritual Channeling...in its current form i can think of like 1 or 2 mobs where it could be kinda useful...but basically it sux bad...<br />
i think it should be replaced with a lifeburn/gather-mana type deal...IE: take away 70% of your HP and give you mana back equal to your HP-max... <br />
<br />
But most of all PLEASE tell them to fight against botted buffers/debuffers/healers....i dont mean play the game-police....but rather have buffs do a &quot;check&quot; every 5-10 min or so and drop if the buffer isnt in the group/raid... make heals land for only 1/2 or so if someone isnt in your group/raid... <br />
<br />
Hell i'd love it if slow was instant cast and only lasted 15 seconds or so...would make it eazy if your a debuffer, but it would make the debuffing classes 10x harder to bot...<br />
<br />
I'm sick of the &quot;Best Players&quot; being people who have bots outside of group while they PL themselves and farm.......i'm tired of people relying on Enchanter/cleric buffs like a Crutch...<br />
<br />
Yes i know im rambling those last few paragraphs, and they probably would never be implemented in EQ1, so dont bother giving me crap about that....more than anything its a suggestion for EQ2 or other future games...but its stuff like that thats killing EQ imho and i dont think i'll ever play an SoE game again after EQ1 if the buffers/debuffers/healers get the shaft in this way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I don't know.. everyone that I have heard talk about Spiritual Channeling says that they love the AA.  I don't personally have it yet, but i haven't heard any complaints other than from those that don't have it yet.<br />
<br />
I do agree on DoT agro.  I can't do much in certain fights and with certain tanks because I'm tanking (really sucks in places like RS where if I tank much I&quot;m dead)<br />
<br />
CoTW is our best new ability.  Overpowered for us if it's moved to a real rez.  Right now it's something that's invaluable and I use it every raid to bring someone back into the fight that's important (cleric, rogue.. another tank.. etc).  It lets them get into the fight, gives them some actual mana if they need it, and it leaves no rez effects.  When you take the rez, there is a warning there that tells you that you can get another rez later.  If someone doesn't pay attention and loses it, that's their problem.<br />
<br />
For every shaman that has left the game since GoD was released I'm sure that three clerics have left.  For every 3 clerics that left, I'm sure that there were 2 warriors.  In the end, people leave the game, and other people start playing.  I'm sure that many people quit over GoD, and I'm sure that many people enjoyed it (I did enjoy GoD and had none of the problems that others have been complaining about).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AMEN brother AMEN. Spend all my time in here and never seen worse aggro when combined with the crappiness of placate. There is only one instance in sewers I will even do cause aggro is so bad and I dont have a FD puller. Dont remember the last time I popped defensive/ae taunt so often fighting non-named mobs. When u have 3 unslowed hitting on ya you gotta do what you gotta do. My favorite is when u placate half the room and then the one you pull gets the guy on the other side of the room who of course then drags a couple of buddies. Never seen so easy a chance to pull 6-8 as it is to mispull the sewers (especially pre camp break) :)<br />
<br />
GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I did the catacombs last night.  I was with an all guild group (no chanter though), and I commented more than once, &quot;god help any bazaar-equipped group.&quot;  Our guild is all qvic+ and OoW equipped, so we had some pretty substantial dps/hps/mitigation.  Pulls ranged between 3 and 6 mobs.  One room where we had a see-invis mob spawn had 9 mobs in the room, and 2 in each hallway leading off of it.  (We didn't have an FD puller.)<br />
<br />
All in all, it was a real bear.  Doable, but very, very tough with no chanter or with a bazaar-equipped group.  I think it's way harder than it should be, because I know most shaman don't have that kind of hp pool.<br />
<br />
Heck, we had to evac a couple of times, and there are 3 mobs that immediately add at the zone-in (sometimes 4 if a wanderer is near).  If you have to evac, and with different load times, having agro mobs at the ZI isn't really a good thing since people pop in at low hp agro. :p<br />

Very, very messed up agro.  Only place with similar agro would be Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />

I have hated no zones like catacombs and sewers this much, not since plane of torment (the zone i hate most in the game - see the old zone crashing bug).<br />
<br />
The agro and pathing + the drop rate in sewers and catacombs will make you insane. I even was the main healer and slower with no cc on one 6-8hr session. It's not an easy zone, it's not a fun zone, repops are 2 fast for the current configuration, if you dont have endgame gear, you will be miserable. <br />
<br />
I hope the dev that worked on these 2 zones was fired. It took me 27.5 hrs to get a drop on my sewer signet. If you hated VT key quests, wait till you experience these 2 mindless zones.<br />
<br />
They need adjusted, badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realized you'd have to roll out some things (ie raising level cap) on a slightly bigger scale, but seriously, its about time that it was perfect on purchase.  Oow was a billion times better than GoD, but still a lot of mistakes<br />
