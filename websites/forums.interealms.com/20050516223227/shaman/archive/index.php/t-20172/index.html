If a Mod locks this thread it just goes to show this board is being swayed by nay sayers.  (At least be fair and lock some nay sayers threads.)<br />
<br />
Hey all, I know your not going to like me saying this but I think we are balanced now.<br />
<br />
Think about it back before mitigation before High damaging mobs. We lived like kings often being known for our first hand accomplishments such as Lodi and Juggs.<br />
<br />
We have become more even in the slow department. We have sweet cheap duration heals. Our Stat buffs rock. And our Mana regen rocks. <br />
<br />
People can complain and moan and compare other classes abilities but we have a firm grasp.<br />
<br />
Back in Luclin I was unhappy with my 60 Necro and Enchanter. So I started a Shaman. I have been happy ever since at 65 and a huge array of AA points. Why because of power. <br />
<br />
I feel, I have more controlled power. <br />
<br />
Less threat of a mob utterly destroying me if it brakes any controlled scenario soloing or within a group.<br />
<br />
I like hearing the following too, which makes me happy:<br />
<br />
&quot;We picked you rather than a cleric for a LDON dungeon because you can Heal well and constantly, buff us and haste. While adding pet dps and VP &amp; slow Crowd control. This allows us to focus on all DPS group members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; We picked you rather than the BST because we need a patch healer and best slow not more DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know your not LFG but would you like to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With your dog, Bane and Tears of Saryn your actually doing more DPS then the warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; If the shaman leaves I am leaving.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Has maybe something to do with the fact that the only reason you post this here is to stir up trouble?<br />
<br />
Have a nice day and try to not drool on your keyboard over how you tricked us.</div></div><hr />

And you don't thing those complaining are?  *Boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Leave LDON, and go to GoD.  Besides, ldon easy's are so gimpy you can take any type of group in there and still succeed.  I hardly consider ldon even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Our Tnarg simply doesn't cut it anymore, our stat buffs DON'T get used except once in a blue moon someone wants sta ( not including cha for DI, I'll grant thats the one stat buff I still get asked for semi occasionally), our ~sweet~ heal over time isn't so sweet when the mob is pounding you for 1200 a pop, our mana regen wears out my keyboard (and while it may take you a short time to regain all your mana, it sure takes me a bit to get back there, which fm isn't the goal anyways), our pet don't even get me started on.  Slow immune mobs just irritate me to no end, they put slow mitigation in, just make the mob mitigate most of it instead of nulling our main ability completely.<br />
<br />
Plus, you don't get a warrior for dps, you get him cause he can A) Taunt, and B) tank.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, my shaman is my heart and soul, but theres a lot that could use some small improvements here and there.<br />
<br />
PS.  I still wanna know where you found our endurance regen at :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its not that your point isnt valid. Its that its incorrect for the issues that are effecting us. <br />
<br />
You talking about LDoN. Well LDoN is fine and dandy, but start main healing on a LDoN hard and you will get a TASTE of whats going on. Notice i said a TASTE.<br />
<br />
Have you bought GoD ? If so have you tried being the main healer and buffer and slower in a sewer adventure? If you want to grasp whats going on, go try that for a week, not 1 time or 2 times, but consistently so you can feel the pains.<br />
<br />
You think your stat buffs are so great, but they arent my friend. Ask your friends in your groups what their stats are before you buff them and see how much your uber buffs are helping them. Generaly speaking our buffs so jack squat beyond rounding numbers off so they look pretty and thats in a low end group. If you talking about a elemental group or a Time group, your stats wont even do that. <br />
<br />
I have had people tell me to not bother buffing them cause they have maxed the stats they want. How f'ning embarrasing is that? Im the king of buffs and a ranger is telling me to not bother. King of nothing is more like it.<br />
<br />
Im sorry my friend, but you just dont grasp whats going on. Thats not a uber then thou comment, cause im far from uber, thats just the facts of reality on this particual topic. If you want to know more as to why your more usless then you think, feel free to respond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't much that's unfair about your thread being locked. There are moderators here for a reason, and that is to ensure what is posted here *contributes* to the shaman community as a whole. Your post was rather lacking in that, as it served only to stir trouble. Think what you will, but I have not seen this board's moderators unfairly lock a thread, and I have lurked for quite a bit longer than I have been a registered user. If this thread is locked as well, as it should be, I would not go so far as to say the moderators are being swayed. I would simply say they're doing their job.<br />
<br />
That said, there is nothing wrong with saying you're happy with your class. I'm perfectly happy playing a shaman. Yes, we could use a few improvements here and there, but overall I'm happy. Keep in mind, as I say that, that I am nowhere near being an end-game shaman. My EQ is entirely different than, say, Jinheim's or Gloriana's ... therefore the problems and concerns are different. <br />
<br />
Simply be careful how you go about speaking your mind and pay attention to how you come across.<br />

<br />
<br />
that is so true before PoP/GoD expansion, because mob can fully slow plus they have insane HP compare to dps (50dps average during Luclin, now it average 150dps) <br />
<br />
now after PoP/GoD released, SoE have nerf us in 2 ways :<br />
First, they left us us behind the other priest class because we have SLOW, hence we have to pay for it <br />
<br />
Second, they nerf our slow, by put mitigation mob everywhere and mob die under half minutes<br />
<br />
I understand slow is too powerful, but tell me why we have to pay double nerf for it ?  and why they still nerf our class as a priest after they found a solution to nerf our slow ?<br />
<br />
we are priest class, not a hyb for Necro - Priest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It was locked at the request of two posters :)<br />
<br />
Still, I'm still anxious to know how the addition of an endurance stat to melee gear helps balance shaman. <br />
<br />
Do enlighten us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mentioning Endurance did not offend people.<br />
It proved you didnt research anything nor know anything about the class you claim to play.<br />
<br />
The Shaman AA has this effect:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4795&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Notice it is HITPOINTS not Endurance.<br />
<br />
Druids, Shaman, and Clerics all have the same exact effect.<br />
<br />
You were told that over and over and over in the last post.<br />
<br />
Your either:<br />
a) VERY Dense<br />
b) Board Trolling<br />
<br />
You think Shaman are fine.<br />
Came here to speak your mind.<br />
No problem.<br />
<br />
Don't hide behind an alias as to who you really are if you wish to be taken seriously.<br />
<br />
Post:<br />
Character name<br />
Charater level<br />
Charater magelo<br />
Server you play on<br />
And PROOF of your OPINION such as a log of you as the only healer in Tipt or Vexd vs a named/rare/boss.<br />
<br />
You think our mana regen rocks fine log a few hours in a LDoN hard, Vexd, Tipt and post the log with a summary of how much mana you regain with can4/can5 over the course of the night.<br />
You played x number of hours regained y amount of mana which works out to z mana/tick.<br />
<br />
You think our healing rocks fine post logs from you as only healer in Vexd or Tipt with a summary ok how many hp you healed and how much mana it cost you etc. Along with info about your group.<br />
<br />
Post logs from melee with and without your stat buffs see how much difference they made.<br />
<br />
Slows? Well you have been more than proven wrong already no matter how much data you can provide. There is enough information on this board to provide pretty conclusive evidence contrary to your belief.<br />
Slow mitagation, slow immunity, resist rates, and cast times pretty obvious that while we do have SOME benefits to our slow we are definately not outstanding, and in most cases we are out performed by what other classes bring tot he table.<br />
Of course I do not really expect you to search, read and learn.<br />
<br />
Come back with a bit of proof via logs and give REAL and relevant information along with your real identity.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you are nothing but a Troll and deserve your posts locked.<br />
Frankly your lucky I am not a Mod here or I would have banned you for reposting a locked thread rather than expressing your displeasure via a PM to the mod that locked it and politely give reasons why you think it should be unlocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm curious how end regen is going to take us to the next lvl? Besides the fact we cant do it yet how is me keeping some warriors/rogues/monks end regen higher going to help me keep the warrior healed? Great mr warrior you could use your new tricks and abilities if i could keep you alive. Sweet!</div></div><hr />

I don't believe you the proof is below.<br />

I keep game character safe there is nothing wrong with this.<br />
I speak my mind there is nothing wrong with this either.<br />
<br />
I don't see your angle other than your trying to prove something that should not matter.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You think our mana regen rocks fine log a few hours in a LDoN hard, Vexd, Tipt and post the log with a summary of how much mana you regain with can4/can5 over the course of the night.<br />
