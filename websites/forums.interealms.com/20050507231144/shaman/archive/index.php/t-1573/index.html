Who'd have thought that wizards would become flavour of the month, makes a change from all those rogues and then monks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that having a druid and a shaman in a group is pointless.  Their abilities overlap too much.  A shaman with 75% slow and torpor in an exp group can easily replace a cleric.  a druid is definately not needed.  if you want a 3rd party member that can nuke, WIZARD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Squeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BAH wizard smizzard!<br />
<br />
I'm a druid p have been a druid for over 2 years now. Go with druid all the way I reguarly duo with a monk/shaman.  It's great especially in a pinch when you need a heal.  (shaman gets slow resisted couple times...monk getting beat down, who saves the day? your druid p with heals.  wizzy umm nukes 2 or 3 times gets aggro now you got to heal his lame a$$!)<br />
<br />
I duo'd efreeti room witha  56 warrior who had fungi. I casted maybe 2 heals over a course of 2 to 3 hours. cast nature's recovery ( massive regen over time spell ) and snare let tank do all the work. warrior was regening at about 66hp a tick or better, with regrowth/nature's recovery and fungi<br />
<br />
oh and yes druids can stun p  :)  might want to research the spell list a bit more.<br />
<br />
 &quot;fury of air&quot;  250 dd and stuns target for 2.5 secs<br />
<br />
Not to mention the added bonus of a DS for the monk while tanking a named mob. <br />
<br />
Snare - need I say more<br />
<br />
Buffs - shaman/druid buffs stack!  what a wizzy gonna do give ya see invis?  <br />
<br />
Nukes: <br />
<br />
Druid - you need a DD when in a pinch a druid can do it. <br />
Wizzy - nukes 3 times sits down for 10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
I could go on and on but if you can't make up your mind by just looking and the few things I listed then well.....sorry about your luck.<br />
<br />
go druid bro plain and simple!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">high end then go wizard. Only good thing for a druid is track and thats situational. Stuns and the added dmg get it for me.<br />
<br />
Low to mid/high end and I would go druid enchanter monk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Really depends on your ultimate goal for your 3rd boxed char.<br />
<br />
If the ultimate goal was to aid your guild in End-Game/Boss<br />
Encounters.  Take a Wizard.  Lures/Manaburn.<br />
The Druid Petition was right in &quot;raids&quot; druids need severly utility help.<br />
<br />
If the ultimate goal, is to provide a core group, to XP grind, or to build good 6 player groups around, etc<br />
<br />
take the Druid.<br />
<br />
In the 2nd case:<br />
HP Buffs for the monk<br />
Snare Duration/Utility<br />
Mana Regen at 60 for the shaman (POTG)<br />
Ability to heal the shaman while it has slow agro<br />
Damage Shields<br />
Regrowth BP<br />
<br />
A wizard might produce a higher DPS/DP(Hour) ratio.<br />
But they wont come close to the utility.<br />
<br />
I moved my shaman to a 2nd account recently.  So now i play with a 60 Druid/53 Shaman.  With a RL friend 57 Monk.  We can do a lot of xp non-stop.<br />
<br />
Heres my norm right now:<br />
Pull with Epic<br />
Use Druid Manafree Dot as Inc<br />
Cast Slow as Inc.<br />
Root<br />
Sic the &quot;pets&quot; (monk/dog)<br />
Depending on mana can throw some more druid/shaman dots.<br />
Or Melee with Druid/Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go Wizard.<br />
<br />
Though Druids are nice (I have one), the big nukes and lures of Wizzies are just too hard to resist. <br />
<br />
But I like making things go &quot;BOOM!!&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shayman Quod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Druid Stun<br />
<br />
correct me if i'm wrong<br />
<br />
outdoors only?<br />
<br />
i didn't count that as it was situational, and precluded fighting casting mobs inside for xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fury of Air is indoor.<br />
<br />
Breath of Karana is the outdoor one...It's a 7-hundred sumthin DD...I haven't logged in for two weeks, and forget...<br />
<br />
Like Corlathist said.  It depends on goal.  If you wanna help the guild, go Wizzie.  You wanna do great exp groups, have a port bitz, and something to kill needlessly for the sheer fun of it?  Go Druid!<br />
<br />
In the end, it's what you want.  You could always just make both and see how it worked out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Tryg <br />
[B]high end then go wizard. Only good thing for a druid is track and thats situational. Stuns and the added dmg get it for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Track is situational?  Yeah, but a hell of a lot of situations.  You can check to see if X mob is up just by ducking into zone, you can hunt for that one yellow mob in the sea of blues, you can find the rare spawn to farm for your uber loot.<br />
<br />
If it's just for my personal use, I'd go druid.  I agree with those on here who are saying wizards would be more useful to a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i'm not at the end game yet, but i think i'd prefer the druids since they have succor. :) but then i'm a little yellow chicken and i run at any opportunity i can get... MOMMY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Wizzy - nukes 3 times sits down for 10 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
I imagine this was partly in jest but i have a wizard and can cast alot morre than 3 times before having to med 10 minutes. Heck at at least 4 =p . In seriouness in your talking high end i would say wizard especially if your 3 boxing it. Druids do have more untility but also take more work wizard can do alot of damage in a short amount of time with alot less time needed spent at the other puter if your running the monk and shaman. Also remember if your talking highend wizard get spell to land on MR mobs than other classes cant hit. Been plenty of times i have had a druid say dont need caster due to the mob being MR and i have to remind them the last time we faced it i was landing my lures just fine. <br />
<br />
  Anyway not bashing druids though you really cant go wrong either way because both would work quite well and if you were asking about exp grind might lean towards druid for the ds and healing and buffs but highend and a highend wizard your talking some good damage. Especially talking about raids with my wizard i tend to be in the exp group everytime i raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For your guild raids, wizard.  For everything else, druid, hands down.<br />
<br />
In exp groups or as a (solo) trio:<br />
<br />
A second healer never hurts, even if you have torpor.  Shamans are sometimes so busy slowing(and if slow doesn't stick the first time, even more so) that you have to either heal or slow, not both, until one or the other is done.  With a druid around, slow with your shaman and hit a hotkey to health with your druid simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Plus druid DOTS are very good, and their blasts are infinitely better than a shaman's.<br />
<br />
DS shields are nice in a minor way; much less so against slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
Druids have great fire/cold resists, which complement the shaman's great dis/pois resists.  You are very well covered.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Eagle does not suck.<br />
<br />
POTG is a VERY, very, very good buff.<br />
<br />
But most importantly of all, really -- a much more useful, long-lasting SNARE than wizards get.  This is easily one of the game's best spells, and it's importance can't be exaggerated.   It makes dungeons infinitely safer, and everything else too; and since it makes some mobs turn away and stop fighting at low health, it can prevent substantial damage over time.<br />
<br />
Another nice thing -- your druid can use some of your hand-me-down shaman stuff.  SBS, shield of bane warding, GEBS, DWB, iksar beserker club, molten cloak, etc. -- lots of shaman hand-me downs work just great for druids.<br />
<br />
And, finally -- daddy bear gets a baby bear! ;)</div></div><hr />
