Are you glad they didnt change the time limit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Playing both a Shaman and a Wizzy and knowing how hard it is to get a group as the wizzy, short times = burst DPS needed.   Glad for the time limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It felt like a 90 minute PoJ trial or something at times.  I think there should be an option for no time limit personally but for say half of the reward points as the normal setting at 90 minutes.  I wanted to really sit back and enjoy things but instead I got a 90 minute dps trial.  I do admit I just went with who was on in my guild or friends list the second the servers came up so the group wasn't as strong as my normal groups so maybe with a better group it could have gone much better.  We did fine but ran well past the time limit both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well We FAILED our first mission... Fairly good group also -- and we had a full fairly balanced group(3 tanks, cleric, shaman, rogue).</div></div><hr />

The group was much much better but I honestly think the adventures we got in Rujark anyway were much easier than the Guk ones.  We finished the first time in about 30 minutes and the second time in just under an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;--- LDoN Beta tester.<br />
<br />
The Guk adventures are the hardest of the 5 types. But, they have better in-dungeon rewards to compensate. I'd really suggest starting in a different theme while you adjust to the different playstyle needed.<br />
<br />
Overall, the biggest challenge for most people is getting used to the &quot;Must Kill Fast&quot; mentality required. While it isn't really acurate, there is some truth to people saying that they are the PoJ Execution trial v2.0. Even people who are accustomed to chain-pull groups tend to need a bit of adjustment.... Everyone moves, not just the puller.<br />
<br />
Different group makeups really belong in different themes. I am not gonna comment on what belongs where - it would be a rather large treatise, and I think it would spoil some of the fun of experimentation for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't see a need for the time limit, as it doesn't really fit with most of the scenarios.  I can understand why you would be on a time limit for the rescue scenario, but why the other three?  Outside of roleplaying reasons, I don't believe that the timer helps anyone.  I feel that a group that enters a dungeon, wipes, CRs, wipes again, CRs, has LDs, wipes, CRs, and then finally completes the event after 4 hours has definately earned those points.  It won't allow just any schmuck to accumulate points, because most schmucks just don't have the tenacity to keep trying wipe after wipe after wipe.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have only gone through three missions, but I don't find the time limit to be very imposing.  We completed all three missions with at least half an hour to spare.  On the other hand, we had an extremely high dps group (2 rogues, bard, beastlord, sk, myself) and we're all in EP gear playing on normal mode.  Maybe it would be a bit different on hard mode or with a lower DPS group?  I don't know, but I will probably find out tomorrow :)<br />
<br />
I don't have much experience with LDoN so far, but I would say bumping the timer up to 120 minutes would be just right.  You could also make it so that you get 1 extra point for every minute you finish before the timer runs out.  IE completing a normal mission with 20 minutes to spare = 71 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually had a great time doing the POJ trials cuz I was already bored of the regular xping..  Yesterday I did the adventure in Mistmoore, we were 6 to begin with (Pal, rogue, cleric, shaman and 2 wizzies, all level 65).. We had to collect 29 stones.. After 10 minutes of play one wizzy  needs to go, 30 minutes after second wizzy goes LD... <br />
We missed 2 stones with a group of 4 while the event was for 6.. so we would have succeeded if we had the 2 wizzies all the time and its not like we hurried or anything since we were discovering..<br />
<br />
Like Zyph said it all depends on the location of the event.. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I prefer this much more than going to BoT and doing xp.. Even if the xp is not that good (but its not bad either), its much more fun even if you fail the adventure..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the time limit is needed since there is no respawn. how hard would a dungeon be if you could take as long as you wanted with no respawn? I have done 2 everfrost and 1 mistmoore so far and all successes. it is a aggressive play style where everyone is on the move and better be on their toes which i prefer to having someone pull one mob back at a time kill rinse repeat which most exp is now a days. i think they did well with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea is nice, but it would remove the incentive to do the hard missions. I think reversing the idea by deducting 1 point per minute past the time limit would be a better idea, softening up those near successes.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if they hadn't done their beta testing with toons decked out in the absolute best of the best gear attainable in the game, then MAYBE these dungeons would have been remotely balanced for the real player.  As it is, with my patchwork SS and self-attained gear, MY GEAR IS NOT LEVEL APPROPRIATE FOR THESE DUNGEONS.  That's just grand, Sony, thanks a heap.<br />
<br />
As it is, we have yet another expansion that is so far completely worthless to your average player.  Very very frustrating.  I'm glad there are some people enjoying this expansion, but it's too bad people in normal (non VT type) gear have no place in it.<br />
<br />
Ah, felt good to vent.  Maybe they'll retune these encounters before I delete EQ and burn my CD's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't agree, LaughingWoman. With a non-balanced (monk as tank and no enchanter or bard), though admittedly above average equipped group. We finished with around 40 minutes to spare. We weren't particularly rushing at all.<br />
<br />
I believe that a balanced group with bazaar level gear (or even a non-balanced group with people who've got it together), could do well on at least some of the adventures.<br />
<br />
Start out with one of the &quot;kill X mobs in 90 minutes&quot; adventures, and see what you think then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Was it non-balanced group of 4? Having those extra 2 people really does help in the adventures, particularly when you don't have the best gear available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">THat's what totally sucked with the PoJ trial.. everyone wanted the DPS and rarely could I get in a pickup group as a shammy.  In most peoples' minds, we didn't fit.  I hope that mindset doesn't happen again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was a beta tester, and didn't play the 65 dungeons, like nearly everyone else did.  We tested out a lot of the lower level dungeons (20-55), however, and they were all pretty fair.  We had 5 people in our regular group and found that after the first couple adventures, you could adjust enough to be able to complete them with 30 minutes to spare.  With 6 people, you could obviously do them faster.  <br />
<br />
As for the comment about beta testers having the best gear available:  That wasn't the case that I saw.  Again, at least for the lower level betabuff characters, it wasn't.  In fact, they had gear of a lower quality than most of the people you see on regular servers, even new people.  <br />
<br />
I think regular, well-organized groups will find these dungeons somewhat challenging.  Pick-up groups will find them a bit more difficult, at least at first.  I don't see any groups being left out of the choosing of classes.  I think any reasonably balanced group of 6 can finish them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A few of the 65 beta buffs characters had really nice gear and some of them were horrid. Non of them had all uber gear.</div></div><hr />

Failed first try, because we were exploring and went the opposite way from where the target spawned(dguk, assassinate).<br />
<br />
Second time in we finished with 30 minutes to spare. Didn't have a plate tank in either try, didn't have a cleric in either....we did have a full group though.<br />
<br />
Honestly, why would you shoot yourself in the foot and try these with only 4 people when that doesn't affect the difficutly of the dungeon?  While the trials comparison doesn't exactly fit, would you try doing them with just 4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tyrika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have done 6 adventures. 5 fails 1 sucess. <br />
In the first 5 I did every single time we would lose someone shortly after entering the dungeon(LD,had to go, tech problems ect)<br />
The sixth time we had a warrior,paladin,shadowknight,rogue,shaman and druid. We finished our adventure with 30 minutes to spare. This was one of the &quot;Kill 53 monsters of this type&quot; missions in the orc mines. <br />
All in all I think the time limit is a good thing.<br />
If you don't complete your mission you still got experience and loot. It is possible to do these with 4 people but you probably won't win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've only done one so far, and it was a 4-person group (low 50's alts), and we failed, but not by much. Had a warrior, wizard, cleric, and bard and we had to collect 22 items - we got 19 or 20 of them before the timer ran out. If we'd had a full group we would have easily finished in time.</div></div><hr />

With the timer, I know it pushes me along a bit harder than I probably would normally. I've got to optimize things and really move. This can be fun at times.<br />
<br />
With the timer, I can't enjoy things. Look around and see the zone/graphics/models that came with the patch. Can't risk taking a wrong turn, can't AFK for any reason.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like if there were some missions Without the timer on them. Like the assassination missions or the item hunt ones or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, I gave up in disgust with the beta because every time we tried to get groups to try out lower level content, every member of the group had SoD/fungi level gear twinked onto their level 30's.  It was a mess.  With the shoddy testing paramaters they had, it's no wonder this expansion is about as well balanced as a one-legged drunken gorilla.<br />
<br />
I suppose I think it's ridiculous that the expansion is oriented around a fairly rare scenario of no AFK, no LD, nobody having to leave, and finding a quality group of 6.  Sure, I can have that happen, but it's the exception, not the rule.  I'd like to be able to log on and SUCCEED on a regular basis.  Not only be able to beat the dungeon if everything goes perfectly.<br />
<br />
As has been said before, they made it PoJ Trials 2.0.  Because THAT particular scenario was SO SUCCESSFUL that they... removed the 2nd tier access limitations...  No, they don't learn.  Even after that fiasco, someone upstairs is still insisting that time restrictions are FUN, really!<br />
<br />
Some people WANT to treat this game like a job, I don't.  I want to log on and win.  If that means there would have to be an &quot;easy&quot; setting that's worth 2 points per trip at level 65, so be it.  <br />
<br />
I'm used to logging on with my group of four and we have a good time without screwing around LFG or wasting time.  If someone joins us, great, but it was always nice to be ready to go without NEEDING more.  It's a shame LDoN doesn't work for us.  Even worse, if we were 10 levels lower, it would probably work out fine.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
As for the guy with FT11 telling me none of the betabuff characters were uber... I guess it's all relative, hmm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The time limit is ample. We had 4 people. Shaman, Beastlord, Cleric and Mage all level 65. We set the difficulty to &quot;Normal&quot; and with a wipe we still managed to get back in time to have a second go at the named. We paci pulled singles and got the occasional add along the way. We killed all the way to the named within the time allowance. When the timer ran out we still went after the named (North Ro adventure). When we killed him we each got 13 points even though the timer had expired.<br />
<br />
We wiped due to slow being resisted a few times and the named pounded me to shreds. The Beastlord had most HP with 5500 buffed , I had second most with 5100hp buffed.<br />
<br />
If we had pulled the named in the same manner (paci guards and pull with malos) and not made any wrong turns the 4 of us could have completed the 65 &quot;Normal&quot; level dungeon in 60 minutes. <br />
<br />
Just bind all members at he soul binder and in the case of full wipe just sow the group and run back to the dungeon. Loot most of your gear and continue, rez later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">What is dungeon crawling to you?<br />
To me, it is a group of advanturers venture into an unknown place, searching for knowledge and treasure. Slowly and carefully move each step ahead. They don't rush through it, and should not kill and wack everything in a hurry like a running steam train with no break.<br />
<br />
Putting a time limit in LDoN kills the defination and fun of dungeon crawling for me. But it is just my feeling, please ignore this post if you feel differently. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No, they don't learn.  Even after that fiasco, someone upstairs is still insisting that time restrictions are FUN, really!<br />
<br />
No they don't learn.  I remember when they first introduced the nerf to the level range of mobs giving you full exp (this was before PoP).  They had to remove it in an emergency patch 2 days later.  And then, mind-bogglingly -  they reintroduced it in PoP on 61+ chars.  And incidentally about a third of the posters in the Shamans Crucible - a large proportion of the ubers that post here - thought it was a good idea too.  Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The time limit should honestly be bumped up a bit.  We were trying a rescue mission last night.  Group was 63 rng, 63 shm, 65pal, 65sk, 65 dru, 65 nec and we only made it about 75% of the way to the target.  We were killing pretty much nonstop.  Didn't have downtime between pulls.  If the timer had been a tad bit longer we would have succeeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There is an easy fix to this, add an adventure in each location based off of an existing one (to save work) where it's a variation of a theme and the time limit is off.  To hurry the players up a bit and make it challenging, add a stampede or trap that spawns MoBs or flood the dungeon, whatever, every so often on a cycle that will run the players down unless they are skilled or complete the dungeon before the cycles wear them down.  This way, if done right, there are consequences to not going fast, but you could get more time if you can handle the consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Tarthug - That doesn't sound like an easy fix.  And it sounds like there's still a time limit in your idea.  Most players would say &quot;We gotta get this dungeon done before xxxx happens&quot; anyways.  So a player imposed timeline would be in effect, and people could/would gripe about it as well. :)  <br />
<br />
Im content with the time limit, mainly because it's already about as long as I can reasonably expect to be online more or less non-stop.  90 min adventure plus 30 min extra at the end, plus initial grouping/setup and selling/spliting loot = More like 2.5 - 3 hours.  <br />
If the time limit was removed, or upped to some arbitrary number, you'd have grps that would stay online for *hours* trying to finish the dungeon, recover from wipes, and generally hunt down and kill every single mob.  And the pressure would be for every member of the grp to stay online until it's done. <br />
No thanks, I don't like staying up until dawn anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You wouldn't have to stay up till dawn to complete it.  The point is most of the non uber people are going to be hard pressed to complete most dungeons within the 90 min time limit.  Group composition is going to play a big part in that unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I am 2 for 5 so far, and whilst that is fairly limited experience, I have formed an opinion...<br />
<br />
I like the time limits in one way, in that they add a bit of excitement and urgency. The feeling earlier when we looted the 22st red ash 10 seconds after the time was up was, in an odd way, good.<br />
<br />
But this is NOT dungeon crawling. There is no sense of &quot;dungeon crawling&quot; whatsoever, in fact. No need to explore, just KILL KILL KILL as quickly as possible!!<br />
<br />
I think there should be a wider range of missions, some without time limits, some with. The more variety, the more of us will be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have seen (and heard from guildmates), tier3 65 level guild people (no VT/emp) with class title cut through a normal mode dungeon in 40min-50mins or so, without really breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
ie: tonight I did 2 dungeons in under 2 hours total including the two lots of running about/setup for 102 points. This included having a hiccup in second adventure, ranger opened a barrel mid fight for a laugh, killed cleric and buff stripped all the group but me ;) we took a 5 min break to rebuff and pally rez/med cleric, as we already had 12 of 22 done, and were less than 15mins in.<br />
<br />
I'm going to play about in easy mode for all the sets before I comment more. I do find it fun though, and the pace is laid back compared to some of the raiding I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The time limit is fine imo, I just did a rujark mission with 3 melees and we had around 35ish minutes left when we finished. If 4 players with good gear can beat the missions with lots of time to spare, 6 players with average gear should be able to beat it within the time limit. <br />
<br />
If these 6 players cannot do this then perhaps they should examine what they are doing wrong and improve instead of whining about the time limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Lost Time Trials of Norrath was realeased early. Expect some dungeons next Christmas.<br />
<br />
Sarcasm aside, after seeing a bit more, the implementation makes sense. Its going to be some predictable grinds, what most of the Everquest playerbase wants.<br />
<br />
In no way are these dungeons.<br />
<br />
After a bit of experience the time limit isn't so bad. I'm only upset now that they are not really dungeons at all. I was expecting an expansion on the scale of some cool themed dungeons in the spirit of guk or what not. Not to be totally negative, it is cool to have 5 of your best buds running through a dungeon......running being the keyword:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think some of y'all may have forgotten what it's like to be in 'average gear'. <br />
<br />
In beta I did 6 mission with the betabuffed shaman (not uber by any means but a considerable upgrade from what I'm wearing). 5/6 wins and lost the one due to 2 players not having the correct files (15 minute wait on them) and a couple of ld's once inside. We still completed it after time elapsed. All but one of these was a pick up group. Our normal group (in beta-buffed equipment) finished with about 30 minutes left.<br />
<br />
Back to live server and my equipment, I'm 3 for 7 with a group that has been together 3+ years. All of these folks have spent a considerable amount of time inside dungeons. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I think the time limit is reasonable. Of the 4 we've failed on, 3 were completed within a minute (yes, 1 minute lol) after time expired while the other was completed about 3 or 4 minutes after. <br />
<br />
Our biggest obstacle at this point is not equipment but rather getting use to the pace needed to complete these. Honestly, good dungeon crawling (prior to LDoN) didn't consist of pace, it consisted of knowledge (spawn times, dungeon lay-out, pulling techniques, etc), teamwork and caution. LDoN is mana regen and dps. <br />
<br />
Again, for the folks in better than average gear, you might want to pull out a couple of old pieces of equipment, slap it on and try a mission. You might be surprised at how much more challenging they are...</div></div><hr />

We lost a couple (collection misions suck!) but have won more.  I have also played them with a 37 rogue, 63 mage, 30 ranger and found them to be a good time in all cases.<br />
<br />
I played in Beta as well so I knew what to expect whereas the rest of my group did not.  THe beta buff shaman sure had some odd AA choices in my mind :)  And he was better equipped than mine!<br />
<br />
I have also succeeded on missions when we had LD members (keep going with what you have left) and with a partial wipe.  Clerics, bind close please!<br />
<br />
Overall I give it a big thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm just doing pickup groups, many less than ideal, and the closest I've come to losing in 6 attempts was having 10 minutes left. One time our cleric went linkdead five minutes into the adventure and I healed/slowed us to a win. I've completed a couple where we had more than 30 minutes left over. If anything I wouldn't mind seeing some bonus points for finishing early, though I suppose that's sort of built-in in that finishing faster means you can hop into another adventure that much sooner.<br />

The time limit is a big part of what's making LDoN fun for me.</div></div><hr />
