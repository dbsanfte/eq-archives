<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We'll inside a zone with a decent ZEM is a must for trying to get 1% per kill in a duo. With that said here's some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Kedge first floor, The Hole, Lower Guk (take a guide if you havent been here before), CoM, and Droga. SolB and permafrost are also options.<br />
<br />
The hole is soloable at your level and would be my first choice for xp.<br />
<br />
If you want exp and loot then I'd start with lower guk, but I would suggest waiting till you have stoicism and C2, as the wizards will suck a lot of mana in terms of heals for your warrior hubby. You'll also need ItU potions down there (if you arent already familiar with the zone).<br />
<br />
Happy hunting-</div></div><hr />

for some reason I thought I was posting on that new thread. Still applies though for the BST's pet, as he'll probably get sent in first into most battles.</div></div><hr />
