<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I am PLing a druid on a second account because getting around is so much of a pain in the &amp;ss that I can't stand it.  He's level 30 now and things are getting tough.  I need to get him to 39 to be happy about it, but I don't care too much about his skills (I have been practicing spellcasting skills while grinding with my main).<br />
<br />
At this point the best and safest XP I can find is to let him cast shield of brambles+bramblecoat for a 14pt DS, pull a mob to him, and root it while it kills itself on the DS.  I can't afford to make DS potions for him.  A bloodgill will kill itself in about 10 minutes, and I have to heal the druid about 4-5 times; it results in about 3/4 of a blue bubble per kill, close to a yellow an hour.<br />
<br />
I can also group him with some RL friends who are high 30's and the three of them can all get about the same amount of XP per hourl<br />
<br />
Is this the best I can do?  As soon as I start using his mana to nuke, he goes OOM and has to sit down.  The DS works but is slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SolA, gobos and gnomes have way less hp's then bloodgills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, about half of bloodgills.  Unfortunately they are level 20-23 instead of 35-39.   Sol A has a nice XP modifier though, might be worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think that the decreased hp's (and those mobs will still be light blue to yellow throughout the zone for you), that you'll kill faster and more per kill.  which means faster on the respawn and more overall exp.  Give it a whirl, cant hurt ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's so much easier to PL a melee twink than it is to PL a caster twink.  A melee never runs out of melee, but a caster soon runs low on mana....  then they suck at melee, so after a bit it starts to take too forever to PL a caster.<br />
<br />
I've found that it's best to partner your caster twink with a melee of some sort that is close in levels.  Buff up the little tank, sit your caster down, and tear through stuff.  Just keep the little tank healed and you're set.  Constant pulls and the xp flows a little easier.  Nuke with your little caster if he's got the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing you might want to try is Sol B, near the Sol A zone.<br />
<br />
What you do is pull a mob, let it hit the drood once (so it takes damage from the damage shield).  Then root the mob, and dot the bejeeezus out of it.  Just before the mob dies, root it one more time for good measure and zone to Sol A.   Result = your twinky get's the entire xp for killing a nice high level mob.  Good xp modifier, and very mana efficient.  (you could do this at CoM zone also)  Advantage there is that you can use your horse and hence mana consumption would be even lower.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the point here is not for your Druid to be doing all the work, but for you to be killing stuff.<br />
<br />
Screw the stupid shet - group him and do Hole Entrance.  Have him DS YOU - and rip those clods of dirt a new one.<br />
<br />
You're 55th level. Kick the crap out of Kedge, CoM, or the Hole. Just have Druid sitting there leaching experience. (Hey wait a minute....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have the druid DS you higher level character and then have them pull 3 or 4 back to camp.  (Regrowth is good here.)<br />
<br />
Let the 3 mobs slowly beat themselves to death on the DS, then have your druid AE blast them when they are near dead.  If you get the timing down, you get all 3 kills with one cast.  <br />
<br />
If your PLing shaman is in their 50's, the damage they do to him will be insignificant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">remember, if your dr00d does 51% of the damage, he gets the exp....  so be sure to hit the mobs with JBB plenty to get them upset with you before he gets them.  I PL'ed my melee dr00d this way to 49</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys are all doing it the hard way or giving inaccurate info.  I just PL'd a wizard to 24 in 7 hours with a my druid.  Its not hard at all.<br />
<br />
Simply do this.  Buff both characters as well as you can.  Do NOT group them.  Go to an area where mobs are KoS and auto agro without having to do anything to them, or unequip your weapon and punch them once to agro them but you want to do as little damage as possible.    Mobs should be low red to your druid.  For a 30 druid you want mobs that are level 35 or less, any higher and you'll get too many resists.  Undead preferred, runners make it a pain.<br />
<br />
Have the druid give YOU a damage shield, then go pull 3 mobs (most you can pull is 3, any more won't stay agro on you).  Let them beat on you and don't cast any damaging spells on them.  Do NOT slow them.  Have your druid cast ONE AE from a safe distance after they are half dead, all you need to do is 1 point of damage (assuming shaman did no damage, otherwise you need to do 1 point more than shaman did), then sit and wait for damage shield to kill them off.<br />
<br />
Damage shield does not count at all towards kill, so if the druid's 1 AE is the only damage done besides the DS then the druid gets full xp for the kill.<br />
<br />
You can have the mobs attack the druid and heal him once in a while to get his defense up but other than that let them beat on you.  Most mobs will hit your shaman for much less than they hit the druid so you don't have to use as much mana healing.</div></div><hr />
