<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never heard a word from any patch or derv chat in forums, but I noticed that doing LDoN now actually gives you a lot more exp after lvl 66 (I was getting 2% exp per win and now gtting 6% exp per win) and 99points on a normal adventure. This wasn't like this when oow first came out and I was getting the 51pts per win at lvl 67. Anyone else notice this? (Makes it worth doing them again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was told after 65 there is no &quot;easy&quot; any more and they are all the equiv. of the lvl 65 hard.  So if the group makeup avgs 66+ you will always get the lvl 65 hard dungeons.<br />
<br />
You should be getting 105pts if memory serves me.  Not sure what's up with the 99.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 99 means there was someone higher level than Koda in the ldon I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would be nice if it has been changed.  Did a normal LDoN adventure on Wed night, group level varied from 62-69.  Got 2% regular exp (at level 66) after completing a collect 30 in about 45 min.  Split was 75pp per and no loot drops.  Pretty dismall.  Will check it out tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More specificly, the group was low end lvl 66 (3 players) two 67 player and one 68. So no was under 66. The adventure was a EF NORMAL. The mobs migated slow a bit (all of them) and were conning dark blue to all player lvls .. so i suspect mobs were lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my recent experience, if there's a lvl 69+ player in your group, the adventure will default to a hard. Tried a MM with with me(68 shaman), 68 necro, 66 &amp; 70 pallys. I requested the adv. it was a normal. Zoned in to find a bunch of 1k hitters that partially slowed. Finished the adv (30 collect) with 10 mins to spare &amp; was awarded 101 points. Immediately after that, the 70 pally got replaced by a 66 monk &amp; the following adv came out a normal.<br />

It may be an avg. lvl thing, but I havent tested that yet.<br />

*edit Hmm, re-reading t-wolf's post makes me thing its an avg lvl thing. lvl 68...</div></div><hr />

Ldon had always been ave level for the change of difficulty. I think the old final change to boost up was 63. Than you had the normal 65's adv or the hard. I think now it might boost you up to the hard after an ave lvl of 68. I havent played it recently to see if anything had changed with the normal. My groups ave lvl is still hanging just under 68 so the default was a normal 65 a couple week ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah, i can't pull 6 and 7 at a time anymore in ldon =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From my experience if the group level average is 68+ it is a hard adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First to dispell some confusion that might be present: one man's hard is another man's normal.  Literally.  Basically there are tiers of LDoNs: one the game gives to groups with average levels X to Y, another for groups, average level Y to Z, etc.  If you are in the X to Y range, and you pick hard, you instead get the Y to Z range adventure.<br />
<br />
Back when level 65 was the max, SOE made a level 66-70 adventure, to be the level 65 hard adventure.  Officially, they never made any new adventures, even after they raised the level cap, because they don't make any money adding content to an expansion you've already bought (well that last part isn't official, but you can read between the lines).  However, a lot of people wanted higher LDoNs and &gt;1450 pt equipment, so maybe they decided to compromise and give higher level LDoNs but no new equipment.<br />
<br />
If you get a &quot;normal&quot; mission with a level 68+ average group, you might get an adventure that seems &quot;hard&quot; (because its the same one 65's got when they picked hard) but it should still be a &quot;normal&quot; in game terms.  However, you guys are reporting that you got 100 or so points from these &quot;normals.&quot;  What I want to know is, is this because these higher level adventures give a lot more points than lower, or is it because the game is actually giving you hards and calling them normals?<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried doing a hard LDoN now with a 68+ group.  Do you get 200 points?  If so, full set of incorpreal, focus IV effects, and 40 hp augs here I come :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eirgorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont think that you can request a &quot;hard&quot; ldon if your groups avg level is 68+.  That means that until your group is avg level 68, you can request a normal adv which is the equivalent of the old full group of 65's normal or you can request a hard which is the same as the old full group of 65's hard.  Once you break the average level of 68 though, you can only do normal ldons which are the equivalent of a full 65's hard - and that is the point value you recieve.  Until Sony expands on the Ldon expansion with new dungeons/loot/adv point gear etc...I dont think you will see more than the 100 or so points per adventure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did a 'normal' (easy-65) one two weeks, group averaged maybe 65, maybe 66; 67 was the highest, and mobs were fully slowable. 66 Monk was PISSED because he needed 50 pts for some gear, and got 49 or something; I got maybe 50 at 67, don't recall exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In a level 68+ average group ..at level 70 i got 105 points for a &quot;normal&quot; adv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Only the highest level player in the group gets the full point value for the adventure --<br />
 51 points for a normal adventure with level average 63-67<br />
 105 points for a hard at 63-67, or a &quot;normal&quot; at level average 68+<br />
<br />
Everyone who is lower level than the highest level player in the group will get fewer points :( Back when full groups were all level 65, everyone got the full 51 or 105 points per adventure but that is not the case anymore.<br />
<br />
LDoN adventures go by average level and have a level spread cap of 7 levels.<br />
OoW expeditions go by requester level and don't have a level spread cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so a 66+ person can request adventures again? musta missed when they fixed that...thank gawd i dont have to hunt down a 65 person anymore to get an adventure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did a LDoN with a 68+ group yesterday.  I am level 70 and only got 105 points which is lower than the 109 I used to get from doing hards at level 65.  Anyone ever see 109 points since leveling ith oow?  <br />
<br />
We didn't get a named yesteday so I can't comment on whether the loot is like the hard LDoN loot or not.  Anyone know if we get hard LDoN drops in 68+ groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have never seen 109 points for a LDoN win...<br />
<br />
High Risk LDoNs have always been 105 points at 65, at least for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I must have miss- remembered, It has been a while since I did a 65 Hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">KK, did a hard with a 66-70 group last night.  At 66 I got 93 pts.</div></div><hr />

And the highest level person in the group got 105.  I think I've heard of people getting more than 51/105 if they gain a level during the adventure and are the highest level when they start (e.g. a level 66 person starting an adventure with others 59-66 and then getting level 67 while doing the adventure).<br />
<br />
I really don't see why a developer can't spend five minutes and go back to hard code it so that anyone who is 65 or over gets the maximum points for that adventure type.  Creating a 68 Hard is a different matter, but fixing the points should be a trivial change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok cool they are playing around with ldon now.  Where is the new items to make ldon a more playable option now?  Sure some of the hard name drops are nice now give us new armor.</div></div><hr />
