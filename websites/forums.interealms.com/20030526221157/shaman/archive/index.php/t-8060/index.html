<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">lvl 62 root worth a damn or no? i just got it for my first parch turn in, anyone ahve a lvl 61 spell that they would be willing to swap for this one? or should i just hold it or sell it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll assume you got Greater Immobilize.<br />
<br />
In PoP, alot of crowd control can be accomplished by &quot;root parking&quot; mobs.  If you are ever going to use this technique the new roots are a must since they are less resistable than the lower level roots such as Immobilize and Paralyzing Root.<br />
<br />
In fact the new roots have a built in -30 resistant adjustment making them harder to resist on the initial cast, and harder to break while they are on, i.e.  they'll last longer, even up to their maximum duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gibb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been doing some soloing with both root (lvl 14 one) and greater immobilize and I'm leaning a little towards GI despite the higher mana cost. It's 0.2 sec quicker and although they function very similar, GI seems to hold a little better, root doesn't break as often after casting BoN.<br />
<br />
For the record, this is PoN spiders, trees,ravens etc, I'm lvl 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greater immobilize is heaven in a can. I have had it resisted initially by mobs twice in 3 weeks of constant use. It usually lasts to its full duration, even on nasties in storms, and malo+GI is crazy sick pvp rooting.. I havnt seen tanks rooted and destroyed this easily since my warrior was lvl 5 in 99.<br />
<br />
&lt;3 GI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so i guess i should keep it not sell it. now just to get to a lvl i can use it =)<br />
ryoz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm going to give it a try once I get it, like I did with all our other roots, but I keep going back to good ol' Root.<br />
<br />
Hard to beat the low mana cost, the easy of channelling due to level, and it's decent cast time.<br />
<br />
When I need to keep things parked for longer, I just refresh.<br />
<br />
I hope that GI is as nice as Karelan and Gibb say though.  That would finally make it worth upgrading, imo.</div></div><hr />
