<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buku1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was woundering at 56 where in Solb would be a good place to set up shop to get my last yellow for 57, I currently decked out in Hate Armor, with Epic, and Jbb ac is around 950 buffed, Some time I have amonk coming with me otherwise it just be and doggy. Aswell Can Efferti be solo'd or Duo'd<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">youre not high enough to get the imps single, so i dont think you could get to the freeti solo.  if the monk can get them single you could duo the freeti.<br />
<br />
other than that, the only other thing worth fighting is LDCs, and there's not a lot of em, and theyre often camped by monks.  ive only seen shamans soloing there once or twice - theres generally much better zones for solo shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Efreeti is solo'd frequently by a 60 shaman i know, but i doubt it would be possible before that.<br />
<br />
LDCs would be good, but like Jagara said, there isnt enough of em to keep you happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Buku1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty mich looking for a nice old world/Kunark zone to solo in or duo, I try of Luclin and High HP's any suggestions would be nice :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have always wondered if South Kaladim would work as a replacement for HHK around 59-60.    When I did try it ... I was 57 and every pull had very high MR resists ... plus had a hard time single pulling.   If you check Illia's on South Kaladim ... those guards should be light blue with around 3500 HP.<br />
<br />
Any 59/60 Shaman's tried to single pull the guards at zone in at South Kaladim?   Maybe since it's a city zone it would be worth trying ... Esp for the Evil Shaman's (no exp hit).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also ... Skyfire is a good place for Dark Blues to solo around the Burning Woods zone line.   Look out for Quadders though.</div></div><hr />
