<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Are there any cheap light emitting items I can get to go in my ammo slot. I have a gorango idol in my ranged slot and crystal web shield as my shield ( got to love the bazaar). I am tired of taking up an inventory slot with a GLS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">replace the idol with a ceremonal smudging stick ... see my post for specs on item .. it is a light source as well ...<br />
<br />
with a decent group you can loot one yourself .. but i have seen them in bazaar for as low ast 900pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is also the Runed Vah Shir Figurine. <br />
<br />
It's player made and is a lesser light source that fits into the ammo slot.  <br />
<br />
It's very rare for a player made item since it requires completion of a long and buggy quest to get the tools to make them then uses nodrop components from creatures that are green to most potters who would have the skills neccessary to make this item.  In addition any time that the potter fails a combine he will lose the tools and have to redo the quest from the begining to get a new set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your epic is a light source.  Makes a huge diff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, well I have MANY level to go before I get my epic, I am 15 now. I will keep an eye out for something to use. Serpint site is handy but a light source just makes things easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would advise casting infravision on yourself and every nightblind erudite, barbarian and human you can as often as you can.  You'll really regret it if divination isn't maxxed for your level when you hit 29 and invis.  Invis is one of those spells that often needs to be cast immediately...fizzling it could mean a nasty death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might also consider a Split Paw Hide Mask.  <br />
<br />
By no means a great item but it is a greater light source that you can wear and should be more than adequate till you get to where you have more options.<br />
<br />
SPHMs sell for about 5pp so they are more than affordable and are quite common.</div></div><hr />

Reminds me of something that happened a long time ago.  I was in CC doing Geonids, and a group that wanted to pass through the tunnel to the exit had a few KOS people.  Their only inviser was a troll shaman (who had apparently never cast serpent sight in his life, or maybe any other divination spell for that matter).  The guy fizzled himself completely OOM before he could get two people invised.  Their group had to invite me to invis the KOS. :p  In this case it wasn't dangerous, just really embarrassing for the other shaman, but there are times when it could be very dangerous.</div></div><hr />
