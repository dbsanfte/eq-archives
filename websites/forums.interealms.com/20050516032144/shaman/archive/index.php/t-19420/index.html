<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just peaked at Lucy and saw a bunch of &quot;Concoction&quot; I wonder what the odds are that they might be alchemy potions.<br />
<br />
Doubtful  but I can hope<br />
<br />
Id love this one <br />

They seem to be numbered I II III  ... kinda like the Awareness potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's interesting. The movement reduction is lower than snare or ensnare (33% at level 65 compared to 55% or so for snare/ensnare), but it would be enough to stop fleeing mobs. I wonder what will cast those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rogue poisons almost certainly.  Don't get your hopes up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hm... One can hope, but it might also be a rogue poison.  They have poisons labeled with I, II, IIIs.. and it is a detrimental effect, so that is probably it. :/<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/nod prob rogue poison. although rogues already get snare poison, and they also get slow poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sure we dare hope!  Why not?  With all GoD's emphasis on trade skilling, I'll be surprised and disappointed if it doesn't include some Alchemy stuff.  I'm afraid I'll also be surprised if I'm pleased.<br />
<br />
/em Sighs heavily<br />
<br />
My biggest worry on that front is that the trade skill enhancements may be designed primarily as a platinum sink rather than for player enjoyment.  The cool new user interface will likely draw lots of folks back to the trades.  If they're not more fun and/or more useful than they were, that fad won't last long.  I'm sorry to say (after Essence of Concealment prematurely faded on me again last night) that LDoN's foraged component alchemy approach was counter productive, adding significantly to my frustration rather than fun.<br />
<br />
We can hope that this new GoD has changed course, doesn't hate Shamans, and comes up with useful potions with reasonable and competitive component costs, revitalizing alchemy's potential.  Ensnaring Concoctions that didn't require raid-drops or relatively rare foraged rubbish would be awesome!  Unfortunately, Rogue's poisons sound even more broken than our potions.  Maybe this will help them.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'm still hoping for a potion series something like &quot;Essence of the Hunter,&quot; &quot;Spirit of Bestial Dominion,&quot; or simply &quot;Flowing Thought.&quot;  I'd crassly chortle for &quot;Canned Crack!&quot;  It needs to cost about 20p per hit for the first level, 60p for the good stuff, and last about three hours.  Gee, I wonder what gave me (probably along with most alchemists) that idea?  I don't want to estimate whether I've spent more on my alchemy skill-ups or in &quot;donations&quot; to drug dealers.  Either way the cost's been obscene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Please,  I've given up on alchemy and I don't understand why they keep giving us crap like foraged components/lame vendor buybacks and on and on.   <br />
<br />
Alchemy was broken from day one,  and I expect absolutely nothing from Sony in the next expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id rather my usefulness came from my spells and abilities, as opposed to something sold in the bazaar by bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alchemy is useful. I use lots of IVU potions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alchemy is useful. I use lots of IVU potions!<br />
<br />
I have a number of potions that seem to sell at least reasonably well (And I do mean for a profit, not just for cost, though my guildmates get it for cost - if they force me to take money that is)<br />
<br />
Damage shield, sow, some people expressed interest in the canni-in-a-pot potions (for the exact names) when I can make them..<br />
<br />
And for some odd reason, there is one person that really likes shrink potions.  A high elf, too.  But, who am I to turn down a customer?  Also wanted illusion potions when I could make them.<br />
