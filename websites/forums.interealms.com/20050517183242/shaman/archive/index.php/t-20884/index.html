<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok as of last night I completed all pop flags needed for sol ro according to the check list and seer information threads here.<br />
<br />
The only thing im missing is the PoS Giant quest. I even have Agnarr dead. I cannot zone into sol ro. <br />
<br />
The seer tells me that all the pop bosses are dead however <br />
<br />
when she tells me about mith mar vz and tz says: Now I know that because I havent killed RZ that vz and tz are supposed to say that but why Mith mar too? <br />
<br />
The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend<br />
<br />
Also I recieved one flag from the librarian after hailing him but when I say what lore to him he says something vague about heads or tails.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
please help if anyone knows anything that can help me out <br />
<br />
 I have everything listed here below minus the last part Regarding Saryn and Mith Marr. I do have Saryn though cause i double checked that.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To enter Temple of Sol Ro, you must have the following at a minimum: (Grummus, TT, Bertoxx, KoS, Saryrn, HoH trials, MM, Tallon, Vallon)<br />
- Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal. The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
PoV/PoS<br />
- Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
Grummus<br />
- Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Terris Thule<br />
- Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt.<br />
Bertox<br />
- Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
Keeper of Sorrows<br />
- You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
HoHonor Trials<br />
- The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.<br />
Saryrn &amp; Mithaniel Marr<br />
- The words of Maelin echo in your mind, 'The Zeks and Solusek are planning an invasion of Norrath, find out more from Rallos if you can.<br />
Tallon &amp; Vallon Zek<br />

<br />
If anyone can help Id appreciate it thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure you need the POS quest which flags you for BOT which allows you to get Agnarr flag. Of course since they opened BoT you don't actually need it to zone into BoT but I bet you need it for progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have to complete the PoS quest to get access I think.<br />
<br />
The reason you are getting the message:<br />
<br />
&quot;The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.&quot; <br />
<br />
is because you have killed Agnarr, talked to Karana, but are not BoT flagged yet.<br />
<br />
Unless I am reading your post incorrectly you say you have not completed the storms piece. I think you need to complete it and zone into BoT through the portal in storms. Then you might need to do some hailing to reset your flags correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BoT and agnarr are not needed for access to sol ro or fire.<br />
<br />
Best thing you can do is actually post the exact text from both unlock memories and guided meditiation. IF you have anything other than agnarr showing up on unlock memories thats definitely a problem that needs to be fixed. Most commonly people are missing something in the sick house. Either one of the hails after terris/grummus/bert or missing the I will go to tormement preflag for saryrn/keeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool, thanks allot. I was told I didnt need the PoS quest to get into Sol Ro. Ill take care of it this weekend, Once again the Crubicle comes through for me :) thanks again.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit just read above post. Ive been to the sick house/librarian seer like 10 times already. Ill go over my guided meditation again thoroughly when i get home and see what I can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrm, I went and looked up the information and it appears that you are correct. The site I looked at had this for SolRo:<br />

<br />
This is what you posted, so you have the correct information. I would do as suggested and run around doing the guided meditation, pre-flagging and hailing the librarian. I know some people in my guild took several re-runs of hailing to get things right.<br />
<br />
So, I might have mislead you, sorry about that. Perhaps you just need agnarr and the PoS quest for elemental access to earth, water, and air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoS quest IS required for elemental access.  I can confirm that, since we had to go back and do it for a guildie with all other flags.<br />
<br />
Since it is required for elemental access (otherwise granted by killing RZ as the final element), it stands to reason that it's required for sol ro, too.<br />
<br />
All you need is a giant head, beard, sash, bone, and 2 amulets off the named (1 amulet off of ocean, desert, or forest giant mini-named--can't be 2 from ocean mini-nameds, etc.  Has to be 2 different venues).  If you've gotten all those flags, you can probably get 1.5-2 groups needed for the PoS mini-named easily enough.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BoT key/flag is not needed for Sol Ro access, is needed for Elementals though.<br />
<br />
RZ is not needed for Sol Ro as well, only for EP access.<br />
<br />
Unlock memories and hailing the librarian over and over again sometimes gets flags unstuck if you will.<br />
<br />
This happened the second time around flagging a toon for Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
I believe I had to go back and forth 3 times finally to get the message that nothing could be unlocked anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmm, I don't see AD on that kill list - no progression HoH access, no valid MM kill, no Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah I have attended an AD raid. It was one of my first after I got 65. Hopefully I got credit for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm, I don't see AD on that kill list - no progression HoH access, no valid MM kill, no Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Don't need AD for Sol Ro access. A rogue friend hasn't killed AD yet and is in Sol Ro after completing the Saryn chain, HoH trials, and MM kill.<br />
<br />
Ssnafu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bot quest &amp; agnarr is required for PoE, PoW, PoA access but not for PoFire access. Sol ro access is everything but rz and Agnarr/bot. If you've got sol ro access and get rz and sol ro but still don't have agnarr you are fire flagged but not for other elemental planes. In this case he's probably missing a pre/post flag for one of the mobs he killed. If anything other than agnarr shows up on unlock memories thats a big clue as to what the problem is.<br />
<br />
AD is only required for access to HoHb, aka marr's room. As long as you have all 3 trials and get 15%ed into a marr kill to get the flag you never need an AD flag.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the unlock and guided meditiation from your log file here and I can probably tell you exactly what you need to do.</div></div><hr />

Vallon is what is holding you up; if you really have all other flags. AD, BoT (PoS quest), Agnar, and RZ you don't need. You need to talk with the librarian/seer until it is fixed.<br />
<br />
Mithaniel is because you have not sorted your Agnar flag out.<br />
<br />
I really wish people would log their entire seer list when they ask for help  :confused:</div></div><hr />

This is what you need to fix for Sol Ro. Hail Maelin in the library and say I have new lore and then I have new information.<br />
<br />
The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />

Hail Maelin and say what lore. Probably need to do your BoT flag first.<br />

<br />
BoT (PoS Quest) flag.</div></div><hr />
