<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had quit playing about a year and a half ago, dropped my 44 shaman cause it was getting boring. I decided to create a second character to duo with my shaman and wow.<br />
<br />
gfay on xegony used to be the place to trade and get items, only 10 ppl in zone. <br />
<br />
oasis, the hotbed of activity for the orc highway, the crocs, specs and gobs was always packed with people usually on the order of 100 or more in zone, now 13 in zone.<br />
<br />
unrest, the party haven trains, corpses, and people lined up at the entrance waiting for the mobs to wonder back to whereever they came from usually about 50-70 in zone, now 6.<br />
<br />
but the kicker, the one I never expected. south karana. wow that place is dead. centaurs, aviaks, paw, rare mobs. used to be there were at least 120-150 people in here at all times, one group for each spire, 10 groups at the aviaks, 4 or 5 at the centaurs, and people roaming around. now there are 10 people, including both of my chars. half a group at one of the spires and the rest at the aviaks. I had the whole of the centaurs to myself, it was like steamfont without someone camping the mino 24/7 of course, now with the changes to the mino, probably not even that.<br />
<br />
as far as items, I picked up a mithril 2 hander for 200plat, I saw an ssoy for 500, and I also got a wakizashi of the frozen skies for 150. if MM is as dead as these other zones, and the exp is as good as I remember, my warrior will be 30 within 15-20 hours played. I will be heading over there at 22, so probably after tonight I will be going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If deserted zones with good exp mobs are your thing, then you've only scratched the tip of the iceberg. <br />
 - Runnyeye was revamped<br />
 - Keasora was added a HUGE exp modifier<br />
 - Cazic Thule is now NOT a good noob zone, full of 51+ lizards and such.<br />
- Jaggedpine forest would be a good bet for expin at 35ish.  That's new.<br />
- Stonebrunt is also quite nice for exping around lvl 20-30.  <br />
<br />
Then you got the LoY zones . . . the Gulf of Gunthak is a good noob zone for 35ish.<br />
etc etc.<br />
<br />
Plus they removed the &quot;book&quot; completely.  No more staring at the thing to med!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, times are a changing.<br />
<br />
The new oasis is Paladual caverns on Luclin, although the exp there is just insane.  Most people zone in at 13 and leave at 25 after a day or 2 of grinding. Its just sick...<br />
<br />
MM is still a great zone, and usually empty except for those that are there for specific quest pieces (usually shaman and SK's as far as I can tell)<br />
<br />
Bazaar is a godsend.  learn to play the markets there and you can make yourself very wealthy in a short amount of time.  Boring as hell to me, but some people really like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, I had the same shock when I started playing my 45 shammy last november after over a year off. I leveled from 45 to 61 without much effort in 4 months after I started playing again. So much changed when I got back from the time off like:<br />
<br />
- No more hell levels<br />
- No more staring blindly at a med book up to 34th lvl.<br />
- No more dispelling buffs to remove a slow, can just remove it with one cast of abolish disease.<br />
- Pets summon at maximum level each time<br />
- Pets back off from a mezzed mob without the need of spamming /pet back off<br />
- Shaman pets can dual wield if you give it two weapons<br />
- KEI<br />
- Insane XP in PoP zones<br />
- The bazaar<br />
- PoK books for easy travel. Yah! No more begging druids and wizzies and long assed boat rides.<br />
- Did I mention KEI?<br />
- I remember when JMs sold for 15k and Wu sticks for 10k now they are 1kish. CoTs are now vendor items hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And......KEI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to padual caverns till 25 ... though you will cry once you leave.  4 levels an hour is not that uncommon.  Now that it is very crowded exp has slowed some but you will still make insane amount of exp here.  Killing a blue mob as an iksar only gives you 4% or 1 blue.  If you didnt have the racial penalty it is like 6% per kill</div></div><hr />
