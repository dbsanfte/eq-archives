<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I voted for the resist mod on our dots. Is annoying to have my dots bounce so much without maloxx.<br />
<br />
Feels like we have malos great and now its held agaisnt us forever. Even places where my slow is landing okie without dots bounce to much especially bane and the like with a long recast timer.<br />
<br />
As for the shrink thing. I dont know even being a shaman all my alts that i play alot have shrink ability. Went and camped the wand in the deep so people wouldnt have to bother shrinking me. I do think invis and shrink should have a way to work out of group after all this time. But at the same time people can take action to help themselves on this. Alot just dont. <br />
<br />
Is pure spirit the one mentioned they were going to fix because it wasnt working way it is suppose too? <br />
<br />
As for surviving. I dunno i feel i survive as well as other slowers. I'm never had an opinion if we should have a way to lose some aggro from slowing or a special shaman thing like chanters have self runes. I just never felt that fragile. <br />
<br />
Vp: Like dots with long recast timer that bounce it can be a bit frustrating to need VP in a quick situation and have it bounce. A modifier would be kinda cool but i still get most ticked when my dots bounce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DoH true Glori , I cant seem to remove it though . Says only mods can .. can you remove it for me ? I agree It shouldnt be there .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never edited a poll, let me see if I can completely hose this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">while i agree that #9 and 10 were a bit weak, one of the things i would like to see, espically for us (replace those crappy aa's) would be something like &quot;multi MGB&quot; for those times when yur the only shaman... name me another class that has to potentially MGB 6 group buffs (focus. wrulans, diaku, stamina, sence, and tribunal) even a 3x mgb would be great.<br />
<br />
<br />
also for VP i'd like to see a better resist mod on it and if a lower reuse timer isnt valid then give us &quot;multi VP&quot; for there are times where 1 VP isnt gunna cut it!<br />
<br />
yes to day is sponcered by the word multi and the number 3...<br />
<br />
tho to vote on the poll... maybe something with the resists im undecided</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I voted for survivability, since if you can take a beating more than what we currently can, you can probably do a lot of additional things that wouldn't be wise now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">None of the above.<br />
<br />
MGB reuse timer reduction AA, a larger negative resist mod on Balance of Nihil, and adjustments to Cripple line that make it actually gimp mob DPS/casting would be handy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">none of the above also...have a shrink AA or spell that allows a shaman to stay shrunk until dead or camped out. much like the chanter/rogue illusion AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would be nice if we could spell &quot;poison&quot; properly before sending to devs.<br />
<br />
Also, IMHO, it is fruitless to ask for built in resist mods on dots, don't ever see them giving us this.  And, they have given us a way to reduce aggro with Spell Casting Subtlety (if it works).  That and self healing, which the other &quot;slowers&quot; can't really do, is not a bad compromise.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick one of the items listed (which I did), I went with the resist debuff on VP.  I hate having to have MD memmed to use VP reliably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also, IMHO, it is fruitless to ask for built in resist mods on dots, don't ever see them giving us this.

Agree here Thunder. Asking for things that have obviously been considered and not implemented is like spitting into the wind. Shaman have tools to recude the resist rates on spells. The change in Slow (-40 resist on Balance of Nihil) was a HUGE concession, and directly addressed one of the biggest issues we had as a class. Namely, the Malos-Slow combo was landing too late in fights to be considered a big enough factor given the &quot;New&quot; EQ trend of shorter fights, higher DPS, speed speed speed etc. WHile adding a resist mod to our DOTS would be nice, its hardly even a &quot;minor&quot; issue to me. <br />
<br />
I voted for TGB Shrink, but I honestly feel the best solution to the shrink issue is to give Mages an AE-shrink item spell similar to Mod Rod. Make it no-rent, no-drop, etc. I dont think it would hurt the shrink potion market, and it would certainly help in raids. Personally, I now have many other things I would rather use MGB on than Shrink. TGBing shrink would help, but would still remain a PITA for single deaths in raids. A &quot;Mod Shrink&quot; item would solve all these issues with one swoop. Players newly rezzed could immidiatly shrink themselves without wasting a charge or potion on raids. Devices and Potions would still have their place, in individual group situations, but the raid shrink problem would be largely solved, and that is the glaring issue of Shrink overall.</div></div><hr />

Oops , Sorry for the typo there . Im unable to edit and thus correct the offending word .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if I try to convince myself that you are suggesting this out of the good of your heart I have trouble with understanding the reason behind it.<br />
<br />
If what is on this list really does have some meaning for SOE these are the points we can expect to get fixed...but if this is the case then why cant you just remove the points that changed after the list was first made?<br />
<br />
If its because nothing really happend then its hard to believe it matters what is on the list and what isnt.<br />
<br />
I know you are just trying to do your best to help but I suggest you just wait until WoW is released then there are sure to be some MAJOR changes suddenly being implemented. Then you can look at the list after that in a totally different light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">People should be allowed to vote 2 points from the list. I voted survivability over DoT resist checks(something that really needs to be adressed), just because survivability was something we used to have and it makes no sense for Shamans to have less than an Enchanter, Bard(Bards have a hell of a hard time to gain aggro in the first place) or Beastlord.<br />
<br />
Necros and Druids were never supposed to get debuffs either, look at them now. Both, Necros and druids outdebuff us for Disease and Fire respectively. Yet they kept their nice advantage that their DoTs used to have before they had any sort of debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My #1 complaint at this time ... make the avatar line either last longer or give it a normal recast. Voted for VP timer decrease because it is our only truly unique  USEFUL thing we have.  <br />
<br />
#2 WHY does the enchanter get hastened MGB and shaman dont ... they have 2 buffs (haste and crack) we have 6+ (Focus AGI STA Diaku Sense Might ... and list goes on) ... OHH I have an idea Make Every MGB able buff You cast for 1 minute an MGB buff. mana+ cast time would limit this and the only thing that MIGHT make this unbalancing is events where Recovery is part of the design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">resist mods on our spells,<br />
sure we have malos but at any time we are grouped with another caster THEY are the ones that benifit the most from it, not us. we have to cast malos to land anything where as most classes get by just fine without and its a bonus to have it on a mob.<br />
would it really be game breaking if malos was suddenly a raid spell and not an exp spell?<br />
and would VP really be broken with a neg100 check? I mean give me a friggin break whats the point of an aa root when it STILL TAKES UP A SPELL GEM. vp without decay is like regular root without malos, you have to get lucky or it just breaks or bounces right away.<br />
<br />
dot agro was most certanly not fixed with scs. <br />
<br />
fix agro and resists and Shaman survivability will go up on its own. I would still like to see shaman returned some of their previous melee powers, bash/double attack/increase the dodge cap.<br />
<br />
hastened mgb shouldnt be on the list it should just be added about 2 years ago. while I hardly think agi qualifies as a buff anyone would ever mgb I do agree that with fo7/sta/tribunal alone we have an argument for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit) didnt vote, the poll doesnt fit anything quite right other than dot resists.<br />
change the VP from reuse timer to big fat resist check please. I dont need it more often I need it to land without keeping decay memmed just so I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think resists really need to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Now mind you but my shammy is only lvl 61. He is a character that I started so I could play when my wife didn’t want to. My second ever character was a druid. So 95% of my career I landed DoT's with no problems what so ever. Talk about a shock when I switched to a Shammy.<br />
<br />
Sirens Grotto = If I malo'd I was lucky to stick my DoT's 50% of the time. Meanwhile I had a druid with me that stuck their DoT every single time. The entire time we were in SG the druid was resisted 2 or 3 times over the period of 4 days.<br />
<br />
Veksar = fat chance in hell to land a DoT for my shammy. The only @#$% spells he is worth casting was slow and DD ice based spells. I was never able to land a single DoT on a Skelly there!<br />
<br />
I was trying to get shield from the Grey off of the skellies = Good @#$% luck. I am back to nothing but Slow and DD's. DoT's don't stick unless I am super lucky and have malo'd.<br />
<br />
I have been fighting in Griegs lately and I am seeing the same old story. First of all getting a single pull in some rooms is just not possible. So about 1 out of every 3 pulls is at least a double. By the time I get two mobs slowed &amp; Malo'd there is no time left to throw DoT's on.<br />
<br />
My group always has a warrior, shaman, and cleric. 99% of the time I am without crowd control. That leaves the warrior tanking 2 or three mobs at times and sometimes more. It's not a bid deal but on a three mob pull that is 6 spells and 43.5 seconds before I am able to cast a damage spell (slows at 3 cast 6 recast, and malo at 3 cast, 2.5 recast) I can check my logs later but I believe I am getting around a 1-20 resist on slow (just a guess).<br />
<br />
One mob is usually dead in that time frame and the second one is already half dead. I usually nuke with my cold DD for 675 a pop and at this point I can chain nuke without worries. The second will die with in one or two casts of my DD and that leave me with one mob I have the option to try a DoT on the last mob to have me curse 50% of the time that it got resisted and I shouldn’t have bothered with Malo and just stuck to DD's!<br />
<br />
Obviously I don’t need to Malo the first mob seeing how I never get to try to DoT it but the whole thing frustrates me having to cast Malo to have a 65%(?) chance to stick a DoT? Yet if I played my druid my biggest worry is how many DoT’s can I stick on the mob before I steal aggro from the tank!<br />
<br />
I will go through logs when I get home and sure up my numbers with facts!</div></div><hr />

what wand is this? I cant find anything via allas/shrink/items with this effect<br />
<br />
and believe me I would camp the hell out of an all/all shrink piece</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman survivability has nothing to do with DoT aggro(DoT aggro is broken and a is a problem on its own). Shamans can't tank slowed mobs anymore due to Slow mitigation. A plate tank will survive longer against an unslowed mob than a Shaman of similar gear will against a slowed mob nowadays. This might be intended so I won't ask for a design change.<br />
Fact is you can't realiably self heal anymore as your are constantly forced into a channeling roll and the damage you take is still much higher than it used to be. On top of this, healing will create additional aggro, thus making it a questionable tool even when you can use it.<br />
<br />
Because of the points above Shamans need a short term ability that enables them to endure damage. Vindictive Spirit does that to a degree, but it is still <br />
<br />
1. Resistable(seems to be less of a problem in Omens, but very frequent in GoD high end zones)<br />
2. Not instant casting(imagine getting summoned, yeah it happens!)<br />
3. Very range restricted(if the mob isn't in range, i.e. 50&quot;, the spell will still go off and just not affect it, thus not placing the recourse on you, but it will grey out for 30 seconds)<br />
4. Not working like other PB AEs(you have to target an NPC to cast)<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, it's definitely the best spell a designer has come up with in years. I'd like to see an upgrade for this in the future as it really adressed a huge Shaman deficiency. (Nice work, Rytan).<br />
<br />
I'd like to see Vindictive Spirit to be a 0.5 second cast. Having a 100&quot; range and be able to be used targeting oneself. Other than that, the spell is great. Future upgrades should improve the recourse and the slow %.<br />
I know that this is wishful thinking, but I don't think it would alter the spell too much.</div></div><hr />
