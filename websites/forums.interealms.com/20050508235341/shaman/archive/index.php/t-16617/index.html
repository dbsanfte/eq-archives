<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cervus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow shaman!<br />
<br />
I am an 11 shaman on the FV server.  I'm also an ex-daoc'er so I have no twink goods to fall back on.  The lack of no-drop flags on the FV would make everything cheap right? wrong-- seems that no one camps the low level gear b/c there are so few of us around.  So the lowbie gear still remains outside of my financial reach.<br />
<br />
So, i'm looking for a place to farm cash.  I've heard about mammoths in Everfrost, but I don't know anything about that zone or what level the mammoths are.  All i've heard is that the tusks sell for a few plat, and the mammoth meat is needed by bakers for the Halas Meat Pie.<br />
<br />
If any kind soul out there could outline a strategy to hunting these, or provide suggestions for alternative places a level 11 could hunt i'd be delighted to hear.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lots of info can be found here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?forumid=16) about your level range and they discuss cash a bit.<br />
<br />
  FV server is very unique though, so the guides may not apply as well for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure if this has been nerfed in the past 5 months that I was out of the game, but the aqua goblin camps in Butcherblock (south of the docks) was pretty good cash.  The stuff they drop can sell for a few plat each and a lot of it stacks.  Plus at lvl 11 it might still be xp.  Beyond that, the best thing might be to farm silks to sell to players that are doing tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FV is actually quite high in price for player trade compared to other servers. <br />
<br />
Best money maker for lowbies anywhere are spider/ling silks &amp; animal pelts. spider/ling silks sell for around 2 to 5pp in the bazaar, low &amp; medum quality pelts can be made into leather padding, which sells for around 25pp, high quality bear &amp; rockhopper pelts can go for up to 50. Skill up in taloring on ruined pelts &amp; mask patterns, so you can make the leather padding. Best place in game for spiderlings is round NE of the druid ring in the Feerrot.<br />
<br />
Save up all your bone chips to do the quest in kaladim pally guild, gives good money &amp; items which you can sell for more.<br />
<br />
Kill the red snakes outside Qeynos for very easy loot that sells for gold.</div></div><hr />

That's something I forgot.<br />
<br />
Aqua goblins HAVE been nerfed, but the GREEN goblins in the butcherblock mountains still drop blood and heads worth 4pp each. Skunks (pristine skunk paw) &amp; wandering greenbloods (greenblood insignias) there have drops worth about that too.<br />
<br />
One thing to watch when you sell things is faction. A vendor that judges you amiably will give a much better price than an apprehensive one. You can get better prices buying &amp; selling things by getting a couple of opal encrusted steins in the bazaar for 20 to 30pp. They raise your charisma a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">125 CHA will max out the prices you get from what you sell, no matter what faction you have got (as long as they will trade with you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or 104 CHA for anyone indifferent (which is what vendors in PoKnowledge are).  If you shoot for that with some gear, you'll be fine.  Probably the cheapest/easiest gear:<br />
<br />
+25 CHA Opal Encrusted Stein (player made through pottery, sold in Bazaar for about 25 pp usually), not-lore, you can equip two.<br />
+7 CHA Gold Cat's Eye Agate Bracelet (Jewelcrafter made, sold in bazaar for... who knows, 15-20 pp maybe?) non-lore as well.<br />
<br />
With 2 of each, on top of base 40 cha, you'll be at best sale price to an Indifferent vendor, all for under 100 pp.</div></div><hr />

There are two levels of wooly mammoths in EF. The fully grown ones drop tusks that sell for 8-10pp(depending on cha) you can start to solo  at 24 and are cake at 29. The calf's that are in your range now drop tusks that sell for 5gp I believe.<br />
<br />
I hunted these about 3 years ago. It was a very popular area so I had to hunt at off hours else you are competing with druids and rangers who can track them down. I made about 500pp from the tusks, helped pay for 2 dufrenite for my first pieces of totemic armor :)</div></div><hr />

If you can leave yourself up in the bazaar then animal pelts and spider silks are a great way to go.  If you don't want the pelt route this is what I can recommend.  Seeing as you're lvl 11 it may be tight for exp but you can get to lvl 12 hunting giant snakes in blackburrow.  They drop fangs and stackable glands that sell for 4gp+.  Great money for levels 8 &amp; 9 to 12.  At 12 you can go to wisp island.  Go from qeynos to erudin on the boat and stop at the island you come to first with the cats on it.  My recommendation to you is only kill the wisps, you can spawn some mean mob killing the other things.  Also the wisps are what drop the money items.  Lightstones sell for 1pp, greater lightstones can be turned in at the gypsy camp and west karana and another place for a book that in turn will sell for about 7-9pp - as opposed to the 5 you would get for the greater lightstone.  That will probably give you exp until around lvl 15.  After that i'm not sure.  Go to paludal caverns, scrape up exp and make sure you have enough money for spells.  Don't worry about your equipment.  In the upper 20's you can hunt for your totemic, however the gems are expensive.  The BP is probably the only piece that would have a nice benefit to you.  If you don't care about faction in the mid 20's you can hunt the treants in south karana - decent money there as well.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of right now.  Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Low level PP on Firiona Vie can be obtained by using one (or all) of the following methods<br />
<br />
1 - Sell cheese: There are lots of tradeskillers on FV, running to JP takes time. Many would rather buy it from you.  JP vendor cost @3 silver each, sells for up to 2pp in the bazaar - Just don't leave the vendor village and if the gnolls are attacking zone out.<br />
<br />
2 - fuzzlecutter formula 5000: Sold in W Freeport from the gnome vendor for @ 5 gold each. Will sell in the bazaar for up to 3pp each.<br />
<br />
3 - Heady Kiolas - Low trivial brewing - tailors need em, all components are vendor purchaseable for less than 2 gold. Tailors hate making them. They sell for 4-6pp each.<br />
<br />
4 - Spider / spiderling silk - varies but they always sell for more than they're worth<br />
<br />
5 - Pelts - Low-medium quality will get you 4-5pp. High quality will get you 5-10. HQ bear will get you 15pp<br />
<br />
6 - Leather padding - 15-20pp each</div></div><hr />
