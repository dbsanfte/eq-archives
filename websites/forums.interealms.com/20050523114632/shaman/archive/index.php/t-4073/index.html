<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally decided last night to try a modified UI after seeing so many screenshots on here. I grabbed one that shows percentages for XP, AAXP, HP and Mana and also has the sub-bar for mana - wow - it's made a huge difference in two ways:<br />
<br />
1) Remember how much less frustrating it was when they added the blue bar and you could see your xp move? It's even better now. I could actually see my xp percentage going up a point with every 3 kills last night. It was fun to grind! May not last long though...<br />
<br />
2) The sub-bar on mana made cannidancing sooooo much easier! No more squinting to look for ticks! <br />
<br />
I am loving the new UI!<br />

PS Does anyone else think it would be a good idea if we added an Equipment forum and made Quests and Special Items be just Quests? All upgrade questions and new item posts could go in the Equipment forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Changing the forums has been mentioned before, but the general opinion was that people don't read the other forums enough. Which is why equipment and quest questions get posted in the main forum anyway. So a new equipment forum would probably just get ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I gotcha. I've been looking at www.shadowknight.org lately and I like the way they have it set up. When I was looking to equip my SK using the bazaar, it was easy to just jump to their equipment forum and see other's recommendations. I'll post my upgrade question in this forum then! Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are other fora?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love the new UI also, before I had percentages on all my gauges I really had no idea what canni 1 was doing - if anything at all. Now I know!  Canni dancing for newbs has never been easier =)</div></div><hr />
