<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there such things? if so how much HP?<br />
<br />
I have done 30 adv's in Mir and about one at each of the others and am sure I have heard people talking about these, but am yet to see one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back before there were Slot 7 drops, I got a 12 hp aug in a L65 normal adventure out of MMC. I can't remember if it was a drop or from a chest. I haven't seen any hp augs drop since they made the switch to slot 7. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you mean type 1.<br />
<br />
Assuming that is the case - the best droppable aug with HP on it is the Perfect Garnet of Constitution (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23219), which only adds 12 HP.<br />
<br />
This is according to AllaKhazam's. Magelo or Lucy is probably more accurate, but they don't have a very good way to search for augs yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's also a Pristine Garnet of Constitution with 15hp, drops from hard adventures.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone else besides me think 12 hps is kinda...well, cheesy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">50 HP slot 1 Augs also drop on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel like 12hps is on par with +6 DEX or +6Cold Resist.  <br />
I'm not gonna feel bad when I upgrade my gear and lose the aug, but you get a couple of them and it can make a dent.  We've got ~20 slots that can take an augment, so chances are youve got a free space or 2.  I wouldn't pay points for them from an adventure merchant, but if they drop in the dungeon I'd roll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+12 hp or +12 mana is actually a pretty sweet upgrade if you think about it.<br />
<br />
It almost upgrades some gear 1 &quot;rank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Take a Solstice Earring... +55hp... becomes +67hp ... as a single start... that's pretty fricken great for most of EQ's population.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you're sitting in +210hp gear, and it becomes +222.... big whoop... but it's a fairly substancial upgrade.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these are free upgrades that you'll get through the course of adventures.   And meant (mainly, but not restricted to) for old gear (slot 7).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have 2 of the 12 hp drops.. one from the first week in Miraguls, the other from last week in Rujark. Both are now type 7. <br />
<br />
Very nice placeholders til you get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, before the dropped 12hp and 12 mana augs were all slot, but they got changed to type 7 in The Great LDoN Nerf.  I still have a mana one that says all though (augmenting a type 7 slot heh).<br />
