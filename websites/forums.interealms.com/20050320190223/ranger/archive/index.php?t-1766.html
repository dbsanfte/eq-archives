It has a sound card that is 2 years old<br />
A Gforce2 card that is about 9 months or so<br />
An AMD 1200mhz processor<br />
NIC card<br />
512 meg of RAM<br />

And the bastage runs so fricken hot that I have had to pull the covers off and have a living room fan blowing air across it broadside to keep it cooled.<br />
<br />
I love my machine it runs pretty nice.<br />

Then I work on a POS 400mhz machine here at work but for silly web development, java,jsp crap it gets by :D</div></div><hr />

The company I work for was sold to another company and they have a lot of benifits.  One is that they will give a $2K intrest free loan to all employees so that they may purchase a home computer.  The company will in turn take out a small portion of money from your paycheck each time you get paid to cover the cost.  Very good deal.</div></div><hr />

I also added the NIC and the Voodoo3 2000.) Don't laugh, it works :D This was our first computer, bought it in Aug, 99. <br />
<br />
Bought a refurbished CompUSA computer for my son a year later...PIII450, 128 RAM. I am going to use this computer for my second account, as soon as I fix it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Bought my son a Sony VAIO Digital Studio computer a few weeks ago. P4 1.6 ghz, 512 RAM, and just about all the goodies a budding rap star could need for creating his own CD's. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Now it's my turn...trying to decide if I want to build it myself, or buy a barebones and add to it, or just get one off the shelf. I have carte blanche to get whatever I want, just not sure of my abilities to build one completely from scratch. :p</div></div><hr />

Which is put together nice and the only problem was that the motherboard craped out on me in a couple weeks, but they replaced it free of charge. Next i'll just make my own. More than likely a mixture of parts from my current one and new parts I buy every so often. When it comes to gaming only a few thing matter. Video card, RAM, and processor. And my GeForce3 will last a couple years at least. As most games do not utilize the GeForces features; running out and buying a new GeForece4 is a waste O' cash. My goal is to eventually have two computers and use one as a server. :) Pardon, I do ramble on...</div></div><hr />

A couple weeks ago I finally got around to adding a CDRW drive because my trusty old 32x drive died.  A few years ago I added a ZIP drive.  I'm using a GF2MX from a year and a half ago or so, that will probably be next upgrade if I don't double my RAM to 512.<br />

<br />
There's a dell in the other room.   If you just want a basic biz comp, you cant beat dell -- $499, free shipping, no CA sales tax, for basic systems whenever they run a special.<br />
<br />
Breakdown of my biz's comps:<br />
9 identical dell desktops<br />
12 desktops built by me<br />
2 laptops -- 1 toshiba, 1 ibm<br />
<br />
5 custom servers built by me.<br />
2 co-located servers that I've never seen, from some website or other.<br />
<br />
As the biz expanded, it definitely became easier to shop dell.    You can use microsoft admin tools to reset the unique ID for NT-based OSes so you can simply mirror the hard drives.  Takes about 15 minutes per PC.  But I kinda miss building em =)</div></div><hr />

You should build your own Nitefox.  You could build a SCREAMING machine for 2k.<br />

I built the following for about $850:<br />
<br />
AMD XP1700<br />
512 Meg DDR Ram<br />
2x40 Gig HD in a RAID 0<br />
GeForce 3 Ti200 Videocard<br />

Its easier to upgrade, and more reliable. This HP I have was given to me by a friend. He'd had  a crash and couldn't get it back up and runninig agaiin. After tinkering with it a few days I managed to get it running. Since then the AGP slot fried so I'm haveing to use a PCI Vid card. HP's are more proprieatary (spelling) and much harder to work on. Dells you can slap almost anything in them. <br />
One day, I'll build me a new  rig and scavenge  the drives and stuff out of this HP, since my wife uses the Dell and DARES me to touch it heh.</div></div><hr />

It really wasn't much more money than anywhere else on the net I found, even those little companies.<br />
<br />
If you can put it together, you can probly save enough to make it worth it. But I would rather not try unless I knew exactly what I needed/wanted to put in it.<br />
