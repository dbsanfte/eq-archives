<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">... We're above the below and below the upper<br />
We're stuck in the middle where money gets tight<br />
But I guess we're doin' all right ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tordail wins for pulling Jodee in :)  Allow me to expound!<br />
<br />
Been slowin' for our rent and buffin' for our supper<br />
Above the below and below the upper<br />
Stuck in the middle where heals get tight<br />
But I guess we're doin' alright<br />
<br />
Well we had a lot of power when we were younger<br />
They thought we were crazy but we had the Turgur<br />
We made a lot of friends but got skipped over as a class<br />
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ass<br />
We lost our slows, we lost our buffs<br />
We lost our groups when things got tough, but<br />
Beatin' time is a winnin' fight so we guess we're doin' alright<br />
<br />
We're all, we're all, we're alright<br />
It's a deep ol' dungeon not a cleric in sight so I guess We're doin' alright<br />
o - oh, o - oh, we're alright<br />
Got my Antithesis with me tonight , I guess we're doin' alright</div></div><hr />
