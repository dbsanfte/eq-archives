<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well due to EQ2 and WoW my raiding guild Nexxus of Faith on Torvo died a slow death, and server population reduced to make LFG a freakin' nightmare, so after much soul searching I decided to move servers to Xev, and apply to a raiding guild there called Old Continent.<br />
<br />
I have to tell you I had reservations about the move, loss of friends I'd known and been around since lvl 1, a new server, new guild, new people. Well I have to say if you are considering a server transfer it's not that big of a change, I'd strongly recomend it! I also think that sony should consider merging a few of the hardest hit servers like they have with the PvP servers.<br />
<br />
People in my new guild are very similar to my old guild, I think that reflects the type of person you need to be to get to high end raiding. At the other end of the spectrum if your family guild has fallen apart due to EQ2 and WoW, I think you'd find what you are looking for on another server to. Do a some research make a char on another server check out populations @ the times you play most, and ask lots of questions.<br />
<br />
Although EQ2 and WoW have effected the populations of most servers some consolidation is needed, I see myself probably playing for another couple of years, the server transfer was just what was needed to re-ignite my interest again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brokkem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel your pain.. I was in Gift of Thought and then Tides of Destiny on Torvo, both some of the bigger raiding guilds at that time on Torv.  When DaoC came out nearly the entire guild left for those greener lands, and I nearly quit EQ since all the old familiar faces were gone.  Finally got rejuvenated by coming back to Innoruuk server where I originally started playing EQ (Torv was the newest server when I moved).  Good luck on your new start!</div></div><hr />

I've known quite a few OC people over the years and most of them have been really great players and pretty nice people.</div></div><hr />
