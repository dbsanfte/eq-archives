Current Requirements (as listed in our recruitment thread): AA's wanted (or can get during the app period): MGB, canni 5, RC3, SCS3, ancestral aid, pet discipline and other key aa's<br />
LVL 68-70: 150 minimum <br />

Raid Times: starting at 7-8pm EST, usually every day except Saturday, but it varies as extra exp days are needed or if we've had some especially long or hard raid nights<br />
<br />
Bonus, we sacrifice our guild leader repeatedly every raid...it's not a raid til Cere dies =)  Crystilla and Bydr are the recruiting officers so they'd know more than I would cuz I'm just the epic officer, shaman leader and all around flirt  :p<br />
<br />
We're looking for pretty much any class btw...requirements vary based on class needs<br />

We currently have 2 active shaman including myself, and another afk while on a month long business trip.  Ideally we want five total, and hope to see at least four per raid.  Because I'm a college student at a university (Michigan State) I plan on having my play times cut down dramatically coming this summer, so that I can experience the college life, so I'm really looking for someone that has high play times that can kinda replace me (not so much as the leader, just more so as another shaman)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To the best of my knowledge, NONE of the top half dozen guilds on Bertox are recruiting shaman. I'm sure Phantom Raiders isn't, Dragon Council isn't (and since I'm the recruiting officer for that guild, I'm pretty sure on that one :) ), unless Prophecy has recently reopened it they haven't been (but they've had some attendance issues lately, so you might want to check with them first), Blazz just said Omani isn't, I have friends in Goldenhearts and they haven't mentioned being open. <br />
<br />
Add to that the Karana influx and I think its safe to say that at least from the Bertox half, joining a guild beyond mid-tier PoP as a shaman isn't easy at the moment.<br />

Raid Times: 5:30PST/8:30EST until 11PM PST/1AMEST, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Guild members are very active on offnights as well, so there is always something to do.<br />

We have Shaman listed as closed, but we could really use one more good Shaman to help us fill out the ranks on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Reviction (http://www.reviction-guild.com/main.htm) , on Morell-Thule (soon to be Erollis Marr), needs a few more shammy. We raid weekdays during Eastern Standard Time (usually starting at 7pm EST) and Sat afternoon (usually 2pm EST).<br />
<br />
We're in Tacvi (still got 2 mobs to defeat there), working through DON (still need to kill Yar’Lir, Kessdona, Vishimtar), and working on MPG trials for CoA. We're killing the RSS royals, most of Tacvi, and all the other unspellable GoD stuff.<br />
<br />
You should own GoD, OOW, and DoN expansions and plan on sticking with EQ1 for the forseeable future.<br />
<br />
Requirements? Well, a sense of humor, a desire to kill strange creatures that have never done you wrong, and a strong tolerance to shouting hobbits are essential. Being level 70 w/ about 200 AAs is nice too, and the ability to raid at around 4 times a week (although more is better, of course) is good to have too. Persistance and a good attitude is more important than gear - after all, we can always kill stuff and get more gear.<br />
<br />
Check out the web site at www.reviction-guild.com<br />
Read through the old news (don't get thrown by the April Fools update) to see if this sounds like the sort of folks you'd like being with and the sort of stuff you'd like raiding. Read the &quot;About&quot;, check out the Roster, and then fill out an Application if you're interested.<br />
<br />
In game, if you have questions, etc - please contact Sanadeb, Tingling, Coladiel, Aramelus, or Janson.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nightwatcher's (http://www.nwguild.com) on The Seventh Hammer.<br />
<br />
We are the only European guild on our server, and raid from ~8:30 pm Central European Time 6+ days a week. We seek hardcore raiders who are looking to progress in the game. We are currently concentrating on getting Tacvi access and MPG trials for Anguish access.<br />
<br />
We are Txevu flagged (and we still do The Plane of Time sometimes, although we've officially left there) and do a wide variaty of raids from RSS Royals to 1.5 Epic raids, DoN dragons etc.<br />
<br />
We are seeking good people of all classes, and are specifically looking for ~2 more shaman. We require level 70 with 100+ AA's in the relevant areas.<br />
<br />
Please see the recruitment post on our boards for more details.</div></div><hr />
