<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Isn't it about time we got a group cure upgrade?<br />
<br />
Oh wait...it's a cleric spell http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5270&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Were we not supposed to be the best at curing diseases/poison? *shrug* Guess I can chill on Bertox now too (Word of replenishment wasn't as many counters as blood...and now this is more...) Hmmm...less cast time too. Woohoo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now really, do you think a Cleric is going to be able to cast that enough ?  Mana cost is way too high to use as a simple &quot;cure&quot; spell.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's whack that Clerics get a spell that does so many things, but as far as a strait cure?  I don't feel threatened by this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Half of a complete heal for your whole group, plus curing quite a bit in the process, for what I would think is a reasonable amount of mana, with a 4.5 second casting time.  It would take 2 casts of it to do the work of RGC or Abolish Disease, but it would be hitting the whole group.  I can see a cleric being assigned cure duty with this kind of spell.  They would be healing the group for the same amount of healing 1 second faster than a Cheal casting cleric could heal one person too.  Looks like a sweet spell for clerics.  Of course I'm jealous :p<br />
<br />
Maybe they wanted us to be a different kind of cure caster, with this? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5410&amp;source=Test)  I don't have Radiant Cure, so I don't know how useful this will be, but it looks like it will help us stay in the curing business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bitch ass lazy shamans in my guild haven't even done the blood fo nadox quest, so clerics getting it resolves many problems we had when we first faced Tantisala in earth etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW shamans can be happy no longer to get asked for removing disease / posion counters on a single target. Paladins (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5283&amp;source=Live) will now take over. Well, could be even true for curse counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd like to know what Cleric can chain cast this spell in AE fights.  Forget it.  A Cleric can cast this MAYBE 4 times . . . vs how many times can you cast Blood of Nadox ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno at 62 and not anywhere near elemental geared I can cast it 3 times with out clarity, and not counting any form of mana regen.  I imagine a cleric could through it out more than that. I'm not saying chain cast, but every two minutes maybe.  But it should be (minus about 1000 of the healing power) a Shaman spell.  We could cast it every three minutes without missing a beat.<br />
