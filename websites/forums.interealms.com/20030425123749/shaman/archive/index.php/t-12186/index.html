You could try scounds and archers in Echo Caverns. The archers drop 2 bows each that sell for 23plat a piece. Problem is there are only 2 archers. But, at 58 you could handle them and the scounds as well as an arisen soldier or 2. not fast cash but you can get ok exp and aaxp if you want.</div></div><hr />

Though it is boring as heck, don't underestimate the money potential in farming tradeskill items.  Old world zones like EC, WC, the Karanas, etc are virtually empty most of the time.  Leather padding sells RAPIDLY at 300pp a stack.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks for Rockhoppers (might even still be dark blue for exp, I don't remember) is another potential goldmine.<br />
<br />
Superb &amp; Flawless rockhopper pelts sell FAST for 125pp EACH on my server, and that's a fair price since most bazaar traders have them listed at 200pp+ each.  That's 2.5kpp for a STACK of them, and no hunting silly spiderlings, running all over a zone, or combining to be done either.  MQ &amp; LQ pelts sell for 5-10pp each w/o too much trouble. Heck, even the damaged pelts can sell for 5gp-1pp each.<br />
<br />
Of course, at 58, Old Sebilis is an old and reliable standby.  W/ Kragg's, you could probably get by as primary healer &amp; slower with a good group.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
