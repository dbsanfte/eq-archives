<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't understand what you mean by the firepots are broken.  You can't bind there anymore?  The pots don't take you anyplace?  Going to cabilis puts you under the world?<br />
<br />
Can you please clarify what you mean by broken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You no longer go where you think you will be....<br />
Neriak pot seems to take you to Cabilis, Cabilis pot puts you under the world in a different zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FP = SRo<br />
Felwithe = LOIO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">tested with them for a bit<br />
<br />
akanon,grobb,oggok,kaladim,river vale pots still works<br />
<br />
eruidn,neriak pots    goes to      west cabilis(think it's loio zone)<br />
gfay pot                   goes to      warsilk woods<br />
felwhite pot              goes to      loio,at FV zone<br />
halas pot                 goes to      dagnor's cauldron,at BBM zone<br />
freeport pot             goes to      sro wizzy paltform<br />
cabilis pot now        goes to      nro by side of inns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hrm...so the question is:<br />
<br />
If you could take 9 pots and re-'target' them, where would you?<br />
<br />
I really don't need a FPot for Grobb and Oggok when they are so close together...especially if I could get a pot into Velious or Kunark.<br />
<br />
With my luck they will remove Oggok (VI_employee: hrmmm...nobody goes there anyways.  Let's make one for Qeynos. ) :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's pretty funny!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would like to see them for:<br />
-Gfay<br />
-TT at Seb Bubble<br />
-Zone in to Chardok<br />
-Umbral<br />
-By the Scorp pit in OT<br />
-outside Velk's<br />
-Kael<br />
-ToV<br />
-Safe spot in Veeshan's Peak <br />
oh and....<br />
-CS Home<br />
<br />
~Bax<br />
<br />
btw: don't know if there is a Safe Spot in VP - never been there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">since you cannot gate out of VP, I don;t see how you can refer to any spot in that zone as &quot;safe' ... closest thing would be at one of the places you can zone out, but aren't they all in the back of  dragon lairs?<br />
<br />
so, I think no VP firepot.  but one to PoA would help, and one to Hate would be, uh, interesting .... how about one to PoM?<br />
<br />
bah - I am with Snapdragn, just lose one of the Grobb/Oggok pots for a loc in Velious ... but not in one of the cities, as that could cause more people to go on that faction.  maybe outside of Velks is not that bad a spot, but CS makes more sense to me.<br />
<br />
Then lose one of the Gfay pots and make it go to Luclin instead...<br />
<br />
but this is really pipe dreaming, as VI is surely not going to make them customized to a wish list of camps that PC's want easier access to ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*Obligatory &quot;Oh wow this would be so freakin cool&quot; comment:<br />
<br />
Be nice if you could set the destinations in your config file.<br />
<br />
Give us a list of 10 - 30 zones and let us pick the ones we want to have as destinations.  <br />
<br />
Sure it's a pipe dream, but damn that would be nice...as in 'broken' nice.</div></div><hr />
