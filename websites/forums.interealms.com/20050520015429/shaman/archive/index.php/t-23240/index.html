<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I was always mistaken, but I had assumed that EQ had the most subscriptions of any mmorpg.  <br />
<br />
http://games.slashdot.org/games/04/08/19/194208.shtml?tid=209<br />
<br />
This slashdot article links to some graphs showing that the current subscription winner is Lineage, then Lineage II.  <br />
<br />
The graph appears to be down(thanks to slasdotting), but what it showed was Lineage having 2.7 million subscribers, and EQ as having 400,000 subscribers.  <br />
<br />
I guess I didn't realize that the difference was that great.  So is Lineage /Lineage II like the best mmorpg ever made or something?<br />
<br />
I looked over the Lineage 2 site, and the graphics looked nice, as did the concept of castle siege.  The classes didn't seem that appealing though, and the skill based system seemed...lacking.  They posted a quest list, and it only had a few dozen!  <br />
<br />
One thing that seemed intriguing also was the fact that any class could tame animals.  For instance, you can fight a dragon (epic encounter I assume), and get a dragon egg.  Then you raise it for a while, then if your clan (guild structure I guess) has a certain type of building, you can raise it to another stage where it becomes a ride-able mount.   Then if you are in a clan that has a castle, you can do some quest type things and get it to become a wyvern or adult dragon.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, it didn't seem like it had nearly the content, nor class depth, nor same number of quests as EQ.  Yet, Lineage has 6x the number playing it?  <br />
<br />
Where have I been that I missed this, hehe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know, I've only seen this type of post at least 20 times over the last year or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lineage is primarily played in S. Korea if I'm not mistaken.  In the city of Seoul, pretty much ever single residence has some form of DSL, making it much easier for people to game online, and the city is full of Internet gaming cafe's, as well.  There was a really great article in Wired about it a few months ago, I'll see if I can find a link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lineage is (iinm) a game VERY popular in Korea (South of course).  It has been around for quite some time. Check back issues of  Wired  for a good writeup on the game.<br />
<br />
Lineage is not popular here (and I am speaking of Lineage 1), because the game forces you to choose whether to be a follower or leader right off the bat.  This does not jibe well with the Western (notably American) mentality where everyone wants to be the hero. (Except abashi of course)<br />
<br />
L2 may have changed some of the dynamics (the  Wired ) article is from 2-3 years ago IIRC.  <br />
<br />
S. Korea (specifically Seoul) is VERY heavily wired for high speed connectivity. People actually watch video game competitions on t.v. Additionally, groups of individuals will gather in  bangs  which are our equivalent of internet cafes to play Lineage. (and other games I suppose).<br />
<br />
I was always envious of my fellow soldiers stationed in Seoul. They had cars, apartments, and many amenities not found in  Tong-du-Chon  where I was located.<br />
<br />
Think of Seoul as Erud and TDC as old Grobb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't be surprised. I came back to eq not too long ago and almost everyone I knew was gone, I am sure a few people changed there toons but I think most of them quit. Eq has lasted for quite some time now, I don't think there is too much they could do to get people back. I could be wrong. I think everquest still is the probably the best one evermade...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know people who work at the company that sponsor lineage here in the US.  It has a tiny subscription population.  By far it's largest population base is in Korea.<br />
<br />
EQ is the largest MMORPG in the US, as best I recall.  I think it may be tops in Europe as well, though it's a much smaller market over there in terms of subscriptions.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of the differences are cultural.  I looked at lineage a bit, and came away with the conclusion that is really, really sucks!  Try it at your own risk!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SOE never claimed that EQ is the biggest in the world, only biggest in the US. And yes, as folks have mentioned, Lineage is huge in Korea, representing a huge chunk of its market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Similar to the way Black and White was only a mild success here but VERY successful in Europe.<br />
<br />
Cultural differences to affect what games are interesting/attractive to people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I liked Black &amp; White.  Don't like Creature Isle much though.<br />

Anyone remember Dungeon Keeper?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye - I still have DK2 on my drive.  Fun game.</div></div><hr />

Not the article I was looking for, but a nice read.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely great game.  I never could keep the Demon Lords happy. So I'd just drop them in the middle of a bunch of enemy troops and let them suicide.  My main force was always Dragons and the Bile Demons.(The ones who farted all the time.)<br />
<br />
And nothing says &quot;Fun&quot; like torturing and turning the heroes to your side. Of course you could use the assistance of a Dark Mistress (*) or two for that..........<br />
<br />
(*) Dark Elf Wenches who like to be spanked.  Ok make that LOVED to be spanked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lineage was great for the first 7 levels or so. Past that, the exp grind was horrible.. think back to level 59 and how bad that was. That's how every level is starting around 15ish. With a high max level, I only got to level 28 on my character before I realized how much crap I was going through, and went back to EQ.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, there are characters that are delevelled and running off scripts to farm money and KSing all your mobs. group exp is horrible and not worth anything even at the high 20s/low 30s. I heard that you have to level when you are in high 30s+, and that it still sucks.<br />
<br />
I really would not recommend lineage to any gamer now that I know what I got myself into. Was great for the first month, then down the tubes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">l2 was by far the most boring grind i've ever played.  I was bored out of my mind by lvl 10-15 or so.  great to see how bad it was for free in beta though ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Alphar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Simply put Lineage sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ahh ok.  Lineage is not big here..  thats why I've never heard of anyone playing it:) thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lol Lineage has the worst grinding curve ever, I think its not capped and after each level, it would take twice as long to do the next. I've not played the game more than 5 mins but this is what I have heard. The 5 mins I played, the graphics are 2d, the environment is crap, eq is better easily. As an additional note, I think a game called Ragnarok actually exceeded Lineage, but it was closed down or something.<br />
<br />
Also, as to the subscription numbers, if Lineage is ignored,  I am quite surprised eq is still retaining the top spot, I did think ff11 overtook it or something at one stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was always envious of my fellow soldiers stationed in Seoul. They had cars, apartments, and many amenities not found in  Tong-du-Chon  where I was located.<br />
<br />

<br />
Definitley a disparity in things that are available... I was at Camp Liberty Bell when I was stationed in Korea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i know ragnarok is still around.. but im pretty sure it lost alot of subscribers when they went to pay to play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been playing Lineage 2 now for several months. Here's my 1 minute analysis:<br />
<br />
1. Graphics are lovely. Landscapes look real, shadows are done right, there are many pretty scenes.<br />
<br />
2. Animations are very good. You get the feeling of hitting mobs and being hit by them that is convincing. I don't know how many times I sat and shook my head at the silly swinging at monsters one does in EQ.<br />
<br />
3. The game is based on the Unreal graphics engine, which is probably its strongest point.<br />
<br />
4. There is a strong gender bias in the game. Female characters wear short skirts that show their panties and in some cases expose an abundance of cleavage.<br />
<br />
5. Classes and races are severely limited, resulting in low character diversity.<br />
<br />
6. Character customization is almost non-existant.<br />
<br />
7. Availability of items and weapons is severely limited.<br />
<br />
8. Because of 5, 6, and 7, everyone looks the same.<br />
<br />
9. Spells and abilities are limited. Most upgrades occur by slight increases of existing spells/abilities.<br />
<br />
10. Quests are generally useless, although you must at least twice over your career engage in boring quests to upgrade to the next tier of character development.<br />
<br />
11. The UI is abysmal. There is a single chat window that cannot be adjusted in any way.<br />
<br />
12. PKing, scamming, and griefing of players by unscrupulous individuals is spiralling out of control.<br />
<br />
I've stayed with the game as long as I have because I've met some fun people, many of them EQ and DoAC refugees. I guess I'm just biding my time since I lost interest in CoH, don't have any interest in WoW, and am skeptical about EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I`m probably wrong,but I heard from a friend (who usually is very knowledgeable with this stuff) that a week after its release final fantasy online had more accounts than eq did in its 4-ish years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I`m probably wrong,but I heard from a friend (who usually is very knowledgeable with this stuff) that a week after its release final fantasy online had more accounts than eq did in its 4-ish years<br />

<br />
It sucks anyways...room mate got it...over 3 hour patch (even with cable connection). They may of gotten a ton of subscibers when it first came out, but I bet most left. (Such as shadowbane..lol). <br />
<br />
FFXI is choppy, story line is same as all the FF...and players are rude.<br />
Played a week of it and came back to EQ. (lol...wonder were EQ got the 'Augmentation&quot; idea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">EQ got augs from D2 ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lineage 2 sucked. Its only saving grace was that the female models were quite easy on the eyes.<br />
<br />
Not enough to keep me around when I've got a wife to look at though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I recently quit playing lineage2 (l2 for short) recently because of RL.  I think the worldwide market went was Lineage 1 with an est 20 million users, FFXI 2 million, and i'm not sure about lineage2.  Lineage 2 is more like diablo in that you have basic templates that you follow.  Every amazon, barbarian etc would look pretty much the same with minor differences. In lineage2 its basically the same, until c3 or whatever where you get tattoos that enhance your natural ability.  This allows natural ability to be the only mitigating factor in pvp, castle sieges.  Levels do help, but post 55,58 you don't get any upgrades defense/offense/weapon skills.  The thing with Lineage2 is its very very society based.  Soloing is crappy, exping is crappy, etc.  The only thing fun about it are the sieges and the massive 400 v 400 fights or 400 v 100 fights like on Bartz.  I can see why lineage/lineage2 are so popular in korea, but i can  also see that the US/North American market isn't fond of the grinding only to lose the exp in castle sieges or pvp.</div></div><hr />
