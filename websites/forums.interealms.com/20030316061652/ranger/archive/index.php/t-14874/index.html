don't rely on a mage to summon you those insta click things unless you are going to remember to use them lol... <br />
<br />
bring a healer... a slower... a mana batery... throw up see invis... run north to the SSra temple... and do some exploreing<br />
<br />
<br />
its a fun zone... kind of a pain to get to... if you get in trouble you can zone into the temple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The zone is almost empty on Veeshan.  I can two-box there with my 54 druid as long as he has KEI and I don't get any named - I can take them but it's damn tough (no Earthcaller yet). In other words, bring a slower/healer or a cleric/58+ druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, personally I quite like this zone for soloing, especially if you have a horse as you gain the medding while standing advantage.  Though it was slow at level 60 I could roam almost the entire zone, but if moving anywhere other than the zone borders, be sure to invis, it works again most mobs but some may occasionally break it.  Watch out for the unsnare/rootable mobs, they are a pain in the butt, sucks that we have to also put up with the attempted quadding deterrent.<br />
<br />
With a BFT and fleeting quiver, combined with swifty haste and ATK and a Tolans bracer I could solo a mob in about 5 minutes excluding summoning times for arrows using root, shoot and DoT.  With Endless Quiver and Bow of Doom upgrades I have now I'd hazard a guess that soloing would be a fair sight quicker, though still very much slower than PoP grouping.  The boulder fiends (think that's the name) are annoying with their huuuuuge agro range, but most anything around I could manage solo, including some named, or if you are very bored, Sun Revenants, though they have a huge number of hitpoints, they give I think roughly 2 blue notches of AA per kill.  IMO overall one of the best solo zones for a moderately equipped 60 Ranger pre PoP, if only for the ability to use a horse to remain constantly FM without a KEI.<br />
