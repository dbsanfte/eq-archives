<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have worn out Velks, Seb, LoY, and Tier 1 PoP.  I am looking for something somewhat empty but fun.  XP and loot are not a priority, just want a change of pace with different scenery I guess.  My gear is very average, no Epic or JBB.  But, I have unlimited KEI which is nice :D<br />
<br />
Is AC a pretty good place for me to go with this duo or is there something more fun in my future?<br />

AC wouldn't be bad except for all the casters. I box a 65 clr/shm myself and i ot to admit i could never duo for long. the slow DPS of the two classes just grates. I find myself a melee, or pet class to trio with for most grouping unless i'm hardcore AAing in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, the DPS is horrid between the two.  I originally started the Cleric for LDoNs with RL friends, but they are fading from the game.  Right now, I am focusing on the Shaman, and will probably just come back to level the Cleric in Droga or something.  Getting the itchy trigger for transferring my Ranja from Lanys anyway :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A cleric makes a great low maintenace bot for a shaman. No melee positioning to worry about, just stack dots with the shaman and keep canni'ing down and hitting the standup/heal-over-time/sit hotkey on the cleric. Virtually no down-time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly - when my cleric gets the summoned hammer, I was planning on flipping them around and botting the shaman while Meleeing with the cleric.</div></div><hr />
