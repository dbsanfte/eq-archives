<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few months ago, I was happy being lvl 65 with a ~100 useful AA's.  It seems that lately I am having more trouble getting strong xp groups.  I believe that more and more experienced high lvl players ar deciding that it is better to have a (level 65 of course ) beastlord or chanter filling what used to be our prime role.  Don't get me wrong, It is still easy to get lots of groups in BoT, HoH, normal LDoN and etc, But when it comes to GOD trials or Hard LDoN's I find pickup groups hard to come by.<br />
<br />
I do believe I play my shaman well, have decent equipment and spells, and treat others in my groups well.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's not so bad when i can play at hours when more of my guild is online, but lately I'm playing when there are only 8-10 guildmates on.<br />
<br />
Are other lvl 65 shaman finding it tougher to get non guild groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I go /lfg while waiting for a raid group the chances are I will get an offer to grind somewhere. I am fortunate to be elemental flagged so I am happy to sit at C1 or C3 in fire solo'ing, but in your case Ubex I would recommend just chucking up /lfg and go soloing in the pit of tactics (assuming your flags are in line on your magelo). You can get ok xp and the chance of a drop or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What's a non-guild group?<br />
<br />
Also, my guild uses LFG when on raids to quickly fill up groups when we are forming up somewhere.<br />
Usually when I turn on LFG, I get a tell within a minute asking me if I want to go hunt somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you read my post, i noted it's no problem getting groups in zones like BoT or normal LDoN's, and etc, but they get rather repetitive and boring after a bit.  And I can't complain about our abilities in eithe of those zones.  I've been slower and main healer in both LDoN and BoT on occasion.<br />
<br />
And yes, I can solo in tactics and often do while LFG.  But that gets real boring after 10-15 kills.<br />
<br />
But getting a decent group in GOD or as I said even hard LDoN's is getting tough.  I think folks are leaning strongly to Enchanters for slowing in GOD because of pet dps and the ability to rebuff VoQ after deaths, and beastlords in the hard LDoN's because of the dps issue again.<br />
<br />
My issue is: Are we being shoved aside by other classes in the post 65 game( non raids of course)?  Maybe I'm looking at it through personal frustration, but I am begining to feel that way.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against these classes, but feel we are being strongly marginalized in the newer content.  I expect that if i continue raiding ( need to up raid attendence whwn i can), I will see the elementa planes.<br />
But I have heard that the elementals are mostly raid content.<br />
<br />
By non-guild groups, I mean getting groups with the LFG flag rather than guild chat.  I like tp group with my guild when I can, but recent playing times have interfered.</div></div><hr />

Me either... or a pick up hard ldon. I myself just do guild groups and if there isn't anything i can join i'll play my alt bard. To many n00bs out there :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The base answer to your question is yes, with the few exceptions which have been mentioned above.  I have parked my 65 shaman and only bring him out for my guild if they ask.  Beastlords can slow almost as well as we can and groups would prefer them because of the rapid damage they can provide.  Chanters can also slow well enough to satisfy most groups that also feel that their mez for cc and their pet outweigh the difference in slowing percentage and rooting for cc that we can do.  I have created a pally and a necro both of which are now in their mid and upper 50s.  Logging either of these on will generate numerous tells in a very short period of time asking if I want to join a group even without /lfg on.  My shaman can sit for extended periods of time with /lfg on and the only tells are from groups asking for fo7 before they head out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm getting plenty of hard LDoN invites. There's a crowd that likes hards on MithMarr, and perhaps they have trouble with slowers, or perhaps I just got lucky, but I'm loving it. The pace is so fast, I don't have to think about what to do - by the time I malos, slow, toss Q on the puller and cani a little, the next pull is incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">solution:  Dont turn on LFG unless getting ready for a raid....start your own group.  I have np asking friends in guild or not to start groups with me for hard LDoNs (i dont do GoD yet as i dont have the time and am working on getting EP flagged atm).  <br />
<br />
I always have a group within 20 mins of loggin on ready to go because i start my own group, and compared to you my EQ kinda sucks, i dont have as many AA, but.....i have friends and a guild :)<br />
<br />
as was posted above, for anything harder than BoT or reg LDoN BYoG! its the only way a shammy can do anything any more :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can sit for an entire afternoon LFG and get either few, or no offers for grinding xp.  I know I have decent gear, I play quite well (and adapt to situations way too well), and treat people rather well I like tothink also.<br />
<br />
However, it seems that almost at any given time, theres at least 7 level 65 shamans lfg on cazic.  If I'm offered BoT, HoH, Tactics or hard ldon, I'd take it ina heartbeat.  I wouldnt mind normal ldon so much, but they are far tooeasy (IMO) even with me as thehealer and slower (sometimes hairy, but rarely).  Often I lose interest in a normal ldon early, or starrt to doze due to lack ofthings to keep myself busy.<br />
<br />
More often than not, after we finish a raid, I'll mention in guild I am LFG,and flip my neon LFG tag up also.  and proceed to sit for another 2-3 hours bored ot of my mind hoping for any xp group as guild hardly asks me also.  Then again, I tend to often decline PoV invites, get those like no other, but..many bad experiences there...and general hate for the zone itself. <br />
Have a paladin I'm 2boxing, just to get xp when he's 65 so I dont need to worry about always sitting lfg..sigh<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You probably aren't going to get pick up groups for GoD or hard LDoN very easily. I don't think I've ever done those outside of guild or guildies friends. That's probably generally true I would think. Best bet is guildies, if they wont group with you, well.....<br />
<br />
From what I've seen in my guild shammies dont have an unduly hard time. If it's cutting edge stuff usually people take a specific group based on functions and who they are comfortable with. But we've had shaman in those groups too, more so than many other classes thats for sure. In terms of desirability you wont be first, but definitely not last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are two reasons for your recent discovery.<br />
<br />
First reason, yes, chanter is preferred most in GoD because adds are deadly, next maybe Beastlord or Shaman.  Shaman distincts ourselves by our ability to assist heal.  For the role of assist healing, we then compete with druids.<br />
<br />
Second reason is there aren't many pick-up group for GoD because the mobs will rip apart pick-up group very fast.  Not many noobs would go back to GoD after one or two experience.<br />
<br />
If you are referring to GoD trial specifically, shaman can still fill the role of assist healer with a cleric for some trials.<br />
<br />
So you are probably right.<br />
<br />
For some reasons, I am aware of many shamans who do not believe they should be healing much.  Recently, I came to know of a shaman who believed he was right not to mem Tnarg Mending in a raid...I mean, such a shaman should go and play at Luclin or pre-luclin zones and should rightfully find no group in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't get a pickup group for GoD, and I'd be very careful about a pickup group in a hard LDoN too (had a bad experience with one which should have worked on paper, but sucked in reality).<br />
<br />
I do get offered hard LDoN groups occasionally - but that's partly because I'm in a time guild. Mostly people prefer to group with people they know for the more risky stuff like that.<br />
<br />
However, if you really want to do these things, you can always build your own group. I suggest that you get an elemental geared tank and cleric, and start from there.<br />
<br />
There is still a demand for shamans out there for these things, but people go for the ones they know and trust. It's so easy for everything to go wrong with a bad shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I find a huge demand for Shaman myself.<br />
Whenever I do /who all Shaman lfg<br />
I'm suprised to see more than myself, and usually unless it is late night, I get swarmed with tells.  THis is on Xegony, one of the orginal, and thus most crowded servers.  Terms of Shaman functionablity, I have NO idea why people wouldn't want them around.  In a raid situation, slows do help, and enchanters are usually too busy mezzing, and beastlords either afk, or non existant.  We never have more than 1-2 on a raid, and they lack the debuffs to help slows land.  Shamans are also good for backup GRC.  While druids, Pallys and Clerics can all get the spell their attentions are best directed elsewhere.  Terms of a single group, every enchanter i've seen who attempted to do slows + mezzes usually ended up either oom, or with tanks getting raped by unslowed mobs while they mezzed stuff.  If they're coming in singles, sure they could do it but in the clinch they couldn't deliver.  We're useful.  Accept it.  It may be difficult, but accept it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Im currently on the 8th shawl combines and frequently farm drops with LFG up and &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; LDoN on information. Within 10 minutes I will get 3 or 4 BoT groups asking me to join. I now have a /r &quot;Sorry hate BoT - thanks for offer though&quot; HK. Usually get an LDoN pickup within 30 minutes but hardly ever a hard mission.<br />
<br />
The annoying thing is guild hardly ever need me for GoD and Hard adventures - we have chanters who basically do a better job than I can.<br />

I love my Shaman - seems very few others do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's really strange for me. I could be LFG for 30 minutes to an hour sometimes so I get bored and load up the alt to power level. Within 5-10 minutes of playing the alt, I get a tell for the shaman. <br />
<br />
I usually just start up my own groups though. It's not uncommon to see maybe 2 full balanced groups worth of people LFG but nobody ever wants to be the one putting the group together. /shrug Oh well, more leadership points for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">While I haven't done any exp hunting in GoD yet, I get plenty of invites for hard LDoN's (both in and outside of guild groups) so haven't noticed being shoved aside for a beastlord. While I know it's also a bit redundant, I've also been invited to hard LDoN's by enchanters. They usually don't want to be main slower if they're charming a pet and well, having a second healer comes in handy in those situations. While I agree our healing is weak, we still bring a fair amount of tools to the table, so to speak. We just need to be able to adapt to our groups and fill the gaps as best we can. I guess what I'm trying to say is, while there's room for improvement in many of our spell lines, we aren't useless unless we think we are. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Peopel act like pickup groups are the devil.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as GoD goes I think we are being pushed out by chanters.  There are several situations where charm is ungodly powerful in the trials.  That and the fact that for many of us (myself included) lack the healing AA's as well as spells to back up heal hurts us.  I think many groups are trying to get chanters to charm/slow/mez and either druid or cleric as an extra healer.  We are sorta left out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Every new expansion is like this for a bit.  Some class is the odd man out for a bit and then adjustments are made or the class itself adjusts and makes a come back.  I know I am going to go back to AAing to increase my healing AA's and I am sure it will work itself out.</div></div><hr />

Well, as we all know, Shaman are the masters of the PL...I have used mine recently to PL my monk to 65 as well as a BL to 65 and a SK to 53..  I figure my BL will take over my main spot for a while as I wait for things to play out on our spells.  The buffs, slows, heals, DS (potions) all make for some really good PLing..as you all know I'm sure</div></div><hr />

I don't do pickup groups btw, but if I am seen outside an experience zone whether it be BoT, PoP zones, Tactics, Ldon, GoD, I get tells asking. <br />
<br />
As for healing shaman, I find there aren't many these days and that is a shame. I make use of my skills (428AA) as backup healer in ldon and GoD groups, CC (root and VP), dots, and tanking if I need to (equipped Sharkspine Club with 125DD aug) etc. The clerics in my guild basically love me for saving them mana in groups during raids and experience groups. Working the heal spells we have, I can be main healer in some areas in PoP, (C1 in fire, earth entrance and ledge, PoW entrace). I grew up the old way, and find alot of shaman growing up now are mostly PL'd with no idea what it's like to be a shaman. I can talk to some in their 50's now and they don't even know what the canni dance is and I am amazed at how many don't even cann they tell me Kei is enough /bog.<br />
<br />
Not many of us old timer Shaman around, we need more. Yes, we need tweaked, yes Sony has pretty much left us out in the cold on some things, but personally, I would prefer playing my shaman than any other class out there. <br />

<br />
This is on Xegony as well but I find I'm usually having to decline invitations regardless of having lfg tag up or not. Anything elemental + is going to have very few pickup groups anyways since getting to that point requires being in a raiding guild and from what I've seen the people in these guilds tend to stick together. <br />
<br />
The same probably also applies to GoD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Last night I was main healer/slower in my normal ldon group.  Most of us were EP gear with the exception of the WAR ( he was a pick-up rest were guildies ).  I had no problems whatsoever.  Canni V + Canni IV + KEI, and I was rocking.  During our second adventure, KEI ran out and I had to take a 1 1/2 min break to wait for Canni V to pop.  Heh, we were pretty beat up from chain pulls. :P  My friend wanted to keep me focused.  VP was a huge assest as well.  Puller brings too many to camp?  No problem.  VP one of them, and he is out of the picture.  Heck, at one point, I was off-tanking a slowed mob and healing.  *lol*<br />
<br />
As for GoD, I had the opportunity to do trials 2,3, and 4 as well as a named in Vexed.  I was asked to come, and I thought I did a decent job.  <br />
<br />
For trials 3 and 4 the group consisted of:<br />
<br />
WAR, CLR, DRU, ENC, RNG, and SHM ( me )<br />
<br />
For trials 2:<br />
<br />
WAR, CLR, NEC, ENC, ROG, and SHM ( me )<br />
<br />
At one point, we had a few adds and the chanter and cleric died.  I was slowing and healing, and while it would have been nice to have the upgrade, I did not have much difficulty keeping the rest of the group alive.<br />
<br />
For named in Vexed:<br />
<br />
WAR, DRU, NEC, RNG, and SHM ( me )<br />
<br />
Our cleric had to log.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I do not know why most of the posts I read these days is that the sky is falling on Shaman.  Yes, I think there are some areas that need to be worked on, but overall, I am happy with my Shaman, and I will continue to play him til I quit EQ.  I am usually busy all the time - raiding, grouping with friends in EP xp camps, ldon, or even GoD now.  In the past, I never had a super hard time finding groups, and if I did, I would go solo somewhere until I could find something or PL my rogue.</div></div><hr />

I've switched to an alt ENC as my main, almost level 65, and I already feel more useful.<br />
<br />
If you like SHM the way they are, then great.  If not, move to bst or enc, or just cancel.  Too bad over 5mo to go for WoW still.<br />
<br />
I guess this is my little hidden farewall to my shm main on the bottom of a troll thread, heh.<br />

Shammies are not usless.  Im tired of hearing people whine about being usless.  I agree that there are things that need to be changed!  Malos needs to be a lil faster, resist checks on slow a lil higher, pets get a lil lovin and maybe a lil more lovin on the heals.  BUT, shammies are still better than the classes that are trying to out do us.  Bsts cant back up heal like we can, and our slow is still a LIL better, chanters cant back up heal like we can or HP buff (dont count runes).  If you think that only 1 shammy on a raid is enough, you have NEVER raided in PoP.  It takes at least 3 shammies on a raid to be able to keep up with everything, 4 would be optimum and any more is DPS and back up slows when something gets resisted.<br />
<br />
Im in a full EP raiding guild, i have never felt more needed when i am on a raid and there are like 8 active shammies in my guild.  that doesnt mean that they are all on at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Shammies arnt the asset that they once were, oh well...we still rock! doesnt mean we dont need a lil help from SoE though &gt;&lt;  :)</div></div><hr />

I'm really not trying to sound flippant, but when you have those 3 shamans on your pop raids, just how many clerics have you?  Could an enchanter not fill in nicely for any of those 3 'shaman' positions?  Having options is a good thing.  Having an option that is superior most of the time after a certain level of progression isn't.<br />
Pop is not necessarily the problem, its the type of content that was introduced with pop.  Hard hitting, fast encounters just dont play to a shamans strength, but instead highlight our shortcomings.  We need to adapt, but need a few tools to do so.</div></div><hr />

I do think they can be fixed, and they'll probably be fixed. <br />
<br />
Maybe I can play Nik again in 3 months.  That's why he's keeping his equipment.  Its going to take time and hard statistics showing less shaman in game and cancelled accounts for things to happen, I think.  If I'm lucky I will be counted in that statistic.  I daydream that sometimes they put their statistic gathering abilities to other uses than Fippy's facts.<br />
<br />
Also remember this was just my experience I am talking about, not everyones.  If I was in a family guild I don't think I would ever quit my shaman.  I want to participate and be effective in PoP raids, I want to visit GoD, and I want in on LDoN hard missions easily.  In the meantime my enc alt is almost 65 and will meet all of those desires.</div></div><hr />

yeah.. BoT, PoV always want shaman/enc, they can never get ppl to slow for them seems like.  I was slowing this god forsaken PoV NW camp.. I can't imagine why anyone would xp at this NW wasteland camp there except as last resort.. and I was looking for a replacement.  I asked a shaman at one point, and he said &quot;I would rather kill myself than come to pov.&quot;.. I told him &quot;I understand&quot; heh<br />

<br />
Hehe, i have never memed Tnargs for any raid i have been on.  If i am in the healing chain then my guild has some serious healing issues.  Its time to do some MAJOR recruiting for clerics and druids.  Granted we have plenty good healing spells, tnargs isnt one of them.  I still use tnargs durring exp grps, but in a raid, ill Q heal if i am asked to be a backup.  I grp heavily in the planes atm, mostly BoT towers since everthing else requires a flag, and due to me coming from Tallon, and being a pure dark player, i didnt ever get chances to flag on that server.  Now that i am on Stormhammer, i have begun the long process.  But if your guild is having you heal, you need to take that up and get it fixed.  Shams are not meant to raid heal, just patch, and Q is a LOT less mana efficient then tnargs.  <br />

<br />
Not really...and also this is in response to the post above this one as well (Jdt's on pg 1)<br />
<br />
One shammy can do it, but not as well as 3 working as a team.  With 3 you can have the MA's target slowed by 99%, the 3rd shammy could have any adds malos and starting to slow.  all mobs slowed within what...20 secs-ish? chanters are tashing/mezzing and the like, they dont have time to slow as they are busy doing other chanter things.  How does the # of clerics on a raid effect the shammy's job? (in response to Jdt's post)  i was using PoP raids as an example mostly as well because that is what i am raiding atm.  <br />
<br />
in a nutshell:  Yes, shammies need some help, Yes we have been overlooked for a while....if you dont like then dont play a shammy.  If you dont like it, then by all means get the word to SoE.  But PLEASE dont whine about things not goin your way!  all i see is people whining about only getting asked for BoT groups when they have LFG on...easy solution, DONT TURN ON LFG! start your own damn group (yes it can be done i promise)  :)  much love for all my fellow shammies out there :) <br />

<br />
You can get by with 1 shaman on many raids, but that doesn't mean that more aren't useful. I often find myself keeping the group alive while the cleric is in the heal chain.<br />
<br />
One thing I love about raiding is that, as a shaman, my role varies from fight to fight. One fight I will be doing the standard shaman thing of malos/slow, but the next fight I might be healing my group in AE, the next I might be curing dots, etc. There are very few fights where my *only* role is simple debuffing and DPS.<br />
<br />
I'd hate to be doing these same fights as a cleric hitting a hotkey 2 seconds after the previous person hit their hotkey or as an enchanter who, on many a boss mob is pretty much reduced to being a third rate wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Cascet, the number of clerics has no impact other than using up a set # of raid spots.  Just pointing out the real required classes.  Shaman just isnt one of them.  Call it whining if you like, fine.  In general, no class is required but one.  A few spots may require a certain # of enchanters or might require 2-3 warrior tanks, but in general everyone is replaceable.  Pay a shaman to mbg focus and most raids will never miss not having a shaman.  The same thing can be said about any support class.  Once the classes' main job is handled, everyone else is unneeded.<br />
As I've said, having options is great.  I hate having required classes.  However, everyone wants/needs to have a *relevant* role to play.  In the case of shaman(but not just shaman), the opportunity to have that relevant role is diminishing.<br />
The reason why we get so many groups in bot/hot and below?  At that point, people still see shaman as hugely overpowered.  They see well played shamans and think we can do anything.  The problem is, we fall off rapidly in ability to be effective in tougher zones, in any capacity.<br />

Yeah, so is 1 Warrior, 0 Sks, 1 Paladin, etc, etc. <br />
<br />
Admittedly more than 3 shaman do not stack well on most raids, but that doesnt make us COMPLETELY useless. I have been the only shaman on a bunch of raids, though, and its a PAIN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was backup healer, and we had no deaths at all. The warrior isn't our best geared warrior - he doesn't yet hit 10k HP raid buffed. The only buffs we had outside the group were KEI and enchanter haste to start with. We're in a time guild, and all have decent gear, but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
All this talk of requiring uber tanks, or enchanter pets, or 2 main healers - well, I'm beginning to think that people haven't risked trying it.<br />

Having said that, you can have the perfect group in terms of classes and have one muppet spoil it. Skill counts for a lot.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you meant now :)  yeah it sucks a$$ to have one req. raid class (cleric), and it sucks that people see the few shammies who play their class well and assume that since we do such a damn fine job, we MUST be overpowered because we can slow, and MH in BoT &lt;sudder&gt;.  All i can say is i do my job to the best of my abilities and take pride in that i am a Kick a$$ shaman much like many of you :)</div></div><hr />

You do not need any of those. It is just that any of them makes the trial a lot easier. If you played a cleric or druid instead of your shaman and the group would have been much better of.<br />
Replace the Shadowknight with an enchanter and your kill rate will literally triple if not more then that.<br />
You already had a warrior so that part is covered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it matter? My point is that you don't always need what people say you need. We had a shaman online (me) and didn't have an enchanter, or a cleric. We had a warrior who is about 2000 hp off our main raid tanks, but still did it. We didn't stick around waiting until we had those things, we just did it with what we had, and 3 people got flagged as a result.<br />
<br />
I've seen people refuse to go without a main tank type warrior, or without an enchanter, or without a druid or second cleric... My point was exactly that you don't NEED those things, you can do it without, even if it's not optimal. It didn't even take us that long really.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that other things might have been faster, but my entire point is that some people hold out for the optimal, and assume it can't be done without.<br />
<br />
If we'd held out for an enchanter, we wouldn't even have started by the time we actually finished. So, what would you rather do - give it a shot with what you have, and maybe take longer, or hang around for 4 hours waiting for the &quot;right&quot; people.<br />
<br />
So yes, I still think shamans can use an upgrade. I still think enchanter charm pets are ridiculously overpowered, and that it would be good if warriors and clerics weren't so required. But these things aren't the be all and end all of Gates of Discord, there's still room for other people to enjoy it too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You had a warrior and a cleric. The only &quot;power class&quot; you were missing is an enchanter. Would you have tried with a druid instead of the cleric and a paladin instead of the warrior?<br />
<br />
I don't disagree that other things might have been faster, but my entire point is that some people hold out for the optimal, and assume it can't be done without.<br />
If you can do it with a less then optimal group you can do it faster or safer with an optimal group. If the optimal group can barely do it the other group can not at all. So far that is as it has always been and should be. However in previous content there have always been several ideal group configurations, each class being included in at least one of them. This means you have some flexibility - lost a cleric, get a druid and maybe switch the shadowknight for a paladin. Lost a shaman, get a beastlord.<br />
<br />
In GoD the ideal group always includes a cleric and warrior and usually an enchanter. And if you could you would actually prefer adding more of these instead of other classes.<br />
<br />
In PoP druid / shaman / shadowknight / rogue / magician / monk was a fine and balanced group, possible ideal for certain content. You could add a cleric instead of the druid and gains some healing and loose some mana regeneration - that might be a good deal or not, depending on the situation. You could add him for the shaman and loose slows and haste for healing - that would probably not be a good deal.<br />
<br />
In GOD it's a nobrainer. You add the cleric - he can replace both the druid's and the shaman's healing by a large enough amount to make up for the loss of slow, freeing up a group slot for an enchanter who will at least double your DPS. And of course you switch out the SK. Pulling singles is easy, he taunts marginally better then a warrior and he tanks so much worse on nameds he is a liability.<br />
<br />
Can you still do certain content with the inferior group? Yes. Is it balanced against a  group of cleric / cleric / warrior / druid / enchanter / enchanter? No. It is a lot worse. Should it be worse? Certainly not. If anything it should perform a lot better. It does not though.<br />
<br />
This does not necessarily mean that any of the above classes are over- or underpowered overall. That is something for a thorough analysation. It does however mean that certain classes are over- or underpowered in GoD. And the margin is way too high to be acceptable.<br />
<br />
So yes, I still think shamans can use an upgrade. I still think enchanter charm pets are ridiculously overpowered, and that it would be good if warriors and clerics weren't so required. But these things aren't the be all and end all of Gates of Discord, there's still room for other people to enjoy it too.<br />
That would depend on whether you expect to contribute even half as much to a group as one of the above classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Until recently, I'd not felt useless. Ever since dinging 65, I've avoided BoT and PoV like the plague as they really didn't appeal to me.<br />
<br />
Normal LDoNs are nice and relaxing, although I'm not really keen on being the slower and main healer. I can do it, but I'm constantly worrying about what would happen if we had 3 or 4 adds, as I'd die in pretty short order. Level 60 dungeons (of which I've been in a few with guildies) are fine, though -I don't mind being healer and slower in those. <br />
<br />
Hard LDoNs are more of a challenge - I realise I can't realistically act as main healer in those, which does at least mean a more relaxed feel when I accept the group invite. <br />
<br />
GoD is the latest area I've explored, in particular Vxed farming with some elemental flagged raiding guild members. I'm not elemental flagged, and until recently the highest hitting mob I'd seen was a 1015 hitting named in LDoN. I've been fortunate to group with an enchanter (or two  :p ) in there, and the insane damage put out by a charmed pooka - well, it's mindblowing, mobs crumple within 20 seconds or so. <br />
<br />
Then we found a named - I'd expected to Malos, slow, then nuke or patch heal, but no, the suggestion was for me to chain Tnarg's on the (warrior) MT, and not bother slowing. I was sceptical, but it actually worked even if it was draining mana wise. 1400 or so for a heal really isn't much when the mobs are hitting for 1800s, but in conjunction with Supernal Light from the cleric it kept the tank alive. Never before have I been asked *not* to slow, though - it still seems odd.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I scribed Balance of the Nihil, thinking it would help with the Malos, Slow, mob at 20% sort of thing that had been going on before. It doesn't bounce as much as Turgur's, but I've had several mobs where it bounced twice (and then the mob was dead, so I couldn't test it any more). I've also been summoned and died for slowing with Balance when the mob was at 60%, which makes it pretty awkward to know when to slow..... Anyway, after a few deaths it was put to me that slow wasn't even needed, how about I just patch heal instead? Again, less deaths and it did seem to work, but boy did I feel useless.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that without an enchanter things would have been different, but sitting there chain casting Q and spamming Tnarg's when needed isn't the sort of playing style I'm used to.</div></div><hr />
