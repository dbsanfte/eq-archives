<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is just a guess, not an observation of fact or anything just yet, but I believe that the melee changes are going to give more &quot;worth&quot; to a shaman in a non-uber group.  Simply because str, dex, sta, and agi all contribute to a player's endurance pool-- especially when you ferine avatar/boar/wrulan a melee who only has like 100 in each physical stat.  Yes, Wrulan actually has a tiny extra use to it now!<br />
<br />
So although we lost an aspect of acumen, we gained an indirect &quot;buffage&quot; to our buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since this patch, I have been playing my warrior main only.  This is the most fun I have had playing here in I don't know how long.  It is also nice not haing to wait nearly as long to find a group, as we are already getting groups faster.  The melee changes have been a godsend to warriors at least.<br />
<br />
You are absolutely right about shaman being even more desired(at least by me) now.  I have twice now in high DPS LDoN groups without shaman buffs gone OOE(Out Of Endurence) just from using Incite.  As all 4 melee stats add to the endurence pool, having a shaman to buff is a godsend in these groups.  And yes, I am now asking for wrulan, it now does something usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i heard they broke disc's, something like 24hrs to refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, that only happens when your computer clock is set incorrectly I believe.<br />
<br />
Though there may be another cause for it, not everyones disc timers are screwed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I messed around a little with it, long enough to buy the tomes and see that I could indeed pop evasive right after defensive, and that you could click off discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not to nitpick, but evasive and defensive are on the same timer.  You should not be able to chain them back to back.  Unhooking timers was nice tho, as warriors can now tag mob with Incite(400 hate + 70 hate per tick for 10 ticks), hit disc furious (riposte all attacks from the from for 2 ticks), then disc defensive/evasive/stonwall once healing is established.  You can even follow these up with aggesive or precise if another tank moves in when your disc drops(assuming you have enough endurance for all this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, I had a blast this weekend with my warrior.  Probably the most telling part was when I left a pu BoT group after a few hours and there was a 65 sk and 65 warrior LFG...the group said to get the warrior  :cool:   I doubt that would have happened before the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not to nitpick, but evasive and defensive are on the same timer.<br />

<br />
They sure weren't when I tried it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Funky...  They are for me, and have been from day one, but I guess I never actually tried to use both, so maybe they're bugged or listed wrong in the context menus.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's pretty sweet to be able to do furious then pop into defensive or stonewall though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I could not say for sure regarding the defensive disc timer, but using mighty strike made all the rest of the offensive ones unuseable for 25 minutes, so I'm thinking that Stonewall did the same to evasive/defensive. I never had a need to use a defensive timer disc within 10 min of the first one so far since the patch.</div></div><hr />
