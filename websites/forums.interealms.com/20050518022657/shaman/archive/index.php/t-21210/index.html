<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not only got, i still wear mine 'cause im too lazy to take it off.<br />
<br />
I usually make it a sport to click it and try to get the kill shot in groups/raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got mine. I use it soloing still when mana runs low and im waitng for can5 while tanking something. Plus im a lil lazy and after campign a mob for 2-3 hours i get sick of hitting can4 so i wait for the can5 refresh and just click the jbb to keep damage going. Its not that less DPS then BoNife so think of it like that, its a mana free DoT sorta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sold it when i was about 62 to help finance my 63+ spells.  Previous to my selling it sat in my bags for months without a single click.<br />
<br />
Since I got more from selling it than I paid for it 3 years ago, I considered it a good investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still have mine. I can't say that I use it ALL the time, but mana free damage is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That was the only droppable I kept when I quit, I used it so much I just couldn't bring myself to selling it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to use mine on manadrain mobs for a method of doing damage, but haven't used it since I got my sharkspine, since I do 40ish DPS with that, and the JBB is only like 30ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL, Gloriana and I were nuking TT in PoT with ours before we figured out how to deal with her mana drain AE.<br />
<br />
It was kind of like throwing pebbles at an elephant, only less effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">TT isnt bad at all. with 500 MR you can resist her manadeain AE Easily enough. Make sure nobody's shrunk cause the water blocks AE Resists/Mana ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh aye, have one and have happily made a hotbutton for clickin' it, heh. Great for LDON-ing, and for chipping in little itty bitty damage on raids where my spellset is full of debuffs and slows and heals. :) Besides, having a clicky makes me feel cool.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got rid of it shortly after PoP.  Better use of my time against mobs with that kind of hp than wait for such minimal damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got rid of mine at 64, could have ditched it any time after getting Canni5 without missing it but I was emotionally attached.<br />
<br />
Hell, I probably could have ditched it after getting Torpor and Canni4, it's probably more efficient just to toss in a nuke and cann the mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm still wearing mine, but I only use it to farm greens, and I do that less and less these days. I think I'll be bagging it as soon as I get something to replace it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Never owned one. <br />
<br />
Well ... at 62 or 63 (somewhere in there) I looted one but gave it to a younger shaman in the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Still use it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Had 2, sold one, and other is on 57 shaman that rarely gets played.  I occasionally have wished i took it off him, but not that much.  I don't really miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sold mine a year or so ago.  I wasn't using it and its damage is a joke.  mana free damage is good but the JBB just doesn't do enough now; it was godly in the 40s and good in the 50s but now I would never use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's still very useful as a root breaker.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in groups someone will root mobs away from the group so we don't get him by them, but then the mob will be on ground you don't want to fight on because there are too many roamers, it's a steep hill, or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Or sometimes I'll be a puller on a LDON and the same situation will apply -- the group will be ready for the next slowed mob that I've rooted nearby, but I don't want them to have to waste potential DPS and/or medding time by running over to it.  So I blast the root off with a JBB, and the mob comes running in at me.  I take a hit or two, then go pull another.<br />
<br />
This works great on solo too, when you need a mob out of your face for a moment, but then MUST have him over to you right away before he aggros other mobs, and you don't want to be sitting down memming DD's to do it.<br />
<br />
JBB will always be valuable for root breaking.</div></div><hr />

Where is KraksterSlanginbuffs with his comments like &quot;jbb will give you diaper rash&quot; when you need him ;)<br />
<br />
Do you still lurk Krak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Will never sell mine.  Got it pretty much when Kunark came out and a rogue friend of mine wanted the melee ring from MM (long arse time ago) I forced the group to defer to her since I know that was all she wanted.  In repayment she called me over to SRo one day before she ran up to Hate on a raid and handed me the JBB.... at the time they were still insane rare and going for ~70k I think it was, on Tunare.  So I was happy to say the least :)<br />
<br />
I actually use mine all the time but mainly when I'm helping to PL... Gorg pulls trains of slowed mobs back to beat on him.  Then /assist PL_Newb, Bracer boom and lvl 30-40 mobs it takes off ~15-30% health in one blast.  So it just picks up the pace a bit for the little one.<br />
<br />
Just went to BW last night and remember how long I soloed in there with it... on the Greater War Bones (Lvl 44-46) it takes off ~5% per blast.</div></div><hr />

I still disagree that it's useful.  The darn thing takes 9 seconds to cast.  The number of things you could do in the eternity it takes to use the JBB are mindboggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Damn damn damn...I sure do miss mine!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like what, cast a DOT when the mob has 7 seconds to live?  Waste precious time you could be canni'ing by casting a worthless DD?  Healing someone with our lame heals when the group is already keeping people healed just fine?  <br />
<br />
In an ideal killing spree, everyone just kills non-stop.  Shamans are pretty good at keeping that pace up by pulling in slowed mobs and then rooting them or tanking them till ready.  JBB is a great way to have the mob right there, right now, when you've rooted it and need to break the root.<br />
<br />
Even a small amount of running for your assembly line of killers is disruptive of DPS and medding time.  I contribute relatively small amounts of DPS compared to real DPS classes and don't really need to meditate, so if anyone does the running around, it should be me unless the pulls are particularly tricky.  <br />
<br />
The amount of things you can do in 8.3 seconds that are more worthwhile than delivering a slowed mob right into the lap of your main tank are mind bogglingly small, not mind boggling.<br />
<br />
I have the DD and DOT AA's too; but I'm not convinced of the power of either my heals or DD's or DOTs in LDON's or most other content compared to my ability to just pull slowed and/or debuffed mobs into camp and have them ready to go at the group's leisure or immediately.</div></div><hr />
