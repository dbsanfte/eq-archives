<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't know a whole lot about it.  Not looking for something exactly like EQ, just something interesting.  I enjoy the whole StarWars storyline, was just curious what others thought who actually played the game.  Does it capture your attention and more importantly, is it fun and interesting?  Thanks guys and gals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a friend of mine liked it for a few months.. i played it for a little while.. its nothing great in my opinion, and i love starwars games</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone i have spoken to say its boring and buggy. I have no first hand opinion to share though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">depends if you want all the boredom of eq but with none of the charm or personality.  To increase many of the skills you really need to leave you guy logged in and macroing over night (Hi, UO!).<br />
<br />
Despite the graphics and the Star Wars setting, the game has no soul.  At least not in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Terribly boring, lacking high end content, and reeks of UO.<br />
<br />
If you think that (today) UO is the best game in the world, then go play SWG.  You got item decay, macroing skills, etc.  Previous poster got it right, the game has NO soul at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SWG is not a game worth picking up at this point.  I wish it were, it has the most fun potential of any game on the market, IMO, but LucasArts and SOE have really ****ed up a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play it but not often. The real problem is that after you get your toon up to the top of a prefession --- now what? There is little incentive to just go on missions over and over as there is nothing to gain except coin and what it can buy. You can buy a large house and fill it full of stuff and you can start over with a new profession. There are some series of missions but they aren't all that high level. I have a TK (basically monk) Master and there is little that he can't solo.<br />
<br />
What most folks are doing is the STUPID quest to become a Jedi. You have to master 5 professions - problem is you don't know which 5. There are some things you can do to find out 4 of them but not the 5th. So you have to guess, and keep guessing. I had one guy in my guild who ended up mastering 22 professions before his 'force slot' was opened. That is insane!<br />
<br />
They are supposed to add a new quest for Jedi later this year about the time they sell the more planets and spaceships expansion. I may try it again then, as for now I log in for a day a couple times a month and kill storm troopers for faction. Working my way to Rebel Colonel (Captain now).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Read the reviews (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/B00024DW2W/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/002-4574062-1254457?me=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for the SWG expansion pack.  Let that be your guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only other mmorpg i tried which i have to say was worse for me was  Anarchy Online. Star wars galaxies is a horrible piece of s--t. Boring and horrible feels empty liek somebody said before no soul. there is no real sense of life to the world or purpose to what you are doing. Add item decay and a 100% player driven economy and u got a HUGE pile of s--t.<br />
World of Warcraft is gonna go into open beta this year. Wait for that i hear it is far more polished than any mmorpg that has gone gold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vanexx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you want to play a Star Wars themed game, play Knights of the Old Republic Its single player but best SW game to date easily..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Theres a 14 day free trial on gamespot and fileplanet. I'm going to try that soon and see how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i heard its boring as hell, also u lose ur buffs when u log off, fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most of us beta testers didnt stay past the free month. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Played for about 2-3 months, in that timer I completely mastered Artisan and Weaponsmith, raked up more cash than I knew what to do with, and killed the most powerful mobs in the game with some friends.<br />
<br />
Eng-game content is really lacking; character progression stops very early on as there's nothing to do once you've spent all your skill points, and 99% of your gear will be purchased from crafters so there's little demand to raid mobs for anything other than modifier components to give to your local friendly crafter.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, its probably great for more casual gamers. The graphics are lovely, character customisation is amazing (facial features, clothing etc), and SWG is after all Star Wars. Some of the planets are very nicely made with sunsets and sandstorms that are really engaging. But its all fluff to me, the core gameplay is what I look for.<br />
<br />
SOE have been planning a massive reworking of the entire combat system, a first-hand admission that its not working at the moment - yet somewhat mind-bogglingly, this has been postponed until after the expansion is release. Money grabbing at its finest IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i beta tested it found as the above did.<br />
<br />
nice idea just no soul<br />
<br />
so the day it when live i deleted all the files and when back to EQ and porn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i would recommend that you try the free 14 days to check it out.  most of the people that say they don't like it are basing their opinion of the game when it first went live (very buggy and very shallow content).  i was just like many of the other people (played when released, then dumped), but have thought about trying it again.  it was a lot of fun for a short time, then it got boring fast.  i had master chars on several servers.  my favorite char was a cross between a pistoleer and a bounty hunter (pistol specialization).  i played as a rebel and loved to take out entire zones of star boys.  it used to make people mad, but it was fun.  it has been long enough now that there is probably a lot more content in the game now (especially with the expansion).  <br />
A side note is that i think it will give you some idea of where eq2 is going.  it appears to be a cross between eq and swg.  it is worth the free 14 day trial.  you can become a master of something in 14 days if you play a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SWG sucks. played it for a few months, and realized there is exactly zero depth.<br />
<br />
i actually got EQ for the first time after leaving that game (got SWG at launch), and am so much happier it's beyond words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The driving force for me playing SWG would have to be this...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most of us beta testers didnt stay past the free month. YMMV.<br />
/em raises hand<br />
<br />
Count me in that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well I was in beta and continued playing it until October after release.  At that point the friends I was playing with started leaving so I came back to EQ.  I played it a bit more this past spring while I was doing alot of things around the house and with the family as it was easier to log on and play for short periods of time. <br />
<br />
Yes the game has changed alot but in the end once you master your desired profession(s) and hit the few Themparks (large quests kinda like epics but with no real reward) there isnt anything left to do.  What I think the game misses most of all is a reason to do the themeparks.  There arent any uber item drops or what have ya except for the occasional companent used by crafters.  <br />
<br />
To sum it all up picture EQ if you could max your levels and AAs out in 1 or 2 weeks and there was no reason to go on raids.  Thats pretty much where SWG stands now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Put it this way....I'd rather watch grass grow than play this.<br />
<br />
Play a FPS game until WOW comes out :d<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bf1942 (or the Desertcombat mod) is a good time killer<br />
Unreal tournament 2004 is also a good one.<br />
