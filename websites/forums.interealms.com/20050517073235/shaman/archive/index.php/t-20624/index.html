Running a radeon 9700p.  Anyone else notice anything similar?</div></div><hr />

I've noticed very little change personally, using the GeForce ti4200 w/the new drivers. I think the change most benefitted the cards put out over the last couple years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't tried the bazaar yet but on my second machine (althon 1200 and geforce 4 4200) there was a noticable improvement on raids. Things are much more playable on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still get graphics lag when I am around a lot of people.  Seems the problem is when I first get around a large group, then I am fine till the next new large group.  <br />
<br />
I run with all the new models, clip plane way out, and use a GeForce 4 MX card with the latest drivers.  Dunno what the deal is.  But since it's been that way, I never bothered to complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did the same thing last night . . . but I suspect that it was because there were only 13 traders.<br />

I think this person simply experienced an empty bazaar zone for the first time.</div></div><hr />

the bazaar was around 500 traders.</div></div><hr />

there's a difference between being able to run directx9 video games and having a video card that is fully directx9 compatible. The 4200 isnt a dx9 video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is a major difference in crowded zones with DX9.<br />
<br />
Framerate is greatly improved everywhere.<br />
<br />
I have a Ti-4800</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I turned all my settings to max, clip plane max, spell particles max, and player names all and tried the bazaar. Had some choppiness, but less than I used to with names at 1 and lower settings, and the bazaar was far from empty. This is with a Radeon 9200.<br />
<br />
One other thing I noticed was players names are smaller, and so is the particle effect on our spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree, my Radeon 9600 pro framerate looks great with the new engine.  I have turned on all new models now, and run with spell effects on when not on a raid.  Very nice.<br />
<br />
BTW http://www.pricewatch.com lists a Radeon 9600 128MB card for $60.  This implements the DX9 renderer in hardware, correct?  I think a lot of people are under the mistaken assumption that you have to buy a $300 Radeon 9800 or a $200 GeForce 5900 to get these benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jeez...I only have a Radeon 9000pro evil commander and I can walk around the bazaar with the clip plane at 100% w/ only a little lag.  Card only costed $59.</div></div><hr />

Had no idea cards were this cheap now, guess I'll upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The patch radically improved framerate on both my computers (one has a GF3 and the other a Radeon 9600).  The difference in the bazaar is just incredible.</div></div><hr />

The 5900 he's talking about is the 5900XT, or SE, same card, depends on who makes it, it not a full blown 5900, uses regular DDR ram instead of DDR2 ram,  bought mine for $188 US from newegg. Mine is made by MSI. <br />
and overclocked very nicely,  I by no means have an uber system, AMD 2500 barton, 1 gig pc 3200 ram on an ASUS a78nx deluxe mobo. a very middle of the road system nowadays. using aquamark 3 benchmark utility, I am getting an overall score of about 40000, which isn't bad at all.  The 5900xt is about the best buy around right now, in a high(er) end card, you can overclock it to where it very close to an non-overclocked GEforce FX 5950, or a Radeon 9800, cards that cost about twice as much.<br />
  Nice card for the money, runs EQ great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other system specs:<br />
Win XP Home<br />
AMD Athlon 1300+ (1.3 GHz)<br />
Asus A7A266 motherboard<br />
512 MB RAM<br />

I would guess the 64 megs of RAM? I don't think the processor is helping much either.</div></div><hr />

60 fps with no one in same area. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a Gladiac 64 and kept wondering why since the patch my performance is worse.  Talked with a computer friend and he told me this which might explain some problems with folks with older video cards.<br />
<br />
Theres a diffrence between dx9 compatable and dx 9 compliant.<br />
dx9 compatable alot of the video perforamance is actually being handled on the computer side thus using more memory.<br />
<br />
dx9 compliant means the majority if not all video performance is being handled by the card thus freeing up resources.<br />
<br />
Time for me to upgrade to.<br />
