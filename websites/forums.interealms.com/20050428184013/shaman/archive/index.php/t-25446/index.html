<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So basically i'll start with my question. Do any of you play eq style in instances? Meaning the warrior/pally tries to get all aggro?<br />
<br />
See i joined a group. I had been having some good luck with them. Today started off wierd with alot of pets and just everyone pet tanking or tank tanking. Was two pallies and the rest hunters/warlock. No one is talking but no one is dying either. <br />
<br />
So one leaves a few minutes into it. Just hearts out, so we bring a pretty high pally in. Who starts to bark out orders. Saying let me get all aggro and wouldnt you know it the deaths from the same mobs started happening. <br />
<br />
One thing that amazes me in this game is how many pallies die with full mana. Having a main healer doesnt mean only healer. But i digress. <br />
<br />
Ive liked wow and being able to have people offtank and not be a big deal yet. I'm lvl 52 so i dont know how it will be in the next level instances but THIS One zal something or other off of tanaris I can keep myself alive agaisnt the normal elite mobs without to much hassle. Was wierd going from the hectic pettanking people tanking and moving through to the eq style and people dying. The group ended when plate shoulders that bind on pickup dropped and the last hunter rolled and won by accident lol. <br />
<br />
I wont get into the details just was more and wasnt the best day. But I was having fun til we went to the eq style of one tank. Does it get like that in the highest dungeons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Paladins have to work hard to get aggro. Which (as Mill said iinm) is ironic since they are so damned hard to kill.  And yes, many Paladins flat out SUCK. Yo dude - that blue bar MEANS something. Cast a spell once inwhile.<br />
<br />
Each group finds its way.  When I did the instance you are talking about we EQ'ed it. But we had a strong group (2 x Paladin, 1 x Mage, 1 x Rogue, 1 x Druid) and the Druid was a designated MH.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can sorta &quot; all solo &quot; which is chaotic.  However, the bottom line is:<br />
<br />
If it's stupid and it works - it isn't stupid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Today I went through SM on my mage.<br />
Our group was<br />
me - 38 mage<br />
39 mage<br />
42 paly<br />
41 paly<br />
39 hunter<br />
We did it pretty much traditional eq style, as much as you can with 2 paladins being the main healers.<br />
On the normal trash pulls, I was sheeping the left of a group of 3 mobs, while the other mage would sheep right.  Made for very effective crowd control and pulling of &quot;singles&quot;.<br />
On the bosses the higher paladin would be the tank while the other one was main healer, while the other 3 of us would do range damage.<br />
We only had 1 bad situation where we got something like 3 wizards on a pull on the last dungeon (go go arcane explosion!) and had 3 of our group members die.<br />
<br />
Traditional eq style will work, as long as your tanks *know what they are doing* to get aggro and hold it.<br />
High damage output weapons help *immensely* in this regard.<br />
Partying with a warrior and paladin in the last 2 days that both were wielding 30-35 dps weapons held aggro very well.<br />
They were also people that played lots of EQ or other MMO in the past so they knew what they were doing well.<br />
It was very difficult for me to take aggro.  I could do it, but it wasn't easy, and I wasn't trying to very often either.<br />
<br />
If it's stupid and it works, it's still stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find that the traditional single tank aggro does not work as well in wow. There is very little crowd control available and offtanking seeems to work best. With a single tank trying to hold multiple aggro the healer will get all the adds after a couple heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The healer getting adds is definitly true. <br />
<br />
But, a good warrior can hold stuff on him pretty well if he knows what he is doing and has a good weapon.<br />
<br />
Our regular group has a warrior and paladin and if the paladin has the Seal thingy that heals me (thief) on every hit then the paladin can easily achive aggro lock due to that things healing counting as his aggro. Gave the warrior fits till we figured it out. So the warrior swapped to duel weilding bezerker stance and help dismember things. <br />

huh i'll have to look into that seal. Ive thought about using it more but its been funny but every group ive been in since i play odd hours at times has been pally centric. Ive seemed to always be the second highest pally not matter what so ive been doing the healing and add tanking at times when needed. <br />
<br />
Was just a frustrating day. Landed in tanaris and was getting spammed by a priest who wanted to duel me. I finally after declining 10 times took it and beat him. Than his warrior friend was hounding me so i went into this group irritated as it was and things just kept getting worse lol. I defintely dont mind single tanking when its fitting into place. BUt when people die with full blue amongst other stuff .....<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to get different group setups ive yet to group with a rogue , druid , warrior or priest. Not been by choice either i never ask who's in the group when i join for a quest or an instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have 3 pallies in my crew and this is how we handle big pulls. I main tank which also means I pull because I want initial aggro.  Also, I'm spec'd pure DPS because we're light on damage and it seems to hold aggro better than aggro seals/spells (sadly).<br />
<br />
- I pull a crowd to the crew which is hanging back<br />
- I do damage to mob #1 on incoming<br />
- I drop AE on crowd when at rest of crew<br />
- pally #2 picks a mob, gets aggro, fires off his AE then assists me<br />
- pally #3 picks a different mob, gets aggro, fires off his AE then assists me<br />
<br />
At this point dmg is spread among 3 tanks, all mobs not being offtanked are on me due to my AE going off first.  Offtanks are responsible for healing themselves, priest concentrates on me and only flash heals offtanks in emergencies.<br />
<br />
We've had no problems with this so far, in fact it's worked great even on huge pulls (6-8) of elites.  Any time the priest manages to get heal aggro one of us hits priest w/ invul shield and he just heals to his heart's content in complete safety.<br />
<br />
We also keep blessing of salvation (35% aggro reduction) on the priest/rogue at all times, but I never use the aggro seal unless I'm worried about dropping aggro on a boss mob.  However, we solved that pretty handily by letting me tank the mob for awhile solo with a heal chain going so I have solid aggro lock and heal aggro is spread among 2 other pallies and a priest.  This has worked really, really well so far. We'll see how far we can milk this crew.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the novel.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe not a novel at all Iz. Why i was asking like to hear what other people are doing. <br />
<br />
Like i alluded too the pickup groups been very tank/pally oriented and were naturally more multi tank/side tanking going on. <br />
<br />
The one time ive tried to do the more traditonal MT as much as possible it went bad. But looking back think it was just one of them days that get thrown out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in a small UBRS raid yesterday with 3 warriors tanking roughly pulls of 4-5 58-61 elites at a time while the mages AE'ed them down with the rest of the people just beating down random mobs.  Warriors held aggro fine and mages never died, so I guess that is considered EQ style :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sounds like AE'ing at its best, to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't group often with warriors but they seem to have the tools for gaining and holding agro on a group of mobs. <br />
<br />
Paladins, on the other hand, suck at grabbing agro. My regular group is paladin/rogue/druid (only in the mid 30s) and we had a helluva time with heal agro. Pally tanking, my rogue doing damage and the druid healing meant a dead druid on almost every big pull or even when fighting a single high level mob (5+ levels higher). <br />
<br />
After one particularly bad night where the druid seemed to die to heal agro every 30 minutes we took a step back and had some long discussions on how to deal with the problem. Around 30th level, we basically threw all our strategies out the window and started from scratch. Took us longer than it should have to figure things out, we were too set in our ways from EQ. <br />
<br />
My rogue hung up his dual maces and respecc'd from combat to sublety talents. For the first 10 or 15 seconds of a 3 pull, I'll now cut the incoming DPS by more than 2/3. Druid shifts to bear form on a rough pull, her first priority is just to survive the inital rush. The paladins's job is just to stay alive, keeping agro naturally follows from that since the paladin is healing herself to stay up. <br />
<br />
So, the paladin will use about half a mana bar initially to heal, then the druid can shift out of bear form (still with a full mana bar) and take over main heals or switch to nuking. <br />
<br />
It works like a charm but it certainly isn't your standard EQ way of doing things. ... and just to add, damn those Paladins are tough! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My bro can lock down 3 mobs about 100% and 4-5 a good amount with his warrior. They have the tools for great agro if used right. <br />
<br />
I do end up tanking if I have to spam heal though, but isn't too bad unless its a dual wielder which tend to tear me apart. Anything else I can just HoT and deal like I did in the pre 500 dps mob days in eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anything else I can just HoT and deal like I did in the pre 500 dps mob days in eq.<br />
Yeah, it's weird not getting 3 rounded on dungeon trash like I used to on my EQ sk in hard LDON runs.  It's nice that I'm actually able to take a drink while fighting vice having to be white knuckled over the keyboard since I was typically 3 secs from death at all times.  I far prefer many mobs as a CC/aggro challenge vice 1 mob with a dps/healing challenge.  Way more fun for everyone involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, since after a month or so away from the boards, I already broke the seal on another thread, I guess can respond to some of this.<br />
<br />
First off, if you've never played a warrior, please refrain from stating how easy it is for warriors to get aggro.  Aggro control and rage generation have been and still are the greatest issues plaguing the warrior since the nerf in OB.<br />
<br />
Single mob, sure I can get aggro, IF, I do the following:<br />
+ battle stance<br />
+ charge (generates about 12 rage)<br />
+ demoralizing shout (people say generates threat, I have my doubts about how much)<br />
+ berserker stance (down to about 5 rage now, not enough for an immediate special move unless I connect hard with a 2h weapon on my first swing)<br />
+ bloodrage (generates more rage per hit/getting hit supposedly)<br />
+ sunder armor (AC debuff, supposedly generates the best threat for warriors)<br />
+ sunder armor again<br />
+ sunder armor again<br />
+ etc... <br />
<br />
And all this relies on the shamans not using their most threat generating nuke (I think this is their highest damage one so they ALWAYS use it and get aggro) and that no one needs healing because the threat per heal ratio is incredibly high.  Oh yeah, and no nukes.<br />
<br />
Against more than one mob, I can demoralizing shout (since it's an AE) and then if I get enough rage, do some AE attacks to try and keep attention on me.  If someone whacks another mob, he is now the offtank.  I have no way of getting aggro back on that mob.<br />
<br />
Obviously I'm not a defense spec'd warrior.  Even if I was, taunt gets aggro for oh, about 1 second before the mob goes back to what it was doing until after the 10 second cool down I can taunt again.  <br />
<br />
If the mob is 2 levels above me?  Forget it.  Miss rate is so high and if I can't hit it, I'm not generating rage enough to do any special moves to piss it off.<br />
<br />
Solo?  Yeah, warrior is pretty good.  I have no problems on mobs 1-2 levels higher usually.  2 or 3 mobs my level or lower, yeah, I can probably do that too.<br />
<br />
But aggro generation and rage in groups, fighting tough mobs, warriors have a hard time.  Yeah, I might be the last one standing, only because the rest of the party already got aggro and died.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, on the Horde side with a warrior tank, you will have a hard time trying a classic EQ MT type group.  Most people are too idiotic to control their aggro and the WoW warrior has no current way to counter this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have no idea what the game is like past lvl 35 content (I'm not lvl 35, but the content is all pretty much the same to that point, I've seen it), but up to this point I prefer tanking as a shaman, especially if I have a handy priest who knows how not to overheal.  In the horde on my server the shaman are a common class selection so I usually end up with a couple in every group.  Getting aggro is easy with rockbiter and occaisionally earthshock, holding on frostshock on low health mobs if they tend to run.  I'm usually fighting pallies, not playing with them, so I have no clue how well they generate aggro, and I've seen some impressive warriors, but generally every group I've played with off tanks rather than doing slower EQ style MTing.  For aggro, it's so easy for shaman to hold it and at my level, it's pretty easy to survive it with a good priest, passable gear and a little knowledge (alchemy helps ;)).</div></div><hr />
