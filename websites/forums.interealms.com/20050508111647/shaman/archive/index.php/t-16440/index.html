<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically a few days ago i started to notice that browsing interent extra my refresh rate has gone to ****. By that i mean when scrolling down web pages it takes time to refresh the next area of the webpage so its all jump (inc on message boards). Also while typing the buffer seems to have gone to ****, i can type about 6 words and not see anything on the screen for a few seconds which is annoying. <br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea whats going on? (tried boot disk)<br />
<br />
PS I know jack**** about PCs so make it as simple as possible. Runnig 98SE, 700 AMD Duron, 320mb RAM, Geforce 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Open internet Explorer. Click on Tools, then Internet Options. Click the Delete Cookies button, then click the Delete Files button, check the box next to Delete all offline content, then click okay. <br />
<br />
That will clear your cache, and if it's gone unchecked for a long time it can effect your browsing speeds. Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Right-click on MY COMPUTER, right-click on each of your hard disk partitions, select PROPERTIES-&gt;TOOLS-&gt;Defragment to defrag the drives.  Do it to all the drives.<br />
<br />
Open your calendar (paper or online) and put an item in to do this again in a month.  And a month after that.  etc.<br />
<br />
Run Windows Update.  Take all critical updates and any Recommended Updates that seem to apply (like DirectX and Internet Explorer updates).<br />
<br />
Get a virus checker, update it to the latest, and do a thorough scan.<br />
<br />
Get rid of ALL extraneous programs that run at startup except a virus checker.  AIM/ICQ/MSN, popup stoppers, little search toolbars, archivers/unpackers, etc etc.  Boot and notice how fast and smooth everything is.  Add the ones you use most back one at a time once you determine you really can't live without them.  Consider invoking the programs you use manually when you need them instead if possible.<br />
<br />
If those don't work, wipe the machine and reinstall Windows.  Seriously.  Windows installations rot over time and run slower and slower.  Better to shoot them and put them out of your misery, then start fresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">weissblau sounds like a computer tech :)  Take his advices its the same thing I do on a day to day basis.  that said in the current envirmoment prolly a viral thing so many of the buggers out atm chokin CPU cycles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye...computers don't clean themselves.  It's amazing how many programs install themselves in your startup and run in the background.  You don't even know they are there.  With Win98 hit cntl+alt+del and a list of programs comes up.  I think Windows only requires 3 or 4 of those to run properly.  The rest (in the most part) is crap.  If you have installed Real Player and grokster (or the like) then you have lots of stuff running without your knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Goto Start:Run: then type and run: msconfig<br />
<br />
Goto the startup tab within msconfig, and uncheck EVERYTHING. You can selectively re-add things later, but this will show you how well your computer will run when its clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check drivers too, update them if possible. If you keep a clean PC, you should never run in to any real problems, have a pc from three years ago, which is old really, original win98 installation is great.<br />
<br />
But it does likely sound like system resources are being suckered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ommar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Download Spy-Bot or Ad-Aware, freeware spyware removal tools... found numerous data miners on system and in the registry.  After removal, my internet access through a Linksys router went from avg 45kb upload to 120kb on a cable connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Careful with some those Adware removal protection programs.  I have run into a few that when I desided I didnt much care for that refused to completely remove themselves.  Blasted things kept poping up windows telling me I should install them to protect my system from annoying ads.  Blasted thing would not go away and would not stop my pop up problem.  Had to Format my hard drive in the end.  Wish there was just a way to send all those blasted ad ware back on the companies that create them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah,  Chazic, I know what you mean, but then those companies would know better than to install their own software :)<br />
Ad-Aware and SpyBot are the two best out there right now, and they don't cause problems with the system like some of the others are known to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I use Ad-Aware.  Got rid of Gator on a system for me after it kept re-installing itself when I tried to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">P.S. I'm not a professional computer tech, but I have five PC's at home, some of which are used by my kids, and I get to maintain them and clean up after their messes, so I guess I'm an amateur tech.  I'm a software developer by trade, which is a very different field than maintaining computers but does have some relevance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ommar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chazic:  Sounds more like a popup stopper program...but they are a necessary evil and a god send sometimes.</div></div><hr />
