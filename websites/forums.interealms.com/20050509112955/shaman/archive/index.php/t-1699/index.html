<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail Shaman-<br />
<br />
Almost 60 (like 2 blues) been dragging my feet because I dont have torpors, malo, voice, avatar etc... just focus.  <br />
<br />
I really think being 60 w/malo and torpors would make me be 3x as efficent on raids but I am a tailor (200~ish) and burn all my cash on that and really really really dont want to save up and then pay 80k for these two spells... I have my VP key minus the trak tooth but no one goes to VP on my server.. juggs raids got me Bane but no 59-60 spells... I heard Guardian Wurms outside VP were an awesome awesome supply of 55+ spells, esp 60 spells and am wondering on strategy on these.<br />
<br />
One guy told me a group could handle them.. but I was researching them and it said they hit for 550.. anyone here have any tips?   I want to know a few things like:<br />
<br />
1) do guardian wurms summon?<br />
2) can they be single pulled w/o (or even with) harmony?<br />
3) can one group of 58-60's do it? or 2 groups? or 3 groups of 53-60s?<br />
4) Is it safe to set up at the vp door and pull to there? do they see invis and is that out of aggro range?<br />
5) Spell resists?<br />
6) Anyone confirm that they hit for 550?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also- <br />
Any one finish the ring quest in Plane of Air since they upped the stats on the rewards?  <br />
Does it still have 2 charges of Feign death on it? <br />
and is it rechargable by level 5 mana batteries? <br />
Whats cast time on ring?<br />
<br />
This item is #1 on my want list over Lodi shield and Vindi BP etc.. esp on harder mobs that take 3-8 casts of turgurs to stick... could just FD to lose aggro.  <br />
<br />
and lastly-  Someone said that the focus nuke bracer works on weapon procs.. does this work w/the barbarian spiritualist hammer as well? if so whats the best proc anyones got with this?  Been working on my 2hb i take 3 swings then click JBB and i get double 263's all the time after bracer goes off.<br />
<br />
Sorry if these have been covered before.. i went thru a couple weeks' posts but gave up after an hour or so.. and all the places i've found info on guardian wurms almost all the posts are people arguing that the guardian wurms inside vp hit for more than the ones outside..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regarding GWurms:<br />
<br />
1) Yes<br />
2) Assuming that you don't pull them from a group of GWurms that are side by side or touching, yes.<br />
3) Yes, I've done it with three people<br />
4) Hmmm, as long as you avoid aggro from the elder wyverns guarding the entrance, yes.  But I would find a spot along the zone wall.<br />
5) At 60, I get some resists.  I ALWAYS lead with Malo, just in case.<br />
6) Ohhhh yes, hehe.<br />
<br />
Also, they don't always drop a good spell.  We killed one a few days ago that dropped like Words of Odus or something . . . lame :/<br />
Still hoping Torpor will drop off one of those suckers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Broder Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I was 59, I was with a group that killed guardian wurms (2 of them). The group consisted of 5 members.<br />
<br />
60 Necro<br />
59 Monk<br />
59 Shaman<br />
56 Cleric<br />
55 Wizard<br />
<br />
I was able to land slow every time, Bane of Nife and epic. Thank god for the cleric I was getting beaten up pretty good. <br />
<br />
The next time we tried, I was 60 and  let monk gain more agro and it went much more smoothly. I also had torpor this time. We did get 4 kills with no deaths. Spell drops were Malosini (lol), Tigirs Insects, couple of good druid and cleric spells forget which. In my opinion, it definitely is doable with one group. <br />
<br />
Yep they hit for up to 550, I wasn't summoned but I was always right in the fight too. We pulled to half way between entrance to VP and the OT zone. BTW, the necro pulled not the monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a semi Expert on those bastards. (68 Down zero shaman spells.)  <br />
<br />
I feel comfortable saying that you may want to get a Jumpy/Protector raid first. (It is what I will be trying to do)<br />
<br />
The Guardian Wyrms (afterwich refered to as scumsucking bastards) can and do double hit for 550. But the Scumsucking Bastards are able to be done with a single group. <br />
My Normal group is 2 warriors (57 and 55) A cleric (60 now, was 53 when we started) Myself (Level 60 was 53 when we started) a ranger, and Sometimes a chanter. (54)<br />
<br />
We once tried one with me A 57 Cleric (Same one) a level 46 ranger and the 54 warrior. (damn that was a fun fight. We had em but I was so excited I forgot to reslow and we died)<br />
<br />
I have a Ranger spotter Lead out and track to them then I pull with Malosini (Now malo!! Woo!! Thanks Kalrie for the fine fine gift !!) <br />
<br />
I then run like hell away from said cursed Scumsucking Bastard Leading to the Party. Once I get close to the party I then Slow the Scumsucking Bastard If you do so from max range and are quick about it you can avoid being hit but most of the time I take a little tickle from em. <br />
<br />
Once I get back to the Party I root the Scumsucking Bastard And let the tank Build aggro. Then I start dotting the Scumsucking Bastard Like no tomorrow and start chanting drop a friggen spell... (Kidding on the chanting part, it is more like a mumble)<br />
<br />
Once the Scumsucking Bastard is killed I then console myself to another heart crushing denial and Look for another. Once we run out of Guardian wyrms I then prostrate myself in front of the Random Number generator plying it with Rum and chickens blood praying fervently that next time I will get lucky so I never EVER have to kill another one of the Scumsucking Bastards  <br />
<br />
<br />
(Twitch, Twitch, Damn this is making me get angry now)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done quite a few guardian wurms with the guild actually....and to me the hardest part is actually FINDING them up.  I believe they are 8 hour spawns, so they are kind of hard to come by.<br />
<br />
I'll try to answer your questions below. Every time I've fought them, I've used my monk....who is only lvl 52.  I am usually the puller as well.....of which one time I had to pull across the entire zone (that was a fun one) :)<br />
<br />
1) do guardian wurms summon? <br />
 -- yes, they do. you have to do some dmg to them first though.  maybe ~300+ before they actually summon you.  I was able to wack one for about 100, then pull it across the entire zone w/out being summoned.<br />
<br />
2) can they be single pulled w/o (or even with) harmony? <br />
 -- They are usually single just walking around in the zone. you can just walk up to one, wack it, and run like mad :)  Usually have to walk them back to camp though...they aren't all that fast and will lose interest if you get too far out of range.<br />
<br />
3) can one group of 58-60's do it? or 2 groups? or 3 groups of 53-60s? <br />
 -- Well, put it this way....this is the latest group we did it with:<br />
60 war<br />
56 cler<br />
45 cler<br />
54 sham<br />
52 monk<br />
53 monk<br />
    That's it!  We were really happy with being able to take one down with the above group. The key was the Shaman slow and the warriors Defensive Disc.  You will probably need to chain CH the MT until a slow is landed.<br />
4) Is it safe to set up at the vp door and pull to there? do they see invis and is that out of aggro range? <br />
 -- Hmm, just got to this question and assume that you are talking about the guardian wurms INSIDE VP..   oops :)  they are the exact same thing as the ones outside from what I&quot;ve heard, so hopefully some of this info will be helpful :)<br />
5) Spell resists? <br />
 -- not sure, but our lvl 54 shammy never really has a problem landing a slow.  Be prepared to die in about 5 secs once you DO land one though.  hehe<br />
6) Anyone confirm that they hit for 550? <br />
 -- yep, they sure do.  Put it this way.....our lvl 60 warrior using his def disc went down in about 10 seconds because the cleric didn't get the first CH off in time.  VERY VERY nasty hitters.  The key word here is SLOW.....land that and you are golden.  They do  have a ton of HPs as well.  Very fun fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I qualify to talk about guardian wurms.  78 kills no usefull spells for any class that was present for a kill.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you are looking making way to much out of killing them.  Get a normal exp group together, preferably with a tracker, find a spot with few adds, pull and kill.  I prefer the north wall of the zone. Around the statue thing there is a little plateau that you can pull to.  They are extremely easy to slow with no debuffs, and all you really need is a cleric and a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;1) do guardian wurms summon? &quot;<br />
<br />
Yes.  But only when damaged, just like 99% of the summoning mobs out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;2) can they be single pulled w/o (or even with) harmony? &quot;<br />
<br />
If you have two, root one.  They stop following after a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;3) can one group of 58-60's do it? or 2 groups? or 3 groups of 53-60s? &quot;<br />
<br />
One group, hell probably Warrior + Shaman + Cleric + mana regen can do one.<br />
<br />
&quot;4) Is it safe to set up at the vp door and pull to there? do they see invis and is that out of aggro range? &quot;<br />
<br />
Better off setting up along the wall to avoid roamers.<br />
<br />
&quot;5) Spell resists? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Low resists.  Best way to pull them is: Malosini, root, slow.  Then bring to group and let group kill em.<br />
<br />
&quot;6) Anyone confirm that they hit for 550? &quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, they hit for about that much.  Easiest thing to do is to not get hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, if you have a balanced group of 58 to 60, you are a hell of a lot better off going to Sebilis and ganking Jumpy/Protector.  With the new changes to Glamour of Kintaz that encounter got really really easy.  I'm pretty sure you can still do the lev and sneak around Jumpy trick so that you can pull the protector and jumpy into the lair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">80k for these two spells<br />
<br />
malo buy itsself is fetching 100k+ on Xev. <br />
<br />
lol, Malo - the new everquest lotto.<br />
Loot a spell, twink an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">War/Cler/Shaman is plenty to do em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ok cool.. I usually dont like seb just because of the time involved in getting to the juggs.. and the usual debate weither to stay at King or not.. and if you dont have a porter you have to fight your way out (although the portal by the shrooms is a wonderful thing).. however.. killing in seb does sound more appealing than tackling mobs that hit for 550 and that there might only be a few up every 8 hours.   I'll go look at protectors again..<br />
<br />
How many protectors are there? and is it right next to juggs so if you had a rogue you could go back and forth all you wanted while you waited for protectors to repop.. and if trak is up are Tolapumj and the protectors before or after trak.. have only been on a few raids that had a rogue to get past door in juggs and forget.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the info.. if i get a good group maybe i'll go wax any guardian wurms that are up and then go to seb.. and bring a druid since they can hop to SF and EJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is 1 protector.  He spawns every 3ish 4ish hours or so.<br />
<br />
The protector is in the middle of the juggs in trakanons lair,  along with tolapumj.  Normally people pull the protector before trak, then trak, then tolapumj.<br />
<br />
GW's hit for 550, but don't let that bother you.  They are easy to slow, and once slowed, they don't hit that much.  I tend to pull them most of the time, and I pull with slow.  If I am not careful (i'm not) I end up tanking them for a good third of the fight, and the cleric has no problems keeping me alive, so any melle should be able to do it just fine.  <br />
<br />
By the way, the protector hits for over 400, and he is alot harder than guardian wurms in my opinion, just because of the pull and the geography of the zones, but he is still very very doable for one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I talked to a guy last night who said from watching the market channel he saw 5 different people selling a copy of Malo yesterday . . . . needless to say, prices are considerably lower on my server.  Bout 10k at top value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">did G. wurms easy whit:<br />
me lv 60 shaman<br />
lv 60 druid<br />

me<br />
<br />
gwurm = dead<br />
<br />
They hit for 550, but real slow, and they're easy to slow on top of that.  A good dc pet, or a warrior can make them doable easily.<br />
<br />
Spell drops aren't that great.  Killed quite a few last ragefire camp, got a few junk spells (malosini), and some really rare worthless cleric spell (59 or 60 ae spell).  Other than that it wasn't that wonderful, and they're rare spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Renendor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive done it in the past with a duo 59/60 shaman, 60 paladin.  <br />
Best to have a little more heal power or damage dealing to ensure survival though.  Add a monk or bard or healer and youll be doing fine probably. <br />
Best is to root, and debuff with malo/malosini, slow, maybe cripple.  At this point you havent done any damage, so no danger of summoning.  Then make sure tank aggros.  Warrior or paladin with stuns will do the trick nicely.  Save mana for heals if you are only duoing and jbb away.  <br />
Never seen a 60 shaman spell off them, but other nice rares do drop often.  Traded sunstrike for torpor, and word of retribution for malo, both dropped off GWs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Right on Renendor...it's not always about getting YOUR spells, but getting the spells that someone else needs sometimes :D<br />
<br />
a long time ago I stumbled upon a really rare enchanter spell...local uberguild enchanter spell banker let me pillage thru her bags looking for one I wanted in trade :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">After Malosini these can easily be fear kired by a necro or SK so they're your best bet if you want to do it with 2 ppl...</div></div><hr />
