<br />
Below is my magelo profile, I know it's pretty unimpressive, but hey, my shammy is a side project to help level my rogue, what can I say...  Anyway, here's the deal, I have no cash, and I don't have too much spare time to make any, on the other hand I have a 64 rogue who is pretty well equipped and a hankerin' for some new shammy stuffs.  Could anyone suggest a place where a two-boxed 51 shammy and 64 rogue combo could get some decent upgrades for my shammy?  I've already got my mind set on going to KC to get myself some new Jarsath (sp?) wrists and arms, and I have some ideas in mind for gloves and booties too, but nothing is set in stone just yet.<br />

Question 2:<br />
<br />
My shammy, as fun as she is, was created in order to help AA my rogue, who will be 65 shortly and working on AAs at that point, could anyone suggest some good two-box tactics for a shammy rogue combo?  What I've been doing as of yet is just fully buffing myself and the rogue, offensive buffing my pet, then tossing up a slow, sometimes a dot, then regenning mana for the next fight(I really oughta get canni2, canni1 sux these days, though levelling to 54 for canni3 may be quicker than doing the quest).  I'm sure you guys have a few suggestions for making this combo more efficient and I'd love to hear your suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your stuff isnt that bad.  Get out of the gnome skin as soon as you can.  The jarsinth from KC would be an upgrade, but not for very long.  Leaf scale gloves are getting very cheap in the Bazaar; Id recommend a pair of those.<br />
<br />
Id aslo say get some Jaundiced bone Arms.  Those usually run about 400-500 plat for the arms, helm, and boots.  Legs and BP are much much more expensive (last time I saw the legs they still running 11K), but also pretty nice items.<br />
<br />
As far as tactics you are in an interesting situation.  I know that your rogue and shaman can group and both get exp, but Im pretty sure the exp your shaman is getting is small.  My general recomendation is to head to Tier 1 planes, but I really dont think your shaman could tank there, and I dont know if you could either.  <br />
<br />
You could try some of the new LOY zones.  Exp there can be good.  Getting a boat in Dulak should get your shaman some good exp (and yourself some good AA) as well as some ok cash and the oocasional drop. Your shaman should have no real problem here after you hit mobs with slow...the pet could do all the work.<br />
<br />
Hope some of that is usefull to you.  GL in your endeavors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jhael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My main is only 63 so Im not sure what spots still give xp at 65, but I think getting a few more levels on your shaman would make things easier.  Seb is fairly empty now and you could tank and single pull most of the camps there.  You could even try the Crypt, but spliting the guardians and dealing with their cheals may be tricky.  I know you could duo the necro and gang camps easy enough and you can pull a few k in gems out of there in a few hours, as well as some nice xp for the shaman.<br />
<br />
best of luck to you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, honestly the most effective way to combo a rogue and a shaman relies on the shaman having some outstanding gear to tank with.<br />
<br />
   Shaman lays on some DoTs, runs Quiessence/torpor on himself and keeps the mob rooted, rogue can then sit at max melee and still backstab.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   In your case you can modify this slighty by keeping the mob rooted and rogue at max melee still I suppose, then after the rogue gets hit, move the shaman in.   Mob turns to face him, you can backstab, then move the shaman out of the way all before another hit lands if you are lucky/no lag.</div></div><hr />
