How to give a warrior the hate he needs <br />
---------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
A warrior's main problem with taunting happens right in the beginning of the fight, where the slower suddenly sees his hate spike above the amount of hate the warrior has had the chance to generate. Once the warrior takes aggro back from the slower, the fight usually goes fine. The problem is, you may end up with a dead slower in the beginning of the fight. <br />
<br />
Warriors can generate steady hate over time with weapon damage and procs. They can't generate bursts of hate, whereas a shadowknight can. I usually use clinging darkness for this purpose, leaving the newer hate spells unmemmed. In order to help the warrior, you need to know the following: <br />
<br />
1) One cast of clinging darkness generates more hate than one cast of slow. If the slower has to cast slow again (resist), the 2nd slow will make the mob jump the slower unless you have cast clinging darkness a second time. For simplicity's sake, let's assume that: <br />
<br />
- clinging darkness: 400 hate <br />
- resisted slow: 350 hate <br />
- successful slow: 300 hate <br />
<br />
2) A spell will generate hate whether it sticks or not. It will even generate hate if the creature is immune to that spell. From the slower's part, a resisted slow generates a little more hate than a successful slow. A shadowknight can keep his hate over the slower's hate if he casts clinging darkness at least as many times as the slower has to cast slow. I generally pull a mob by casting clinging darkness on it twice, this gives the slower a margin for two resisted slows (where i have 800 hate, and the shaman 700 hate). If i don't cast clinging darkness a third time before the slower casts his third slow attempt, the slower's hate will exceed mine and he will be attacked. Usually slow will hit on the first or second try. <br />
<br />
3) During the time when the shadowknight is casting hate spells to keep his hate above that of the shaman, the warrior will be hitting the mob to gain aggro. A shadowknight can cast Voice of Terris on the warrior, which will let the warrior generate 10% more hate. This is still not enough to avoid the slower being jumped on slow, but it is used later on. <br />
<br />
4) A successful taunt from the warrior gives the warrior an amount of hate equal to whatever the highest guy on the hate list has +1. You may have seen this in action when you're the tank, you have a warrior in the group, and the mobs suddenly pingpongs between you and the warrior even when you're chain casting darkness and you know the warrior has no possible way to generate as much hate as you do. That's a successful taunt attempt. <br />
<br />
<br />
How to put it together <br />
Either the shadowknight pulls, or he casts clinging darkness on the mob when it is being brought in by the puller. I prefer to be the puller cause it gives me more time to cast clinging on the mob. Ideally i will be casting clinging darkness on the mob 4 times regardless of who is the puller. This will give me 1600 hate, taken the numbers from my example. <br />
<br />
The slower can cast slow at his leasure if i have 1600 hate. On successful slow he's at 300 hate, on resist + success he's at 650 hate, even with 2 resists he'll be at 1000 hate when slow finally hits. This is quite safe for the slower. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, the warrior is taunting. He will have a successful taunt either before or after slow hits. If he can't taunt the mob off you before slow hits, the slower is casting against your 1600 hate and nothing can happen. If the warrior taunts the mob off you before the slow hits, the slower is casting against the warrior's 1601 hate, which is still completely safe. <br />
<br />
When you see the mob switch from you to the warrior, this is the point where the warrior just received hate 1 point above yours. The mob may pingpong between you and the warrior for a moment. This means the warrior got 1 point over your hate, but you hit the mob so it ponged back to you. In both cases, switch off autoattack to let the warrior outtaunt you for a few seconds. Don't switch off autoattack before this happens, the more aggro you have at the point when the warrior takes over the better. The mob may switch very early during the fight, it totally depends on how early the warrior gets a successful taunt. Your hate may be sky high, the warrior simply gets what you have +1. After giving the warrior a few seconds, switch autoattack on again. <br />
<br />
Because you generated so much hate in the beginning, the warrior now has a huge amount of hate as well. Nobody but you can pull the mob off the warrior for the rest of the fight unless you have some huge nukers in your party, so all you have to do is be careful with your own hate from this point on. I've never seen the mob get off a warrior after i cast clinging darkness 4 times and the warrior took over, and i don't get aggro back if i just autoattack and cast the occasional spear. You will want to cast Voice of Terris on the warrior so you can stay under the warrior's hate better. If the warrior can't keep aggro with Voice of Terris on him after he's taken over your hate and all you're doing is autoattack, you need a different warrior. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Now, my guild leader brung up a good point (56 SK)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Couple of reasons for my logic. I don't like pulling with a dark, because it takes longer for the mob to get to camp and increases your chance of adds. Plus if you want to switch targets, your chanters can't mez that mob. In my long time pulling, I strongly recommend you never pulling with a dark. Secondly, shadow vortex builds up more agro, so why not pull with it. If I don't want agro, I use siphon strength, its fast cast and low mana. Once the mob is at camp, you dark it, this has a couple of benefits, it gives your casters who get agro, time to run away if they have to and helps the warrior catch the mob while chasing it. If you get agro and your an sk, you don't taunt, you turn auto attack off and let the mob hit you. If it gets to the point where you get low on life, just chain life tap. Life tap is a low agro spell and doesn't do as much dmg as your sword. Chain life tap until the warrior gets agro. Also as an sk, you want to position the mob for the warrior. Make his job easy, if you ever noticed when I pull in ToV, I bring the mob to the corners and many times harmshield. The mob is in position so my warriors can just jump in and keep the mob where it has to be. <br />

Thought you all might like to take that back to your guilds and save yourselves XP deaths, or close calls, in xp groups =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe sk friend in my guild is the guy that wrote the original post about that :)<br />
Was very handy reading too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wasn't sure who wrote it.  An SK from Aduentus on Vallon Zek posted it on our forums for us.  He noticed it became a much bigger problem in CoD than it was in PoD, but thought it would help us anyway.<br />
<br />
Tell him that its making its way around and he should be happy he's helping others =)<br />
<br />
One note on that...<br />
<br />
Another way I control my own agro is by pulling myself.  Alot of tanks say &quot;nono, shamans can't pull if they get adds they'll get ganked&quot;...  But thats far from true.  Any shaman who's solo'd knows how to deal with 2-3 mobs.... Any shaman who's solo'd enough knows how to wait till they won't get adds.  Pulling yourself ensures you know where the mob will be at all times until it is slowed.  Around 55, if your wondering, is a good time to start pulling/soloing in PoD.  I think thats where you hit the resistance cap because it seems my slows/roots resisted ALOT less at 55 than at 54, without malo.  So you can pull with slow, and root it before it gets to you.  That way your tanks (unless their proc'ing dd's that break your roots) can get the taunt from you fairly easily on a placed mob.<br />
<br />
Just make sure your roags know how to handle root-agro. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SImple conclusion in exp group : dont let the crap war MT... ONly war with uber weapons can taunt correctly. So let pal and sk tank and you will neer have such problems. They may have a tad lower hp, but who cares everyone can tank mob slowed, and everyone is happy that the mob stick your tank.<br />
<br />
And yes i think war suck in exp group.</div></div><hr />
