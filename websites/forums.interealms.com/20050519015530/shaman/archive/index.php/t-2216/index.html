<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phlegma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It looks like Verant finally added some decent smithed armor that Inny Trolls can wear, but I can't find out anything on the stats of it.  The only smithed Item I've found is the Mistmoore Shield, and I must say it's a pretty damn nice shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phlegma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know this isn't part of the cultural stuff, but this is one of the better smithed items that I've seen a Inny Shaman able to use.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Interesting...is that shield limited to Inny worshippers? <br />
<br />
Is that the thing where smiths are recycling old gear (looks like a crested MM shield was involved with the creation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone got rough prices for these items?<br />
<br />
Those chain bracers are way better than Totemic (yes I still have totemic!). The boots have 2 less AC than JB, but the stats probably make up for that. And the shield looks slightly better than an SBS.<br />
<br />
I want! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's one of the Smith recipes to upgrade exsisting (but generally useless) items in the game isn't it??<br />
 <br />
How the heck do you do that?  What's required to beef up the Mist Moore Shield?<br />
(cries from camping the Bone Buckler)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From the limited info on traders corner, the shield is made from:<br />
<br />
Crested Mistmoore Shield<br />
Large kite shield mold<br />
smithy hammer<br />
2 folded sheets of infused acrylia<br />
<br />
They don't know the trivial yet, it appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And talking of prices - although I don't know much about smithing and the costs involved, I can see that to make Oggok Adamantite sheets uses 1 blue diamond per sheet, assuming no fails. Therefore the cost to attempt this armour is going to be over the cost of 1 BD per sheet used, and BDs go for around 1k on my server.<br />
<br />
Pricey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>svaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey, isnt the ogre cultural plate WAR/SHD only?  I.E. Inny Troll SHM cant wear the ac16 +5wis boots?  Or can we?  Sorry if I'm missing something obvious here :)<br />
<br />
     -Svaeth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nope, the chain stuff is Fulvous Darksplint and it's shaman wearable. (the above plate list had two chain items at the bottom)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes but ogres can make the inny troll stuff that i listed...its completely diff armor than the ogre stuff...just diff recipe i would assume...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For Gloriana and others interested, the shield and the other weapon things able to be made is what the Troll Cultural Smithing is. The good thing is that they are not limited to trolls or dieties for the most part for who can use them. That is unless a troll were to imbue them for you. The smithing for the trolls is really rough right now since it is the very first time trolls get any cultural smithing (May 8 patch) and all the trivials are the same as the new high end smithed armor is so far. Example, the smith upgraded Ykesha changes a yak from a 8/24 weapon with effect Ykesha to a 12/23 weapon with effect: ykesha. This is pretty pathetic since the delay is too high and there are no stats of any sort on it. The cost of it makes it unsellable since 12/23 weapons drop and rot all the time for free in places like ME. Anyhow, off topic hehe. See your local troll master smith. He should be able to help you with the items that have been successful so far. Or, if you want to read about them for yourself, check out<br />

and read the smithing message boards about troll stuff. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">New Yak is a great twink item though... unless it was fixed recently that proc was level 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In terms of pricing:<br />
Guy on my server is human smith, making Rallos Zek Plate armor.<br />
You can get the Plate Breastplate for 30K and 15 Blue Diamonds.  the price is negotiable, the BDs are not.  He (the smith making them) has sold 3 so far I believe.<br />
<br />
Every one of these new items takes multiple Blue Diamonds to make, and because of the number of steps involved it's easy to blow 5 or 6 at a time.<br />
<br />
Even the new Yak requires a few BDs I believe...not really worth making for a twink.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually Hrothgar, that was one of those bugged things. The weapon said it had a recommended level of 1, but didnt proc until level normal yak proc level of 37 i think it is? And with the average of something like 4k worth of meterials to get a successful combine on those, it is unlikely you could even make your money back, much less any profit.</div></div><hr />
