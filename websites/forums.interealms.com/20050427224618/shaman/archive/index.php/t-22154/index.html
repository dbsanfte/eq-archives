i rotate those twice on the boss mobs, they drop like fly's and i even got one of those regen BP's with 90 hps for a friend from a few nights camping there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Riwwi is pretty easy to get to with just invis, just keep an eye out for the odd see invis mobs that roam about in qinimi. Once in riwwi, its easiest to set up at ferubi zone until you get used to mobs (low traffic zone line)<br />
<br />
Also, Vp3 is excellent for soloing, esp. with malicious decay debuff first.</div></div><hr />

Got GoD with my subscription for a raid.  Been dragged deep into *somewhere* by a guild druid and ported out after the kill.<br />
<br />
So I have no clue.  Tell me if this is wrong:<br />
<br />
Take LDON camps to Nedaria's Landing, talk to another Magus and go to Abysal sea.  From there somehow zone into Natambi --&gt; qinimi --&gt; Ferubi --&gt; Riwwi?<br />

Are all of these zones open?  What are all the trails for?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually Snap I think the zone progression goes something like: Nedaria's Landing -- Natimbi -- Qinimi -- Barindu -- Ferubi -- Riwwi. From Barindu you access Tipt and Vxed and Sewer trials. I have no idea about anything past sewers. :) As for what the trials are for ... I think you go Sewer 1, Sewer 2 (This one is the Sewers of Nihilia: Crematory, I believe), Tipt, Vxed, and then Kod'Taz. (???) There are other ones, I'm sure I'm missing a handful. I had a guild group try a sewer trial once (the Crematory). We couldn't figure out the script, and by the time we realized we needed an evacker to even consider completing the trial we'd already lost. I did get nearly 2 AA's out of that run, though.<br />
<br />
I (3700+ HP shaman) personally enjoy a solo session at the Barindu-Ferubi zone line, and also spent some time in Barindu at the Barindu-Natimbi zone line working my way along the halls. I haven't tried soloing in Ferubi yet, but I'm dying to, the AAXP has been pretty amazing so far. <br />
<br />
Now, if I could just get my hands on one of those *@$%# runes ...<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
or something roughly like that.<br />
<br />
natimbi has a soloable camp with +20 hp type 7 non-lore augs<br />
virtually all god zones have nice items dropping rarely from trash mobs, a'la sebilis<br />
a group of non raid-geared players could make it as far as kod'taz with a bit of skill; the tank would probably need VT or the best LDoN / questable stuff though.<br />
the sewers are easy and even soloable if you are careful; spells and nice augments and 90-ish hp/mana loot can drop there.<br />
vxed/tipt are fairly easy with nice risk vs. reward for augments, spells, 110-ish hp/mana armor.<br />
qinimi, barindu and riwwi are soloable as well, with nice trash drops.<br />
ferubi might be soloable now, but i much prefer single group dungeon grinds here; rewards are nice and include three or four different lore augs , either 25 hp/mana type 7 or 10-15 ac type 7.<br />
kod'taz is mostly single group content, with nameds dropping really nice augs and spells.  off of kod'taz are the ikkinz trials, which are fairly difficult and would not be feasible for a group without elemental+ gear.<br />
<br />
keep an eye out for any no-drop stuff you see in gates content, look up the breakdown in communication quest and roll for any BiC drops you see.  buy a silvery mask and identify stuff, most gates items have some interesting if not entirely pertinent item lore.<br />
<br />
hm, VP3 is an incredibly handy and generally underrated AA under any circumstances, but it can be a lifesaver as well as a good solo tool in many gates zones.  get it.  otherwise have fun, die a lot, make friends with some rogues and necros, etc.  hope this helps or whatever<br />
<br />
edit: oh well that map doesn't really make sense, tabs and spaces keep getting changed or something</div></div><hr />

LDON Magus to Nedaria's Landing. From Nedaria's Landing you can go to Abysmal Sea or to Natimbi. From Natimbi you can access Qinimi, Kod'Taz, Yxtta, Uqua. From Yxatta, you access Qvic. From Qnimi, you access Barindu and Ferubi. From Barindu you access Vxed, Tipt and Sewer trials. From Barindu, you zone into Ferubi, and from Ferubi into Riwwi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">tordail's map is basically accurate, except qinimi has zones to ferubi, riwwi, barindu and natimbi.  ferubi connects to qinimi, riwwi and barindu. riwwi connects to qinimi, ferubi and barindu.  i think qvic is off of kod'taz but i'm actually not sure. oh, and abysmal sea zones to natimbi via a magus or the ship.  <br />
if you're exploring or playing a lot in god, i reccommend binding in nedaria's landing since it gives you access to natimbi or any of the LDoN portals through the mage.  the mage in the abysmal sea only zones you to nedaria's or natimbi, which makes it a less convenient option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been playing in Qinimi and Riwwi lately killing nocs for the BiC quest. I actually had 5 chalks drop for me last night - too bad no one could come and get the un-used ones <br />
<br />
I would make my initial camp near the Barindu zone of Qinimi. I would pull the nocs with a DR debuffer and VP them. I never had adds when I pulled them, and I was able to rot them in under two minutes - do not have BA IV or Crit Aff AAs. Just Bane, BoS, Breath, and Epic. For giggles, I would spirit call them - they rampage, so be careful. Kinda fun tho :P<br />
<br />
There are two nocs at the bottom of the stairs. In the next room, there are two more. Then, you have the large room in which 4 nocs spawn. Down the stairs you have 2 nocs. Also, there is a roamer noc. You can move around safely with invis. I would be careful tho because you could have people training to Barindu if you camp here. <br />
<br />
In two hours camping there, I got 5 chalks and 1 key for the BiC quest. Also, I got a few tongues and some vendor loot. One of the nocs droped a Blue Diamond.<br />
<br />
Some Notes:<br />
<br />
1. I had VP 3<br />
2. Nocs did not summon<br />
3. They did not run on low health<br />
4. They will break VP or resist without the DR debuff<br />
5. They proc a poison dot I think that can be cured with rc3 ( do not know if lower ranks can ).<br />
<br />
Next is Riwwi.<br />
<br />
I went here for the dust, and on my second kill, the dust dropped for me off of a noc near the Qinimi zone in/out.<br />
<br />
A guildie friend told me the best place to hunt in this zone is near Ferubi zi/zo. I tried it last night, and there were a lot of nocs. You can use the same tactics as I did in Qinimi.<br />
<br />
Some Notes:<br />
<br />
1. Again, VP 3<br />
2. They did not summon<br />
3. They did run, so you want to make sure you root them. I have ornate legs for the clicky root, and that seemed to hold on them log enough for my dots to kill it. Also, it seems to me that the aggro range on these nocs are small. I rooted a runner close to a mob, and it did not aggro. I do not know the exact distance, but I thought it was close :P<br />
4. They will break VP or resist without the DR debuff<br />
5. They proc a poison dot I think that can be cured with rc3 ( do not know if lower ranks can ).<br />
<br />
Now, I need get the mud from the sewers.</div></div><hr />

Did they drop off of random mobs?  I tried soloing the Plant Sewer, and I was able to kill a cube - the ones that see invis, but they can be rooted via VP with a DR debuffer.  A guildie friend told me that the mites could not be rooted, so I will not be trying to kill them anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Those cube things are perfectly disgusting. They remind me of Plane of Fear. Talk about original design! :p Anyways, the muds dropped primarily off the little sewer gnats, and I believe one of them dropped off a larvae. One also dropped off one of those Nihil spiritist-type mobs, but that must not be too common an occurence since I've done probably 15-20 sewer expeditions and have never seen that before.

3 mobs = 1 yellow of AA.  They hit for 700ish so I expect to eventually be begging for a rez.  <br />

To split the 2 mobs at the entrance:<br />
<br />
Malos one, run out.<br />
Come back, Malos the other one, run out.<br />
Come back, PE one at his spawn.  run out.<br />
Come back, Slow the unrooted one, when he gets close to the zoneline root him.  <br />
Take it from there, respawn is ~20 mins I think.  <br />

Heh, you will have a field day in Phase 3 of Time.  There are mobs from each of the gods: <br />
<br />
Cazic ( Fear ) - Jello Mobs and Good Ol' Squid Face<br />
TT ( Lair of TT ) - Horsemen and Undead<br />
Saryrn ( Torment ) - Those Crab Thingies and the Beasts<br />
VZ/TZ ( Tactics ) - Diaku and Boars<br />
Inndie ( Hate ) - mobs common to hate<br />
<br />
Anyways, not to derail the thread - posting a list would be nice.  I know when the jello mob hit me - I wanted to re-position the mob - he was hitting in the 500/600s with one in the 1000s.  Oh, he conned even to me as well.  Also, he was not slowed.  I was lucky enough to get a VP off at 30% health :P  It took about 2:30/3 mins to kill one, so I would say that they have 20% more HPs than the nocs in Qinimi and Riwwi I reckon if I had to guess - I say this because I took time out to heal myself and dots faded off the mob.  *lol*  I am sure with someone with all the determintal focii can kill much faster with me.<br />
<br />
When I get back from vacation, I want to see if I can solo a fly there *lol*  I have a bad feeling about it.  :P</div></div><hr />

Haha, I'm getting ready to log and make my first attempt at soloing in a sewer ... or perhaps I'll start in Barindu ... Ugh, maybe Qinimi ... lol. I, too, have a bad feeling about this, but luckily my guild loves me and has a good number of clerics on at any given time.<br />

I might have to make a cleric bot *lol*<br />

I would say try Qinimi first.  See if you can handle that.  Riwwi's noc mobs are the same as they are in Qinimi, so if you can do Qin's nocs, you should not have any problems.  Again, the key is VP.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Barindu yet, so I cannot say what to expect there.<br />
<br />
As for the sewers, I found that a lot of stuff is immune to root, so that will make it most interesting to tank.  Adds would be bad mojo.  *lol*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, managed to spend a couple hours soloing. The whole time, puppy and I had Q and haste up, I was making a halfhearted attempt to give him FA, and he was buffed with FOS/AG with two rusty daggers in hand. Erm, paw. I had self buffs and POT9 on.<br />
<br />
Tried Qinimi first, killed a handful of the noc things, a few mastruq guys (no casters, only melee) and a kiv eyecollector (I think that was the name ... the nasty little guys with arrows and one HELL of an agro radius), and killed them all without too much trouble. Pulled with Malicious Decay, brought them to the Qinimi - Natimbi zone line, VP'ed them, cast slow, Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryrn, sent puppy in with Q, dug the Copper Hammer out of the bag, and went to it. Radiant Cure 2 did just fine for cleaning off most of the nasties that were cast on me, but the Kiv guy had some sort of a snare spell and something else on me that didn't come off. He nearly killed me, got me down to 35% with about 15m left, but puppy saved the day. The second mastruq guy (a mastruq warfiend I think the name was) I killed dropped a piece of chalk that I'm told is for the Breakdown in Communication quest.<br />
<br />
Headed to Barindu, pulled a few of the little guys at the Qinimi - Barindu zone line (I did have some trouble singling the ones that stand right there as you come out of that first doorway from the zone line), same as above, same result, just took a bit longer.<br />
<br />
Arbitrarily picked the Sewer:Crematory one, zoned in, pulled puppy up. Same story as above, killed off a slime or two, a little sewer gnat, and about that time started getting beat and summoned by a turtle. Around the time puppy died and I hit 45% I figured it was a good time to end the experiment, lol. :p <br />
<br />
Figure I'll try Riwwi next, provided I can find the zone. *sigh* My sense of direction isn't all that great, lol. Had an invite from a monk friend to duo the sewers, he has recently left an Elemental farming guild, so that might be interesting.<br />

Average gear is very marginal for a caster here, especially one who is casting SLOW :P  An unslowed mob would dispatch of me in one round easily, but I had a great tank and survived for about 2 hours before peeps got sleepy.<br />

Natimbi - It's a free for all for any 65 Shammy.  Pull out the dog and find some DB cons and slaughter away.  On BB this zone is packed throughout even the earliest hours of the day because of the two neck pieces that drop off random mobs.  Be wary of the poison from Warfiends and Nocs....the intial damage can cause a scare at low HPs, so keep Dog Dog and yourself above 50%.  Other than that, it is a walk in the park for even gimp Shammies like myself.<br />

All GoD mobs have inate resistance some kind of damage and are weak to othe kinds. Having a magic and a desease based root can be handy depending on what mob you are killing.</div></div><hr />
