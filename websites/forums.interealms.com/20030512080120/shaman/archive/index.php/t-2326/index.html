I'm a new shaman, and I've searched the forums and found no answer to this particular question, but I was wondering if any non-Iksar with requisite LegionofCabilis and ScaledMystic faction have attempted to quest for this item?  Seems like a phenomenal primary weapon, and an even better range weapon for when you complete the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
Any responses are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Me be a Cazic-fearin troll and me Legion fakshun caps at Warmly.  Presumably, da Mystic fakshun will be Warmly too but may be a lil higher in point terms.<br />

Currently me's got to da fifth cudgel wif no probs (current fakshun wif Scaled Mystics be high amiable).  Takin a break frum da quests at dis point tho coz me hasna got any exp fer a cupla weeks an me's startin ta get itchy. ;)<br />
<br />
So, me can confirm dat dem is doable to at least da fifth cudgel wif at least amiable fakshun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, thanks to a lifetime spent in kunark, my legion of cabilis standing cannot get any better (finally capped it by killing trakanon).  So anyways, I go to cabilis finally last night to see what my faction is like.  Im in LOIO and i run up to the cabilis entrance and con some guards.  All indifferent.  Thanks to an old iksar character, I knew which guard gives out the bone chip quest, so I run up and hail him to see what he's got to say.  Much to my surprise, I got harmtouched!<br />
<br />
Ow!!!!!  I now realize that the crusaders of greenmist are obviously not part of the legion of cabilis :(   This really sucks because it takes a LOT of money to get a 49+ cleric to come out to LOIO.  I did get some funny screenshots of myself dead on the steps of the mill, though :D<br />
<br />
Completely irrelevent story, but I thought it was funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not only that, but one of the crusaders in FoB is on Scaled Mystic faction, which raises even more slowly than Crusaders (for my enchanter, anyway). Since I don't need to do it myself anymore, I'll let you guys in on a little known quest for cabilis factions.<br />
<br />
Once you're in good with the Legion, gather up all of the Marauder Snout Ring 'MM's that you can find and turn them into Drill Master Dal in groups of 4. He is just inside the Warrior guild (look up and behind you when you get to their area. I'm not sure if you get bigger hits than the bone chip quest, but it sure seemed like it. It also gives some sweet xp if you want to PL a young iksar. You can almost always find the rings on vendors at the Windmill in LOIO, in FV and in Cab. They drop off outcast iksar marauders and manslayers. Note: there are two versions of the rings, only the MM ones work.</div></div><hr />

I failed on a MQ turn-in on the 6th for my Shaman. Both he and I where Amiable, but apperently I wasn't high enough amiable.<br />
Ran the bonechip quest a few times got my faction back up enough to complete MQ for the 7th Cudgel, though.<br />
<br />
It's the same bug that prevented human monks that followed Quellious from completing the Shackle quests. VI's fix - lowered the faction requirements. Maybe they more here, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kherys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Barbarian Shaman cannot even get the second cudgel quest.  When you try and ask for it, it gives you a message to the effect of &quot;You must do more to please the Scaled Mystics first&quot;, even though your faction is maxed (at indifferent).  I found this very disheartening, considering the amount of work it takes to get good faction with all the Cabilis factions, and the fact that they made specific changes to greenmist and whistling fist quests to allow all non-iksar to complete them, yet not the cudgels.</div></div><hr />

Since they did, and many non-iksar shaman made the assumption that they must have done the same for cudgels and worked our asses off for the faction.. that's what gets me.  I like cabilis faction, cab is one of the better cities imho, but I wouldn't have spent the better part of a couple of weeks of my playtime to get the faction up just to get in another city.. I was really looking forward to a cool series of quests.<br />

Thanks to the intentional open door that VI left for faction, and a few hundred bone chips from the early days, I am max ally to Scaled Mystics.  I am close to completing the 7th cudgel and have actually enjoyed every part of the quest except the deal in Kurns.  If you are a CT troll it is worth doing IMO, but I would probably faction west cab first and then look for something there to give you hits with east cab.  Even the existing explorer knife quest is better than the old bone chip quest.</div></div><hr />

My shaman is Barbarian Tribunal and he WILL have Spear of Fate and Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients. :P<br />

They'll lower the faction issues so everyone can do them just like they did the other Iksar &quot;epic&quot; quests so that everyone else can do them. You know that Verant likes to make things &quot;equal&quot;. *coughbullcrapcough*</div></div><hr />

I am having an impossible time finding HS groups to get the skulls for cudgel 7 (it'll be easier to get a guild raid group up for the final battle)...any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

(actually had to get 2 dusty skulls, we snafu'd the first arisen iksar attempt lol)<br />
i believe the 4 skulls drop from the same wing, and im pretty sure he told me the lore dropped from around the same spot each time.<br />

I am an Inni troll and have done enough faction to get to warmly for legion and dubi for everything else except necros. Wanted to go see if I could start the first cudgel with just dubi faction to scaled mystic but ran in to a problem. I CANNOT FIND HIEROPHANT OXYN :(    .  Searched everywhere in the temple of terror and didn't see him, searched the whole zone and no luck. Ran my ranger in to track and wasnt on tracking. Logged off my server and made a mule iksar on another server and Oxyn wasn't up on that server or the server I checked after that one too. Right now I am waiting on a petition to see what the deal is. Has Hierophant Oxyn been moved to a different zone other than East Cabilis, is he up only at certain times, did someone just do a part of the quest which despawned him for a couple days? Please tell me I didn't just waste all my time faction farming for a quest that has been removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a Tribunal Barbarian Mystic.<br />
I have no problems with not being able to complete the cudgel quests.  It would be nice, but I'm not losing sleep over the fact I can't do them due to faction caps.<br />
<br />
Since I can't do the quest series, I really haven't spent much time researching it, so please forgive me if these sound like stupid questions.<br />
<br />
I went to Kaesora to get my fang for the HS key from Xalgoz.<br />
He dropped a &quot;Shrunken Iksar Skull necklace&quot; (I think that's right, my notes are at home &amp; I'm at work) along with his 2 fangs.  I did a search on Allakhazam's and found that this was for the cudgel quests (#8 I think?).  We had no Iksar's with us, so I looted it (and one fang) as the only shaman present.<br />
<br />
Can I MQ this for an Iksar shaman or should I just destroy it?<br />
If it is MQ'able, will I have to max my faction (to indifferent) first, or is there a trick that I'm unaware of that would let a MQ work?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Kraggy Krup seemed to be pretty hard.<br />
<br />
I was passing through Swamp of No Fun, and there was a raid group there to kill the epic froggie for Druid epic.  I offered my services (53 shaman at the time), and set to work buffing and healing (druid epic froggie is VERY MR).<br />
<br />
When we finished druid epic..I said something clever like &quot;Since we're all here and buffed, could y'all please whack that froggie over there for me?&quot;  2 groups broke off and we made short work of kraggy..it took a few minutes, so I'm assuming that he is only a bit easier than the epic froggie.  <br />
<br />
My advice is to bring a strong group of 50+'s and overkill.  Swamp of No Fun is no place to be randomly running away or trying to do a CR (damn place is EMPTY unless someone is there for a quest).<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
P.S. Oxyn is one of the 3 hierophants in the main temple, so if he wasn't up he may have been pulled for Enchanter epic, or you were looking in the wrong place. There is also a trainer in the basement..I can're remember which one he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was in the right place, and just to be sure I went all over that temple and even brought in a lvl60 ranger to track him, but No Oxyn. So I thought  maybe he was killed or maybe he despawned cause of a quest turn in, so I made an Iksar shaman on another server and checked multiple servers, so far I have looked at 12 different servers for Oxyn and none of em has Oxyn up. Big conincedence that all these 12 servers I looked at does not have him up? I checked em all very carefully and I know where he is suppose to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Great, but that still doesnt change the fact that he is not up. Please go to East Cabilis and look for yourself, I would love to be proved wrong as I pretty much have every single part of this quest completed that I could complete without actually having the faction to start it. If I had the faction today (which I pretty much do), I would have the 8th cudgel in a couple days, but no quest NPC means I just wasted a big chunk of my time. I have already made a bug report, hopefully they took Oxny out by mistake on a patch. Maybe when they made changes *cough NERFED cough* to the cabilis faction quests, they took Oxyn out by accident.....I hope.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am sure he is not up, no I am not guessing. Yes, a lvl60 ranger can track all of East Cabilis from zone in , but I also went ahead and ran my ranger in deeper just to be sure and yes, I even went to all the surrounding zones and tracked them for Oxyn too. Ok, I understand he is suppose to always be up and that is the problem, becuase he is not up now........on any server I have checked (stopped looking after 16 servers). I also called a GM, but all he did was tell me he is  a useless guid and cant do anything but confirm that Oxyn was not up (we were in East Cabilis at the time). Please go find Oxyn, please do a bug report if you cant find him, maybe all it is is a mistake on Verants part, I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Aye, Oxyn disappeared a few days back.

Saabu, I'm a Vah Shir shaman and am doing the cudgel quests right now.  So far my faction with Legion of Cabilis has hit the cap at high Warmly, while the other factions are as of yet uncapped.  Shamans are currently at mid-amiable, everyone else except necromancers are indifferent.  Necromancers are apprehensive at this point.  I presume that the faction with the shamans caps either at the same as the warriors, or potenially slightly higher (Ally?) because of the class.  If there's interest, I'll post the faction caps as they're encountered. <br />
Faction hits and whom their for.....<br />
- The Iksar Necromancers in Cabilis West are known as the Brood of Kotiz. <br />
- The Shadow Knights in Cabilis are known as the Crusaders of Greenmist.<br />
- The Warriors in Cabilis are known as the Legion of Cabilis<br />
- The Shaman in Cabilis are know as the Scaled Mystics.<br />
- The Monks in Cabilis are know as the Swift Tails.<br />
- The is a faction called Residents of Cabilis.<br />
<br />
The Bone chip quest will give you faction for all but the Necro's. Best way for their faction is to kill outcast/bandit/etc iksar. Unless this was changed... its been a while since I did the quest with my monk.</div></div><hr />
