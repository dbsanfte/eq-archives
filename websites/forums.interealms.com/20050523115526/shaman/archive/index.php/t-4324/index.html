****************************<br />
<br />
I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed a young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though it looked like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I decided to help the guy out. <br />
<br />
I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to type: &quot;I'm mesmerizing the lion for you.&quot; I got as far as: &quot;I'm &quot; when I remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of Effect mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC enchantress. Gulp. <br />
<br />
My movement keys are mapped to &quot;w a s d&quot; so I frantically stabbed at my keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell. <br />
<br />
I forgot that I was in typing mode. <br />
<br />
The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she promptly charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying to *save*. I watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife flailing like a crazed sushi chef, chased the little guy down and stabbed him to death. <br />
<br />
I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a nice weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed when I told him what happened. <br />
<br />
He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. One minute he was fighting a lion, the next minute a strange gnome appeared out of NOWHERE, announced: &quot;I'm wwwaaaddd&quot;, then sliced him up like Freddy Krueger. <br />
<br />

OMG, rofl.  This made my day.  My wife is downstairs turning blue laughing.  Kind of reminds me of when I accidently attacked the guy on the top floor of the Necro guild in Neriak and the WHOLE zone went nuts.  Basically all the NPC's attacked and killed everyone in the zone except for little charmed me.  I felt terrible, but man, good times :)</div></div><hr />
