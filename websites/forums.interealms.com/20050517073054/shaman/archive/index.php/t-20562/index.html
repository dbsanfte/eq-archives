<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They have finally fixed/nerfed(depending on how you look at it) the entrance to this zone.  For those of us that have used the /duck method to get into the Hole/Ruins of Old Paineel, we can no longer do that now.  You have to have a rogue or key to enter.  I am sorry if this has been posted before, but I skimmed over the threads and did not see this posted.  I thought people may want to know this tidbit of info.<br />
Good luck and happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did it last night on my enchatner no problem.<br />
Just went on the rock, duck, I was through it.<br />
Musta just had bad luck, make sure you shrink first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm an ogre and was able to shrink down and get in via the duck method last night too. I had some trouble at first b/c I seemed to keep falling thru the rock but eventually I slid right in. It was actually easier than before imo.<br />
<br />
Not to derail but I got A Sacred Key (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6380) off an Old Construct along w/ a Shiny Gold Earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62283). I've heard this is a master key to all the locked doors. Anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">think that key works on all the doors inside, not sure about the one outside though. They aren't lore or no drop so ya can sell em or give em to your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Osrik, I do know that the key you mention does open the locked door to the Enchanter Epic MOB in The Hole. <br />
<br />
AFAIK it does not work on the &quot;rock&quot; door in Paineel.  To get that one talk to a Skeleton Guard, then take the key it gives you and head back down towards the big pit.  Click on the rock that is located down the narrow rock path.  <br />
<br />
There is a female vendor inside Paineel who sells a key to The Hole.  To get max Paineel faction whack Kobolds in The Warrens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe the Sacred Key will also open the locked door to our Epic mob in the Hole in his new location (High Scale Kirn?  can't remember name).<br />
<br />
PS - the top door of the 'castle' is no longer locked, melee's can now run/fight their way out of the zone.  No need for a teleporter in every grp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Went in last week as a troll.  The shrink/duck method seemed to work fine for me.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the experience down in the deeper portion of the hole was not bad at 65.  Considering the mobs hit on average for 150, and an hour long solo stint down there yielded xp on a rate similar to pov, I was pretty impressed.  Zone is completely empty 24/7, you can bind in the zone itself, not to mention the zone is gorgeous.  Just reaffirms my belief that the old world dungeon creators had a thousand times more skill, depth, and creativity than the creators of the content we see today.<br />
<br />
Just park a necro alt down there to summon your corpse back if you happen to die down there ;)</div></div><hr />
