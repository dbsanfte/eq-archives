<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this possible?  How so if so?  I really want to check this place out... never been there and I've seen tons of great Tae Ew crap in yer magelos.<br />
<br />
Perhaps even just basic Do's and Do not's would be very helpful...<br />
<br />
I'd like to know anything and everything you guys know about CT :D ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can you solo .. yes , can you get to the good stuff .. no<br />
<br />
you can solo entrance , but the mobs have ALOT of HP and hit hard . The damn life drinkers are a serious pain in the ass . Maybe Duo , but solo ... naa i dont think so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 60 with no torpor/no malo I was able to successfully split and solo both entrance mobs with little difficulty. <br />
<br />
Tactics for split is simple: <br />
Root one, run and stop just before the zone, the other should be right on your tail.  Root it, zone out.  Zone back in and use tactics you would use on any summoning mob.  <br />
<br />
Both are warriors btw and I believe only one at the zone in will summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not efficiently, no. Are you friends with a smith? The tae ew shields, tunics etc are player made, not dropped. If you arent, expect to pay some cash for the combine. If your guild has a smith, get a guild hunt going there, and use the bloods to benefit the guild. Every chain wearer in my guild has tunics and legs if they wanted them, and almost all priests have shields thanks to my skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Flabbo tell me you play on Fennin Ro .. I'm very interested in obtaining the tunic/legs/shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can solo the sewers camp pretty easily. Some nice ft3 boots drop there that sell for a ton. Mobs hit from 150ish-200ish, the slimes have a fairly small aggro range, but the skeeters have a huge one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sweet... That is genius, the whole root one and root the other near zone... And yes, I have a guild smith, a psychotic 65 Wiz by the name of Yillain that has mastered all skills I think...   I envy him to a disturbing degree.<br />
<br />
I knew the stuff was player made, can blood drop off the entrance mobs?<br />
<br />
60 Shammy with no epic (maybe soon =p), no Malo or Torpor =/.<br />
<br />
I'm in a good guild... so I think I could just snag a melee and head down there...<br />
<br />
Which is more important, High resists, or High HP/AC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, Flabbo, maybe you can answer a couple questions about that armor. <br />
<br />
How rare is the blood? And can you make the distilled blood/temper and the armor at any brew barrel/forge, or only a specific one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used to solo there at 60 with difficulty.  Now at 65 in better gear, I solo there and it's a piece of cake.  I've soloed spider camp at the wiz port, soloed planks, soloed pools.  That's all I got around to trying. <br />
No point tho at 65 unless you are pharming for good droppables, the exp sux.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say once you hit 58 it would be possible.  I soloed the entrance mobs from lvl 58-59 and scored many Tae Ew Bloods.  And if you have a good baking skill you can make some ok cash from making the Candied Tae Ew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Miser, just curious, how do you single pull the goos around the FT3 boots dropper?  I tried it once and got a pull of 3, maybe I just got unlucky.</div></div><hr />

Its a pain to break.  But I'm soloing the 2 entrance mobs at 53.<br />
Horse, Jbb, alpha and Kei pretty much required imo to do it at this level.  I'm just over 1k ac and 2k hp self buffed.<br />
<br />
My approach is to slow, cripple and save all my mana for heals.  I end up reslowing twice... it makes for a long fight, but for me it just doesn't  work as well if I spend mana on dots.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">at level 63 whit torpor, it s pretty easy to kill both mobs at entrance solo.<br />
<br />
the caster mobs  can be a pain when you killing 2 or 3 at same time.<br />
<br />
well 200 aa help a lot too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can someone tell me where I can find the Pristine Lizard scales.  I've been soloing and duoing the entrance and I have yet to see them.  I have looted some shiny pristine scales...which are the ones I think that sell for about 86 pp a pop.  Anyways, the other question is where has most people found the Tae Ew blood to drop the most.  I am in the process of upgrading my entire guild of rangers and shamans with this armor, and I'm looking at maybe the other classes, but that will take some work to find the proper dropped items that are needed.  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You would get the best drop rate on the blood at the 4C camp.  The scales will drop there as well.  They are very rare drops though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Being a relative newb in CT... I know where 4C is...but the real question is how difficult is it to fight there.  Right now I'm typically fighting with a 63 ranger, me (65 shamam) and once in a while a 53 monk follows us to leech the exp (shamming bastard).  I have been there once and well, the nice friendly SK pulled 5 mobs back with him including 2 lifestealers and they ate me alive after I slowed them both.<br />
<br />
Oh, for those that wonder...right now when I did this at 64, with torpor and Pox, I could effectively kill the front two, then the two behind the doors, then sometimes one or two of the tiger rapters that are pretty close to the entrance before repop.  and this was solo, where I would root the first one at the entrance to pull the second, root the other near the exit and zone back in to fight him</div></div><hr />

 If your on Fennin talk to Klugge, Cirin or Sraxxis one of them should be able to help you with Tae Ew stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I get a pull of 2 max at planks camp.  Use aggro pulls to pull, not spells.  Then use your pet to distract while you slow the goos.  Might be a good idea to Torpor pet before pulling. <br />
<br />
The lvl 61 pet tanks surprisingly well in CT!  Very well indeed!  I let puppy chew on one with the occasional torpor while I chew down the other one with dots and nukes.  lvl 64 velium strike nuke is actually quite efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm...now if only I can figure out where the planks is...I'm assuming that it's not full of Tae Ew mobs from your post huh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tae Ew blood is just as likely to drop from entrance as it is deeper in. Pristine scales on the other hand, are rare as hell. My guid's been on several trips to CT and haven't found one yet. But, I do have all the priests in myguild equipped with shields, and just about all the chain wearers have legs and tunic. Rest of the chain pieces are crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I owuld say the blood is about a 1 in 20 drop. Rather rare. The pristine scales and flawless hides are even rarer than that. In several multi group outings to ct, we have received 2 scales and NO hides. Some monk asked me to make him pants... I told him he'd see an ornate mold sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I spend a fair amount of time in CT, mainly doing maze mobs with a warrior with druid bot and my own warrior bot as meat shield. I would strongly advise against moving into the maze without a meatshield, the mobs hit too fast to rely on channeling.<br />
Some peculiarities:  Forget splitting of mobs - even at 65 you will mostly get 2, even if they are light blue.  The casters are nasty, the healers have an aoe heal, the others have an aoe slow or aoe rain, both of which are unresistable.  Some of the raptors and spiders are highly magic resistant, have malo and grumus up just in case.  There is also a crazy bug that ports you to safe spot should you summon your horse too close to a wall.  <br />
Loot in CT can be pretty rewarding, we rarely got out of an evenings session under 10 k in bazaar sellable loot.  Blood is about 2 per hour on average.  We have gotten two pristine scales, compared to about 50 blood.  Since you need 6 scales for the combines you will need to spend a hell of a time there to get a full set for an attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's amazing the difference levels make, at 60 with a full group of NToV equipped players there were still challenging camps in the zone and the only place I could think of soloing was the zonein. Since PoP was released and I've gained a few levels it's become easier to do a few areas...the zone in and courtyard is easier to do solo now, and the previously impossible to solo wizard portal is now rather easy. I was soloing there a few weeks ago and killed a named for a nice mask:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What's PH for Dreadfang?  I have soloed spiders there at the wiz port (works well, just can't use poison), but haven't learned to pull anything else yet.  Spider named drops dmg III wizard hat, which is highly sellable.  <br />
Eww, nasty tunic Dreadfang also drops.  I guess the mask is his rare eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Dreadfang drops the int caster legs, his placeholder is one of the frenzied tigerraptors in the maze. The mask is his common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Dreadfang is in the West tunnel, closest to Wizzie Spire side.  PHer is another Dino.<br />
<br />
I have actually had more luck with the Scales in the old Tae Throne area, upstairs especially.  <br />
<br />
I had very limited luck soloing or two boxing in area unless spawn was already broken, may be possible with more hitpoints/buffs but fights were long losing battles and there still spots in the throne area where mobs get healed from second floor mobs ( facing out from throne to left barely in front of stairs and over to right where the small tunnel is).  <br />
<br />
Blood is about 2-3 an hour in 4c, seems to be about same drop rate from most of the lizards throughout the zone though.</div></div><hr />
