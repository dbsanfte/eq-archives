<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading through the random auctions early this morning and some Mithril Boots caught my eye. The stats are incredible for tradeable gear (15 stamina and 50 hp), and though well beyond my price range, I mentally added them to my wishlist. Until I looked closer.<br />
<br />
Races: Vah Shir Dwarf Ogre Troll Gnome Dark Elf Barbarian Erudite Halfling Wood Elf High Elf Half Elf Human<br />
<br />
Like my roommate once said, if the list is that long and you're an Iksar, you're screwed. None of the mithril gear is Iksar wearable.<br />
<br />
I can live with no JBB. After all, it's something of a broken item anyway, and it was released when Iksar were new. Velious corrected the armor deficiencies for Iksar, so I wasn't really concerned about finding gear. Shojen is crap, I didn't care that I couldn't wear it. This is a bit much for me. Whoever set the idiotic trend of Iksar not being able to wear plate at Verant/SOE needs to be smacked upside the head with a 2x4. These items are really good, and there's no fictional or game mechanic reason why Iksar shouldn't be able to wear them. All you're doing is denying a small portion of your player base from using some items that would allow them to enjoy your game more.<br />
<br />
Not fixing the JBB is fine. I realize that's never going to happen. But that doesn't mean the game should continue its trend of a stupid design decision that has no compensation to the players who suffer it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lady M is racist.  She nub like iksar.  I believe it is in the storyline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't see a reason?!    Did you sort of NOT read about your class when you made it?<br />
<br />
    You get a higher natural AC because iksar CANNOT WEAR PLATE.  It is incredibly uncomfortable to them due to the constraint on their scales.<br />
<br />
<br />
  That was listed right along with Higher natural regen and hated all over the old world.    Saying that there is no reason for not wearing plate is really like saying there is no reason that gnomes hate you.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I do normally try to see eye to eye with people, but it really and truely was part of your race when you took it.    The fact that non-Iksar shaman have the ability to wear some plate items like Vindi Bp and Mithril is a bonus wich you lost out on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW shaman are a CHAIN class and CANNOT WEAR PLATE ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Btw Iksars can wear Vindi BP :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">newsflash - <br />
<br />
everquest isnt consistant!<br />
<br />
Strange but trooooooooo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personaly wish SOE would put more of this kind of thing into the game.  It would make each race / class choise more unique and interesting.  Like Barbarians and the IGS and the Speritualist Hammer and the ivory imbued jewlry.  Iksar do get some specials as in a special set of PoH armor in comparison to others.<br />
<br />
I can understand how it migh be frustraiting, but It does help diferentiate the races and make each more special and interesting to play.<br />
<br />
I would also agrue that if you are not an Iksar you should not be able to do the cudgle quests for the same reasons.</div></div><hr />

Can't see a reason?!    Did you sort of NOT read about your class when you made it? <br />
<br />
    Wow, um dude its race. And Iksar actually can wear a few plate items, like Vindi bp, frosted velium bp etc, and imo ;) the reason VI made that restriction was because we looked so darn sexah in plate . <br />
<br />
 Besides, it isnt the end all be all of the class/race to not be able to wear some plate items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iksars just have to choose different armors, there's enough choices.<br />
<br />
I may be disappointed I can't wear this stuff, but  I am definitely NOT &quot;suffering&quot;. Jeez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The number of pieces of gear introduced after the kunark expansion that YOU WOULD CARE ABOUT that an iksar shaman can't wear (and other shaman can) is probably less than 10.<br />
<br />
Once you pass a certain point in the game ... maybe its killing First Broods, starting in WTOV, there might be 2 more items that are usable by all shaman except iksar.  Nothing in Ssra.  Nothing in Vex Thal.  Nothing on Lord Inquisitor Seru.  Nothing in PoP that I've seen so far.  Maybe nothing in all of Luclin?<br />
<br />
We could argue all day long about the Vindi BP being plate or not, but the fact is Iksar can wear it, and they can wear any upgrade to it that any other shaman can wear.<br />
<br />
Gear selection, outside of the JBB, is a non-issue among shaman races.  The JBB itself is a stunningly awesome piece of gear at level 45.  Its awesomeness drops slowly until level 55, drops quickly from 56-65, and is pretty much an afterthought by level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You knew ahead of time when you chose your race what you were getting yourself into. Sony has never hid the fact that they exclude Iksar from wearing plate armor, so it's not like you should be surprised.<br />
<br />
If you can't live without Mithril equipment, then switch to another race. This time, make sure you're willing to live with the disadvantages that come with that race, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Plate armor chaffes the iksars scales, so they are not supposed to be able to wear it.  This is the price they are supposed to pay for their natural AC bonus.  They fact that iksars CAN wear vindi bp and a few other plate BP's is a boon for you.  Be thankful you have what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They can't wear it because the dev team absolutely SUCKS at items. Look at what they did to the melee with horrible item design..monk gear dropping off the same mobs as warrior gear- only the monk gear is higher ac and hp?<br />
<br />
The rp reason was just that..a poor attempt at rp.<br />
<br />
/shrug just gotta suck it up- I mean we're already superior, imagine how bad non-iksar would feel about themselves if we could wear that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If they stuck with a concept it might make sense.  As it is, there's JB armor, mithril armor, and that's about it that iksar can't wear.  It looks more like they forgot to put iksar on certain items, especially after such a long period of time of having no follow through.  I'd love to have some, especially since it's starting to be sold more often, but I'll manage without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">actually it's like they came to the realization that it was just too problematic especially since they had plate classes for iksar. They started making iksar only versions of everything that didn't look like plate. IE PoF/PoH iksar only armor but just came to realize it was too much hastle and really a bad idea to make a second set of armor just for one race.<br />
<br />
Looks like a nice Idea but when you actually start trying to implement it it's a pain in the ass especially since they started running out of id's in the database to add more items.</div></div><hr />
