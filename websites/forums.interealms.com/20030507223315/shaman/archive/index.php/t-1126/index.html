<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The higher the better of course, and also, everything is based on level.  However, i would think you should shoot for 100+ unbuffed mr/cr for vox, mr/fr for naggy.  I made a warrior twink to use for vox/naggy and atm i just got his resists at around mr/cr = 110/160.  I think he's good now in that area, gotta level him a bit now, he's in his mid 40's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lots of raid leaders suggest 75 unbuffed, but I found that just wasn't good enough. I didn't live all the way through a dragon raid until my resistances were over 100 unbuffed. If possible, grab an elemental blanket from a wizzy just before the raid.<br />

<br />
The required resistances were quoted at 50mr and 80CR/FR. I found that you can usually get 2 or 3 items from a mage that will give you MR/FR/CR<br />
<br />
Elemental blanket Shoulder +15 MR FR CR<br />
Coldstone Range +15 CR<br />
A back item not sure of the name +5 MR FR CR <br />
<br />
These are from memory so I may be wrong on the stats.<br />
<br />
I found that If I was grouped with a bard then my MR and CR/FR were getting to around the 200 mark with their resistance songs stacking with group resist magic and circle of winter/summer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First of all, the lower your level, the higher your resists need to be.<br />
<br />
For most Vox/Naggy raids, the lower level limits is about level 44 (although Clerics as low as level 39 are generally welcome). At level 44 you would be aiming for probably 150+Fire/Cold and 125Magic resist (with buffs), but at level 52 you would probably get by with 125 Fire/Cold and 100Magic.<br />
<br />
My advice is to aim to get magic resist and cold(Vox) or fire(Naggy) as close as possible to 100 using only gear - i.e no buffs. If you can do that, then with buffs, you should be in good shape. Remember that you can use level 53+ players for pre attack buffing, so you can get all them uber level 60 buffs before the fight commences.<br />
<br />
Bards - Bards are the kings of Vox/Naggy raids - they can sing songs that raised fire/cold/magic by 71 - and that will seriously cut the damage that your main tanks will be taking. It is probably best that bards do not engage in melee - the ripostes alone can kill em<br />
