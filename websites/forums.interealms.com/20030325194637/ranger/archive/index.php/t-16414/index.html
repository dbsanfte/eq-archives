<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mattgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
I have recently started a ranger and would like to ask for some advice on grouping and how not to become one of those 'bad' rangers which the class seems to be stereotyped by <br />
Thnx for any help in this matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simply be knowledgable. Learn from your mistakes and never, ever be a d00d.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have an open mind, learn what you can/cannot do to an extent, listen to instructions (important ones), Be friendly, don't be boastful (ie. brag about gear, statistical numbers), do not ninjaloot, do keep up buffs/heals when ya have a chance (every little bit helps, depending on group of course),  and most importantly, stay alert  (ooh you do not want to let a mob wander off unsnared!! I learned it the hard way :( ).<br />
<br />
Have fun playing the ranger, and welcome to The Glade!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lanilya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- If you get hurt when you are not main tank - you are doing something wrong.<br />
- Use all buffs you can. Better buff your tank with Cats Feet than keeping a slot for your weapon proc buff or other self buff. Groups must see you are usefull, they should 'miss you'<br />
- Take your time on pulling. Better delay with pulls than to pull a train.<br />
- Snare without taking agro (at 50% mob life or after)<br />
<br />
Thats all I can think of now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok - in groups,<br />
learn which of your buffs will stack with others, especially those which are unique to the ranger class.<br />
<br />
Many of our spells are shared with druids (so will be overwritten with a better version if grouped with a druid) but several are not, such as Feet like Cat and Riftwinds Protection (careful, Riftwind's will stack with Haste, but not with the 'chanter's augmentation series of spells).<br />
<br />
I give everybody feet like cat, even the casters,  nobody has ever complained and they like to know you are thinking of them.<br />
<br />
If there is no druid or shammy in the group, then outdoors they will love you for keeping them SoWed (once you hit level 30).  <br />
<br />
Always make sure that the target is snared before it starts to run (do not root it, that just makes it fight back instead of running).<br />
<br />
Also if there is no druid - make sure the main tank (if not yourself) has your best targetable damage shield on at all times (cast on yourself as well so you know when it runs out).<br />
<br />
Learn how to peel adds - especially for when  there is no mezzer in your group and you are not the main tank.<br />
<br />
Always keep an eye on your healer/chanter - if they get aggro,  pull it off them, drag it away and root it, then return to the fight.<br />
<br />
To gain aggro for peeling, use attack/kick/taunt/disarm together with snare and maybe flame lick (I usually find just snare is enough - some prefer tangling weeds because of shorter casting time).  Don't use flame lick (or any DoT) on adds if your group has a chanter.<br />
<br />
After the fight if the chanter has taken damage, heal them.  Your heals are useless on tanks but ideal for int casters with their measly hit points.  Having the cleric heal the chanter is often inefficient.<br />
<br />
It is safe and useful to snare mezzed mobs - snare won't break mezz - and chances are the mob will come after you instead of the chanter when mezz breaks (this is a GOOD thing).<br />
<br />
Learn how to pull, how to single pull, how to chain pull.  Outdoors you can use harmony, snare, roots.  Indoor just roots and snare.  Learn to sneak pull with the bow.  Learn to ghetto mezz someone else's  bad pull using roots.  My dreadlands groups loved me for my chain pulling, there was always a pre-snared mob coming in at just the right time.<br />
<br />
If you get a really bad (as in lethal) pull and can't shake it off, zone or die rather than cause a Total Party Wipeout. (If your pulling is up to scratch this should hardly ever happen).<br />
<br />
IF you are called on to tank - make sure you have all your damage shields on, and make sure you use snare and flame lick to lock down aggro.  You may  take more damage than a warrior, but the DS's will take the mobs down quicker, and the mobs won't ping-pong, which will make your cleric (and your debuffers) happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A ranger's most important duties are:<br />
1.  Don't die before the tank (if there is one)<br />
2.  Die before the casters<br />
<br />
Learn how to stay #2 on the hate list.  Be a bodyguard for the casters but don't be a mana sink by getting too much aggro from the tank.  And make sure everything's snared.  The finer points will come in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, this is sort of a list of things I have learned and wish I would have known at level one.  <br />
<br />
Levels 1-45<br />
1.  Program Sense Heading (or /loc for CRs) to left arrow, Forage to right arrow.  Forage will stay maxed and you won't have to worry about when you hit 46 and start thinking about your epic.<br />
<br />
2.  Keep your skills up both spells and combat.  Conjuration was the hardest for me and Stinging Swarm is very helpful when soloing.  It stacks nicely with Immolate which you get at 49.  And don't wait till 50 to start working on your archery skill.  Keep it maxed at all costs which can be very slow and boring as you won't really be using it for much more then pulling until you start closing in on level 50.  If you have to run around a newbie zone with 6 bags of arrows then do it.  It will pay you back in the end.<br />
<br />
3.  Put your best nuke in whatever gem slot you have closest to your attack buttons.  (use it as often as you use kick.)  Never had a problem keeping my evocation skill maxed.  <br />
<br />
4.  SNARE EVERYTHING.  In an exp group where you don't need to worry about pulling agro off the MA rangers are built around controlling mobs.  If you start getting a bunch of adds you will find that snare and root become the greatest tools you can use.   Snare has a HIGH agro score and its fast casting time can be your best Taunt button ever.  DONT LET YOUR DRUIDS SNARE!!   That is your job in a group especially if you are trying to maintain agro and are tanking for the group.  Your casters get jumped by an add, engage the mob, snare/taunt repeatedly until you get the mob off them.  Then back up so both mobs are in front of you cause you can't take too many hits from behind before you start to get dangerously low on Hit Points.  Keep yourself SOWed and you should be able to run the mobs around until you get the range you need to get a root off and park the ADD so the party can engage the first one and finish it off Grasping roots is very unpredictable but Ensaring Roots you get at 49 simply ROCKS!!!  Keep an eye on your text windows for: Your Root Spell Has Worn Off.  If you still have not finished off the first one then run out to the parked mob and repark it.  Then pull out of range of the parked mob and engage the first again.  You will use this tactic a lot in all the Kunark zones as well as places like Velios and JP.  If you have a group that is simply chewing up the mobs faster then you can pull them, then pull two or three at a time using snare and root to line them up like ducks at a shooting range.<br />
<br />
5.  Try and not get so &quot;tank&quot; oriented that all your gear modifies your Strength.  Wisdom = Mana and a ranger that is pulling for a group that can't keep his mana high enough to maintain his snare and root and SoW spells can be frustrating for a group when chain pull exp grinding.<br />
<br />
6.  Move all your combat spam to another window so you don't miss communication.  Always communicate what you are doing.  I have a button for /g Looking for the next mob, a button for /g Inc %T!!!  Get Ready!!, a button for &quot;mana check&quot; (never pull when your healers are Out Of Mana aka OOM).<br />
<br />
7.  When exp grinding don't run off after the fight is over to go get another mob if you are low in health.  Clerics hate it when they spend mana to heal you just to have you run out of range of their heal spell.<br />
<br />
8.  Try to roleplay and be polite.  You will make more friends by roleplaying then you ever will otherwise.  Some people are quiet types and have a hard time making friends which you need in later levels.  If you role play your character when interacting with others it will increase the enjoyment of your EQ experience and theirs and you will find yourself getting /tells &quot;Hey man, what you doing?  Want to group up tonight?&quot;  Always try to play your character like the noble white knight always curtious, always helpful, and always patient.  Your group of friends will grow and you will have a total blast playing this crazy game.  In fact these days some of my best EQ friends have become my best RL friends. <br />
<br />
9.  FLETCHING!!  To keep your archery skill up you will need to fletch as buying arrows is about 5 times the cost to make them.  You can fletch arrow for very cheap compared to simply buying them from vendors.<br />
<br />
10.  Fear Kiting!!  Read up on it!!<br />
<br />
11.  Sneak Pulling Can help you single pull mobs from some sticky places.  Read up on that too.  Very Cool.<br />
<br />
12.  Track is a great skill so keep it maxed.  At lvl 50 I can see half if not all of the entire zone.  Jagged pine for example if you stand in the middle of the zone you can track Pot maids to the west, towns folk to the west, darkpaw gnolls to the north and poachers to the south.  Muhahaha...  You can't believe how often you will use this skill.  If you are on a particularly long pull you can pull the mob, then switch to tracking your party and pull it straight back to them.  Very, very helpful.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Levels 46+<br />
The game after 50 changes a whole lot as you slide farther and farther away from the tank role you will find yourself in at lower levels.  Rangers get beat up pretty bad against mobs in places like Kael or the Planes of Power.  Rangers are great support melee and can tank for groups up to say the low fourties but after that mobs that are light blue and dark blue just hit too hard.  You will notice that mobs you fight in East Wastes for example will be dark blue at around 37 and stay that way till 50.  So you have to learn what you can and can't pull.<br />
<br />
1.  In the 50 game if you are not soloing you will find yourself on some crazy raids like dragons, giants, and epic mobs.  RESIST GEAR is your friend, LOL.  You may want to start swapping gear and items around to get your resistances up and start dumping some of your Strength and moving it toward STA, DEX, and AGI.  Not all of it just don't be lopsided with all your eggs in the STR basket.  The highend game you will have Shammies and Droods with some nice STR buffs.  Anyway, the point here is that Resist Gear will prevent a lot of damage for you and in some cases eliminate your ability to join certain raids.<br />
<br />
2.  After 50 I have found that there really is no advantage with respect to how fast you gain exp solo vs grouping.  I prefer grouping because I'm pretty social by nature but I can solo and make about 4% of a level in an hour and I can group with 2 others and make 4% an hour, and I can be in a full group of 6 and make 4% an hour.  So after 50 you don't have to group but you might as well cause you might actually make exp faster that way or at least with less risk.  Besides, fear kiting gets boring after a while.  I prefer 3 to 4 man exp groups where our DPS (damage per second) is high enough we can move through the mobs rather quickly.  BARDS make great Partners!!  They have Damage Shield Songs, Mana Regen Songs, HP Regen Songs, Mez Songs, Buff Songs, Haste songs, etc...  They are simply a great class to group with if they are a good player.<br />
<br />
3.  DO NOT PULL AGRO OFF THE MA!!  Rangers can do some great damage and very fast and at times can pull agro off the MA or Main Assist (usually a pure tank, i.e., Warrior).  But if you pull agro off the MA you will, most deservedly, die or worse cause a wipe out by Ping Ponging the MOB.  Jolt can help you lower your agro but that is only if the mob is not hitting you so fast you are stunned the whole time.<br />
<br />
4.  LISTEN and FOLLOW ORDERS!!  I can't stress this enough.  When you group get in a group with someone that knows the zone well and then listen up.  Keep your head on a swivvel and do complete 360s every once in a while to keep an eye out for ADDS but most of your attentions should be on what the raid leaders or group leaders are saying.  This will keep you alive.  If you are young in RL and sitting quietly and being patient is almost impossible then forget about grouping and just solo.  You will die often, get your group killed, or even the entire raid killed.  You will make enemies very fast.<br />
<br />
5.  At 52 if you ever want to go on Naggy/Vox raids you may want to switch to 100% AA as I believe 53 you can't attend them.  The PoP I hear is some crazy exp but hard to find a group if under 55.  I have yet to hit the plains yet but look forward to it.<br />
<br />
6.  Oh, and if you ever want to learn how monks split mobs or get a jump on what's coming when you are in a dungeon the spell Bind Sight is a very effective tool.  It has no range limit and if you can see a mob and target it (either through your eyes or theirs) you can see what they see.  You can use it on a wizzies Eye spell and see what the wizzy sees while exploring a dungeon.<br />
<br />
7.  Oh, and if you cast levitate before you enter a water zone you will maintain your posistion in the water without slowing sinking to the bottom.  Very usefull for pulling Lord Begurgle in Lake Rathe when helping your Cleric friends start their epics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm... I'm rambling now so I guess that seems to be all I can think of atm.  Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Allannaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let me start by saying, I'm relatively new to the Glade, and that despite the fact I've played since Beta, I'm relatively low level because unfortunately, I concentrated on a healer-class for the last several years since that was what the guild I was involved in needed most.<br />
<br />
However, our class has always been my true love, so it's the one I've studied, learned, cried over, learned from the group's perspective, learned from the healer's perspective, cried over, and did I mention, loved?<br />
<br />
Rhuark's post covers an awful lot of what's needed but he mentioned one key thing that a lot of people seem to forget, and which bears looking into.... Roleplay.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what your roleplay is (even if you're what's called, on my server, a &quot;vesti&quot;.... that is, a man roleplaying female characters) but roleplay is key to EverQuest -- and key to your performance as a ranger, believe it or not.<br />
<br />
Like this....<br />
Think about your race -- Wood Elf, Human, Half Elf, Halfling.  Why did you pick that race?  <br />
Some folks pick a race because of the abilities. They want extra strength, or more stamina, or the ability to sneak or forage from birth. <br />
Some folks pick a race because one of the archetype sprites resembles their real-life looks.  I did that. Allannaa looks like I did when I was about twenty-five, before everything sagged, settled, or turned grey.  <br />
Some folks pick a race because of faction.  They like the idea that they can move and trade freely in most places.<br />
Some folks pick a race because of the race's social implications within the world of EverQuest.  Halflings, for instance, are generally seen as the fun-loving race of Norrath.<br />
So.  Think about why you chose the race you did.<br />
<br />
Think about your deity -- Tunare, Karana.  Why did you choose the deity you did, or default to it with the race you chose?<br />
Tunare, the All-Mother, is the mother of the woods, the protector of the wilds, and of the young.  Her magic is that of protection, but that protection can be turned to attack if it has to be.<br />
Karana, the Rain-Keeper, is on the other hand more aggressively oriented, and more active in both offence and defence.  Karana is of course also more &quot;masculine&quot; in aspect.<br />
So. Think about why you chose the deity you did.<br />
<br />
And now, think about why you became a ranger in the first place. We're a druid-warrior hybrid, in case that hadn't quite sunk in. You could have been a druid -- slow and patient in your hunting, able to heal and buff and even remove your friends or yourself from danger with the simple cast of a spell.  You could have been a warrior, with all the physical prowess that goes along with that profession, including the ability to do the most damage possible just as you teeter on the brink of death.<br />
Instead, you chose to be a ranger.... Why?<br />
<br />
Are you a ranger because you have a limited amount of online time, and you wanted a class that could solo effectively even at very high levels?<br />
Are you a ranger because you enjoy the idea of using your wits as well as your gear to accomplish a given task or quest?<br />
Are you a ranger because you daydreamed about being Aragorn when you were a kid? (er, or, given the recent release of the LoTR films, because you dream of it now?)<br />
<br />
Now think about why you not only chose to be a ranger, but why you stuck with it -- because ours is without a doubt, the most difficult class to play well, for many reasons.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many others remember what it was like to be a ranger originally.  I do, though.  I remember when SoW was a daydream that we got at some ungodly level like 39 or 40.  I remember before we had epic weapons.  I remember when we were a sad, sorry waste of bandwidth.  We couldn't tank like a paladin; we couldn't buff like a bard; we couldn't pull like a shadowknight. (Beastlords hadn't been discovered yet.)  Basically what we could do was shoot stuff and get our fannies handed to us by the average blue-con monster.  As time passed, the class was altered and we became more durable, we got more and better spells at more logical levels, disciplines were introduced, damage tables changed, epic weapons were created, and finally, finally, we became something more than a druid with a knife or a fragile tank with a heal spell.<br />
<br />
It took something special in the bad old days when we had to go to Kelethin by boat and on foot, uphill both ways, in snow arse-deep on a nine-foot Orc.  It took guts. It took determination. It took brains.  It took perserverance (okay, it took stubbornness).  And it took pride.<br />
<br />
It still takes all those things.<br />
<br />
Those are the nebulous, abstract things that it takes to be the best ranger you can become.<br />
<br />
It also takes a few &quot;practical&quot; things.<br />
<br />
You must:<br />
1) Know your capabilities AND your limits.  You are NOT a warrior with SoW and Heal.  You are a ranger.  While you can take melee damage and you can certainly hand it out, you must be aware of how much you can take before you can no longer dish it out.  Experiment with yourself, near a zone-line where you can escape without hurting anyone else.  (Or with a friend who is willing to log on a cleric to rez you, if nothing else.)  Learn how to pull, and learn how to pass off agro to the main tank.  Learn to use your bow.  It isn't there for looks.  It's there because, ultimately, it is your most powerful weapon.  Learn to balance the amount of damage you do, with the amount of healing you require.<br />
<br />
2) Know your magic.  Snare is a huge agro-draw.  Two things out-agro Snare; one of those is a strong heal (druid, shaman, or cleric); the other is a slow-spell (beastlord, shaman, enchanter).  Don't let the group's healer also be the snare-caster.  Be alert for the slow-messages, and be ready to use Snare, Burning Arrow, Taunt, Root, or any other thing you can think of, to ensure that the target stays focused on the melee classes and not the caster or healer.  Know what you can do alone, as far as DoT, Fear, and DD.  Know what your buffs (including your self buffs) are for, and learn how much mana they require.  Know how your heal works, and learn when you should throw a fast heal on someone before you turn back to dealing damage.<br />
<br />
3) Keep your skills at max-for-level.  Every skill you have is vital, whether it's Sense Heading, Channelling, Forage, Archery, Double Attack, or whatever.  For me, casting skills seem the hardest to keep at level, so every few days, I spend an hour sitting hidden in Surefall Glade working all of the skills -- Alteration (heal and snare); Abjuration (Skin); Conjuratoin (DoTs); Divination (Camo and vision/sight spells); Evocation (Fire-based stuff).  Channelling and Meditation come, of course, as you practice the spells themselves and then meditate to get your mana back.  You can cast all this stuff on yourself; use the lowest-level, lowest-mana version of whatever it is until the skill maxes out.<br />
The same thing holds true for fighting skills.  Go somewhere and find a few relatively harmless light-blue-con monsters and kick the snot out of them -- and let them hit you back.  That will take care of Offence, Defence, Dodge, DW, DA, Kick, Taunt, your weapons skill (1HS is the most common, but I work all my skills; one never knows!) and of course your archery skill.<br />
Most people know by now to stick Forage and SenseHeading on a hotkey together, or on hotkeys like directional arrows, or something; basically whatever makes you happy works, so long as you have a way to max both those abilities.<br />
<br />
4) Roleplay, as has been already mentioned.  But also remember common courtesy.  That gets tossed away all too often in the online world.  People think &quot;This is my $15 a month, I can do anything I want!&quot;  To a degree of course this is true, but then again -- try it from the other side.  Don't do stuff that you wouldn't want done to you.  You can't prevent other people behaving like jerks.  But you can prevent YOURSELF being seen as a jerk.... Don't train other folks without some sort of warning even if it's &quot;oh Shiiiiiii..... TTZ&quot;  (TTZ = Train To Zone).  Don't use OOC or Shout to bad-mouth other people, other classes, or other Guilds.  Don't use a pull-route that may drop your monster on someone else's group.  Do your best not to steal someone else's pull.  (That's not always easy.  Just as sometimes people don't realise you've snared or shot a monster, sometimes you can't tell that you've done that to someone else's monster yourself.)  If you do inadvertantly mess someone else up, then APOLOGISE.... even if the other person was snippy about it. If someone asks you for SoW, take a moment and toss it on her.  If a younger ranger asks your advice or opinion, answer him.  Your first answer may be &quot;Sec, fight&quot; but when you can, try to answer.  Remember, always, what it was like to be low-level, badly-geared, lonely, frustrated, and confused.  Remember how it felt the day you brought your first copy of EQ home and tore into the shrink wrap and stuck the disk in the computer -- remember the excitement as well as the &quot;omg how the heck do I --?&quot; feeling.<br />
<br />
5) Learn two very important tradeskills -- Fletching, and Pottery.  Fletching should be obvious; it keeps you in arrows until you can go to Sebilis and camp a Tolan's Darkwood Bracer, or until you get the AAs for Endless Quiver.  It can also make you a few plat, if you get good at making Faydark Thunderbolts or Nightmarewood Compound Bows.  And wipe the grin off your face -- I was serious about pottery.  Work that tradeskill to 125, and you can make Thurgadin Gate Potions.  That little drink of blue kool-aid can get you out of a lot of yucky spots where the only other alternative is the &quot;you have been slain, loading please wait&quot; sequence.<br />
<br />
6) Learn the zones you hunt.  Use Camo, or Sneak, or both.  Use Bind Sight.  Explore as safely and as extensively as you can.  Learn how things path where you hunt.  Learn what things agro and what things don't.  Learn where the zone lines are.  Learn where nasty things like pit traps and the invisible bridge in the Deep are.<br />
<br />
7) Have fun.  It seems obvious but it bears mentioning.  Have fun.  And remember other people are there to have fun too.  EverQuest is your escape from the pressures of reality, and our class is your passport into the best parts of EverQuest.  You chose to play a ranger... So BE a ranger, with all the freedom and power our class gives us.<br />
