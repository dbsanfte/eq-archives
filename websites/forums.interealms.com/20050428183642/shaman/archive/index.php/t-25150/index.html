<br />
My 3 friends have chosen alliance so proably best if I also fit in with them<br />
<br />
So what is the best alliance class to complement a druid, hunter and palli<br />
<br />
thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any class complements any other class.  If you want the Alliance class closest to a shaman, then choose a paladin.  They are good in PvP as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hunter!<br />
<br />
Yummy ranged goodness, melee, and a pet!<br />
<br />
Ok, so I'm biased. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">unfortunately<br />
<br />
paladin<br />
hunter<br />
and druid <br />
<br />
are taken by my grouping buddies so i was hoping for a suggestion that was not those 3 =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That narrows it down then, 'eh? Warlock or Mage.<br />
<br />
If you prefer pets, Warlock.<br />
<br />
If you prefer nice ranged damage (but die easily if you get whacked a couple of times), Mage.</div></div><hr />

Rogue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DOH! How did I forget Rogues? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Priest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not having played the game, I think priest seems a bit shamanique with their broad range of abilites. The only thing that keeps me from choosing a priest right away would be i dont want to run around in a dress... Im biased towards chainmail :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I took druid over priest because I didn't like the idea of getting squished in a few hits either and like to be able to off tank decently (was one of my favorite shaman jobs in eq). <br />
<br />
I was in exactly the same boat you were in, really wanting to play a tauran shaman but being outvoted 3 to 1 for alliance. <br />
<br />
With your current group makeup you already have 2 classes that can res and heal (although druid res is a bit of a problem with a 30 min recast, not sure about pally one) I would probably either go with a mage for CC and big booms or a rogue if you want to have some tankability and dish out massive ammounts of melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for advice<br />
<br />
I think probaby rogue is the way forward, although I could change my mind to priest or warlock while waiting for the game to arrive in the post. <br />
<br />
The WoW rogue boards seem to be full of happy rogues trying to debate the best build etc. so seems like plenty of depth to them.<br />
<br />
The priests have some gripes, and the warlock's seem unsure of their group desirability, although it does seem like an involved class to play.</div></div><hr />

You are fired.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could be a tauren shammy and then have your friends make friends with your 2handed staff when you run into them on a battlefield.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A WoW priest is more interesting to play than an EQ cleric though, but if you already have a healer, go for a melee.  Rogues can help in crowd control and they do damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It sounds like your group could use some CC, so a Mage or a Rogue would be nice and both add DPS. A Warlock apparently can offtank an add or two with his VW, although I don't know how well they scale up at 50+. Given the choices, I'd go with the class that you enjoy playing, e.g. some people hate the Mage playstyle, others love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen a 35 Rogue kill a level 40 NPC faster than the two level 36 Bodyguards could kill me. (36 Paladin).<br />
<br />
Rogues=Mad DPS<br />
Priests=Not sure, because there don't seem to be a lot.<br />
Druid=MR(s) Versatility.<br />
Paladin=Harder to kill than a c0ckroach<br />
Warlock=EQ Magician with some other tricks<br />
Mage=EQ Wizard with some other tricks<br />
Hunter=Puller, Soloer, DPS'er. (Has Pet)</div></div><hr />
