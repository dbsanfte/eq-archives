<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have a really good strategy for Fear?  I was in a raid there on Saturday, and it ended up being a 12 hour CR.  Unfortunately..or fortunately..I had a real life emergency and had to leave.  But just listening to the crack team get to the SW for CoH was a nightmare.  It seems that Fear has been majorly nerfed, and now it seems that it will be months before I can get in to get my Tear.  Unless I get super lucky and find someone that has a tear and will MQ it with me.  My guild itself, is not large enough for fear, so I'm just trying to get in on one thru friends of other guilds.  And will have to stand in line to get a shot at the tear, IF the PH's are even up.<br />
<br />
I only have the Tear and then the turn in's in CoM to do to complete my epic.  Fear seems to be the only drawback now :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xeiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">couple ways to clear fear<br />
<br />
The old skool way, dunno if it would still work and even if it did its genrally a waste was....everyone zoned in and fought to the SW corner and all died with a cleric camping out there to log back in when coast was clear (have a monk/necro/sk fd) and manastone rez...or now click rez<br />
<br />
Coh way, you have a comptant mage (read knows the path to nwall w/out aggro) group with someone outside portal.  Mage gets to nwall.  Person outside portal is grouped with mage and is the leader so they invite people invis them they zone in and get cohed to nwall.<br />
<br />
Rez stick way, you have mage zone in and die, monk or a good sk/necro (maybe rogue dunno what see's thru there sneak/hide there) drag the body to nwall rez them.  Then use the coh plan with the invites to get people to nwall.<br />
<br />
Another old tatic was to zone in with a druid in every group (back when they all wanted vercium) and fight/evac out and keep doing that till they could setup camp.<br />
<br />
The two old ways of doing it are fun, but they are annoying with the golems up since they like to random DT people and that can be bad.  And the golems are the main reason to go.<br />
<br />
If you need a map of fear eqmaps.com has a good one in the free section.  Have the mage run north till they get to the flame wall, DO NOT GO THRU THAT, had our one 55+ mage do that once and we had a nice time getting his body out =\ then have him follow it, go to the right.  Have him learn what see's thru reg invis and stuff.  Uhh the imp model things, sacrlings i think do see thru invis, and the pumpkin heads that drop the ranger axe see thru it.  But if you know the path and you know what to avoid it isn't hard to get there.<br />
<br />
I dunno if they changed it but i believe you can still bind in pof some people have there mage bind at nwall.<br />
<br />
If you can understand what i am talking about you might need help etc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It just seemed like the Aggro radius was HUGE.  Things would come running from way across the zone, that the crack team could not even see.  So that was where the assumption of Fear being nerfed or changed someway.  I believe the crack team had one or two CoH's in the groups for that purpose.  To get us all there.    We were to camp as soon as we got there, but seeing as the crack team died over and over, it turned into a huge CR.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your responses.  Hopefully I can get in on a few to try for my tear.</div></div><hr />

Dread does NOT spawn the Iskar Child, or at least he didn't on the raid I was in.  Since he's the one who has the DT, I'm just as glad not to mess with him (or at least be the one who has to go after him).<br />

Just wanted to note I think this is a terrible idea.  The Fear zone in is a very dangerous place and nowhere you want to stop for 8 seconds while waiting for a call.  <br />
<br />
My guild always zones in invis, makes our way (forget direction, straight and slightly to the left of the zone in) to the wall.  If you get aggro, stop and die, noting loc for CRers.   Do NOT train camp.  When everyone gets there, fight like hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No offense, but if you are having issues with Fear... start planning a Nes and Rak raid now.... Each has it's challenges but can be dealt with if properly prepared...</div></div><hr />

Don't stop just run around, and camp out as soon as you get cohed, after they changed it to certian distance sometimes if across zone the mobs don't forget (huggles VI!!!!)  And get sow too<br />
<br />
Just get sow and invis and run around for 8 seconds, with my monk i stay fegined at portal and drag anyone that dies to NW corner for a sk or another monk to get.  Never had any big trouble with it and only seen max maybe 3 people die getting cohed in, done it this way atleast 5 times.<br />
<br />
But if you are looking for fun i advise just zoning in camping out a cleric and everyone die fighting.<br />

<br />
Don't know what you mean.  I am having issues with Fear, but have done Neh, and have 3 or 4 mages lined up for Rak.  Neh was easy, and Rak shouldn't be a problem.  The sticking point is Fear.  Without doing Fear, there is no point in preparing for Rak, surely?</div></div><hr />

This is true of golems then?  I was lead to believe that they were randomized like Cazic and all the other bigger mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The three golems are Dread, Terror, and Fright.  They are only 3 day cycle give or take an hour or so.  They are popped after every patch, including mergency patches, just like all mobs.  You probably need about 25-30 peeps to take em out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been up a LOT the last month or so, mostly with a friendly guild (Tempest Draconis) that really has their act together.  They generally CoH.  The initial skulking about to get to the N Wall is the only difficult part.  The subsequent zone in and CoH has been flawless.  Zone in, stand there, POOF!  Running around (and agitating the denizens) is the last thing I'd really recommend.  Much easier pulling if you don't get them all annoyed and woken up first.<br />
<br />
The &quot;zone in and fight&quot; works well for raids with large numbers of people.  It'll also let you know who the folks who can't listen are.  They're also generally the ones that'll be grumbling loudest as you're on the gruelling CR after the wipeout they caused training the camp.<br />
<br />
Eoin, you were up lately, you notice any difference?<br />
<br />
This last time, things certainly did seem to be buzzing about a bit more.   Everything was popped, though.  I wonder if that's just the extra love Cazic and his cronies bring with them.</div></div><hr />
