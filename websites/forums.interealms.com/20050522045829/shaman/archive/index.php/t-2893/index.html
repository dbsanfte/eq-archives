<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  <br />
<br />
I am a 43 (44 tonight hopefully) level shaman.  I am looking for some gear upgrade advice from other shaman.  I believe I have some good pieces in some slots but i think my shoulder, neck, legs, wrists and maybe back need work. <br />
<br />
I am also getting to the point where i need to work on resists since I would like to try the planes at 46th level.  In addition to the gear in my inventory i have a pair of platinum jasper rings to use when i need additional wisdom.  I have about 8k to spend buying new stuff.  BTW I have found Gornit in OOT to be a good money maker if anyone is looking for a rich mob at around 39+ level.  <br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated.<br />

<br />
face - enshrouded veil - 10 FR<br />
shoulders - tattered mantle - 10 DR<br />
neck - ivory collar from Chardok - 10 PR/DR<br />
feet  - black fur boots, tribal war boots, JB<br />
hands - JB, CC gloves, coldain (Nice hitpoints on these)<br />
chest - iksar regen bp<br />
wrists - dragon hide armor from WW<br />
legs - jarsath, no drop from KC, those quest legs from GD<br />
<br />
Specifically resist gear:<br />
head - froglock crown +20 FR/CR<br />
shield - crested MM shield +10 PR/DR/MR, SBS +10 FR/CR/MR<br />
2 velium diamond rings +8 all<br />
2 velium jacinth rings +14 MR<br />
sabre tooth amulet +15 MR<br />
2 blue diamond earrings<br />
2 blue diamond bracers<br />
<br />
Don't forget when planning resist gear, MR &gt; all other resists.  Even if you're resisting a dragon's fire spell, you're not going to be doing any healing or debuffing if you spend the whole fight running away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First and foremost:  Get an iksar regen BP.  Regen &gt; All.  <br />
<br />
Easy upgrades to get your AC up:  JB arms, boots, gloves, tattered mantle (each 100-400 pp)<br />
<br />
Sentry bracers are a nice mid-range wrist item with resists.<br />
<br />
Glori's resist advice is good.<br />
<br />
Ditch the cloak.  :)  Lots of good cloak choices if you're willing to spend a little (+10 wis acrylia cloak, +8 wis arctic wyvern, 20 ac / 25hp seahorse cloak, etc.)</div></div><hr />

Refer to this thread, check out other shamans' equipment around your lvls for the ideas.<br />
(That was the point of making that thread I believe?)</div></div><hr />
