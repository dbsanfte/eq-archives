<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hope you got a chance to watch the game last night. It's a really special time here in North Carolina. Fans are excited, carowhina sucks rocks and the team is just playing great.<br />
<br />
TA is running through people, and he's a freshman. Rivers is just an outstanding leader. Forget the ugly delivery, the up and down stats, he is making things happen on the field.  Offensive line is just pancaking people. Great group of receivers.<br />
<br />
Defensively - well Terrence Holt is a PLAYMAKER. Shawn Price had a quiet game, but he is a playmaker as well.  Essentially they pitched a shutout last night against a team that rang up 20+ on Georgia.<br />
<br />
Special Teams - possibly (with the exception of our horrid field goal kicking) the strength of the team. The TD return on the kickoff was a fluke, the kids got excited when they saw the ball on the ground and left their lanes.  <br />
<br />
Really fun time to be a Wolfpack fan!<br />
