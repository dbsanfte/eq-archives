<br />
Character Creation and Development <br />
Which race should a beginning shaman be? <br />
<br />
In the end game, there is only one class who gets a raw, inherent combat advantage over each other and that is Ogre.  With the highest base Stamina and the inherent front side invulnerablilty to stun, that alone gives them an advantage no other has.<br />
<br />
If you prefer more to the soloing game, both Troll and Iksar have the advantage of inherent regeneration, albiet with the sharp price of an experience penalty as well.  Though Iksar can not wear plate armor (including the fabled Jaundice Bone Bracer) they recieve inherent ac bonuses, excellent racial quests and are easily the match of Trolls.  If you DO choose to go troll, and are aiming for the high end rewards, Cazic Thule Trolls are the only shaman capable of doing Iksar Shaman quests which, although tedious, are POTENT items to ANY Shaman's arsenal.<br />
<br />
Barbarians, though, recieving no inherent bonuses, nor infravision, are the light race choice with an excellent newbie area adjacent to their city, the ability to take advantage of a majority of quests and a solid physical base to go with their strong wisdom base.<br />
<br />
If RP is your style, it's your choice, but all of these have</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget to cover Vah Shir in the starting race section.<br />
<br />
Here's an attempt while waiting for more emails to flood in at work:<br />
<br />
All races have their strong points but can quickly be summed up to some positive and negative issues:<br />
<br />
Barbarian:  <br />
Pros:  Good starting Wis.  Good faction with all &quot;light&quot; cities.  Smallest exp penalty.<br />
Cons:  Poor night vision but is quickly overcome by your own spells.   &quot;Cookie cutter&quot; shaman<br />
<br />
Iksar:<br />
Pros:  Natural Regen helps reduce downtime for all of your levels.  Small bonus to Natural AC.  Planes armor usually concidered superior to the other races' armor.<br />
Cons:  Highest exp penalty.  Faction is poor with all cities other than your starting continent.  Unable to wear Plate armor including the fabled JBB.<br />
<br />
Ogre:<br />
Pros:  Highest natural stamina and unstunnable from the front.  Generally accepted to be the strongest race at lvl 60.<br />
Cons:  Faction work will be needed if you wish to go to most cities.  High exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Trolls:<br />
Pros:  As with Iksar, Natural Regen will help with downtime.  Worshipers of Innoruk can get a quest necklace that casts Snare.<br />
Cons:  Higest exp penalty shared with Iksar.  Same faction issues as Ogre<br />
<br />
Vah Shir:<br />
Pros:  Sneak and Safefall give some small advantages in some zones.  Faction and Exp Penalty is comparable to Barbarian.  Damn sexsay looking<br />
Cons:  Food consumption double normal races.  Starting cities on Luclin - not recommended unless you have a high-end computer.<br />
<br />
Starting Stats on all races:<br />
It is generally concidered that your two most important starting stats are Wisdom and Stamina.  Stamina is one of the hardest stats to raise and will give you more HPs at high levels, HPs can be converted to Mana with our Cannabalize spells.  The general consensus is to split your points between the two with more stamina being a more &quot;aggressive&quot; tactic that will make lower levels harder to play but have a larger payoff at high levels.<br />
<br />
Did I miss anything else notable?<br />
<br />
Taladaen - shaman of 54.8 winters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AAXP:<br />
<br />
The general consensus is to hold off on most, if not all AAXP points until you've reached level 60.  If you spend a large amount of time inside dungeons run speed 3 might be a choice you make.  Once you do go for AAs, Cannabalize V is the goal you should strive for.  Rabid Bear and Alchemy Mastery are lacking and are not recommended until you've got nothing else interesting to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which race should a beginning shaman be?  <br />
<br />
DO I hear neighing?  Cuz this is a dead horse.  Every class possesses its advantages, it's up to you which you like best:<br />
<br />
1) Barbarian: Lowest exp penalty of the possible shaman races, not ugly :D, can equip JBB, *good* faction standing.  Anyways, not like faction matters as much anymore with Luclin if you don't kos yourself to Shadowhaven/Bazaar.<br />
2) Troll: Natural regen, can quest snare necklace (right click level 8 necro snare, lasts around 30 seconds, farily easily resistable), can equip JBB.<br />
3) Ogre: Can't be stunned from the front, can equip JBB.<br />
4) Iksar: Higher innate wis and ac (not 100% sure about ac), starts out with 100 swimming, natural regen.<br />
5) Vah'Shiir: No clue.<br />
<br />
I believe ogres and trolls start out with the highest amount of stamina too = more HP's.  <br />
<br />
What is the best way to spend AA points?  <br />
<br />
A lot of people start out by putting 3 points into run.  Might sound illogical since we have sow, but comes in handy in dungeons.  I like to pull sometimes, and the faster I get back to camp, the less chance I die.  Or if some typical noob trains me, I'm a catch back up to him, re-tag him with mobs, and head straight to zone :D <br />
<br />
As for stat points, I'd first work on the ones which are important to shamans but that you neglected when you created your character.  I had put no points into wisdom for example, so I trained that after run 3.  You can splash your points around, but after having spent 6 points in general, I'd move to priest abilities and spend 12 points there to be able to progress to shaman archetype.  <br />
<br />
There are a couple nice abilities for priest archetype, and if your intention is to be able to train for shaman archetype asap, I'd put 12 aa levels in for 3 mental clarity points.  Mental Clarity 3 will enable you to start training Cannibalization which can be extremly useful for downtime.  <br />
<br />
Raid-wise, Mass Group Buff is also vital if you have Khura's Focusing.  Some other nifty skills, but if you want more info, check this &lt;a href=&quot;http://eq.castersrealm.com/archetype/default.asp?Action=Cat&amp;ClassId=4&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; out.<br />
<br />
What good is wisdom over 200?  <br />
<br />
Pre-Luclin, having wisdom over 200 didnt help much.  You'd get on average 1 mana per extra point of wisdom, and in that respect, it was much better to get +mana gear once over 200.  It might have changed with Luclin, I don't know, but I still wouldn't opt for 255 wis at the loss of mucho AC.<br />
<br />
Are any stat buffs worth casting? Which ones? <br />
At lower levels, you want to have your hp's and ac buffed.  Shamans get 2 different lines of AC buffs, agility and those little yellow shield icons which use up abjuration.  <br />
<br />
As for hp's, the only buff you'll have at first is stamina, but eventually you'll be stacking targ/tuna onto it.  <br />
<br />
At 24, you get your first regen spell.  I don't think I need to go lengths to explain why regen is so important.<br />
<br />
At 29, you get bearform.  It increases wisdom by 5 and regen by 1 point/tick.  <br />
<br />
If you have a proc'ing weapon, buff your dex up too; if you don't, don't bother.<br />
<br />
Then at 49 you get Harness of the Spirits.  Although I personally never need the str and dex in combat, I always cast Focus (level 60 upgrade to HoS) on myself because:<br />
1) It gives more hp than the standard hp buff, which at 49 would be Altuna and at 60 Kragg.  <br />
2) I can always use the extra strength because my inventory is always fullacrap.<br />
<br />
Haste... I know some people like to play battle-shamans, but it's best to just give your pet haste imo if you're soloing or melees if you're grouped.  If you have no problem whatsoever keeping up with mana, then knock yourself out and add to the damage output :cool: <br />
<br />
<br />
How do I get started with Alchemy?  <br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqshaman.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Personally, I havent trained alchemy in a while, and although the idea does sound appealing, I think alchemy is a lost cause.  I've trained it up to 70 for trivializing on shrink potions, and a couple potions out there as useful such as sow and ivu, but unless you got a lot of cash and patience to burn, I wouldn't recommend putting too much effort into the skill.  <br />
<br />
I make sow potions for my monk, shrink potions for fun, and ivu potions for undead-infested areas ie Lguk, Kaesora etc.  <br />
<br />
I was looking at the list however, and there are a *couple* useful potions I could make use of like Skin Flame and Greater Rejuvenation, but even for those I'm only thinking about high end solo encounters.<br />
<br />
If you're thinking gate potions though, forget about it.  Way too expensive to make, long cast time, takes high alchemy skill, and now people can make thurg potions anyways with pottery (a much less expensive tradeskill).<br />
<br />
Why is alchemy so expensive?  <br />
<br />
To make a potion, you need 2 or more reagents (ingredients).  Most of them are sold by NPC vendors and therefore they can charge whatever damn price they want :p   Some reagents are relatively cheap like the ones needed for sow, but some are ungodly expensive like the ones for gate to InnoSwamp/Everfrost/FoB.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;cannidancing&quot; and how do I do it?  <br />
<br />
Basically, when you med, your mana increases every 6 seconds (assuming you're not starved).  So what a shaman does is stand up right after he notices an increase in mana, casts canni, and sits back down in time for the next mana increase.  <br />
<br />
Cannibalize I has a casting time of 1.25, so this gives the shaman ample opportunity to canni and sit back down in time - same thing for Can II and Can III.  Can IV is 2.5 seconds, but it's still doable.<br />
<br />
I want to solo with my shaman instead of grouping. How can I solo effectively?  <br />
<br />
This is totally dependent on level.  There are several different solo stages in a shaman's life and accordingly different soloing styles.  For any given stage, you even have several possible strategies.  The following I have to offer is based on my own experience, and by no means encompasses all forms of soloing:<br />
<br />
1) Pre-pet, I guess it's root, dot, kite.  For the AC freaks, I suppose it's doable by tanking the mob head on, casting slow, dots/dd's, and bashing it with some high dmg weapon like a velium brawl stick.  <br />
<br />
2) 34-45:  If you're soloing outdoors, shaman pet is an excellent addition to your solo capabilities.  I didn't use it as a tank, but as a manafree dot nipping at the mob while it was chasing me.  Dots are best used in this scenario imo.  Remember that if you use this method to put the pet on /notaunt.<br />
<br />
If you're soloing indoors, I'd be very careful with pets because of pathing and aggro.  Pets have a hard time following you when there's a lot of twists and turns, and since they're quite a few levels lower than the shaman himself, his aggro radius is much larger.<br />
<br />
3) 45-59: All JBB for me, which kinda sucks if you're not iksar.  I'd pull with slow, then tank it all the way while chaining my bracer.  This doesn't go to say soloing for iksars is out of the question, but it's a little harder.  They can still tank the mob head on, but instead of chaining jbb, they'd cast like dots or something, and epic when they get it.  Epic is nice too.<br />
<br />
4) 60 (with malo and torpor):  Hardly ever use jbb, just don't have the time when the mob is doubling for 150-250.  I sometimes tank, but not all the time.  If my pet can get aggro, the fight will be slower, but it makes it that much easier for me because I won't be interrupted.  But basically for high end encounters, I think it's safe to say oracles chain torpor and canni all the time.  <br />
<br />
I also mentionned malo because some mobs would be almost impossible to solo without (or exceedingly risky if you dig euphemisms).  I can think of seahorses in siren's ghetto for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is &quot;slow&quot; and why should I do it?  <br />
<br />
A slow is a debuff which reduces the mob's attack speed by X%.  It starts as low as 11% at level 5 and goes up to 75% at level 60.  Trust me, once mobs start hitting for over 100, you'll realize how vital it is.  I'd say by the time you get tagars you will notice a significant change in efficiency, not only because of the percentage increase in slow, but also because mobs start getting less and less wussier ie giants in FM and whatever in OT.<br />
<br />
Okay, I know why I should slow, but everything seems to resist, these spells use a lot of mana! <br />
<br />
Some mobs have higher natural resists than others.  Slow is kinda messed up in the sense that it's now considered a disease but it has a magic resist check.  <br />
<br />
If you feel the mobs you're fighting resist your slows too often, ask the chanter to tash on a regular basis.  If you got a bard, ask him to sing mr debuff song until mob is slowed.  If you got a mage, ask him to malise. If all else fails, try to malise him yourself.  Use a low-mana cost one and chain it until it sticks.  Malise has the advantage of generating very little aggro, and if it sticks, at least you know the mob is definatly slowable (unless the mob is naturally immune to slows despite his resists - not something really worth retaining, but I'm just pointing this out in case some smart (_|_) decides to point it out :p).<br />
<br />
Fungi Tunic, shaman or monk item?  <br />
<br />
Both.  I'd say these are the 2 classes that use fungi the most.  Monks use it for soloing (just like any other melee class would) and for regenning while FD/in combat.  Shamans use it for regenning hp in combat and for canni.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which stats are most important for choosing equipment? (Wis/HP/AC)  <br />
<br />
Nothing left of the horse to beat on, the termites ate it all ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, so what equipment should I use at level ##?  <br />
Honestly that's a little vague and again leads to a dead horse dispute.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't Verant make a Jaundiced Bone Bracer for Iksar shamans?  <br />
<br />
Balance.  Iksars share the troll's innate regen, have higher base wis than trolls/ogres/barbs, and they start out with 100 swimming.  Other than faction and exp penalty, iksars generally have &quot;superior&quot; base stats compared to any other shaman race (except maybe Vah'shiir, I don't know much about cats).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I heard the Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a powerful item, how do I get one?  <br />
<br />
JBB drops in 4r in Sebilis.  You need to first quest a key to be able to enter that zone.  To get the key, you need to kill the froglok forager and hunter in Trakanon's Teeth, and loot their nodrop medallions if memory serves me right.  The give those 2 in to some spectre dude on a red throne in the same zone, and you'll have your Trakanon Idol, which is the key to Sebilis.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't start thinking about grouping in Sebilis till about level 53.  That's when I started, and even then you might have troubles finding a group simply due to higher level shamans also lfg.  And with Luclin, you now have more high level players crowding these dungeons for AA exp.<br />
<br />
How should shamans be balanced?  <br />
<br />
An oracle with the right spells is already way overpowered.  I've always fantasized about getting snare, but that'd be like cheating imo.  <br />
<br />
What's the deal with Torpor and Malo spell drops?  <br />
<br />
They typically only drop off level 60+ Kunark mobs although Juggernauts in Seb supposedly *can* drop them (just very very very rarely).  These mobs are emperor (Sebilis), Tolapumj (Seb), Protector (Seb), Trakanon (Seb), Gorenaire (DL), Sev (EJ), Talend0r (SF), Prince (Chardok), Overking (Chardok), guardian wurms (SF), etc*.  Problem is, most of these mobs take full raid force (for the average 50+ guild) and malo/torpor are considered rare drops.  Therefore, the first copies would be reserved for guild members.  <br />
<br />
Now more and more these spells are being farmed, which means increasing supply, but the demand is still very high atm.  However, I do expect with the increasing number of manaburners that these spells will eventually drop to a reasonable price.  Manaburn is just sick.  1 group of MB'ers, /wave Gorenaire.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Sontalak (Western Wastes) can also drop malo and torpor I believe, but he's more of an exception the rule.<br />
<br />
Where do I get my high level spells? I can't find them anywhere.  <br />
<br />
Either they're dropped by mobs or merchants sell em.  Those merchants would either be in Firiona Vie or the Overthere.  I've never been to the Overthere, but in FV the spell merchant is in a hut close to where the boat docks.<br />
<br />
I think all 50+ Luclin spells are dropped by mobs.  The level 52-54 ones are dropped in easier zones like Fungus Grove and the level 55+ ones in harder zones (dunno where exactly, bought all of my 55+ Luclin spells).  The level 60 ones like khura's focusing are dropped off high level boss mobs like Doomshade in Umbral Plains.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks nektar.  i'll compile those answers with others.<br />
<br />
as for &quot;dead horse&quot; topics, thats the whole point of the FAQ in the first place.  with a FAQ up, people should be less likely to post these topics and beat the horses even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stats:<br />
The short answer:  They don't do much.   The longer answer:  They do a little bit, but not too much.  <br />
<br />
Str:  Will increase the average damage a hit will do.  Since tanks swing very often, you want it to be as high as possible and it'll add up over time.  Blacksmithing (and possibly more tradeskills) use Str as an alternative stat to base skill increases on.<br />
<br />
Dex:  Increases chance of learning offensive skills and making a weapon &quot;Process&quot; aka proc.<br />
<br />
Agil:  Increases chance of learning defensive skills and adds a small amount of AC.  Note:  Agil below 75 will take a larger hit against AC<br />
<br />
Wis:  Amount of mana for Priest type spellcasters.  At low levels +mana items will usually benefit you more but they cost more.  At 200 the amount of mana you get per point of Wis is not as significant but has been improved from the past.  Tradeskills use the higher of Int or Wis (and occasionally Str)<br />
<br />
Int:  Same as Wis but for Int casters such as Wizards, Mages, Necros and SKs.<br />
<br />
Charisma.  Break points for buying &amp; selling from vendors are 75, 103 and 132 (IIRC.  I'm not as sure about 103 it might be higher).  You want this as high as possible when buying or selling from Vendors.  There is a frequently debated point on whether this stat helps slows, fears or charms to land but there is very little statistical evidence to back these claims up.<br />

 Character Creation and Development <br />
<br />
Which race should a beginning shaman be? <br />
<br />
Play what you want. Experiment and have fun. Realize that Trolls, Ogres, and Iksar are not liked in too many cities. This can be a blessing in disguise as you have more targets of opportunity.<br />
<br />
If you consider yourself a &quot;power gamer&quot; and in a rush to get to 60 with the best options consider a Troll worshipping Innorukk.<br />
<br />
 What is the best way to spend AA points? <br />
<br />
Two thoughts on this.  One, spend none until 60. Two, spend six at 51 to get Run 3, and Regen 3.<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Skills, Statistics and Abilities <br />
<br />
 Are any stat buffs worth casting? <br />
<br />
This depends on your role and your mana. Suffice to say the effect of getting Charisma &gt; 105 is known. Getting Agility &gt; 75 is also a plus. Much of stat buffing is something you need to experiment with and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
 How do I get started with Alchemy?  Place 1 point into it (at your trainer at level 25. Realize the cap is ((Level - 25) * 5) +5.<br />
<br />
 Why is alchemy so expensive?  The diety of your choice only knowns young Shaman.<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Playstyle techniques <br />
 <br />
 I want to solo with my shaman instead of grouping. How can I solo effectively?  <br />
<br />
Two and a half methods. The first is the root and dot. This is pretty self explanatory. Root the MOB, sit a safe distance away and DOT (Damage over time spells) until MOB dies. The benefit to this is you're gaining mana back as the MOB loses health. The downside is your melee skills suffer.<br />
<br />
The other method is the pull with slow method. (Your Txrgxrs spell line). Make sure you have all the appropriate AC, Hit point, haste and melee buffs.  Then you can fight the MOB down. The downside is your downtime may be greater. <br />
<br />
The hybrid of these is root, slow, dot, then melee the MOB down. The upside is you are combing of a Shaman strengths. The downside is your downtime may be greater.<br />
<br />
 What is &quot;slow&quot; and why should I do it? <br />
<br />
&quot;Slows&quot; (again your Txrgxr, walking sleep, drowsy), affect a MOBs attack speed. You do it because you get the best slows in the game, you can take a pounding better than the Enchanter (who can also slow), and in the current EQ paradigm, Shaman slow.<br />
<br />
Okay, I know why I should slow, but everything seems to resist, these spells use a lot of mana!  <br />
<br />
Try casting the Malx spell on the MOB prior.<br />
<br />

Equipment and Gear <br />
<br />
 Fungi Tunic, shaman or monk item? <br />
<br />
Honestly - both. <br />
<br />
 Which stats are most important for choosing equipment? <br />
<br />
The answer to this depends on your play style. If you find that you have too much mana but are getting reduced to paste, try switching out some Wis for AC gear. Conversely if you can melee great, but are constantly OOM, look to add a WIS piece or two.<br />
<br />
At higher levels resists and health make a big difference.  <br />
<br />
 Why doesn't Verant make a Jaundiced Bone Bracer for Iksar shamans? <br />
<br />
 Too piss off Krakster and the other suitcases. <br />
<br />
 I heard the Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a powerful item, how do I get one? <br />
<br />
The JBB drops in Sebilis Crypt. Sebilis requires a key to enter, and Crypt requires a Rogue.  Altenatively you can save money and buy one.<br />
<br />

Class Issues  <br />
<br />
How should shamans be balanced? <br />
<br />
Shamans are one of the best all-around classes in the game. A Shaman CAN solo from 1-60. There isn't a lot that needs to be done with the Shaman, just very minor adjustments to Shaman spells and Alchemy.<br />
<br />

<br />
What's the deal with Torpor and Malo spell drops? <br />
<br />
Rare by design? faulty programming?  Location? Take your pick. Torpor makes a soloing Shaman a soloing HEYOKAH.  Malo is an UNRESISTABLE debuff that makes a lot of encounters MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
Now the fact that the vendor purchaseble Malx is a near common drop instead of Malo is shoddy programming. <br />
<br />
However, if you are blessed enough to be in an Uber guild I recommend Veeshans Peak, and Kunark Dragons. <br />
<br />
 How do I do quests in the Plane of Air <br />
<br />
Go to the keymaster on the port up island. (Ugly dwarf in silver armor). Buy the 1 copper key (looks like a jade) and click on the teleportals located around the port up island. One will take you to the quest givers.<br />
<br />
WARNING - You cannot get out of this room except by dropping back to EFP. (Duel death may work - not sure)<br />
<br />
WARNING - The quest givers are underneath and will aggro if you use AOE spells while whacking the Faeries.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't tell Sirran the Lunatic to &quot;go away&quot; either :D  Cleric friend of mine tried that, promptly got wasted.  Then I told this other friend of mine ***?!? 'cause I didnt know how that happened.  So like he was explaining it to me, except he said the cleric said &quot;go away&quot; in /say channel, so he promptly got wasted too :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />

Character Creation and Development <br />
Which race should a beginning shaman be? <br />
<br />
<br />
Barb-- it's what Nixx was.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the best way to spend AA points? <br />
<br />
<br />
Get everything.  It's what Nixx would do.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Skills, Statistics and Abilities <br />
What good is wisdom over 200? <br />
<br />
<br />
It allows you to more wise, like Nixx.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are any stat buffs worth casting? Which ones? <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, Nixx casted them all.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I get started with Alchemy? <br />
<br />
<br />
Make potions, it's what Nixx did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is alchemy so expensive? <br />
<br />
<br />
It's not expensive if you're Nixx.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Playstyle techniques <br />
What is &quot;cannidancing&quot; and how do I do it? <br />
<br />
<br />
How Nixx gets mana quickly.  Study Nixx closely.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to solo with my shaman instead of grouping. How can I solo effectively? <br />
<br />
<br />
Learn from Nixx.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is &quot;slow&quot; and why should I do it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Slow allows Nixx to solo anything, anything at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, I know why I should slow, but everything seems to resist, these spells use a lot of mana! <br />
<br />
<br />
It's all in the wrist, Nixx is never resisted.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Equipment and Gear <br />
Fungi Tunic, shaman or monk item? <br />
<br />
<br />
Nixx had one, sounds like shaman to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which stats are most important for choosing equipment? (Wis/HP/AC) <br />
<br />
<br />
Nixx liked the end game loot that had all of those stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, so what equipment should I use at level ##? <br />
<br />
<br />
What Nixx used.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why doesn't Verant make a Jaundiced Bone Bracer for Iksar shamans? <br />
<br />
<br />
Because Nixx was a barbarian.<br />
<br />
<br />
I heard the Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a powerful item, how do I get one? <br />
<br />
<br />
Solo him like Nixx did.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Class Issues <br />
How should shamans be balanced? <br />
<br />
<br />
With a duck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't these two spells stack? <br />
<br />
<br />
Because Nixx did not have them up at once.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Spells <br />
What's the deal with Torpor and Malo spell drops? <br />
<br />
<br />
They are rare, becuase they are powerful.  Like Nixx.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do I get my high level spells? I can't find them anywhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kill Kunark dragons like Nixx did.<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________ <br />
Quests <br />
How do I get Totemic armor? <br />
<br />
<br />
Kill mobs and turn in quest items, like Nixx did.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the Spear of Fate and how do I get one? <br />
<br />
<br />
It's Nixx's spear.  You kill mobs and do some item turn ins.  Then you become more like Nixx.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I do quests in the Plane of Air<br />
<br />
<br />
You kill mobs, and turn items in.  One item you can get from this is a ring with feign death that is rechargable.  This lets you be more powerful.  Like Nixx.</div></div><hr />

Where do I get my high level spells? I can't find them anywhere.<br />
High level spells are either vendor purchased, dropped from specific NPC's, or trade in rewards using a quest. (someone needs to round up the names and locations of our spell vendors)<br />
This thread link has the location of which spells drop where.<br />
