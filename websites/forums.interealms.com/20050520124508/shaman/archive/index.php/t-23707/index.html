<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rakey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just went out and purchased the store version of OOW (as I'm tired of being excluded from rewards for saving sony packaging costs with online preorders) and finished the install.  When I tried to run everquest to start exploring the new zones, I was welcomed with a patch.  &quot;No biggie, same ole same ole&quot; I figured.  Until I looked at the ETA...  6 hours (on lower end DSL (26.4kbps).  It is downloading what looks to be all of the zone files.  Has anyone e)lse had this problem?  If sony shipped this disk with faulty zone-files on it I'm going to be rather ornry.<br />
<br />
Didn't they say a few weeks back that they were delaying the release of OOW in order to work out several class balance kinks?  Methinks they delayed the release of OOW because they're inept and used the class balance as a nice red herring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can start dling files before the expansion comes out in the patcher settings.  I ran it last night when i went to bed to get caught up as much as possible, the actual patch wasnt that big or long to dl if you did that.  saves some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rakey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shouldn't all of the files for the expansion be on the expansion installation disk?  Pardon if that doesn't make any sense...<br />
<br />
Edit: lol and I'm noticing on this nice poster of all the class epics that the ranger one is missing.  Has it been designed yet?  Are rangers being 'phased out'?!?!  Or does sony need some new management?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wonder if since I played in the beta, if I even need to install anything?  Should I just activate my account key and see what happens?<br />
<br />
Did you all also notice that this time they decided to just completely do away with any kind of manual? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Filur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When i ran the download i got the manual<br />
<br />
Omens_MANUAL.pdf<br />
<br />
Located in main Everquest library<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ordered it online, and when I logged in last night, I only needed to download 10 mins-ish worth of data.  It was a welcome surprise compared to other people in my guild that took a hour on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont' get that... you buy it retail you get an &quot;extra&quot;. I would of thought it would have been the other way around, they get all the profits when you download, less production cost for them. Sigh... that's SOE for you I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree I ordered OoW when the first Pre order thing was available.  I think We should get a BIG bonus for doing it that way.  Ok so you get a key ring AND an item in game for buying the box for the same price.  We get nothing....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They used to charge less for digital downloads, since you were saving them packaging costs. They stopped doing this.<br />
