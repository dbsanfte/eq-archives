<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I admit im not that good at pvp yet and I need some help with rogues.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to knock a rogue out of stealth before he attacks? I know he is there but im helpless until he attacks. From what I understand damage will remove stealth. Will a AE damage totem work on rogues that are stealthed?<br />
<br />
This is what seems to happen...<br />
 We see each other,<br />
 Rogue stealths then sneaks in and saps me.<br />
 performs a couple of specialty moves before i can move again.<br />
 I scamble to get away from him and heal up.<br />
 i then start kiting him if i am able to survive the initial flurry.<br />
<br />
Right now i am level 32 with Natures swiftness and working on improved ghost wolf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes. snare totem should knock us out of stealth too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any AOE that hits a rogue will break their stealth. Earthbind and that timed explosion you get should both work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People using a see invis buff will obviously be able to see the rogue and break his stealth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Except its still a range &amp; level check so its not a complete lock. Also it only works for the 180 degrees in front of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And if anyone can fire off a dot or similar (say, hunter's mark), they're unable to stealth during the duration (up to 5 minutes for the longest ones, I believe).  So I guess your challenge is to hit that short term fire dot shamans get before he can hit his stealth key.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I beat a rogue twice by hittign him over and over and over again with frost shock while backing up he never landed a hit. I have talents about shocks (reduce recast increase crits and reuce mana costs) and i had half a mana bar when i won the duel :)<br />
He wanted a rematch and i did the same thing lol funniest thing ever :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahh soul, remember, duels favor all classes but rogues, they cannot start from stealth. Did he use vanish? Did he sprint? Did he land crippling or mind numbing poison on you?<br />
<br />
Frost shock is a serious ability though, I am glad I do not have to face shaman in real pvp.<br />
