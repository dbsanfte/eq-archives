<br />
It's interesting what a hormonal change can do to you.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm still losing weight, even though I've added my doctor's recommended 250-300 calories per day to my diet. From my 180 on March 26, I'm down to 174. Six pounds in three weeks - and I'm pregnant. (No, almost no morning sickness)<br />
<br />
Before you tell me it's not healthy, I already talked to my doctor about it. She has me keeping a food diary so she can closely monitor that both the baby and I are getting all the nutrition we need, but she said that at my height, starting weight and frame, she wouldn't be surprised if my net gain over the course of the pregnancy were 5-10 lbs (185-190 by the 9th month). Apparently my metabolism is just catching up with my diet and exercize over the past months.<br />
<br />
And by the way, I don't think my chest is EVER going to fit my old shirts again. I was a 36C before my first child, now I'm a 38D and rising....</div></div><hr />

I have been trying to gain weight for awhile (kinda thin for my height).. Ive managed to put on a couple ponds. Now if I can only move it around a bit ill be happy LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and Myrea it is certainly not unhealthy to lose some weight while preggie.  So dont you listen to any but your doctor if they critisize you.  Heck, a former friend of mine was actualy TOLD to lose some wieght by her doctor and how to do it while she was preggie since extra weight could be detrimental to her and the child.  You just keep eating healthy like you are and getting some excersize (not too strenuos) and you should be fine ;)  Happy to hear your losing too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I'm not weighing myself officially but I've lost a few inches to be sure as I'm not getting back into some clothes I have not worn since my Freshmen year in college.<br />
<br />
Got a ways to go til I consider myself back in Soccer shape but I am working on it.<br />
<br />
And Tymoria... DAMN... errr yeah I think you have a beautiful mind... (don't tell my wife I said that.)  I know many women don't like the big breasted thing but umm... its not all that bad on you really I would even say DAMN again :p.<br />
<br />
Also Tymoria you didn't happen to go to school in the South Houston area did you?  Both you and boy in the picture look familiar for some reason.<br />
<br />
And Myrea don't fret over the weight thing too much.  Keep up with the nutrition for obvious reasons but my wife (who had bad morning sickness which might have contributed) actually lost weight while pregnant and Kaiti (our daughter) is just fine... in fact Kaiti is mega active, can eat like a horse and she just keeps getting taller... in fact she is this skinny tall 2 year old with no baby fat at all.<br />
<br />
My concern is she is going to keep this skinny and tall thing up and I'll be getting grey hairs worrying about the boys at her school oggling her.  I know.. I was once one of them :D ... I wonder how many father's of daughters I put into mid-life crisis... and I know Karma is looming around the corner for me in a few years.</div></div><hr />

and the ummm. . . overendowment I suffer from is more of a pain than you would think.  ever spen over $40 for one piece of under-clothing?  Then with fashions these days aimed at skinny minnies I cant find didly to wear anymore lol, the undergarment stores are full of bra's to make it LOOK like you are endowed, but they have nadda for people who are already there rofl.  I go in and get told routinely that I'm SOL and have to order from the catalog or the web sigh, I have a dress to wear for my friend's wedding that has lacing across the BARE back, what in the Planes am I supposed to do??  They dont MAKE convertable bras in tripple D and I CAN NOT go without, I wouldnt subject anyone to that lol *shudders at the thought*  My only option in sight is lose two sizes upstairs before September 7th :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now you sound like my wife.  She is not as blessed as you are but she isn't far off the mark either.  She is looking into having surgery as our insurance will pay 80% of the cost.  It makes me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the only reason I havent gone for the knife is because I used to be a single D, I only got larger when I got onto BAD BC and gained SEVERE weight (from 140 to 205)  I know for a fact that when I gain and lose weight the first spot to change is the uppstairs areas, so If I manage to get way back down to 130 like I was just before I met the hubby then I will be back to normal.  If your wife is planning on losing weight she should NOT get the surgery, often people get knifed, then lose weight and lose even more than they planned on losing.  It isnt an operation to be undergone lightly for certain, although back aches tend to argue otherwise lol ;)</div></div><hr />

Well good luck to you, but think about another option. I don't know how low the back really is, but maby an all-in-one? I have a rather low cut evening gown for a Christmas party, and I was able to find an all-in-one undergarment (You know,they kind of look like a one-piece bathing suit) with a halter style top in sizes up to DDD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now she isn't all busty and perhaps I'm misplacing where this idea would work cause she was trying to &quot;enhance&quot; her tiny breasts but she one day to my shock as I walked into their living room was using packaging tape to &quot;push&quot; up her breasts.<br />
<br />
Now I have no clue if this would work but from other stories I've overheard from her and her friends it seems like tape can solve a lot of the figure problems with breasts..<br />
<br />
Just throwing out ideas here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just do not want to think of the women's pain of tearing the stuff off though, seeing I have duct tape I put on some *gasps* ducts around the house still holding after 3 years......<br />
<br />
And congrats on the weight loss, Tymoria :-)<br />
<br />
One thing to remember, humans tends to be quite subjective to weather changes.  I'd recommend doing exercises in the spring to work off all the extra pounds put on during winter.  There's some biological and psychological reasons spring is /the/ best season to loose weight via exercise, but the net effect is, it's much easier to loose fat during the spring time :-)</div></div><hr />

and yes, the back on the dress is just above waist hieght before it turns bare with corset-like lacing accross the back, it is a very pretty dress, but right now it IS the bane of my overendowed existance lol  I will have to speak with my seamstress, with any luck she is WAY better than the one I had for my wedding ;)  THAT one told me to STOP working out so she wouldnt have to do another fitting. . .and she wasnt kidding!  I still ended up tripping over my hem the whole way down the aisle *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the same principle can help you here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
*shakes herself out of it and revels in the ego stroking*<br />
<br />
all kidding aside though, I truely hope this new BC does the trick, if we cant find one that doesnt put that weight back on me again I will probably end up asking for a more permanant solution.  Neither I nor my husband enjoy the thought of having kids, we were both worse than brats as kids and little versions of us would be WAY much.  We both want to enjoy things as long as we can, but I dont see us enjoying much when I cant keep up cause of BC side effects sigh.  This oarticular one isnt the only one by a long shot, hell I was so emotional at the appointment she said she might put me on either Welbutren or the PMS prescription drugs.  I was literaly going misty eyed and weepy several times during our appointment lol.  There has to be a better, more effective form of BC than this that I can trust.  (and I dont trust many, I myself was a failed pill!)<br />
<br />
I am eating healthier now, I will be getting a bunch more excersize in soon, my moodienes hasnt QUITE yet subsided. . .but the weight loss is a HUGE plus.  It means at least one thing I wanted to fix is getting better now, so all the others may return to normal soon too :)</div></div><hr />
