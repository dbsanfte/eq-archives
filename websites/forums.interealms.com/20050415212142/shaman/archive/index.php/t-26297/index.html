<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe we should forget feeding SOE class balancing information, and make up a new top 10 list that can be accomplished with relative ease.<br />
<br />
Take our current Top 10 list:<br />
<br />
1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  [currently being evaluated]<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. [new item]<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast.  [new item]<br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. [currently being evaluated]<br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. [new item]<br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  [new item]<br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
<br />
As a coder for SOE, I&quot;d look at that and just say.. &quot;Hey boss, I'm taking next week off&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thats why we need a new top 10 list.  A list thats easy to do, and will have much greater rewards than silly things like healing or dps.<br />
<br />
My proposal:<br />
<br />
1.  New chain graphics.  <br />
I'm tired of seeing the same chain graphic from level 1 - 70.  I've gone thru 10 tunics I bet, and not one has looked different.  I get way less cyborz than other players, and its crushing my ego.<br />
2.  Barking Dogs.<br />
I for one, am fed up with howling.  And why wolfs all the time while we're at it?  Can't my spirit call summon forth a random assortment of barking dogs?  Couple collies, a few chihuahua, and maybe a pug or two?  <br />
3.  Upgrade to Slow.<br />
Ok, not your typical upgrade.  But if they intend to keep mitigating (pun intended) our primary ability, at least make it entertaining.  I want bigger flies damnit.  Real nasty horsefllies.  And the mob had better swat and swing his fists around between blows.  I mean. are those flies doing something or not?<br />
4.  FA and Panther Cast Animations.<br />
Ok, these just are the lamest things ever.  Have you seen the troll boogie?  Waving my arms in the air and squatting like I'm dropping a big... you know what.  How about some chanting.  Maybe bounce around for a bit like a rain dance.  Anything remotely 'native' looking.<br />
5.  Chance to crit buff.<br />
We are THE buffing class right?  Might as well crit them.  3% chance for Panther to do 1100hp per proc sound good?  You betcha.  Chance for Acumen to have xray vision, seeing thru a wall or two, uber I tell ya.  Chance for levitate to actually let you FLY.  Oh yeah. <br />
6.  The Troll Run (personal one due to class).<br />
Have you seen my run?  I'm the slightly retarded looking fellow wiggling around like a worm when I run.  I'm just an oversized human.  No need for me to look like I have a broomstick up my you know what.  <br />
7.  Bring on the Rain.<br />
Druids stop the rain. Shaman make it rain.  Seems fair to me.  A little dancing.  A little chanting.  And booom.  Lighting and Thunder.  Of course, shaman rain brings an increased chance to forage due to the healthy nature of the spirit water (oh, and give us all forage grrr).<br />
8.  Head Shrink.  <br />
Ok.. so obvious.  We absolutely have to have the ability to shrink people's heads.  Maybe it grants a slight decrease to being stunned as a bonus:)<br />
9.  War Paint.<br />
Ok, between alchemy, and our brothers in the north's knowledge of tatooing, we should be able to make a fairly durable paint.  Its just an insult to the Native Shaman everywhere that we can't wear any ceremonial paints.  <br />
10.  Talismans<br />
Talisman of fate.  Talisman of.. talisman talisman shalisman.  If this is such a big part of shaman heritage, why can't we make them?  Like a headress of griffon feathers:).  Or, Puma skin war braids tied to our spears, or a necklace of teeth for the love of Innoruk. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are plenty more ideas out there, for items that would make that SOE programmer want to come to work early rather than call in sick.  Lets get to work compiling a list of workable ideas, and forget this silly crusade to keep tanks alive, or be wanted in groups.  Thats just wrong folks.  Lets get real:)</div></div><hr />

Aaaaaaaaaargh! For even jokingly suggesting this you should be shot, quartered, hanged and then drowned. I can already see a light bulb flashing over a SOE developer's head. Two weeks from now we will get &quot;agin plz, n33d cr1t focs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oh, and bear form + shrink already gives you xray vision.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im a shaman and all and i think we need some tweaks here and there<br />
<br />
but there is no need for that entire top 10 list... few things yes .. but you want to much<br />
<br />
increase dps, increase healing, AOE malos(reduced reuse time of malos), reduce dot agro .....<br />
<br />
ill settle for just a semi better healing spell and better reuse time of malos...<br />
<br />
we already have insane DPS... i can pump out ALOT of dps when properly motivated.. so i dont think our dps should be touched...<br />
<br />
As far as AOE malos yeah...even tho it sounds like really good they will not give this to us without a price... which = HIGH agro... you see how often ench use AOE tash.. (hardly ever) cause it means like instant death... im VERY happy current malos agro is really low and i really dont want that to change.<br />
<br />
and reduced agro for dots.... yet again ... great idea but you need to not reach for so much ....maybe just an item with an effect somewhat like our epics focus effect.. or to be honest a whole line of them items just like other focus effects which has different percents of agro reduction<br />
<br />
overall a good post but i think your reaching with alot of it... to be honest... besides our lack of healing and the reuse time on malos.... im pretty happy with shaman class<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I expect to see zero serious posts here Bladefury darn it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1. New chain graphics ... I'm tired of seeing the same chain graphic from level 1 - 70. I've gone thru 10 tunics I bet, and not one has looked different. I get way less cyborz than other players, and its crushing my ego.<br />
<br />
I would love another chain graphic. I'd also like the ability to turn helm graphics off and on, regardless of the expansion they're from. The problem of &quot;getting way less cyborz&quot; could be directly related to the fact that you have gone through only 10 tunics in the last 70 seasons, and could also have something to do with No. 6 on your list. :p<br />
<br />
2. Barking Dogs ... I for one, am fed up with howling. And why wolfs all the time while we're at it? Can't my spirit call summon forth a random assortment of barking dogs? Couple collies, a few chihuahua, and maybe a pug or two? <br />
<br />
I wanna summon a rottweiler!! With a spiked collar!! Spirit Call should resemble dogs walked by those crazy-assed dogwalkers in Central Park, NY, leashes and all.<br />
<br />
3. Upgrade to Slow ... Ok, not your typical upgrade. But if they intend to keep mitigating (pun intended) our primary ability, at least make it entertaining. I want bigger flies damnit. Real nasty horsefllies. And the mob had better swat and swing his fists around between blows. I mean. are those flies doing something or not? <br />
<br />
Yeah, horseflies sound good. I would also like to see mobs proc something called &quot;Flyswatter&quot; on shaman who successfully slow them — you know, sort of a knockback, fly-through-the-air, Ikkinz-2 type thing.<br />
<br />
4. FA and Panther Cast Animations ... Ok, these just are the lamest things ever. Have you seen the troll boogie? Waving my arms in the air and squatting like I'm dropping a big... you know what. How about some chanting. Maybe bounce around for a bit like a rain dance. Anything remotely 'native' looking. <br />
<br />
If I have to wave my arms in the air and pop a squat in the middle of the zone, I want a YMCA dance graphic to go along with it. If I'm going to look like a moron, I want to really look like a moron.<br />
<br />
5. Chance to crit buff ... We are THE buffing class right? Might as well crit them. 3% chance for Panther to do 1100hp per proc sound good? You betcha. Chance for Acumen to have xray vision, seeing thru a wall or two, uber I tell ya. Chance for levitate to actually let you FLY. Oh yeah. <br />
<br />
Ohh, 3% chance for Wunshi to a) buff more HP than Conviction, without blocking it and b) add more mana regen than druid Skin-line buffs! <br />
<br />
6. The Troll Run (personal one due to class) ... Have you seen my run? I'm the slightly retarded looking fellow wiggling around like a worm when I run. I'm just an oversized human. No need for me to look like I have a broomstick up my you know what. <br />
<br />
See No. 1. This is a direct contributor to the &quot;getting less cyborz&quot; problem, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
7. Bring on the Rain ... Druids stop the rain. Shaman make it rain. Seems fair to me. A little dancing. A little chanting. And booom. Lighting and Thunder. Of course, shaman rain brings an increased chance to forage due to the healthy nature of the spirit water (oh, and give us all forage grrr). <br />
<br />
Yeah, and druids shouldn't be able to make our rain stop! If I'm gonna have the ability to find herbs, I don't want some moron turning it off! Karana who?<br />
<br />
8. Head Shrink ... Ok.. so obvious. We absolutely have to have the ability to shrink people's heads. Maybe it grants a slight decrease to being stunned as a bonus.<br />
<br />
Totally.<br />
<br />
9. War Paint ... Ok, between alchemy, and our brothers in the north's knowledge of tatooing, we should be able to make a fairly durable paint. Its just an insult to the Native Shaman everywhere that we can't wear any ceremonial paints. <br />
<br />
No way! Not unless there was an anti-vandalism flag on the warpaint! Otherwise POK would look like some sort of inner-city alley. Which might be an improvement, come to think of it.<br />
<br />
10. Talismans ... Talisman of fate. Talisman of.. talisman talisman shalisman. If this is such a big part of shaman heritage, why can't we make them? Like a headress of griffon feathers. Or, Puma skin war braids tied to our spears, or a necklace of teeth for the love of Innoruk.<br />
<br />
I like the headdress idea. Headdresses made from the feathers of different flying creatures in various zones (think Griffons in Karanas, snow griffons, various birds in Air ...) could be different quests for different levels of the game. And they should override helm graphics!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, isn't that also our dance emote?<br />
<br />
but if you do want to change the way your character moves while casting you can change it to a different emote action I think it may still work.<br />
<br />
/cast #<br />
/flip say tells %T to have a really bad day<br />
<br />
which would then make it so that when you casted bane or some such on the mob that for casting it you would be doing the rude emote gesture and people around you would get the message of<br />
<br />
Jenguran tells An orc pawn to have a really bad day.<br />
<br />
Unsure if it would execute that line in the hotkey though while casting like it used to let ya, knew a cleric who used to do the cry emote while rez'ing.</div></div><hr />

And if we're gonna do warpaint....let us have camo dye for our armor....that way when we send in the swarm of flies, horseflies, gnats, bees, wasps, yellowjackets, hornets and butterflies, we can sit back and laugh as the Big Scary Mob swats away in futility and scratches his shrunken head in confusion, looking around for the Shaman with the forest green warpaint, cammo armor and palm leaf headdress thats standing 5 feet away</div></div><hr />
