<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hamirez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard lots of people saying that chanters are great soloers even without dire charm.<br />
<br />
I have played with all known solo class from 1 to 30 including druid, necro, wizard, mage, shaman and shadowknight and I am looking forward to start a chanter if they are capable of soloing.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me how they do this if they cant snare, heal and give orders to their summoned pets? <br />
<br />
Do they charm pets for it? Isnt it dangerous? I tought that charm spells had random duration and could break at anytime. Does it get better and more reliable with time? Humm. I dont understand. <br />
<br />
Are chanters really so great?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the explanation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They don't dire charm for the real rewards. They use Command of Druzzil, a level 64 spell. Yes it breaks and yes they do die. They also make so much exp that I have seen them blow off rezzes because they can make the exp back faster than it takes to find a rez. I know one chanter solo'ing the Arena pit in PoTactics who makes an AA every 25 minutes. He also cleared 80k in one week on Spectral Parchments. Now as to whether you should do this yourself. Well, I would say unless you have a level 60 chanter ready to go, no. This is the enchanter version of manaburn, they have already nerfed it down once and chances are they will do so majorly at some time in the future and apologize after the enchanters that were already at that level have become rich and all have 300AA. If you started a chanter now and PL'ed him you would probably just get him there in time to see some nerf make soloing a slower more dangerous activity like it is for everyone else. Right now the risk/reward on it is hugely out of wack. I mean who wouldn't trade a few deaths for 20 AA in a day. <br />
<br />
We had a PoT arena group going and a chanter had decided to join us. He charmed a War Boar and was having it help kill. When he got bored he would pull mobs on his own and kill them. He even raced the rest of the group on one to see if we could all kill ours faster than he could kill one of the same type he pulled himself, we lost. His pet could put out 400-500dps, very tough to match in normal exp mode. So, can they solo? You bet. Should you make one just to try to take advantage of it? Probably not, unless you are willing to take the chance of a nerf. And given its present implementation you can virtually guarantee VI will scale it back majorly in some way.</div></div><hr />

Chanter charm doesn't really become effective until at least mid 20's.  The reason is that, before that time, the mobs hit for less in relation to the number of hit points that they have.  As levels go up, they do more damage, but have relatively fewer hit points.  PoP is the upper extreme of this.<br />
<br />
It's possible to solo without charm, especially at lower levels, using pet tanking, stun lock, even ghetto wizard tactics.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are great charm soloers after the mid 20's, but there are some caveats:  charm will break, you will die, you will be frustrated until you learn how to do it.  Use of SoW potions or Jboots or a fast horse will reduce your deaths.<br />
<br />
The biggest weakness that I've noticed is the lack of direct DPS from chanters.  It means if you need something dead *right now*, it's probably not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Check out Xornn's (http://members.tripod.com/xornn/) for a good primer on using chanters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes chanters can solo even at low levels and even with ghetto gear.<br />
<br />
I took a break from my shm (on TP server) recently to join up with some friends on KB where i made a chanter and leveled up to 54 so far. I can tell you for a fact that at every level i was able to solo effectively for xp. Of course i made the chanter for grouping so i can also tell you that you should develop your group skills as well when/if you decide to make a chanter.<br />
<br />
Animations -  they make decent pets, personally i do not recommend using charm without Jboots or sow. I got my jboots solo at 51. started the AC camp at 49. The animations can tank well, just remember to give them a weapon. Chaters get the best haste in game so agro transfers well to the pet when they engage. All u need to do is root the mob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Healing&quot; the pet - i just Berserker str on my pet. It has a componentless 200 hp rune and works well in keeping my pet in the fight for a little bit longer.<br />
<br />
Charm - yes it is dangerous. My style of solo i used the animation a lot because i need to go afk. However i find that the higher level charms are quite good. If you r nervous about charm kiting get a dr00d partner and they can snare the charmed mob for u. Makes it so easy to recharm if needed.<br />
<br />
Conclusion - yes chanters are great both as soloers/group/raid situations. they are one of the &quot;needed&quot; classes. very easy to equip even on a low pop server as KB. Finding spells however is another story. Try out chanter and see if you like. I know i did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got a chanter twink and he's fun to play.  I pretty much do exclusive charm soloing and I think it is a blast.  Definately a challenge and a skill.<br />
<br />
As for dire charm:  Before PoP, DC was good because you could charm mobs (max level is 46 i believe) that were close to the level of the mobs you were fighting, and your DC pet could solo all on its own.  Now, though, DC is a completely different game.  In PoP zones there are a few non-aggresive mobs that sit around just waiting to be DC'd.  They are green cons and cannot stand up to the normal exp mobs.  DC is now a method of adding decent and risk-free DPS to a group rather than soloing.<br />
<br />
It's all about command of druzzil now.  What the previous poster said is most likely correct.  By the time you have a chanter ready to scribe CoD, it will have been nerfed to impotence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also have a low level (25) enchanter twink.  I didn't even bother getting him decent items.  Just set him loose in the bazaar with 1kpp and he bought stuff till he ran outta money.  SO not too twinked at all.  I get him KEI and POTG and run him over to Netherbian and charm a guard, use it to kill some mobs.  Rinse, repeat.  The tricky part is keeping pulls and pet under control.  <br />
I use two stuns to manage this, and liberal self-application of runes.  Pretty much all the cash he saves goes into buying runes.</div></div><hr />
