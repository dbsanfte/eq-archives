It's time for me to leave you all.<br />
Good luck for those who keep playing, and I wish you the best luck for class balancing in a near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Frogs as a playable race - ok.<br />
<br />
Taking the Troll homeland away - not good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd quit too if that was my UI......<br />
<br />
But seriously, all the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd quit too if that was my UI......<br />
I was thinking that, but I'd never say it.<br />
<br />
All the best though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd quit too if that was my UI......<br />
<br />
But seriously, all the best.<br />
<br />
:D you make a good point ;)<br />
<br />
but I used to have another UI.<br />
I deleted everything when I retired in february, but then had to reinstall EQ to give away the non no-drop stuff to a new shaman and to do this final run ;)<br />
<br />
So it is the default UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL -<br />
wish I had thought of that.<br />
Also wish I had the chance to help out a fellow troll by pulling the froggies away from you while you camped.<br />
<br />
Hit suspend billing a couple of days ago, and starting to think about when to offload my droppables and where to camp Baz out.  You idea may be worth copying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Take care.<br />
<br />
Wing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd quit too if that was my UI......<br />
<br />
But seriously, all the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
exactly what I was thinking....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thank ya all for the support, but why good luck ? isn't it me that should say it to you ?<br />
I hope that SOE will do something for the shaman class, but I am fed up waiting for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think people are wishing you good luck with whichever road you choose from this point forward. True though, those of us remaining could use a little too.<br />
<br />
So, farewell and good luck. Or would you rather we said &quot;Break a leg.&quot;? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good luck on your new adventures and maybe we all will find each other on the shaman forums for WoW ;)</div></div><hr />
