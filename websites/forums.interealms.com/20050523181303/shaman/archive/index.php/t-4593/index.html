<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 51 I wouldn't be doing AA at all.  You'll do yourself a whole lot more good to spend all your exp on getting your levels up.<br />
<br />
But once you DO start AA, I'd do (in order)<br />
<br />
Run 1,2,3<br />
Regen 1,2,3<br />
Clarity 1,2,3  (gotta be 55)<br />
Can V (gotta be 59)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think most shaman spend their first six points on Runspeed 3 and Regen 3.  Runspeed may seem redundant for a class that can SoW, but since it works in dugeons it can and will save your bacon.  After that, I'd recommend Mental Clarity 1-3 since it's a pre-requisite to mass cannibalization (our best aaxp ability IMO).<br />
<br />
Having said all that, let me say this -- levelling does far more for you than aaxp.  I waited until 60 before even thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
Barm<br />
<br />
Edit: Final was first this time.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get run2 and leave it alone until you are 60.  Run2 will serve you well b/c you'll be able to outrun stuff in dungeons.  Anything more than that is wasted time, b/c levels will help you more than any AA can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run 3 if noticably faster than run 2 - and IMO run speed is a fun AA skill as it helps you when you are the puller in dungeons :)<br />
<br />
I just got run 3 at level 56, and I'm glad I did. Back to levelling now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unless you are the puller, I would suggest getting only run 1 and then continue on toward lvl60.<br />
<br />
Run1 doesnt let you outrun the mobs if the $hit hits the fan, but it sure lets you pass the slowest person running next to you.<br />
<br />
Levels and new spells are worth so much more than aa's. At lvl52 you get regrowth, huge upgrade to chloroplast. Arguing that regen3 is worth the time before even getting Regrowth sounds very strange to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now that we can get Improved Durability as a Priest Archtype at 55, You need at least 2 levels of Improved Natural Stamina to get it.<br />
<br />
But as a Shaman, levels help you more than anything else does.<br />
<br />
My current Axp path is;<br />
Run 1<br />
Improve Stam 2<br />
Natural Regen 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Cani5<br />
Improved Natural Durability 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My current Axp path is;<br />
Run 1<br />
Improve Stam 2<br />
Natural Regen 3<br />
<br />
<br />
are you serious? taking natural regen 3 over run 3? with ND in i would think the &quot;standard&quot; shaman aa path would evolve to:<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
stamina 3 (or stamina 2 regen 1)<br />
MC3<br />
Cann V<br />
ND3<br />
icing (regen 3, mgb, qb, rabid bear, use your imagination)<br />
<br />
i really don't think 2 extra hp per tick even comes close to being on par with outrunning mobs in a dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im not doing any AA until I get to lvl55.  Too many cool spells to get at those lvls to put off exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no AA till 60....<br />
gonna go like this tho<br />
3 run<br />
3 regen<br />
3 clarity<br />
can V<br />
<br />
the rest is gravy</div></div><hr />
