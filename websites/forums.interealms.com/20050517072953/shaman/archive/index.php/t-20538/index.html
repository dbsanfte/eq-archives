<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didnt really do much banging around yesterday or the day before, so when I logged on today, me and a few guildies and some pickup peeps went and started some LDON crawling in Guk....right off the bat I noticed HUGE issues with targeting... I had to stand in the middle of a group of mobs and had to spam F8 and move back and forth to target adds, and had real trouble targeting people in the group unless I clicked their corresponding F key or clicked on their name in group.<br />
Really frustrating adventure and the entire group had massive lag, several LDs with 1017 errors and it eventually ended with a win with 19 min to go.<br />
We were a high DPS group with a rogue, beastie, necro as DPS, warrior tanking, cleric and me for support, I AOE'd as much as possible and we killed plenty of mobs, but it still took us over an hour for collect 26..simply unnacceptable patch problems.<br />
To release a patch with such issues really doesnt surprise me, its happened before, but one would think that they would have learned by now.<br />
Sorry for the rant, hope I am the only one here with the troubles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed similar targeting troubles on Ldons.  It is very difficult to select a mob using the mouse.<br />
<br />
On one Mir Ldon a ranger in the group kept on getting stuck on scenery.  I think he was backing up to use his bow, and would bump into a vase, or chair, and then be stuck on it, and would spend five or six minutes trying to move again.  Happened two or three times, and was rather annoying.<br />
<br />
Hopefully EQ will not need too many more patches to fix all the problems with the latest patch.  Maybe by the end of next week they will have the bugs ironed out of that patch, and they can work on new patches for us to beta test.<br />
<br />
Still I have to say I like the way the stars look.</div></div><hr />
