<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies got my new UI up and am ALMOST happy with it...the new icons really bite :mad: <br />
<br />
I have downloaded the icons that our fellow shaman have created that closely match the old ones and it has helped a great deal, but I am still not happy and still have to search through my spellbook.  I also have a 51 wizzie alt and talk about a messed up spellbook now :(<br />
<br />
Soooo my question is how difficult is it to get the old icons back or to change the new ones?<br />
<br />
p.s. I am not a computer guru so please in simple terms :) thank you!!</div></div><hr />

Also a nice how-to-install, too.<br />

Edit:  can't seem to make the clicky link a new color.</div></div><hr />
