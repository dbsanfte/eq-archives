<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if there is a shaman helm that has decent stats with the leather graphic.<br />
<br />
I'm love the old trolls models, but I'm sick of the 2 horn look from my totemic helm :( <br />
<br />
Think the leather cap graphic looks much more...shamanish :)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't want to have to wear a lumberjack cap just for the look :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
<br />
Just remembered the arctic wyvern cap...but does anyone know if it has a normal leather look?  Seems like I remember it being different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes!  There is a great hat that drops off the &quot;good&quot; rats in DN, the Spirit Talker's Headdress. It is no drop and shaman only.<br />
<br />
I've been trying for a YEAR to get guildies to go camp this thing with me with little success.  It's a rare drop, and the mobs are hard.  I'm actually scared to think about those rats and the NPC caster changes.  They are all sowed, they all gate/run, they hit like trucks...Good luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive a suspicion that Arctic Wyvern is without a graphic, Othmir Fur certainly is.<br />
<br />
Bit tricky for me to think of a mid-higher range hat with a leather graphic as Iksar helms are all a little confused, whats leather on another race doesnt always tally up with what it looks like on us.<br />
<br />
The only other tradeable helm with the leather look that I can think of is a Cowl of Mortality, which um, isnt easy to come by nor likely for a priest :)<br />
<br />
I seem to remember an ND helm drop in Kael looking like leather but cant remember the name of it, lots of resists but not great stats else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Possibly a circlet of vallon (+18 ac, +9 svFMD) which has a leather look, and is obtained by a quest in Kael.  It makes for a pretty decent piece of headgear for my resistance kit...<br />
<br />
Kill coldain missionaries until one drops a book.  Return it to Semkak Profit of Vallon (near the arena) and he will reward you with one of a few items (book of strategy, steel wristband of strategy, shield of battle or the circlet).   Semkak can also drop the reward items if killed.<br />
<br />
Probably a bit tough for you to do at your level though unless you had significant help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah...not looking for anything really hard to obtain.  After I remembered the arctic wyvern cap, I figured that would be the only thing I could get right now.<br />
<br />
The 10 wis on the cap will let me get rid of those gawd awful tribal war boots(the looks, not the stats) and replace em with something that has more AC..like JB.<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Long range goal, you can hope for an Ancient Burrower Flesh Cap. It is endgame type equipment and has great stats (click on my profile below if you would like to look at them). Also, as an extra added bonus, you not only get to have a leather hat look, but a fairly unique leather hat look. It is black leather hehe. What i am hoping to find out is if that would mean on barbies it would look like a black bear head helm :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Paeblas are not that hard to camp. Don't pull them to entropy serpent area, past the pool. Go to their spawnpoint directly. AFAIK, the first platform outside water has only 2 spawnpoints, with 3 roamers. The 3 roamers are in water so they shouldn't aggro. Only one jumps out at the end of his route. There is room next to the 2 platforms that has a crapload of paebla in it, have a monk pull em, or SK.<br />
<br />
Spirit talkers are not to worry about, cast Talisman of Epuration and when they end up casting shaman dots on you, too bad you resist all of them. If they slow tanks, cure tank, yadda yadda yadda. You can stun a good majority of the Spirit Talkers, some might be unstunnable due to level. Just have all melee/pets on one side and it shouldn't gate.<br />
<br />
Dual wielding rats are not pushover, especially for puller. They are hasted and have very low delay. Once slowed they're easy money.</div></div><hr />
