<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Verant seems to have changed my favorite hunting grounds in the teens and 20s. <br />
<br />
I currently dont have SoL (for some reason every time i try to install my computer locks up. When i finally made it through the entire install and tried using a key to update my account it said that i already have this expansion updates but i only have my account updated to kunark and velious so apparently its not even seeing luclin.... but thats a side matter) <br />
<br />
I used to hang around oggok and kill the pyramids and inside cazic thule from levels 12-32 but now im at a loss. Unless shaman have gained so much power since i left that a level 20ish can solo a level 55ish mob which i highly doubt :p <br />
<br />
So... any ideas? Im level 16 at the moment. <br />
<br />
Oh I have been hunting in oasis. Not really my cup of tea personally. Orc highway is just low con add after low con add which would be great if i had a dmg shield but i dont. Gators wouldnt last me even if i had them to myself since they seem to spawn so far apart anymore (I could have sworn gators used to be more common.. i remember groups hunting them now all i see is like 2 people at a time and usually they are fighting mummies and spiders since they run out of gators)</div></div><hr />
