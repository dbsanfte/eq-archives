<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing for somewhere around 4 years and have almost always played my main, a ranger.  I have a few alts that I've started over the years, a 30-ish warrior, a mid-20s rogue, a 30-ish mage, and a 62 shaman.  Every now and then I jump on one or the other just for a little variety.  <br />
<br />
However, for a long while (say the past year or more), grouping with these characters is just terrible.  First, there aren't many low or mid level characters running around these days, which is understandable given the age of the game.  Second, when I do get a group most of them are awful - constant afks, greedy looters, and very stupid mistakes caused either by being ignorant of their class, or just not plain not caring.  This is why my only alt that has made some progress leveling is the shaman because he can solo.  With that shaman, I've noticed that the overall quality and fun of groups starts to go up in the mid 40s and 50s.  <br />
<br />
So my question is this:  In today's game, can you still have fun starting a brand new group-dependant alt?  Or am I being too negative and maybe have just had a really, really unlucky run of bad group experiences?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed my berserker up to 33 and then did some LDoN grouping for a change of pace and while I did find some people had no idea what they were doing (ranger taunting over a warrior and never snaring) most people are doing a good job.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I can go back to PLing if I want to really move the xp bar, but at least so far my grouping experience at mid-levels has been positive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recently created a wiz alt and the limited grouping I've done has been fine.  In most cases I've had my 57 druid there and was just PLing whoever I was grouped with, but even then, the people generally seemed to know what they were doing (chanter keeping clarity on, cleric watching everyone's health, etc.)  I also did an ldon adv (terrible xp at 30 btw), and the players were just as good as I normally see at 65 - which was needed because we had 4 dress wearers, a cleric, and a BL for MA.  (i.e.: agro control could have easily been an issue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KeiriV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A few of my friends who quit EQ just came back to the game so I created an alt to group up with them.  First off I would like to toss a /rude to PC.  Kiss my butt for taking the effort out of XPing in this game as a lowbie.  Screw you twink gear for being so easy to purchase now :b.  I can see why we have in influx of level 65 idiots.  All the effort it took to get high level is gone.  We have been going and doing the old zones like Befallen, Unrest, Runnyeye etc just for kicks.  Some high levels have never even heard of those zones :(.  /sigh.<br />
<br />
I am still having fun though so I guess thats what counts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would guess most people leveling up at this point fall into two catagories:  the true newbie and alt of a high level character.  Both are going to be making stupid mistakes.<br />
<br />
The true newbie doesn't know all the abilities of the different classes at the different levels.  He doesn't know that the ranger is not supposed to taunt over the warrior.  (I mean, they get Taunt, right?  Aren't they supposed to use it?)<br />
<br />
The problems from the alts come in two flavors.  Why are they playing the alt?  Most likely because the are sort of busy and don't want to commit the time to logging on and getting the buffs, or they want to play a character that they really don't care about.  The second thing is people will level their alt's so fast they don't learn the fine details of their characters for a given level.  My personal screw up was hitting the wrong hotkey and my paladin and casting Flash of Light on the wrong target.  Um....  Can you say Runner?  Can you say Train?  I knew you could!<br />
<br />
Still, the answer (from me, at least) is Yes, alts can be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play alts all the time, but usually dou a pair of em or pl em if they melee. Most newbs I run across and alot of 60+ people also are complete morons because its to easy to get to 65 with uber gear without learning a damn thing about group dynamics, etiquette or even what each class can do or can't do.</div></div><hr />

It was real funny seing how many who didnt have a clue as to how to get to Lguk, let alone find there way to a camp down there  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This exact post was posted on the Glade so I'll just port what I said there =p<br />
<br />
I still have lots of fun with my alts, I still find just as many good players (alt or otherwise) as bad players.<br />
<br />
Sure I get frustrated by n00bness more so than in the old days but thats more due to the time I've played and the knowledge and play I've grown used to expecting higher level.<br />
<br />
The only times I get truely irritated are when folks are playing a class I play and are playing poorly, just gets under my skin. Mostly because I just notice when they just suck or are slacking off more I guess lol.<br />
<br />
All that aside though what fun you have on any char at any level is completely up to you. If you don't like pickup groups low level make your own with folks you know to play well and avoid bad players all together in groups /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a 50 bard and did pretty much half solo half grouping (mostly ldon) to get to 50. Ldon groups are so horrible for me :( atleast 2 out of 6 are complete n00bs. So now i just solo until im high enough to get guild groups. I think its just everyone is level so much faster than they use to so they aren't getting as much exp with the class as they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for some fun, i always whip out my lvl 30 paladin who is in unrest and just solo in the house and basement.  that's fun to me, remembering the old dungeons - nothing will ever compare to unrest, guk, befallen, the hole.<br />
<br />
there was a level of creative design in those dungeons that we will never ever see again in EQ.</div></div><hr />
