<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there! I am thinking of starting a shammy because you're real cool out there with your slows and buffs.<br />
<br />
What race would you recommend me? How important is charisma compared to wiz? Is it important to have a race that tank well?<br />
<br />
Is a shammy a useful group player all the way from 1 to 65 or when do you guys peak socially? ;-)<br />
<br />
Can a shammy solo play all the way from 1 to 65 or are you group dependent?<br />
<br />
Hope you can help me out. Thanks!<br />
<br />

Race: whatever you want. Remember these things... Iskar can't wear JB armor, Trolls &amp; Ogres have XP penalties, Barbs can't see in the dark.<br />
<br />
Wis is the most important. Followed closely by HP (sta) and AC (agi)... CHA is a ongoing argument.<br />
<br />
Yes we're useful all the way to 65. Buffs get easier in the 50's. Your play style will change at 24 when you get canni and regen, and will change again when you get your pet in the 30's.<br />
<br />
We can solo if one wants to. I hear it's hard to solo after 62 though. (I'm 61 and can solo fine)<br />
Try to duo with a tank type though, it's lots easier.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is good that you want to start to play a shammy, personally the cha isn't something that your should make your toon over. Regen helps but isn't everything.<br />
<br />
Shammies are always going to be great group players starting when you get your first buff.<br />
<br />
Us shammies can solo well, but not like dr00ds, more then likely our soloing is root/rot/slow/tank or root/rot, etc. But you will rarely see a shammy doing more then one or two mobs at once, although we can usally take a few more if we manage the mana well.<br />
<br />
Going solo all the way to 65 will burn you out before you reach 20, it is possible to solo all the way, but not that great on the mind, we truely shine in groups, if you want to solo to 65 make a necro or a dr00d.<br />
<br />
If we are in a group, the group can now take things that they couldn't previously, because we slow like no other and the stat buffs help from time to time.<br />
<br />
Now leaving race last, I personally didn't want to pick a evil shammy race for RPing reasons, and I didn't want to be night blind either so that left me with the Vah Shir which I don't regret to this day. As a Vah Shir you have great safe fall, which helped me because I like jumping off tall things, and the innate sneak factor.<br />
<br />
But again in the end as most will tell you, it all depends on your playing preference, some like to play some races and others don't.<br />
<br />
Oddly we get cha buffs and a pair of those +25cha steins are easy to come by so Wis &gt; Cha in my books.  As a shammy we are no wussies, we don't care to be hit when you compare to other classes such as a wizzy, chanty, etc.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that should get you started. Also if you want to wait you could start a froggie shammy, but I wouldn't trade my kitty in for anything...well almost anything...<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck with your new shammy, feel free to /tell me if your ever on Povar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">real quick:<br />
<br />
1) there are certain advantages to every race, but when you reach higher levels these racial bonuses become less and less important.  pick the race you find most appealing for any reason.  min/maxing does not always equal fun<br />
<br />
2) charisma means nothing to us.  wisdom is where we get our base mana from, although this is not as important for us as other mana-dependent classes, since we can turn our HP into mana.  i'll let others debate this one, but I'm a fan of moderation myself, go for it all.<br />
<br />
3) groupwise, we contribute a HUGE amount to any group.  <br />
<br />
4) we're one of the top 3 soloing classes when we want to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rofl, we need a gnome shaman, now that would be something. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the help all. Especially Redspeed ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why does everyone always seem to forget Vah Shir. Unless it's out of jealousy cause:<br />
1. we start at level 2<br />
2. have 2 newbie zones with trainers, merchants and a bank.<br />
3. have plenty of trade skill quests to keep us occupied while hunting.<br />
4. we are sexier<br />
5. we have the most balanced stats.<br />
6. we can sell and train almost anywhere with sneak<br />
7. we dont have to wander in the middle of innothule or everfrost at level 5 for our dot spell.<br />
8. we have a newbie quest that starts at level 1 and ends in the 50s<br />
9. we have a cool hot tub on top of the roof of the palace.<br />
That's it for now. Bottom line is go with a kitty for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't forget Froglok.  Iksar aren't the only cold-blooded shaman race any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Remember these things... Iskar can't wear JB armor, Trolls &amp; Ogres have XP penalties <br />
<br />
True, but Iksars also have an exp penalty, even a higher one than Trolls and Ogers...<br />
However, we have a better regeneration and and awesome look! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah, Iksars have worse exp and cant use JBB.<br />
<br />
Hmm let me think.<br />
<br />
Besides Trolls are fun!<br />
<br />
And i believe the regen is the same with iksar and troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi fellow shammies. My sponsor Garam went with the awesome looks and created me.<br />
<br />
He thinks I'll just be an alt. He's in for a surprise. I'll soon pass his measly lev 43 and cook him up for dinner. Wood elf. Yum yum :D<br />
<br />
See you around!<br />
