<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whilst reading the articles at RPGExpert.com came across this on on the concept of a 'Battle Shaman' and thought the folks here would like it:<br />

One could extend that, Ganga, to say that endgame shamans will not be doing much at all.  At least until things change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ive tanked in earth before  ... actually its kinda fun</div></div><hr />

6.2k unbuffed...<br />
<br />
<br />
well were talking about none super human shaman ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fennin has been tanked by atleast one shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nah i was tanking way before i got alot this gear litgruv :P   <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
edit :get it right 6.3   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've tanked Earth too!  LOL its not that hard if you have a cleric or druid that know how to heal at all. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I soloed a gator in Earth on a bet (another shaman bet me I COULD, I didnt think so, heh)<br />
<br />
I love to tank, personally. I yell at chanters who try to mezz in LDoN normal, cause I wanna tank one. I fight anything that hits 300 or lower and can be slowed toe-to-toe. I have soloed many mobs that summon, including the Sol Ro guys. <br />
<br />
The term &quot;Battle Shaman&quot; truly appeals to me. Honestly, if I HAD to say &quot;SOE, give me a skill usable in groups&quot; it would be &quot;I wanna tank and melee DPS&quot;. I love my Sharkspine, and if I ever get a TA, it will be for the clicky more than anything (well, in raids, I guess the hps, too)<br />
<br />
I would love to see Shaman Melee power revived. The AA's just arent good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No you haven't, remember we can't main heal in earth, much less tank</div></div><hr />

<br />
SEE!! I just KNEW I couldnt do it! I kept telling him that, but he just said &quot;If you die, I will log my cleric to rezz ya, but I KNOW you can if you have Sharky and FoM3&quot; (he checked my gear, said I had it made, heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like maths</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have tanked a few raid mobs, but one thing I DONT do (at least if I have any hopes of surviving) is use melee on them. one riposte for 1k+ is probably the end of your tanking spree. sure shaman can tank well into the 50's, depending on where you fight you could probably do so into your 60's, who cares? shaman melee is so pitiful that tanking a mob would actually be slower exp than rotting once you get BoS and BoU. our pitiful dps vrs mob dps just doesnt add up late in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">who cares whats more efficient? its FUN to tank.. plus theres the whole bragging rights thing.. what looks better?<br />
<br />
&quot;i just tanked ____ and pwned his ass&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I 'tank' stuff all the time. I haven't botherered meleeing anything since high 50's though, as ripostes would do more damage to me than any melee DPS I put out. If I get one of the decent EP 400pt proc weapons (sharkspine, staff of eternal flames etc) I'll give it a go again.<br />
<br />
A good 2h blunt and a JBB in the lower levels is great fun though, I spent many happy hours thumping the crap out of stuff ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've ended up tanking quite a bit when duoing with a monk in PoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well again I'm going to go against the grain here. Shaman historically ( and yes I know this is a game) lead and fought in battle. I would like to be able to melee well and secondarily support my troops..heals last hehe. However, I'm aware this is not likely to happen but I can dream. Have a good one all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wasn't it on here somewhere in the past that shaman were originally designed as a battle shaman, but then they turned this design into a beastlord instead?<br />
Melee shaman, I played 2. The first I played by conventional means, the 2nd I chose a troll and played melee until about low 50s. Shaman are really a nice progressional class 1-50 for playing melee or playing normally. When I quit, I was 65 and meleeing was something that was not viable to do, although I had a staff of eternal flames and rabid bear. Thats the nearest thing you get to doing anything decent melee wise damage, or that 1hb from water.<br />
For my melee wantings I started a ranger and rogue, it gets boring after a while anyway, so I didn't regret having a shaman over a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Doesnt this thread say a lot about what is wrong with Shaman and some of the people who play them ?.<br />
On this board for months people have been saying &quot;we're useless as a class endgame etc&quot; then you get a post like this.<br />
Just makes me wonder sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That article sucked. Seriously.<br />
<br />
Here's how ratio works! Here's how haste works! Here's shaman weapons!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When my old guild was raiding ToV (pre-PoP), we had a troll shaman that would off-tank adds. Damndest thing I ever saw at the time and to this day I still don't know how he did it with Kunark and Velious gear.</div></div><hr />
