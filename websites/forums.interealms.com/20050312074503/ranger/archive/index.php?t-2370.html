<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played a Ranger to 20 in DaoC, before I started to run out of interest, and came back to EQ.<br />
<br />
I continued to sputter at DaOC for a while, but some of the things in it really dissapointed.<br />
<br />
I was wondering how many people are still lurking around that played DaoC Rangers?<br />
<br />
I am worried that the things that killed DaoC will work their way into EQ II.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Things I hate about DAoC that effect EQ II ( leaving off other issues, although I have a bunch with DAoC) <br />
<br />
The comments in [] are my comments on how to not have that happen in eq<br />
<br />
o Trivial code on grays meens 100% no farming of anything ever. Becoming powerful and revisting an area is fun and builds attachment<br />
<br />
[Items should have level MINIMUMS, never maximums, they should not &quot;go gray&quot; and suck. Minimums keep people from being overtly twinked with items]<br />
<br />
o Equipment wears out  before you can become attached to it -- life in DaOC is one long revolving door of equipment.<br />
<br />
[Same as above. Its one thing to make people use level apporpraite equipment, its another to make every item you own so transitory. ]<br />
<br />
o Speed of Movement in DaOC is so god awful slow, its like living in a molasses universe<br />
<br />
[No game should be as god awful slow as DaoC. Ports should be kept in. I assume DaoC is slow for RvR fairness or something]<br />
<br />
o Nerf Ping pong. DAoC seems to have a big problem with leaving imbalances in for a long time, then nerfing them so far that they over do it. This happened bad to Archers, and others.<br />
<br />
[They should design and test the crap outa EQ II on paper. I think this is going to be better. They know how people try to cheat the system, they know peopl's mentalities amd play styles and habits going in better this time]<br />
<br />
o Anti-twinking code ends up making the game boring. Between decay, level restrictions, etc, trying out a new char is no fun.<br />
<br />
[Discourage rampant blatant twinking, ala Fungi and Venom Axe pre nerf, not mild twinking ala Black Alloy and BABS]<br />
<br />
o They said player crafted items would be good, but drops are still better and easier enough to make people not care about crafted items. Plus no auction channel our extra-city chatting make it hard to sell.<br />
<br />
[Make it easier to sell and advertise your wares. Make high end crafted items worth taking a look at. Imagine if DAoC had the bazaar channel like eq now, sometimes the suspension of the rp (chat channels, etc) is better for everyone]<br />
<br />
o No Extra-city shouts or ooc, make it impossible to get the &quot;chatter&quot; that makes you feel like you are playing online with other real people, and makes LFG worse, that stupid LFG tool be damned.<br />
<br />
[NEVER, EVER, remove chatter from zones]<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Anyway, those are my thoughts. I think EQ II would really suffer from being too much like DAoC in some ways.</div></div><hr />

1. First few lvls were fun as the game had just came out and there was no trouble finding a group. After the 38 it was like pulling teeth to get in a group even if you have friends. That caused things to drag out.<br />
2. RvR was unbalanced totally.... No resist gear to get those damn insta mez. One-shot kills and bladeturn were BS everyone had Bladeturn.. Insta Stun lasted WAY to long.<br />
3. RvR Lag... What a joke. You need a few people to take a keep about 40 or so and a 100 for a relic.. With 40ppl in a area plus the defenders you could not move at all!!!! Unreal Lag. Then add in Relic raids and having all three sides involoved at once with 75ppl in a area and you have NOT MOVING. Then you have the Video Leakage which made you go LD or booted to desktop and when you get back on your keep is taken.<br />
4. They did not beta test this game long enough at all and it is really showing. They are not fixing the issue that area at hand, but instead adding new problems.<br />
IF!! I were to play DAoC again I would not RvR its to much of a pain in the arse. Unbalanced. . .<br />
<br />
I like EQ its not perfect. .  But it is fun for me I dont have to be wierd about lvling and having green armor or logging on and finding a group... EQ I pop on and get one rather easy..<br />
As for EQ 2.. Dont nowto much about it. Hopefully they beta it well and make sure the mechanics work right.. and not patch it in 6 months down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">debaser71</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't play EQ anymore but I did have a 52 ranger. Some people might remember me, anyway<br />
<br />
Instead of playing a Ranger in DAoC I play a Warden. I think a Ranger that can not heal isn't really a ranger. Anyway I think DAoC is practically the same as EQ except there is RvR. <br />
<br />
Most of the issues brought up here are either no longer issues or soon not to be issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;o Equipment wears out before you can become attached to it -- life in DaOC is one long revolving door of equipment. &quot; <br />
<br />
I don't know, I get gear and it lasts for a few levels, then i need to upgrade. Sounds like EQ to me only the gear is DAoC has a /consider. I'm sure that Banded Cloak that level40 ranger is wearing in EQ would /con grey.<br />
<br />
&quot;o Speed of Movement in DaOC is so god awful slow, its like living in a molasses universe &quot;<br />
<br />
True but Wardens get a run speed chant, part of the reason why I chose Warden as my class.<br />
<br />
&quot;o Nerf Ping pong. DAoC seems to have a big problem with leaving imbalances in for a long time, then nerfing them so far that they over do it. This happened bad to Archers, and others. &quot;<br />
<br />
This is true, but when I left EQ Verant was still altering the game mechanics. And anyway archers in DAoC are good at RvR but not as useful in the typical XP grind PvE group.<br />
<br />
&quot;o Anti-twinking code ends up making the game boring. Between decay, level restrictions, etc, trying out a new char is no fun. &quot;<br />
<br />
You can still twink and PL in DAoC just not as much as in EQ. Anyway the real issue when twinking in DAoC isn't an anti-twink code, but hard caps on stats. In DAoC a level can equip an uber item but their damage will be capped as if they were using a level appropirate weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;o They said player crafted items would be good, but drops are still better and easier enough to make people not care about crafted items. Plus no auction channel our extra-city chatting make it hard to sell. &quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed DAoC trade skills are useless, drop items are better.<br />
<br />
&quot;o No Extra-city shouts or ooc, make it impossible to get the &quot;chatter&quot; that makes you feel like you are playing online with other real people, and makes LFG worse, that stupid LFG tool be damned. &quot;<br />
<br />
I hated all the /ooc in EQ. I prefer the quite of DAoC. I get plenty of chatter with my guild/group/chat channels set up for RvR<br />
<br />
&quot;1. First few lvls were fun as the game had just came out and there was no trouble finding a group. After the 38 it was like pulling teeth to get in a group even if you have friends. That caused things to drag out. &quot;<br />
<br />
It's true Rangers have a hard time getting into xp groups.<br />
<br />
&quot;2. RvR was unbalanced totally.... No resist gear to get those damn insta mez. One-shot kills and bladeturn were BS everyone had Bladeturn.. Insta Stun lasted WAY to long. &quot;<br />
<br />
DAoC is changing that. Soon resists will effect mezzes and a heal, any heal, will cure a mezz. And everyone does not have bladeturn. My Warden does, but that's his thing. Casters get BT but it's useless vs. assassins. Sure maybe a lone archer has isues with BT blocking their arrows. Moral: don't go RvR solo an expect to shred.<br />
<br />
&quot;3. RvR Lag... What a joke. You need a few people to take a keep about 40 or so and a 100 for a relic.. With 40ppl in a area plus the defenders you could not move at all!!!! Unreal Lag. Then add in Relic raids and having all three sides involoved at once with 75ppl in a area and you have NOT MOVING. Then you have the Video Leakage which made you go LD or booted to desktop and when you get back on your keep is taken. &quot;<br />
<br />
I haven't had too many issues with this. maybe having a decent system with a cable modem helps. But even so Mythic is working on a plan to reduce graphics are players that are far away. Currently the game willdraw every minor detail on all players as long as they are with view distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. They did not beta test this game long enough at all and it is really showing. They are not fixing the issue that area at hand, but instead adding new problems. &quot;<br />
<br />
All MMORPGs go through changes after release. EQ did (still is too). But yeah DAoC was unfinished when released. Now it;'s better but they are still adding stuff. Ithin kthat's good, I don;t wanna play in a stagnant world.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF!! I were to play DAoC again I would not RvR its to much of a pain in the arse. Unbalanced. . . &quot;<br />
<br />
To me DAoC is all about RvR not the xp grind getting there.<br />
<br />
Ok DAoC isn't the best game but for me the RvR is decent enough to almost satisfy my craving for PvP. The xp grind to me is no different than EQ.<br />
<br />
As for EQ2, I don't know anything about it other than I doubt I will be interested, Shadowbane will be out and going strong by then.</div></div><hr />

I hated the game or at least I learned to.  At first I thought great no CR, totally able to solo, neat quests.  But it was booooring.  No consequences to your actions, no reason to communicate with others so it was always silent and I just did not appreciate the stripped down nature of the Ranger.  But if I had never played EQ I might have liked that game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about DAOC is that it makes casual gaming more possible. I have maybe 10 hours a week for computer games. EQ requires far too much time investment, even for non-raid activites for me to be able to enjoy it. DAOC allows me to log in for an hour, get a little XP and loot and still enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neelloc</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think DAoC does many things better then EQ, and that is fine.  I mean you need another product on the market to keep companies aggressive in staying fresh.  Verant would not made half the changes they did if not for DAoC and the other games that came out and forced them to respect the playerbase.<br />
<br />
With that said, I like them both.  Pretty much equally.  Many, many of the issues folks talk about in either game are common in both.  Xp grinds, certain classes not being group friendly, penalty of death, etc are no specific to one game, but of the genre.<br />
<br />
The best thing about DAoC to me was the lack of the zone wide spams.  I could not stand G-fay or commons due to the /ooc, /shouts etc.  Ignore only holds so many folks.<br />
<br />
With that said, I am looking forward to EQ2.  Verant has done a very nice job on the content of Norrath.  Hard to compare and say Mythic has not, as their game world is so new vs Verant's.  <br />
<br />
But with each new MMORPG that hits the shelves, the gaming base expects a more accelerated pace for getting games balanced and content in place.  And that, my friends is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valencia</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played an Albion Mercenary to level 30 and got bored:<br />
<br />
Didn't like the idea of my equipment constantly wearing out -- got very hard to get new equipment since drops were hard to get and not many player crafters selling decent stuff.  <br />
<br />
Zones seemed deserted most of the time -- a little OOC every once in awhile makes the game seem more alive.  <br />
<br />
EXP past level 30 is a real grind -- even worse than EQ IMHO. <br />
<br />
The world is way too small and unitemized when I played -- they may have changed that.  <br />
<br />
Running around was brutally slow, especially if you had no run buffs.  <br />
<br />
Finally, not enough variety in spells and skills.  Each class just keeps getting the same spells/skills for the duration of their life -- boring!!!<br />
<br />
Good things about DAoC is that it is better for the casual gamer.  You get all your stuff and spells (re-memmed) back when you die -- wish EQ would give you some option to get your stuff back without having to do a 3-hour CR.  The game engine was very solid -- didn't crash or lag that much at all.  <br />
<br />
EQ just has so much more depth and content -- and non-decaying, twinkable items is a VERY good thing!</div></div><hr />

o Trivial code on grays meens 100% no farming of anything ever. Becoming powerful and revisting an area is fun and builds attachment<br />
<br />
[ Items should have level MINIMUMS, never maximums, they should not &quot;go gray&quot; and suck. Minimums keep people from being overtly twinked with items]<br />
<br />
<br />
Items do NOT have maximums.  In fact, the lower the con of the item, the slower it wears out.  Its just that, as in EQ, the attributes of the items usually are worthy of replacement by the time the item is grey.  There is basically no difference between EQ and DAoC in this respect.<br />
<br />
<br />
o Equipment wears out  before you can become attached to it -- life in DaOC is one long revolving door of equipment.<br />
<br />
[Same as above. Its one thing to make people use level apporpraite equipment, its another to make every item you own so transitory. ]<br />
<br />
There is some truth to this to levels in the high teens or low 20s depending on the class you're playing.  Having not played an EQ lowbie that wasn't semi-twinked in over a year, its a bit hard for me to compare again, but I'd say that the equipment upgrade pressures are somewhere between 25% and 100% more in DAoC than in EQ during the first half of the game.  During the later half, they are comparable.  Again, there is some difference between classes in this.  With my DAoC enchanter, I've worn lots of green (very low con) stuff because I wanted the stats and the AF (armor factor) wasn't very important to me as I rarely get hit and if I do, I rarely survive anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
o Speed of Movement in DaOC is so god awful slow, its like living in a molasses universe<br />
<br />
[No game should be as god awful slow as DaoC. Ports should be kept in. I assume DaoC is slow for RvR fairness or something]<br />
<br />
Bard/Minstrel/Skald speeds are very comparable to EQ bard speeds.  There really is no SoW replacement, although some classes have non-music run speed buffs, they cap at 53%.  However, horses are available to everyone and significantly faster than the fastest bard.  Since the mob/camp density of DAoC is much higher than in EQ, you rarely have to travel as far to find a camp spot without competition.  Going from an EQ ranger to a DAoC ranger, I can see why you feel that way, but I don't think its an accurate reflection of the entire travel situation.  EQ is full of travel hassles, very few of which I can justify from even an RP'ing stance.<br />
<br />
<br />
o Nerf Ping pong. DAoC seems to have a big problem with leaving imbalances in for a long time, then nerfing them so far that they over do it. This happened bad to Archers, and others.<br />
<br />
[They should design and test the crap outa EQ II on paper. I think this is going to be better. They know how people try to cheat the system, they know peopl's mentalities amd play styles and habits going in better this time]<br />
<br />
This is stabilizing now in DAoC and it really isn't like EQ has none of these problems either, although maybe to a lesser degree.  I believe that mythic will come to better terms with these issues within their first year than VI/SOE has come to terms, several times, in the time its been out.<br />
<br />
<br />
o Anti-twinking code ends up making the game boring. Between decay, level restrictions, etc, trying out a new char is no fun.<br />
<br />
[Discourage rampant blatant twinking, ala Fungi and Venom Axe pre nerf, not mild twinking ala Black Alloy and BABS]<br />
<br />
This isn't quite true.  You can definitely make a huge impact on your game play by giving a new character level apropriate (or a bit higher) equipment.  With the right types of buffs, like the damage add and damage shield buffs many mages have, you can level a new character to 10 or so with in one to three hours.  During this time it would be beneficial to maybe change armor and weapons once.  If you want, you could even just give the new player equipment that would be appropriate for a level 10 to 15 char and repair it several times.  Don't worry about drops as with the caps on stats at lower levels, (level / 5) + 1, these are almost useless.  The only difference between EQ and DAoC in this respect is that you wouldn't want to equip the new player with equipment that they could use to level 30 or 40 because it would degrade really fast and not make it to those levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
o They said player crafted items would be good, but drops are still better and easier enough to make people not care about crafted items. Plus no auction channel our extra-city chatting make it hard to sell.<br />
<br />
[Make it easier to sell and advertise your wares. Make high end crafted items worth taking a look at. Imagine if DAoC had the bazaar channel like eq now, sometimes the suspension of the rp (chat channels, etc) is better for everyone]<br />
<br />
Players crafted items are definitely better than all drops with the exception of some quest items, some one time drops (otd) and the stats the dropped/quest/otds might have.  The last issue will be resolved when spell crafting is finally put into the game.  The primary issue here is that most players don't understand how the condition, durability, quality and bonuses work on items.  Quality is always at least 90% from player made items now and an upcoming patch will change that minimum to 94%.  This affects not only the effectiveness of the item, but also the longevity of the items.  Most drops are only 85% quality.  Looking at a piece of armor with an armor factor of 100, the dropped armor would actually only provide 85 AF while the 95% quality player crafted would provide 95 AF.  The 95% quality player crafted armor would degrade at a much slower rate also, saving you a lot of money in repairs and replacement costs.  Condition, the attribute that degrades as an item is used, also affects the effectiveness of the item in the same manner as the quality does.  So that 85% quality dropped armor that has degraded to 90% actually only provides 76.5 AF.  Since the &quot;breast plate&quot; and leg armors supply the majority of AF the user actually receives from the armor set, many users will always buy player crafted armor for these slots and then use drops, quested items, otds, etc. in the other slots to gain the attributes they want or need.  This will change dramatically when spell crafting is available.<br />
<br />
<br />
o No Extra-city shouts or ooc, make it impossible to get the &quot;chatter&quot; that makes you feel like you are playing online with other real people, and makes LFG worse, that stupid LFG tool be damned.<br />
<br />
[NEVER, EVER, remove chatter from zones]<br />
<br />
Sometimes I want more than what is there, other times I enjoy the tranquility and isolation from all those idiots in the game.  I would like to have more specific purpose chat channels in DAoC as long as I have the option to turn them off.  I believe these are comming as well, but they aren't in the game yet.<br />
<br />
I finally canceled my EQ account last month after not having played EQ for over a month and very rarely in the month or two prior to that.  EQ was simply a solo xp grind.  While I had some very good people in my guild, only a few were on other that our normal Tuesday night guild events.  I didn't have the patience for sitting at a zone line for more than 15 to 30 mins depending on the night LFG'ing, so I rarely would get a group while the monks, clerics, warriors, etc. would show up after me and get into a group before I left.  Solo grinding xp in the low 50s is just plain work and I don't need more work.  Being in a small guild, even with a few alliances, there was much that we would never see in eq and I'd be unlikely to even get my epics completed.  Also, VI/SOE's attitude and complete disdain they showed their user base on top of the buggy software didn't help matters much.<br />
<br />
DAoC has been fun.  Mythic is very responsive to user input and their customer service people are overly polite, helpful and generally very prompt.  I've never had an /appeal (same as /petition) go unanswered in DAoC (in EQ I only had a few /petitions actually answered).  The graphics are at least as good as the best in EQ, the player models and animations are much better either the post or pre luclin models.  Its nice not to feel gimped because your model and its animations suck.<br />
<br />
Even  though the server populations tend to hover around 2,000 players per server during primetime, which is comparable to what EQ was when you could see numbers from then, only rarely do I have competition for hunting spots.  Yeah, there are some spots that everyone and their mom think they have to hunt, but it isn't necessary to go there and there are plenty more if people actually look.  At level 53 with my ranger, I had very few spots I could solo and very few times I could get a group.  If the rockhoppers in DSP where camped, which they generally were, I had to go to lesser hunting grounds somewhere.<br />
<br />
DAoC defnitely isn't EQ, nor should it be.  There are a very small number of things I'd like to see mythic bring in from EQ in one fashion or another, but the vast majority of EQ can stay where it is.  If I had been part of an uber guild in EQ, I might think differently.  I wasn't and I don't.  I'll miss my EQ friends, but I don't miss EQ at all.</div></div><hr />

Ugh! I don't know what it is. Maybe the lack of content, slow and boring fights, and lack of zone wide chat. I dunno, DAoC had potential..the archery was amazing (much better than EQ) but it made me want to go take a shower or something. Hard to explain, try playing DAoC as much as you play EQ but there seems to be no point in playing, you don't gain much power unlike EQ. Blah /rant off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">austforbeer</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I played DAOC when it first came out and I started a Beserker.  I kinda enjoyed it, but I was disgusted with certain aspects.  Alot of the things they said they would fix, they really didn't.  <br />
<br />
Granted, I only played one character to lvl 12, but at that point I had enough.  However, my friends from work still play and enjoy it quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I think one of the main reasons I came back was because I had accomplished so much in EQ that starting over seemed like more of a hassle than it was worth.<br />
<br />
My friends still try to convince me to come back and I convince them to come to EQ.  But with SWG comming out, I don't think I'll be playing it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that DAOC used to be a fast paced game without alot of content.  EQ was a slow paced game with alot of content.<br />
<br />
When you switched you were probably working up thinking hey, i'm starting again but it is at least fast.  Then they began to change things and make it harder and take more time.  I believe they nerfed many things about archery.<br />
<br />
Anway, it seems to me to be a lesser of two evils.  Play EQ be bored yet still have a char that is far advanced (after coming back) or play DaoC and spend a ton of time to build up a char to the level you have in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Equipment wearing out. Yes it's the pits in my opinion. Sure in EQ you replace a lot of stuff but you can get lucky on gear you buy/loot that will last a long long time, even multiple characters if you wish. There's a reason people twink, one is to blow thru boring lvls - the other is to not have to run to town to buy/sell ever 3 lvls and get on with the game.<br />
<br />
2. Size, seemed really small after EQ. Could get on a horse and go end to end of your own realm in just a few minutes at lvl 3.<br />
<br />
3. Adventure. Nothing to look forward to really. In EQ at lvl 20 you want to see/slay a dragon etc.. Nothing like that in DAoC except kill some keep.<br />
<br />
4. Communication. I went in playing with a few people from EQ and still found it too quiet and no one wanted to do anything with others. Lotta times I'd log on and couldn't find a group or solo spot and no tells/ooc/shout etc.. I'd log right off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimny</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had several mid 20-30's chars in DAoC.  There are a lot of things that I did enjoy about the game like:<br />
1) easier for the casual gamer<br />
2) eye candy (cloaks, guild emblems, etc.)<br />
3) styles (many were useless but they helped brake the monotony of melee)<br />
4) quests &amp; tasks (many quests, some cheesy, but I think most were well done, and that quest log book was really helpful)<br />
5) crafting (sure it's no where near as good as UO's, but crafting had a purpose and you could actually make money from it)<br />
6) guild commands (daoc has a very robust system for guild maintenance)<br />
7) RvR (I did enjoy RvR in many ways, but I also had some issues with it).<br />
<br />
What I disliked:<br />
1) you run like a 90 year old man with severe arthritis in the legs.<br />
2) very little pve content.  I think this is why they make you run so slow, since the realms are so very small, it would seem even smaller if you could freely (horses have routes) run around at say EQ speed.  There's 1 dungeon for a given level range (10, 20, 30, 40)  Dungeons were smaller than in EQ and with so few to choose from, would grow boring.<br />
3) Class imbalances.  This is true for every MMORPG but really stands out in a PvP game.<br />
4) RvR lag.  Full scale raids would produce some horrible lag.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind the items wearing out, and the anti twink logic.  What killed the game for me was the lack of content.  Sure the lands were dense with mobs to hunt, but there was a small variety of mobs to kill.  At level 30 you were killing a larger version of what you hunted at level 1.  This is true for EQ as well, but to a much lesser degree.  If you got tired of your class, or just came to the conclusion that the class wasn't for you, and decided to re-roll, you would have to basically hunt in the same fields you had already visited before.  This would make the game grow older quicker.<br />
<br />
Mythic has added more RvR content, and even a really cool dungeon (but you can only access it if your realm has the most RvR points or something like that).  I like RvR, but there needs to be a little more PvE content to keep the game interesting, at least for me.<br />
<br />
EQ is loaded with content.  I hate the down time in EQ, but I love the vast choices of zones.<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY grateful though for games like DAoC, and AO (it has improved a lot) because they forced Verant to change their attitudes towards they're player base.  I believe that's why we got soul binders in all the cities, a much easier level 1-10 experience, and the removal of the hell levels, and that pain in the arse spell book.  Competition is a great thing, and I hope the competition keeps forcing verant to improve the EQ experience for all of us.<br />
<br />
As for EQ 2, I'm just hoping they seriously reduce the down time, and make the game a little more friendly for the casual gamer.<br />

Then again is easier to sell stuff!!</div></div><hr />
