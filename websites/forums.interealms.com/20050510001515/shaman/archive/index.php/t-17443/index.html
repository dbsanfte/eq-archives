<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In pickup groups, do you buff other character's pets?  If so, to what level?  For beastlords, I would think they're able to do their own, but necros I can see having some usefulness from our buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually buff other classes' pets if someone in the group has a pet. Well, mage pets and necro pets anyways. I haven't grouped with many BST's so can't really say. Good question though. I'll have to ask the bst next time I group with one. In general, I just keep it at focus and haste (now that I have the clicky haste bp). If the pets are the majority of our melee, I'll sometimes pass FA around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I think about it I buff other peoples pets and buff for example the pet you get in ldon. I buff focus+str of diaku usually. One beastlord told me off though once said he preferred infusion of spirit over focus of soul+str of diaku  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only buff I give to group pets is haste and sometimes SoW depending on the situation.  BSTs can buff their own pets.  I will buff necro pets, though, if they're our main tank. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All pets get FoSoul and Str of Diaku.  If the pets are getting beat up they also get Ancestral Guard and Regen.  Avatar/haste on request.  I generally don't sow pets unless specifically asked though.  A sowed pet = less time to spam /pet back off before you get in trouble.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont bother with much else besides STR and dex for mage pets with goodies. Haste is only for mage pets, all other major pet classes have pet haste buffs and our haste wont stack on (ie BST, DRU, NEC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mages Get Burnout line, much better haste than ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Diaku does not stack with the Mage AA burnout, therefore just focus on all pets just in case there are other stacking issues, if asked, and I have the mana/time/willingness I will haste other pets.<br />
<br />
Will do Ancestral guard if pets taking much dmg, but otherwise, that hardly ever gets memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Focus mostly for the hps, thats all I'll cast on pets. I won't flatly refuse to cast other buffs just to appease a group member, but I don't consider any other buffs worth the mana or time. I certainly do not haste, I can't think of a pet class that can't buff their pets with usually a superior haste spell combined with other usefull atk, ac, etc buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I usually don't buff my pet with anything more than haste in a group, so I don't tend to buff other pets unless I'm asked to.<br />

<br />
stacks with ours too - or so the mages tell me.<br />
<br />
The one ours doesnt stack with is the necro - which is faster than the mages line but wont take other haste on top.  str stacks i think but i never use it on pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The haste spells might stack, but if the mage has a 60% haste and you cast your 30% haste on the pet, the pet will still only be hasted 60%.<br />
<br />
Same as a melee who gets both Alacrity and Vallon.<br />
<br />
One question though, anyone ever done any tests on the effects of (Ferine/Primal) Avatar on pet damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you cast Ferine Avatar on your pet, there is a noticable increase in the number of hits of 60 which is his maximum hit(the lvl 61 pet). So focus and str of diaku I find are beneficial for pets. But for haste each class gets like a 85% pet haste, including druids! omg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Focus + Diaku + FA if I have time/mana on all decent pets (read: not Sk or shammie pets, and not those silly little bears that druids get).<br />
<br />
FA, in particular, makes a very noticable difference in DPS, expecially since most caster pet buffs (e.g. BL or necro) give the pet a proc of some sort.  Add a cripple and these pets will hit for max amazingly often.<br />
<br />
Haste is totally wasted on others' pets.  Every decent pet class gets a better haste than our SLTW, so don't waste the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Focus/diaku.<br />
<br />
Pets are a good portion of dps when several are there, and it makes a large difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Focus is about the only thing I cast unless I happen to be doing FA, in which case the pets get into the cast rotation of that one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Str raises atk - which means they hit more.  Focus and diaku on dogdog, mage, and necro pets.<br />
<br />
Dex = proc - any pet with mage toys gets double the use out of focus/diaku.<br />
<br />
I don't put anything on beastlord pets - check their spell lineup on lucy sometime.  Unless you have a weak stomach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well IF i have a mage in my group and thay have toys out for there pet and mine, then I through Infusion of spirit ( yea the beastlord one ) mortal defnece ( yea the single target dex buff ) mantical str ( yeps again single target ) str of daikui ( str/dex ) and enther PE or FA once i got it timed. this is mainly for the some where near 280 to 300 extra dex it would give the pet. and seeing as how we dont know the starting pets dex well then ... also useing this set up my pet hits more often then with just focus ( also stack on the pet buff if i feel like being stupid since that adds more dex and str ). <br />
<br />
yes I have tested it out and on beastlord pets at lest thay turn in to even more of a procing machine with this set up then just a standered one. also insedntly I use IoS when power leveling or just sluming since I know i can pretty much garnenty that i will cap the stats of just abouts anyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I usually only buff other player's pets if they ask or if I'm bored and have alot of mana. I figure it's their pet. They know the pet and if it actually needs buffs they'll ask. I don't get asked much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Doesn't take much to throw a focus on the pet, especially if you already have it up for something else.  I usually do that much, but I don't usually do Diaku or anything fancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It depends on the situation.  Most of my time of late has been spend in LDoN.  The pace is so fast and the demand on my manna so heavy I usually don&#8217;t worry about pet buffs.  I buff my pet with haste only.  It speeds up his attacks and I use it for a guide so I know if its dropped I need to buff the tanks.  In the groups that I&#8217;m normally in the pets never tank.  So I see no reason to take time away from killing mobs to buff up their hit points.  I used to ask if others wanted haste for their pets, but after being told no about 30 times in a row I finally stopped asking.  The only time I&#8217;ve ever been asked to buff another&#8217;s pet was a beastlord asking me to focus his cat.  <br />
<br />
Now in a less hectic setting I&#8217;m much more willing to buff the heck out of anyone or anything around me.  *smiles*  And I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time lately running around newbie zones and buffing low level characters.  I had people do this for me I first started playing EQ so I&#8217;ve spent a significant portion of my time over the last two years returning the favor.  And any pets get fully buffed as well.  I&#8217;m a strong believer that buffs are a good thing.  But with time constraints, stacking issues and buff slot issues I don&#8217;t pile them on as much in LDoN adventures as I would like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't buff pets in pick up groups unless asked.  I've watched too many people not /pet back off during enranges to really desire passing out a voluntary Focus every 20 minutes for Fluffy III, Fluffy IV, Fluffy V, Fluffy VI...you get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I always buff all pets with Focus, Diaku, haste for mage pets, and put the pets on the FA rotation.<br />
<br />
Except for FA, which is an ongoing burden on mana (but worth it for dps), I figure the buffs are a little bit of trouble up front then reap the dps benefit for a long long time (with SCRM).  It is just a very efficient and trouble free way to up the overall group dps.<br />
<br />
Politically, I think other pet owners notice and appreciate it, and some might consider me to be a more 'on top of it' shaman as a result.  Good for the reputation in pick up groups.  I mean, if you are a mage or BL, who prides themselves on the dps of your pet, dont it make you happy to see FA and Focus on the pet, in addition to your self pet buffs?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As a Mage who 2boxes a shaman, here's what works best:<br />
<br />
Mage Pet:<br />
Burnout 5 (mage spell)<br />
Focus<br />
Primal Essence/FA<br />
Agility (only if pet is tanking)<br />
<br />
Shaman Pet:<br />
Focus<br />
Primal Essence/FA<br />
Haste<br />
<br />
Never bother with haste on a mage pet unless he is very low level. Burnout 5 has 85% haste on it and while your haste will stack, only the higher will take effect.<br />
<br />
How stats effect pets<br />
Strength: Makes pet hit for max more often<br />
Stamina: No effect - don't bother<br />
Agility: AC/Pet gets hit less<br />
Dex: PROCS - MAX THIS. If the pet has proccing weapons, the higher you can get his Dex the better.<br />
<br />
A pet with summoned mage gear will have a significantly higher DPS with buffs than without them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">99% of pet buffing i do is malosinia ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Miaulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hey all, I'm new to the boards, but I saw this thread and just had to chime in. :)<br />
<br />
I have a lot of characters, they are as follows.<br />
<br />
Cleric Level 58<br />
Rogue Level 55<br />
Necro Level 52<br />
SK Level 43<br />
Shaman Level 10  ;) <br />
<br />
On my Cleric I NEVER used to buff pets, but recently I picked up my long abandoned Necro cause I wanted to try some LDoN adventures with her.  It was on one of these LDoN adventures that my view on buffing pets changed completely.<br />
<br />
Our mission was an assassination.  We had tough goings through the mission, our healer was a Druid and she was having a bit of a tough time keeping up on healing our 2 Warriors.  I was twitching as much as I could and slowing undead.<br />
<br />
We were about 3 minutes from completing our adventure.  The Enc paci'd the room and we pulled.  Bad news, 2 inc.  Chanter mezzed one quickly and the Warriors attacked our target.  The Druid healed one of the Warriors and drew aggro which the War's could not pull off in time.  Healer dead.  A few seconds later, War 1 dead.  I tried my best to keep the other tank alive, but my little heal spell was not enough.  Tank 2 is at 30%hps, Enchanter goes LD.  Mob 2 wakes up and heads straight for tank 2, I feign death hoping that my pet will stay alive long enough to kill our target and rack up a success for us.  Tank 2 goes down.  Basically our whole group died except for me and the LD Enchanter.  My pet is at 40%hps and dropping fast with 2 mobs beating on it.  I check our targets hps and he's at 1%!!  He goes down, we get the successful adventure notice (to the cry of many &quot;WOO HOO's!&quot; from my fallen group mates).  The add kills my pet and wanders off to it's spawn point.<br />
<br />
The lesson I learned?  The Druid and Chanter dropped all the buffs they could on my pet.  Keeping it hasted, HP/AC buffed and thorned.  Yes it could be seen as a waste of mana, but if my pet had not been buffed and kept buffed we would have failed our mission for sure.  Now my Cleric makes sure to keep all pets buffed to the best of her ability.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it can be argued that if they had not been keeping buffs up like they were we could have moved through the adventure faster and it would not have been so close, but...  It was a bad pull that caused the wipe.  It wasn't our pullers fault, he had been doing a great job all night.  Bad pulls happen, and you'll never know when you need that pet to tank for you...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You have a very good point, Miaulin.  The problem I had with pet buffing in LDoN was the fast pace and large manna requirement.  For example, I would buff the group just outside the dungeon entrance and Canni 4 back to full health.  Once inside the group would already be half way through the first fight before I’d called my pet, given it fangs and cast haste on it.  I’d jump into the fray and canni back my manna as quickly as possible.  But it would be a constant struggle to keep up my manna from that point forward.  I just didn’t have the time or manna to cast buffs on every pet.  <br />
<br />
However, I did my first two adventures last night with Canni 5 and I must say it was a world of difference.  I was able to cast a lot more DoTs and damage spells than I ever was before and I still didn’t have to spend three fourths of my time canni dancing.  It was so different I was starting to feel guilty because I wasn’t dancing.  Now that I have the time and manna to spare I think I’ll take your advice to heart and keep more buffs on all the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">buffing pets is so situational at best.  However since I am all about maxing DPS then I always haste, relic, and IoS my warder.  If Im lucky Ive got a pet kit with me and he'll just tear everything up.<br />
<br />
BTW, never ever ever ever buff a bst pet with Focus unless asked.  I usually kill my pets if I see it done and recast another.  Then I blow up on my shaman.  Of course Aego/Virtue from a cleric is always welcome! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fandara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">with the speed necessary for LDON I think that sometimes its necessary to buff pets, tossing a focus doesnt take too much mana nor does  a haste, if you can ad even 5DPS could mean the difference between fail and sucess, normally i just ask and if they want it i foucs, some BL get angry when i buff their pets cuz it's their baby <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I see myself HP buffing pets in LDON more often, mainly due to the enrage problem.  Every dungeon theme has at least one enraging mob, and I at least keep loosing pets when I'm busy and the pet went off snapping at some mob while I'm slowing the usual 4 pull.  So I do buff chanter pets etc with focus for the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">in an all pet group with mages i'll IoS, diaku and dex all pets.  they proc like mad!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">For other people's pets, Focus is about it. With SCRM it lasts for the whole adventure and Canni V means its not a big deal. <br />
<br />
If the group only has one or two melees then I will add FA to pets when I can but don't religiously keep it up, with priority for pets with big procs.<br />
<br />
Soloing, Focus, SLTW and FA make a very noticeable difference, particularly as I use mage toys whenever I can get some in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">As a necro I'll tell you that Focus makes a huge difference.  The pets hit for their max more often and the extra hp's are good if the pet has to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Wildaar, what is the stacking problem that makes Focus so bad on BL warders?  Havent heard about this one yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I personally buff all pets with Focus / Daku for the HP, Str, &amp; Dex.  The increase in the pets DPS really negates the 45 average seconds it takes to regain the used mana.  When you add in high level mage summoned items the benifits just multipy.<br />
<br />
I've personally not had beastlords complain about casting Focus on thier pets though I can see where some thier buffs might not stack due to it.  I also tend not to buff mage pets if they are pet canni'ing as its just not worth the trouble to keep it buffed.<br />
<br />
I'll need go out there though and see just what the best config for pet buffage is as I think focus might not be the best way to go for max usage.  I just think if you give those little pets a bit of loving so to say they like to show you how much they love you by beating those nasty mobs up for you faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>leillanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I always buff dogdog IoS, Kragg, Haste - he has saved my ass more then once as he has tanked mobs and let me get / zone. I was in an LDoN group the other day and buffed the droods little bear the same, she was so over the moon. I also gave it some crappy weapons out of my big bag marked *crappy weapons for pets to play with* and the increase in damage it was doing was noticeable. I rarely go oom in LDoN and so I try to keep everyone buffed pets included. As far as I am concerned pets are valuable DPS in the group and get treated the same as any other member, they get buffed, hasted and healed. Yes I get annoyed when the lazy ass bst doesnt haste his pet and i have to, but it is to my benefit too that we have as much dps as possible and succeed our adventure. I know our pets are Warior class, but I am not sure what class other classes pets are, can anybody enlighten me please ?<br />

My brother and i duo (hes a 63 bst) and he begs me to fosoul his warder all the time.  I also give it a diaku and a replen, i dont like healing and would rather let the dogs heal themselves.

No Stamina or Acumen and don't haste BST or Necro pets, otherwise I treat them like a party member.  For example I shrew pets in LDoN, they don't get lost so much that way.<br />
<br />
I typically do the pet buffs slowly as we start a LDoN crawl so as to not slow the group down.  In normal exp groups I buff them at that start and can like mad.<br />
<br />
For a few moments of your time you help your group, make the pet work better, and make thier owner feel like they matter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I've been told by mages in my guild that casting FA on their pet gives them a ridiculous boost in DPS.  They said that their pet hits for max a TON more than without FA.  I think the same is true for most pets, but I know for a fact that the mages in my group love for me to FA their pets.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that the reasoning behind this is that a pet has very low stats to begin with.  So not only do they get the raw 140 atk bonus, but they get a ton of ATK from the STR bonus.  Then add the 140 DEX and the pet starts proccing like mad too.<br />
<br />
As far as other buffs go, if someone requests buffs I will cast them, but otherwise I don't find it to be that worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Hmm focus + str of diaku is 7 less dex than infusion of spirit and manical dex. I have to see if str of diaku also stacks. That would explain if it does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perelandra - I've parsed Goner extensively, never saw AGI do a dang thing on him.  Are mage pets different, or is it one of the &quot;it makes me feel better&quot; things we all have in one way or another?<br />
<br />
I'm often asked by BLs to focus/diaku their pets.  What makes it better to not focus them?  IoS+other buffs, or does it block something?  If the difference is 7 Dex, they can live with FoSoul/Diaku or tell me ahead of time not to buff their warder.<br />
<br />
Too many crap shaman out there who won't buff a damn thing unless you grovel first.  Makes folks expect all shaman to sit on their thumbs and do jack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Oh I found out on myself I can stack infusion of spirit+mortal deftness+str of diaku.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">if a pet procs (beastlord pets especially)  i give it focus+diaku+FA (if there is room in the rotation); if it doesnt proc it gets FA only (again, if there's room), unless its tanking--then it gets focus too.  I NEVER haste another class's pet; they have their own superior pet haste and its just a waste of your mana and sanity.  Occassionally i give a pet replenishment and/or sow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my knowledge only BST and Necros have better haste or pet buffs that dont stack with out haste.  If you aren't hasting the mage pets then you are reducing their potential DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I buff my pet as much as my boredom, mana pool, and role (healing too? hasting too?) allow.<br />
<br />
For LDoN, we all buff to full outside, all get FM, all enter and cast pets, and I focus pets. I also work pets into the FA rotation as best I can.<br />
<br />
I try to do LDoNs with a Bard + four dps (I slow, dot and heal), or a Chanter + four dps (I slow, dot and heal), or some other priest class + four dps (I slow, dot, haste and spot heal). When grouped with another healer, cycling through FA and Haste don't leave much time for heals, though.<br />
<br />
(added)<br />
<br />
ps, I've been very unhappy when grouped in LDoN with only three dps and a healer and a chanter, so I have been avoiding such a support-heavy arrangement, and have much more (and faster) successes.<br />
<br />
But back to the main question: I only put Focus and FA on pets unless something special is requested. If I'm in a pet group, though, I'll load the pets up - AC, Str, Regen, etc. - since hardly any healing needed.<br />
<br />
pps, Here I am hunting shards, grouped with, top to bottom, Beastlord, Enchanter, Necromancer, Cleric (with hammer pet), and Shadowknight (puller and MA/Offtank); green bars are pet health:<br />

Mages have a 85% haste for their pet.</div></div><hr />

Mages have a 85% haste for their pet.<br />
And as I said our haste buff only causes issues with necros and BST.<br />
Not all Mages will have burn out.  You might as well toss haste on their pet so they have haste there for the times between burn outs.<br />
That said thats a fun spell, I want it for my dog dog!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">My understanding is burnout5 is their pet buff it lasts 25 mins according to lucy. If they don't have burnout 5 they have burnout 4 which is a 65% pet haste. You are getting confused with their aa abillity=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Just looked up their aa its called Frenzied Burnout which increases the pet haste to 99%. Plus a few stats. I wasn't aware there was a difference either till I looked them up, I was very sure mages did have their own pet haste which I have proved hopefully=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">To my knowledge only BST and Necros have better haste or pet buffs that dont stack with out haste.  If you aren't hasting the mage pets then you are reducing their potential DPS.<br />
<br />
If for some unknown reason a mage didnt have the following spell at least...(they better have burnout5 though, since its an eth spell)<br />
<br />
Burnout 4 (level 55):<br />
3:  Increase STR by 60 <br />
4:  Increase Attack Speed by 65% <br />
6:  Increase AC by 16 <br />
<br />
I&quot;m CERTAINLY not casting<br />
<br />
swift like the wind:<br />
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
<br />
on them, because while it DOES stack, it doesnt increase haste.  If a fight is going a long time the ONLY &quot;pets&quot; i will haste are the wizard swords and the cleric hammers.  Anyone else better be hasting their own pet, or they can go find a new group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I've never met a High level mage without at least Burnout 3. Burnout 4 is kinda rare (I never got it), but there is only a 5% haste increase. Burnout 5 is VERY common and any mage 62 or above should have this.<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb - don't haste the mage pets unless you just like wasting mana.<br />
<br />
As to Agility, I know of the ongoing debate as to its usefulness. I cast it on my pet if it is tanking. If it doesn't do anything - no loss. It lasts as long as focus and I rarely am in the same place long enough to rebuff more than once.<br />
<br />
As for FA. If you can spare it for a pet - it does indeed give a HUGE increase in DPS. For the Mage epic pet the increase in DPS is automatic (innate proc). For other pets, the main increase in DPS comes from the proc rate - which requires summoned weapons. I would never advocate FA on a pet over a PC, but if you can fit the pet in the cycle - watch the machine go to work.<br />
<br />
As for IoS stacking with Kragg's and Maniacal strength, unless I'm missing something, even Focus of Spirit gives better stats than that combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case I would have to agree. Dex is the main stat I strive for on my pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Infusion of spirit+Mortal Deftness+str of diaku&gt; about 30 more dex than focus+str of diaku. Thats the reason why I find out after a bit of research.<br />
<br />
It is actually 45 more dex.<br />
<br />
MD 60<br />
IoS 55<br />
Diaku 28<br />
-------<br />
143 dex<br />
<br />
focus 70<br />
diaku 28<br />
-------<br />
98 dex<br />
<br />
The trade off for the BL is that she has to keep up 4 of her own buffs (Kragg, MD, MS, IoS) to offset turning down Focus from the shammy.  The reward is 45 more dex, which may be worth it if the BL can be bothered with all the buffing.<br />
<br />
Personnally, I think I will start asking the BL if they want me to focus their warder.<br />
<br />
Actually, we have the same decision to make with our own pets, since we could also get the extra dex by using those same buffs.  However, since I am using FA on my pet (and the BL warder), enough is enough.  No friggin way would I mem those old buffs for 45 more dex on my own pooch.  Maybe some BL's feel differently about their warder and their own melee buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">sorry took me so long to reply..<br />
<br />
You guys nailed it though, its all about the dex.  You guys also forgot that a bst can add 75 more dex using Relic..doesnt quite play into the stacking question but in terms of max dex thats 218 pts vs 173 dex which will add a tremendous amount of procs on the warder.  Keeping up the buffs is generally not a problem, they last a good while, in fact can get through most adventures only buffing 1 time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I buff with Focus, Diaku, and SLTW (no FA, don't have it, and still 16% away from 65 anyway).  I don't know enough about BST pet buffs, so I ask if they want any pet buffs.  The usual answer is &quot;no&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">At lower levels I've never buffed other peoples pets unless asked.  Most groups I'm in tend to be with a tank so I never have to worry about pets tanking.<br />
<br />
Most times now any grouping I tend to do is on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">err, please correct me, but has SOE changed the ways pets work? It used to be that they are NPCs and have a completely different way of determining what damage they do and receive. <br />
<br />
- HP and haste have always worked with pets, sounds like atk buffs do as well.<br />
- Sta, Str, Dex, Agi have done NOTHING for pets.<br />
<br />
I wish I knew where to find the official statments or the million of parses we did that confirmed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">pretty easy to visually see..take a bst warder..only put the proc on it.. He'll get off a decent amount. <br />
<br />
Then take and buff the snot outta it with the above mentioned spells, and notice the difference. Its hella a lot!<br />
<br />
Here's some hard data.<br />

6% alot? Anyways, I find the results they have there not very conclusive. What I was looking for is something like no dex compared 180 dex. Or 0 str buff 120 str buff.<br />
<br />
At least it would mean that dex has an effect, so maybe the other buffs as well<br />
<br />
But I don t trust BL pets, they might work  different from our pets, or the other old style pets.<br />
<br />
Ps.: (the graph say that you get one more proc per min for 100 dex, thats 3 dps more from a total of around 70 dps ca. 4% total dps.)</div></div><hr />
