<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I try to keep charisma buff on myself at all times...I like to stick it in my first buff spot in case I get dispelled. Not sure if it does anything or not but I have a feeling it helps to land spells. I'm level 65, with elemental armor and 200 AA so I got a good idea what I'm talking about. If it doesn't help skills at all it don't matter, it's now a habit and I'd feel unlucky if it wasn't there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh come on gandalfh, everyone knows elemental armor and having more than 199AA makes your spells land more when you use CHA.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'm such a frikkin' n00b.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">instead of tossin' his ideas like some dumbazz shaman noob (the original poster that is), maybe after each new add-on release we retest it... <br />
<br />
It *IS* possible for SoE to add in CHA as some sorta cross-dependent stat equating to a 5-10% modification... maybe it's already there AND it so insignificant the we dismiss it before giving it a serious thought.... MAYBE it's like the old ranger jokes.. worthless dead lump.. sure they still die, but damn they put out some sick DPS...<br />
<br />
Point is.. stop being grumpy old shaman and at least give it a thought after every patch/add-on...<br />
<br />
LDoN is going to have some new features.. Maybe they are preparing for that?<br />
<br />
Personally I can't wait to inspect a females for some hidden treasures!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">GD you grumpy ole shaman are **** heads.<br />
<br />
does cha do anything at 65/250; aside from vendor?   NO<br />
<br />
does cha do anything at 30; aside from vendor?  most likely NO<br />
<br />
will cha do anything for shaman, or other classes; ever?  Hell, I don't know.<br />
<br />
but when i see new items listed that buff CHA by amounts i consider inordinate, i have to wonder.<br />
<br />
when i wonder, i post.  <br />
<br />
kinda what i thought forums like this were for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">when they make new items i think they draw stats out of a hat and then assign them..in the case of these items they happened to draw out charisma more than anything else...<br />
<br />
Maybe in the new expansion there will be mirrors to examine and charisma will make you appear pretty :)<br />
<br />
Oh and charisma does help charm to some degree and shaman and druids have charm..maybe they think clerics are always divine interventioning themselves...that could explain charisma right there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had a mighty 30 charisma when I got flagged for elemental planes (that's 15 charisma below starting charima for butt ugly Trolls).<br />
I have no problems landing spells.<br />
I've been tempted to get as much neg cha gear as I can get to see how low I can make my Charisma, just to laugh at you guys that keep coming back every few weeks/months saying &quot;CHA is needed for us to land out spellz!!11!&quot;<br />
<br />
The most likely reason shaman have Cha as one of our highlighted stats is because we do actually have some limited ability to Charm Animals, and once upon a time shaman also had the Charm spell.  Charms are affected somewhat by charisma.  Thus, shaman somewhat might have needed the CHA stat if our spell line didn't just die with our 2 low level animal charms and the removed charm spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">People seem to be forgetting that Cha is useful to clerics and to a lesser extent druids for buying reagents, they can't simply throw on a cha buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not exactly on topic...<br />
<br />
I have grouped with a few bards in my day... occasionally I get asked for a cha buff from one.. thinking nothing of it.. I'll gladly cast it upon them<br />
<br />
One day we get a bard in my pickup group, I figure I'll give him cha before he asks... so as the night wore on I kept char on him... until he asks &quot;Why are you casting charisma on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point im completely confused...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No one really knows if cha helps. But if it does its something like 1 out of 100 resists would land, or maybe more. I am extremly superstitous. If I keep getting alot of resists, i throw charisma on as a placebo. Regardless of its effect it makes me think it helps. Are you about to mock everyone with a lucky rabbit foot ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My lucky rabbit's foot never hogged a spell slot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Okay, I'm going to go out on a limb and offer another use for Cha!<br />
<br />
On raids, the cleric spell Divine Intervention seems to have a charisma component to it.  Admittedly, this is less of an issue with high AA guilds, where most of the clerics probably already have the AA to make DI fire 100% of the time (unfailing divinity), but the tanks on various boards have noticed a statistically greater liklihood of DI firing (assuming no AA) with higher charsima.  Funny as it sounds, don't be surprised if your MTs request a charisma buff!  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So if I +cha the mob it will help me land slow .. got it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heck, I spent about 50 PP on some Cha gear, just for fun.  Whenever I sell stuff, my Cha is over 200. no big Deal, but it tell you that it has paid for itself 100 fold.  As to the fact it takes up a spell slot, get real.. cast it, forget it, and mem annother. Its not like it's a combat spell that you need to keep memed.  The only buffs I keep memmed are Haste, and Spirit Quickening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Almost feel out of my chair when I saw a level 61 shaman using two CHA stiens as their primary gear  :eek: <br />
<br />
make DI fire 100% of the time (unfailing divinity) <br />
<br />
Still doesn't even come close to firing 100% of the time. UD1 adds the the chance that it will fire, UD 2 + 3 only adds some healing if it fails to fire cheal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
For a bard, CHA helps with failed lulls - a failed lull checks with the bard's cha if it will be a critical fail (and thus aggro), or just fail and stand there nonaggroed.<br />
<br />
Also, really high CHA on a bard helps with fewer missed notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">With a charisma buff and all the DI AA's, DI goes off about 70% of the time on our MT.  The MT, ST, and RT always ask for cha and I'm happy to give it to them.<br />
<br />
For shamans, though, it does nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've got EP armor and 250AA and I'd have to say that charisma does absolutely nothing except what SOE says it does!<br />
<br />
<br />
a tradeskilled ring you bought in the bazaar doesnt exactly count as EP armor mang</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To the original poster...<br />
Those items might simply have cha on them because cha does effect charms and those items all have Druid on them which is a class that charms ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, until someone comes up with test parses and solid numbers, I'll not bother with casting the charisma buff on myself.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, I never have a charisma buff up (except when I've just been selling) but don't think it works. Some people do all the time and swear it works. Whether you believe or not, have you really tried to compare having the buff and not having the buff to see if it makes a difference?<br />
<br />
As for gear with charisma on it... well, druids charm, clerics use DI and Pacify. Charisma makes a difference with both, supposedly. Some of those items are enchanter useable, and they like charisma as a bonus stat too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&gt;&gt;No one really knows if cha helps<br />
<br />
Charisma has been proven help bards in a few ways:<br />
<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallfrm8.showMessage?topicID=77.topic<br />
<br />
Notice a few posts down for log data (not zeitosx's first post he used the wrong song, see his 2nd post). Here was the summary:<br />
<br />
charisma: 148 missed notes: 7.98%<br />
charisma: 198 missed notes: 7.09%<br />
charisma: 269 missed notes: 5.29%<br />
charisma: 305 missed notes: 4.07%<br />
<br />
So a cha buff reduces fizzle by 25.6% on a 198 cha bard!<br />
<br />
Now bards cast a song every 3sec so a 2% more fizzles means you fizzle one more time every 2.5 minutes (basically every pull you fizzle an extra time). <br />
<br />
Also charisma affects the chance of a mob aggroing a bard after lull. So it affects the number of times a bard would have to use Fading Memories when puller (low charisma could cause bard to spend 900mana).<br />
<br />
IMO You should cast on every bard, or at worst ask if he wants it. Of course it doubly helps if the bard is your puller. Note that charisma helps high-end bards (near 200cha) more than it helps lower end bards (near 150cha. So it is alot more worthwhile at 65 on well geared bards.</div></div><hr />
