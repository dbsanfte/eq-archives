I had died trying to climb to highpass and figured &quot;ill get my corpse tomorow&quot; unfortunatly when I tried to get on the next day the internet was down. sooo<br />
skip ahead a 2 weeks I was not surprised that my corpse was not there when my connection came back. However now Im faced with a prob... What should I do for a lvl 15 rgr to get re-equiped? I only got quest items in the bank and a few plat. (only a handful) So I came to the glade for hopefully some helpful advice.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
head to Gfay, kill orc pawns for some weapons<br />
now head to orc hill, get about 12 orc belts, head to kaladim and do the orc belt quest, will give you armor + a shield to wear. head into crushbone and LFG, get belts and pads and sell them to players at 1pp /belt 2pp /pad respectively, kill crush and score yourself a dorf ringmail tunic<br />
<br />
by now you've got a few pp, buy some banded (cost is 1pp per ac) from a blacksmith, with all the smiths working on skillups now in Gfay for the faydark bow, they should be more then happy to do the combine for free if you buy the peicies they require.<br />
<br />
Good luck fellow ranger! hope i've helped .</div></div><hr />

If you do decide to head to Faydwer from Antonica, be sure and kill a few fire beetles first - you'll need that fire beetle eye, which is not available on Faydwer.<br />
<br />
I'd consider buying a velium weapon for about 10pp, and hunt willowisps in the Commonlands or North Karana.  Sell the regular lightstones, and turn in the greater lightstones to that Gypsy in North Karana for an item that you can then sell for around 8pp.<br />
<br />
Karana bandits are a bit more dangerous unless you team up with a druid (for Harmony).  It's too easy to get several on you at once.</div></div><hr />
