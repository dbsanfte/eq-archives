<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’ve been playing EQ for several months now, and I am still experimenting with all of the different classes and races to figure out which combination I like best.  My current “project” is a troll shaman (my first shaman and my first troll).  Well, I gotta say that I think I have finally found my niche – I love this character.  But I have one problem, so many NPCs hate me, it really limits my banking and traveling options.  <br />
<br />
Where can I expect to have access to a bank?  Are there any monsters / quests that I should seek (or avoid) to improve my banking options?  What other surprises await me, like will the druids around the druid rings attack me if I gate with a druid?<br />
<br />
Any advice from veteran troll shamen would be greatly appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Blix</div></div><hr />

I feel your pain, I'm an Iksar.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can (obviously) bank in Grobb and Ogguk while on Anotnica and I'm fairly sure you can bank in Neriak as well.  Your best bet is to bank in Overthere when on Kunark.  Thurgadin is good while on Velious, and Shadowhaven is good when on the moon.  You can hit allakazaams site (sp?) and look up faction quests for each of those zones/cities to try and raise your faction....that will help when buying supplies and selling loot.<br />
<br />
Good luck !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being KOS is prolly the biggest joy of playin a troll.  You will be best off if you assume that every single frikkin mob outside of Grobb wants you dead.  You will want to learn yer way around sewers to get thru zones like FP and Queynos and tricks like swimmin thru the front of the boat to board it.  NK is the only druid ring you really need to invis for and it don't hurt to always have invis up when travelling.  There are mean azz wandering NPC casters that can make you miserable.<br />
<br />
You can pretty much bank in any evil town and in neutral places like CC, Thurg, and OT.  It really isn't hard to expand yer banking options thru faction work, but it does take time.<br />
<br />
Just being aware and conning everything will save you the grief of dying many a time.  Best example I can think of is opening day of RoK when hordes of elfs, dorfs, and barbies kept trying ta get off the Bloated Belly at the OT dock.  They were dying in droves repeatedly because they had no clue that you get a false con from a boat.  A day or two experience as a troll cuda saved them so much pain :p<br />
<br />
Troll Tips:<br />
<br />
1.  If it is short kill it.<br />
2.  If it scowls at you kill it.<br />
3.  If it is named after vegetation or animals kill it.<br />
4.  If it kills you, bring friends back and kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Neriak, Grobb, and Ogguk... what more do you need? :0<br />
<br />
You can go fight in the Gorge of King Xrobb(I think thats the name) and then you will become non-kos to pickclaw goblins... then you can bank in Runneyeye.<br />
<br />
There is also Highkeep :0<br />
<br />
As for Kunark, you can go to OT(And there is a nice OT Hammer :0 )... For Velious and Luclin, I dont know... Ive never been to either of those places... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hahaha I like how  Naagruz puts it at the end of his post...very good advice :) Factions have never hurt me and early on I felt it was a plus actually....you can kill almost everything in sight without fear of hurting faction...cause you never had any to start with! ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
There was no going back the day Evel was born...playing a troll shaman has to be the most fun Ive had in EQ. Ive played sooo many class/race combos and troll shaman is where its at in my opinion. I started a human paladin the day Inno went up because I had the silly notion that there was actually role-playing in this game lol. When I started to understand the mechanics and how the game was played, it was clear to me trolls and specifically shaman had allot of potential power, not to mention fun. <br />
<br />
I like to think of shaman as the swiss army knife of the EQ classes...we can do just about all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a veteran shaman, let me just impart to you the single most important fact about the class; the plural of shaman is shamans. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is -totally- off topic I know, but long ago when I was in high school...I had a teacher who had a huge problem with people who misused/misspelled the word 'woman'....I mean he would literally flip if someone had written 'women' or heaven forbid 'weman' wemen'.......Mr. Wilson...is that you??<br />
<br />
*points over in  Bahimiron's general direction*<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, j/k bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I&quot;m a troll shaman, and the only bank that i can not go to is Halas. I have access to all the rest, faction isnt an obsicle for me, it just takes a little bit of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That is pretty amazing Kaz!  How long did it take you to do Katta and Seru, if you don't mind me asking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faction isn't really an issue once you start adventuring in Luclin.  Even in Velious it is fairly easy to fix your faction with one of the major cities.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how you will spend a majority of your play time in those 2 continents/expansions, you'll quickly find your fears set aside as you gain levels.<br />
<br />
And no matter what you'll always be able to fall back on grobb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm 49th and I bank happily in Thurgadin, there are a couple &quot;herb&quot; vendors right there and I'm not KOS to anyone.<br />
<br />
I will be using the workers sledgemallet to bank in the Overthere.<br />
<br />
When in Kunark, bank in the Overthere, when in Velius, use thurg or Kael, depending on faction.<br />
<br />
In Feydwyr good f'n luck, maybe get wolf form so you can fit, I think it fixes faction, my ogre banks fine there.<br />
<br />
Antioca I think Grobb and Ogguk are the only places...the folks in Neriak weren't too friendly.<br />
<br />
Odus, good f'n luck.<br />
<br />
I think that's it.<br />
<br />
I can pretty much bank any time I want, but below 30, you're gonna have issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
On traveling...when porting, always go invis, just in case.<br />
Most druid rings are ok, but some hate trolls, WC for one, and NK at least...but they can all be overcome by either asking the porting druid to invis you, or do it yourself before you port.<br />
<br />
Travel...you have sow and scale of wolf...use it.<br />
<br />
In your 30-50 get as many sarnak braids in the Overthere as you can and improve your VS faction.  DOn't go near Karnor's Caste or Howling stones...if you do, you won't be able to bank in Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The drop point on a port to WC won't get you close enuf to those frikkin elfs to get you killed so no worries there.  Just remember that those elfs are gud exp later on in life and need frequent reminder why they shud hate yu :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">little later(lv 50) some can be lv 50 in shorth time......<br />
<br />
you can have the worker sledgemallet(who proc a teleport to the overthere(easy quest)must be lv 50 to get the proc.and there is a bank right there..:-)<br />
only evil race are non-kos there.<br />
<br />
very usefull item  :-)</div></div><hr />
