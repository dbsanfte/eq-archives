<br />
W T F does this mean?  Lucy doesn't show any changes to Ferocity (the BST spell), or am I misreading this?  And, if true, then how do these &quot;stealth&quot; changes make it all the way to the live servers with no word from SOE or detection on Lucy?  Man, this is the kind of stuff that really infuriates me.  It's like they want to make changes they know are not fair, so they do so without warning or announcement, figuring we will just live with it after the fact.<br />
<br />
Other than that, some more nice tweaks.  Will have to see if the FPS setting makes any difference when 2-boxing (I can hope, can't I)<br />

Checked out Lucy, and today's updates, and no changes to any of the BST Ferocity spells (live or test, including the proposed Omen spell).  So unless they changed it in a way that doesn't show up at all in Lucy, not even the history log, then this entry must be in error or pertains to another line of spells and not the BST spells.  And, since it says &quot;test fixes&quot; and as far as I know Ferocity did not have this as a broken ability, it may be a reference to something else.<br />

If anyone has more insight, I'd sure like to hear it.<br />

And you'll have to remember to remove all bone chips from your bags EXCEPT for 1 of them anytime that you want to cast a single component spell.  Give em to a friend!<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, from the sounds of the change to Ferocity, it is a change in the coding for the classes to allow them to be granted a chance at double attack, not a chance to the spell itself.   But as with you all, I don't see any indication on Lucy that it EVER allowed a higher Dbl Atk chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the good news is that I read this as saying that if I get an item with the Ferocity effect, I too can double attack.  Now that would be a blast (even if it is only 3%-9%).<br />

<br />
Is in reference to a test only bug where if you had a stack of components the spell would react as if you had none.  To cast a spell you had to drop all but one component, cast the spell, then pick up the rest of your components.<br />
<br />
Another fun bug on test last week was everytime you did a tradeskill combine you would also get a Raw Infused Dark Matter back as well.  You could really abuse that sort of thing since it sells to vendors for about 2pp each.<br />

This option is very useful because (1) it will help those who get motion sickness from very high frame rates and (2) it will limit CPU utilization, helping those who run other apps in the background while playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not saying it's a bad thing, just that there are many of us for whom the FPS issue has always been trying to get more of them.  I actually like the new models, and despise having to turn some of them off to get 20+ FPS.<br />
<br />
Would turning down the theoretical max FPS to something you'd like to attain (such as 24) throttle down EQ and let it produce those 24 FPS more consistantly, instead of choking as it tries to crank out 30+ and fails?<br />

Beastlords only have one spell called ferocity.<br />
<br />
But some items in game have a worn effect called ferocity, which grants you a dubble attack modificator. So changes are just for items, not for  the beastlord spell. Just a bit confusing the way they wrote it on the patch message.</div></div><hr />

And I think you're right Shandy. Ever since EQplaynice went to a subscription thing it hasnt worked correctly for me.  Im not gonna pay $36 for it, but damn the free version is just a step above worthless now.  Unless I minimize EQ, it takes about 95% of my rescources now, where before the last patch with the older really free version it ran at 50% with 2 instances of EQ running on the same machine with max clip and models.  oh well...all good things come to an end</div></div><hr />

Good grief man.<br />
<br />
It was an issue because Bards and beasts have no true double attack but get it through AA. The focus on items was not increasing our chance to double attack. Now it does.<br />

<br />
Huh?  Nobody gets motion sickness from high frame rates.  <br />
<br />
Typical causes of motion sickness in computer games are<br />
<br />
   1. Lag between your navigation action and the onscreen response.  This is made worse by low frame rates, since the soonest an action can be reflected on screen is typically the 2nd frame after you make it (up to 134 msec at 15 fps but only 33 msec at 60 fps).  Higher frame rates = faster response = less motion sickness.<br />
<br />
   2. Quickly changing, physically inaccurate movement.  This is my main complaint with DMF/Lev and the bobbing effect.  This has nothing to do with low/high frame rate.<br />
<br />
   3. Jerkiness in the onscreen movement caused by low frame rates.  Higher frame rates = less jerkiness = less motion sickness.<br />
<br />
   4. Flickering/blurriness on screen due to low refresh rate.  Refresh rate is independent of frame rate.  It's a setting you can tweak in the Graphics options section.  60 hz is too low for me, 70hz and above is ok, 85 hz is great.  Your monitor and video card determine what refresh rates are allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LoL Yuoichi haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Huh?  Nobody gets motion sickness from high frame rates.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, I remember when Doom came out, it maxed at 35 fps - and that caused motion sickness in a lot of folks. It didn't affect me, nor did the chugginess of Quake when that came out. However, a few years later, I did start getting motion sickness, with framerates in the low 100s [in Quake, that is - I used to play at 320x200]... having said that, it was probably a synch issue, as the monitor refresh rate was 70Hz IIRC. <br />
<br />
And coincidentally Doom's 35 fps cap was exactly half of the 70Hz refresh rate used for the 320x200 VGA graphics mode - I swear people were getting sick as it was just too smooth.<br />
<br />
I've no idea what Everquest's framerate is like, but setting it to a max of 35 may well help some folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I remember hearing something over the years about frame rates and motion sickness.  Don't remember any specifics though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">hahah, ok that was good, Slim... funnies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If you got sick at higher frame rates then the developers were using the frame rate to peg the motion, i.e. when you signal a right turn it whips around too fast and stops too suddenly when you stop.  This is unnatural physical motion, reason #2 up there.<br />
<br />
However, tying the physical motion to the frame rate is amateurish at best.  Doom MIGHT have done that, I'm sure Quake did not.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is one other possible cause - low resolution.  If you had to reduce the resolution in order to get the higher frame rate, then it's possible that you made the scene more blurry, which could cause motion sickness as well.  EQ doesn't do that, so I hadn't considered it, but it could happen in other games if they render to a small bitmap and stretch that to fill the screen.  That's also a Bad Idea and modern games don't do it, for the most part.</div></div><hr />

A good deal of posters here are a bit jumpy and sometimes rant at the drop of the hat.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it’s not surprising after so many others state Shamans are good enough as is from expansions in the past, much less to today’s standard.  And if it’s a sensitivity concerning Bard issues, well many here still remember a certain high end site that went to extreme measures to detailing why Shamans were overpowered.  It doesn’t excuse things but debate has gone on since Kunark.</div></div><hr />
