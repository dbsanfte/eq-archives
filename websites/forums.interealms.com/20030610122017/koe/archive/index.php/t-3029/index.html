<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corintheus De'Alchemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">6:00 CST- I ported over to the Dreadlands and proceded to run the following route: DL, FM, OT, Warsliks, Dalnir. <br />
<br />
6:47 CST- Sitting in the tunel at the zone line into Dalnir, I met the 9 KoE members that were going on the raid with me. I boasted that mommy was making me steak for dinner, and kyre (i think) begged for some steak.<br />
<br />
7-10:30 CST- WOAH! this has been the most fun I've had in a ong time. We ran into the crypt and camped outside the temple area for a while. Several people dinged including myself. After a whi;e we moved into the second floor. In the decent w/ out meaning to I jumped all the way down and the meanys started wailing away. Then Griss and a cleric whos name starts with a K (im tired :P) came down and saved me butt. We held this room killing stuff until about 10 when the whole room spawned and several people died. We started to drag corpses to zone line cuz both clerics died and basicly all of g2 (my group) was wiped out. that was basicly the end of it. After everyone got their corpses back i gated out for the evening.<br />
