<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I live in the uk, and I just looked to see which stores sell OoW.<br />
<br />
Not at amazon.co.uk, nor any other online retailer I could see.<br />
I check out some stores locally such as Game and Virgin, and they don't seem to have it, or in fact have never heard of it. One guy even tried to get me to buy everquest online, so i laughed at him and walked away ;p<br />
<br />
So where are the uk players buying OoW? Or are u all downloading online?<br />
<br />
I'd personally like to get the in game gift for once, so don't wanna buy the download.....<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I couldnt find it at any of my normal game retailers in the Essex area, Lakeside, Basildon, Chelmsford, Southend etc.<br />
<br />
The Ubisoft website lists it as being available &quot;For Download ONLY&quot; and has no information on distributors.<br />
<br />
I got the download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was forced to get the download, couldn't get it in Sunderland, Newcastle, in Game/Gamestation/HMV (it was a long shot I know) or Virgin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty suprised SoE did not get it out to the shops in the UK in time for release. I mailed Amazon to see if they are gonna get it soon, and I will post and let you know. I really wanted the freebie this time....could be a useful junk buff for my monk *I believe it gets an icon in ur buff box*<br />
 The keyring I don't care about ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got my OoW using the Ubi download, and out of curiosity tried /claim. I got the clicky toy, so it seems that the Ubi download is the same as a CD version in that respect (you get a CD key and can download or patch the expansion files). Probably not the same with SoE download though, but Ubi could be an option if you can't find it in the stores or want it fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't get me started on Ubisoft...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their webstore was a pain at least, I have to admit that I would rather have bought it from a store, but was a bit impatient. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">whats wrong with ubisoft then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the EQ New Dawn farce<br />
people preordering OoW only to be told they dont accept the method they used to pay<br />
the 'no transfer from Ubi to SOE servers' rule, while the reverse is possible<br />
keeping EU gamers in the dark about EQ2 details, then giving out incorrect details<br />
amongst other things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used Dlgamer (http://www.dlgamer.com), have used them before and had no problems getting game. Heard that Ubisoft is also no problems.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a problem with Ubi, I just found their webstore a bit awkward (kept switching the language to French every now and then for no reason and randomly asking me to log in again). I would have preferred to get a CD version (easier to reinstall if necessary), but getting the expansion sooner rather than later seemed like a better idea. :)</div></div><hr />
