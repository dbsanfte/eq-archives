<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Commonly I am the master looter for LDON adventures.  Sometimes I am too busy to loot each one the second they die so I will save a few and loot em at once.  This is when I noticed the bug.  This bug happened to me 2 times before I made the connection.<br />
<br />
Bug:  If you are stunned from a mob hit, and try to loot a corpse (while stunned) your loot attempt will fail, you will be unable to cast any spells, your hotkeys will be useless as will your clickies.  Bug can be fixed by relogging or zoning.<br />
<br />
Just a little tid bit, hope someone will find it useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've had it happen to me without being stunned, several times. The hotkeys/casting part of it can be fixed by casting an aa ability, and the looting will fix itself after a few minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have had this happen to me several times, as of a patch about a week ago. I have heard people saying it is UI problems.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with being stunned or combat around you, I have had it happen to myself when I am soloing in PoF and just looting a freshly killed mob.<br />
<br />
I have seen it affect 3 people simultaneously in my LDON group where we all had tried to loot.<br />
<br />
It's very annoying and so hit and miss that it's hard to pin down, but every instance I have seen of it has been following trying to loot.<br />
<br />
I was never able to cast an AA ability once it happens, you can't cast or use any hotkeys. It was suggested to me to reload the UI when it happens. /loadskin UIname 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had it happen to me at least once a night now it seems.<br />
<br />
It always happens when I try to loot smething, all of a sudden the mouse can't &quot;click&quot; on anything on the screen.  The only thing that solves the problem for me is camping and reloging, zoning did not help the one time it happened to me near a zone.<br />
<br />
It seemed to start up 2 patches ago IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whew. thought it was just my computer.<br />
<br />
Or me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea this bug has made farming greens for tradeskill drops a real pain. Seems to happen every 10 mins.  Ive read some bad stories about Cleric MLers in exp groups hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've heard it happen to alot of people in my guild recently, though less now than last week.  It happened to me once after I died, I couldn't target the magus to tell him that I wanted to get closer to my corpse, hit f8 told him where, and got there and was fine.<br />
<br />
I don't use a custom UI and most of the people who have been effected don't either, not that a custom UI would prevent it just that customization is often a culprit of bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zithak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been having this problem myself. I found that if you just reload your ui , through options, it will fix the problem. Just keep in mind when you reload you will lose all chat, and any buffs on your pet wont appear to be there , even though they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, haven't had this bug, BUT last night I cast cann5 right as the wizzie was evacing.  When I zoned I went to cann5 again as it never went off, but it said I couldn't use the ability again for 4 minutes.  Cann5 has a 3 minute timer, so I have NO clue why I had to wait 4 minutes to cann again.  Then again, last night was weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just reload the UI and this bug is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just reload the UI and this bug is gone. <br />
Well not exactly, the BUG is still there, but this gets you around the problem.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven encourted this bug numerous times as well.  My experience with it has been that it happens when I try to loot a corpse and I am out of range of it.  For instance, the first time it happened to me I was looting a mob that had died on top of a rock but I thought I would be able to loot (normally I would have in other words), instead I couldnt loot it and couldnt cast spells etc.  After a couple more times it occured to me that it might have been a snap SOE reaction to the bug that was exploited by MacroQuest that allowed people to loot corpses across zones.  This happened around the time when everyone was up in arms about the numerous hacks that were out (voice grafting on an NPC etc).   So my guess is SOE wanted to stop the hacking ASAP and broke normal looting along with it.  If this is the case, I hope they find a way to fix this bug and the hacks as well soon.</div></div><hr />
