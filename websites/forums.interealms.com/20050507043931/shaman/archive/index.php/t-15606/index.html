<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, sorry if this makes you mad, but i've been reading through the best race blah blah post ( did use search :) ) But it didnt quite give me what i need, i'm not asking whats the best, or questions that turn into a flame war.  I'm just gonna give you some info, and see what you think i should pick for race.  And any little input you can give me!<br />
<br />
I like to solo on occasion ( mainly lower lvls ) <br />
I like grouping for the fast exp and rewards (38ish and up)<br />
I can deal with faction<br />
I plan to have a iksar regen bp, dont want to waste the 5k if its a waste to put on a non natural regen toon. ( ex: iksar, troll )<br />
Quest arent that big of a deal to me, if they are there, i might do them.<br />
<br />
I was looking at what armor iksars couldnt wear, it didnt seem that big of a deal, totemic isnt much besides the helm, which is easily replaced.  Most of the armor animations are just like cheap banded and leather anyway.(i think lol)  I was told by a higher lvl iksar shaman, that some of the planar armor blows some of the regular shaman planar armor away, and in the long run, with PoP out and everything, iksar shamans are top.  What do you guys think, what are suggestions?  also if you dont mind, what are some nice stat, cool looking, decent price armor for iksars.  Thanks a LOT in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the pop armor I've seen is wearable by all races. The advantage iksar have is they have natural AC and Regen.. if you plan on hitting 65 and doing the POP based content, most mobs that want to kill you will kill you.. so IMO pick a class you think looks coolest and go for it.. I'm a barb because it was my first char and I wanted good faction cause I didn't know what the hell to do.. but IF you can deal with the xp penalties go for Ogre, cause IMO the JBB is priceless, and the unstunnablility ITF against a lot of mobs solo is awesome.</div></div><hr />

Well, would the regen tunic be almost useless without a natural regen race?  Is it worth it for soloing with a ogre?  What are some good legs, arms, bracers etc?  Totemic to start?  Ogres have a exp penatly?  I havent really seen high lvl ogres running around, how do they look? SoL graphics or not?  <br />
Thanks for the input, and cant wait for more! :) thanks!</div></div><hr />

Any regen is good regen.  With a race that has a naturally high natural regen it makes it very easy to get back mana post  level 24 with the Cannibalize spell.  <br />
<br />
If you have a budget to play with look at Ry'gorr or Jaundiced armor. On most servers it is generally regarged as twink gear now and is accordingly relatively inexpensive.  For 2K plat you could get your character geared up in gear usable to mid 40's.  If you have no money I strongly recommend that you complete the quests given out in your guildhall for armor.  Most are relatively simple quests that will get you gear that will take you into your mid teens to early twenties (VERY early twenties)<br />
<br />
<br />
The original shaman classes have experience penalties.  Barbarians=5%, Ogres=15%, Trolls 20%.  That means that if you are an ogre for every mob you kill you will get 85% of the experience that say a human would get. (Human would get full 100%).  First expansion shaman race (Iksar) also has an experience penalty of 20%.  Vah Shir and Froglok's are not burdened by the exp penalty (and therefore are not real shaman)<br />
<br />
Sol graphic ogres look like giant misshapen humans with longer arms.  Non Sol graphic ogres look like really fat pears with arms and legs. <br />
<br />
(Im only kidding about the Cat and frog shaman not being real shaman....just had to get in a jealousy dig there)</div></div><hr />

Hope that answers yours questions =)<br />
<br />
(btw Iksar are the best =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When someone said that iksar planar armor is better than other planar armor, they were referring to scaled heirophant's, which is their OLD OLD OLD world planar armor.  They can't wear rune-etched, so they get scaled heirophant's instead.  The iksar armor is superior to rune-etched, but it is still pitiful compared to even the easiest to get twink items today.<br />
<br />
That being said, race has no influence whatsoever over any of the issues you listed.  Pick whichever one you think looks the coolest, and that is the race for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks jinheim, i've seen you post on NUMEROUS post simalir to this one, sorry if i bothered you.  Can anyone reply to my iksar regen BP, does it matter or make that much of a difference between a natural regen toon with a iksar bp and a toon without natural regen but with an iksar regen bp?  Thanks guys.  keep that awesome input coming! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I made an iksar he had an iksar BP from about 12-51. it helps a lot but with regrowth and stoicism you dont really feel it that much any more.<br />
<br />
looking at it so many times. really. there is no best race. when it comes down to it it doesnt matter THAT much. I would only look at 3 races though.<br />
<br />
Ogre - no frontal helps with spell casting, JJB friendly, and slam<br />
Troll - Regen and JBB friendly, and slam<br />
Iksar - Regen and AC, no JBB and no slam<br />
<br />
all the other races get minor abilities or none. not saying that those are a bad choice, you just dont get teh goodies that some of the other races get<br />
<br />
in all honesty pick what ever you think looks cool. if you like the frogs and their damn backfilps go ahead pick it. if you like the iksars sexy scales pick it! if you want to roleplay a stupid ogre go right ahead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, to answer your regen question...I get 50/tick sitting with no regen items, just natural and replenish...<br />
<br />
Ends up being alot more than an iksar bp, ends up being about like a fungi...makes life easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go ogre, you wont really notice how nice they are untill you play a non ogre. Frontal stun immunity &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah, I barely ever get stunned. If I get stunned 3 times a night it's a lot.<br />
<br />
Go frog. They look cool, you don't get an experience penalty and you get ultravision. =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That'll change once you hit 65.<br />
<br />
With maxed defensive AA and 1300 ac I'd say I get stunned 1 in 3 times a typical pop xp mob bashes/kicks me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can't remember a time when getting stunned caused me any real problems in a group or solo, so I have to believe that the no stun factor isn't really that big of deal. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't try to tell you what race to play, but I can tell you I liked the options that being an iksar gave me, and have never wished I would have played another race because of jbb, no frontal stun, faction, exp penalty, etc.<br />
<br />
Now at 65, it was all worth it to me. Go with your gut feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">slam is garbage. so dun pick a class based on slam.<br />
<br />
i never had a JBB so you don't need one. that being said don't pick a class based on being able to equip one.<br />
<br />
regen is very nice, it's like FT. imo it's better than FT.<br />
<br />
if you don't mind being stunned, go with iksar or troll.<br />
<br />
if you'd rather not get stunned, go with ogre.<br />
<br />
i'm a big fan of HP and regen. if it wasn't for the unstunnability of the ogre i would have gone troll. while the troll dies cause he couldn't get that torpor or Q off cause he was stunned...<br />
<br />
<br />
oh wait, kitties and froggies. kitties eat more and have safe fall and froggies, um, flip? haven't played EQ since froggies became a playable race. what is it that is unique about froggies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Go ogre.  And for god's sake, don't go frog.  Damned frogloks should have never been introduced into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krogoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Jinheim for the most part. I currently have a Barb Shaman and to tell you the truth in the end all the races are fun to play. They have thier perks, and lack in some areas. It's not about what race is better or what race can do this or that. It's about you having fun playing whatever race/class combo you enjoy the most. With my regen lacking Barb I find it fun to get my regen up as high as I can get it and use more then one canni to see how fast I can get mana back without the help of mana regen spells. Hit points and regen are your friend but they are not the only thing you need. Being big and un-stunable might be it for some where others like to flip when they cast. All of the races can solo as a shaman, its just a matter of learning how with that combo. I say play each race up to 7.. By then you should have found what race you like the most. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm leaning more towards an iksar right now for some reason.  Basically i think its because of the natural regen and ac bonus, with my regen bp i'll have.  So it might work out as a very nice solo combo/low downtime.  What do you guys think?  Is there anything else you can suggest or tell me about another race?  Thanks a lot, you guys are helping a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So, i'm going with a troll :)  I'm just a regen nut i guess? lol.  But anyway i have most of my gear, ikky regen tunic etc etc.  But whats a good cloak, gloves, and belt? dont have a ton of plat to spend, but i do have to sell some things, so just give me a couple of ideas if you can.  Thanks!  Also add some good names for a troll shaman if you want : )  Thanks a lot again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Go ogre. And for god's sake, don't go frog. Damned frogloks should have never been introduced into the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Froglok Advantages:<br />
<br />
Ultravision, no xp penality, frogs look the same to everyone no matter what char models they have turned on. Frogs look good riding a drogmor and they do a nice little backflip when they cast a spell. They can wear a fungi tunic and JBB. Don't underestimate the JBB, it's a pretty nice clicky toy doing 32.875 dps, 197.25 damage per tick, 1972.5 damage per minute.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with playing a frog except that apparantly some people don't like frogs. Play what you like, in the end it makes very little difference. I used to be a regen fanatic and always played an iksar. I find now that a fungi tunic and fungi staff is more then enough regen. At 52 I always finish a fight at full health. In the end you won't be wearing a fungi or using a JBB anyway. <br />
<br />
Learning to play your class correctly is much more important then which race you play.<br />

P.S. Name for a troll....hmmm...Gaspipe? I'm bad at names =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">IMHO Troll / Iskar is better 1-59 with Ogre being supreme 60+.  That was before Stoicism so maybe Ogres are better after Stoicism.  After that or Torpor regen means very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Har har, my problem has never been dying because the stun keeps me from casting Quiescence, if you are to the point that you are about to die and need an emergency heal, you need a bit more than 1800 HPs spaced out over 6 ticks :) That being said, Trolls are GREAT. They are very uncommon, which I like, as opposed to being JABS (Just another Barb Shaman), you don't look like something served as an appetizer in Louisiana, no one worries if you are going to hack up a hairball at an inopportune time, you don't need large quantites of skin lotion to deal with the scaling problems, and no one calls you Bubba. It was the rareity I enjoyed though, on our server there are usually no more than 2 or 3 troll shaman around (Least when I do the checking) so you get a certain amount of uniqueness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">im an iksar and the most notable armor that we cant use is JBB and the mithril items in NTOV.  other than that there isnt much anything else i care about not being able to use really.<br />
<br />
and to add a note about the regen ability 60+ becoming useless i beg to differ i keep my life not maxed at all times with canni4 pretty much, if im standing im casting a spell. and with my gear and replenishment and regen i get like 55hp/tick regen<br />
<br />
that means every 3 ticks i regen 165hp<br />
<br />
canni4 eats 148hp for 82mana....<br />
<br />
i keep a constant flow of 27.33FT<br />
<br />
then ya have ur Q heal if u ever canni too low...or if u wanna top off before canni5'ing for that huge surge of mana.<br />
<br />
while you might try to rationalize it as not being worth a damn it still helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am pretty new to the shaman scene myself. Started an iksar up to lvl 9, then started reading the boards and rerolled a troll (which is now 25 and levelling rapidly). Main points for me in choosing for troll:<br />
- troll shamans are indeed rare, and are very cool looking<br />
- they get to use JBB, while iksars don't; the JBB is not needed (no piece of equipment is) but it is supposed to get you through some difficult levels much quicker<br />
- trolls are the only ones to get the snare necklace, which i have gotten by now and absolutely love; make sure you roll your troll as innoruuk fan though, not cazik-thule<br />
- and i love regen - have the regen bp too, have just gotten regen and canni spells and its making quite the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Go ogre.  And for god's sake, don't go frog.  Damned frogloks should have never been introduced into the game.<br />
<br />
Ignore Gandalfh, he has burning need to diss frogloks for some reason.  I think he's having trouble seperating his in-game persona from his Crucible posting account.  Similar to when troll shaman insist on posting in trollspeak (which I always skip, sorry guys, hurts my brain).<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with a froggy shaman, at the moment anyway frogs are pretty rare in the upper levels and it would be cool to have one.</div></div><hr />
