Finally found one for sale, he says he just got an offer from someone for 9K!!  Don't tell me these are really worth that much?  I told him I was looking to pay about 6k and that was that.  Please if anyone has one of these for sale or knows of one, post here or PM me or give me a tell.</div></div><hr />
