<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sticking this in a new thread plus clarifying it so it doesn't get buried.  Stickying this would be appreciated, but I guess it boils down to how much the community cares, personally I think it would be worthwhile, it gives our self buff lines a much needed upgrade and combining them into one whilst fixing a pair of annoyances (Rabid bears usefulness and our melee abilities) that many shaman share.<br />
<br />
I think everyone pretty much agrees that Rabid Bear is now obsolete except for farming greens, it was a useful ability when xp spots like Sebilis/FG/Akr were popular, it is completely useless in the PoP environment however, the massively increased defensive skills of the majority of mobs mean its useless for xp grinding, whilst the aoes of boss encounters mean its borderline suicide to use it in the majority of encounters.  And of course Hastened Rabidity is pretty much viewed as an insult by many shaman.<br />
<br />
Henceforth after some discussion I propose this revamp to Rabid bear/Hastened rabidity.<br />
<br />
Basic rabid bear (Lvl 0) - 5 AA<br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 200 <br />
Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
Increase STR by 100 <br />
Increase AGI by 100<br />
Increase DEX by 100 <br />
+ 50dd proc<br />
+ Double atk skill of 100<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity (Lvl 1) - 2 AA<br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 230<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
Increase AC by 10<br />
Increase STR by 120<br />
Increase AGI by 120<br />
Increase DEX by 120 <br />
Increase All resists by 3<br />
Increase WIS by 10<br />
Increase HP regen by 2<br />
+ 60dd proc<br />
+ Double atk skill of 120<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity (Lvl 2) - 4 AA<br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 260<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
Increase Overhaste by 5%<br />
Increase AC by 20<br />
Increase STR by 140<br />
Increase AGI by 140<br />
Increase DEX by 140 <br />
Increase All resists by 6<br />
Increase WIS by 15<br />
Increase HP regen by 3<br />
Increase Mana regen by 1<br />
+ 70dd proc (With a proc rate similar to 56 summoned cleric hammer)<br />
+ Double atk skill of 140<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity (Lvl 3) - 6 AA<br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 300<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
Increase Overhaste by 10%<br />
Increase AC by 30<br />
Increase STR by 160 <br />
Increase AGI by 160<br />
Increase DEX by 160 <br />
Increase All resists by 10<br />
Increase WIS by 20<br />
Increase HP regen by 4<br />
Increase Mana regen by 2<br />
+ 80dd proc (With a proc rate similar to 60 summoned cleric hammer)<br />
+ Double atk skill of 160<br />
+ Slam skill of 50<br />
<br />
*Changes = Full time +50 CR is likely unbalancing, so thats gone.  The attack is lowered also, it won't make much of a difference but it cuts down on the 'omgs so much attack' whinge likelyhood.  Double attack and haste element lowered to limit the potential dps against low ac mobs to a more reasonable level.<br />
<br />
The innate proc should be a disease based DD (NO dot element) with NO resist adjustment (IE it lands with the same frequency as BoUltor), this gives more use to Malicious decay/insid malady so we can get the most out of this ability.  The reasoning for this is that if we can land poison fine, we are more likely to use BoSaryn/Nife, hence it would be an alternative source of damage when our poison dots and cold nukes simply get resisted too much.<br />
<br />
The slam skill level is quite low, but that is to prevent it from being too effective with such a large atk element.  It appears to be possible to have a buff give the player a buttoned skill (Ogre/troll/barb illusion grants the player Slam, even if they don't have it in there normal form), although how flexible this is is unknown.<br />
<br />
It should stack in much the same way as Rabid bear, but also block voice of the berserker and form of the bear/greater bear/other illusions (To prevent getting around the size issue of being a bear, this would be a fair limitation of using the buff imho).<br />
<br />
Its base duration should mirror the mage elemental form line with a 36 min duration and 15 minute recast time on the ability.<br />
<br />
Visually 1 of 2 approaches is best, if global model load is an issue, simply replace the existing old bear model with the bear from PoStorms, the PoS bear is MORE complete than the old world bear as it also includes casting animations.  Otherwise as suggested, if global model space is no longer an issue, perhaps using the Velious kodiak would be more fitting?<br />
<br />
All in all, the buff is basically a combination upgrade of Voice of the berserker, form of the great bear and Rabid bear all rolled into one and brought into line in a way that would actually make it worth casting in the pop environment without it being overpowering since it still has limitations (Size issues and buff slot issues).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Keep it on track and keep it constructive if we want SoE to actually address this, and of course an official insight as to if this is ever likely to be given thought would be massively appreciated (/poke Absor).</div></div><hr />

Was kind of hoping to have a more readable thread without the of topic/non constructive stuff getting in the way =P<br />
<br />
I'll add, keep this about rabid bear/hastened rabidity and nothing else.  If we want VI to give these AA's the attention they need, we need to be clear and uniform about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You forgot something Senor.  Currently, rabid bear adds a skill of 200 double attack for the duration.  So you double attack stuff.  It's cool and all, but just doesn't last long enuf, and refresh time is too dam long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aha, I always thought it was parsed out as being lower, cheers for correcting me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This seems a little unclear from your description, but what are you proposing the duration of the rabid bear and the reuse time of it to be for each level?<br />
<br />
Comments like Full time +50 CR is likely unbalancing, so thats gone and Its base duration should be 1 hour 3 minutes to fit in with our existing PoP buffs, theres little reason to have a long recast time on the ability, that achives little except make being dispelled a nuisiance.<br />
 lead me to wonder if you're proposing this be available full time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, at worst case it should be the same as the mage line (36 min duration, 15 min recast).  Aka, unless your not very good with clickies to avoid dispels, it should be availible full time.  Its a big departure from the old Rabid bear, but about the only questionable element in it is that a shaman will have full time max haste, but considering shaman can hit the haste cap themselves anyway, and the fact that our melee damage will always be sub par due to no min damage, that renders it a bit of a non issue.  Perhaps having it in line with the mage buffs for duration/recast would be more reasonable though.  I'll update that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay...<br />
<br />
So, 50 sv cold full time is overpowered, yet max haste and 200 double attack skill is not?<br />
<br />
Yes, max haste is attainable by shaman with an item and our own buff, but how many shamans have a 40% haste item?<br />
<br />
No way will double attack be in if this is full time or even a significant proportion of the time. The knights would be up in arms. We'd be able to slow, heal, and melee nearly as well as them. I know knights get damage bonuses and higher skill caps, but we have some nice weapons available that are priest/caster only, but have insane ratios. <br />
<br />
Yes, rabid bear is not particularly desirable - 5 minutes every 2 hours (1.5 hours with max hastened rabidity) is hardly overpowering, and not enough to be worth the AA expenditure, but full time it would be too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay...<br />
So, 50 sv cold full time is overpowered, yet max haste and 200 double attack skill is not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, the full time 50 sv cold would have a more noticeable effect =P<br />
<br />
Remember, no damage bonus = no min damage per hit.  It means that against a mob with any sort of decent defensive skills, our melee damage would fall of massively.  Got rabid bear?  Try parsing your melee damage with it vs a small shroom in FG, I've accidently melee ks'd a 60 warrior using epics + 81% haste with rabid bear + primal 2hb, not amazing, but pretty impressive.  Now try parsing your melee against a ssra snake, get all the atk buffs you can before hand if you want, your melee damage will still be borderline nothing.  <br />
<br />
Whiff, whiff, 1, whiff, whiff, 4, whiff, 3, whiff, whiff, thats what you should be expecting, except perhaps with more misses.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, as is, we would potentially (Rabid bear against even greens is very streaky) put out dps almost as good as knights against greens with this yes, but against boss encounters and typical pop xp mobs at 65, the melee damage will be a LOT less.  The proc would help cover that.  Exactly the same thing was said about the cleric hammers, that turned out to be a lot of hot air too once people actually realised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First of all, I really like the idea of having an AA bear form that you can have up full time.  However, what you are proposing is a bit too much.<br />
<br />
First of all, a 250 double attack skill with 109% haste and 300atk that functions full time is kind of ridiculous.  I am not sure what kind of numbers it would require, but our melee abilities should be on par with that of clerics using their summoned hammer.<br />
<br />
1) Remove the hastened rabidity AA from the game, and give Mudcrush (the only shaman to train this AA) his points back.  Then, apologize publically for this AA.<br />
<br />
2) Give everyone their 5 points back for rabid bear, and change it in to a 3/6/9 class AA.  The power of the bear form scales at each rank, as you suggested.<br />
<br />
3) The new rabid bear AA will be a full-time enhancement of our current bear form.  The goal of this AA will be to threefold: A) to continue the bearform line that we already have B) to bring our melee abilities up to par with clerics C) to add an automatic self mana-regen AA/spell, as all other classes have.<br />
<br />
For reference, this is what the following classes get as innate mana regen by either an AA or spell (not counting any common items, such as wizard epic, or the mental clarity AA):<br />
<br />
Cleric (20) - 8 from armor of the zealot, a 65 spell, 12 from yaulp6, a 65 spell.<br />
Druid (12) - 4 from mask of the forest, a 65 spell, and 8 from Protection of the Nine, a 63 spell.<br />
Enchanter (18) - 18 from VOQ, a 65 spell.  No self-only buffs I can find.<br />
Magician (10) - 4 from level 3 water elemental form (18 AA), 6 from Xegony's Phantasmal Guard, a 62 spell.<br />
Necromancer (52) - 2 from force shield, a 62 spell.  50 (for 63 hp) from Seduction of Saryrn, a 64 spell.<br />
Wizard (10) - 8 from allegiant familiar (9AA for the prereq, could not find the AA cost for this one), 2 from force shield, a 63 spell.<br />
Shamans ( ZERO ) - we get nada.<br />
<br />
A lot of people say that we do not need innate mana regen, because of our cannibalization abilities.  I disagree with this.  FT and other formates of innate mana regen are actually extremely important for us.  When you are on a raid where you are fighting a mob with a nasty AE, or you are in a group where you have lots of adds and people are getting smacked left and right and need blast heals, you just do not have time to cannibalize.  I can always find 6 seconds to hit canni5 and cast QB3 quiescence on myself afterwards, but when people are dying around me, I do not have time to stand there and cast canni4 over and over.  For soloing we don't even really need kei because you have so much time where you are just sitting and waiting for your dots to run out, and you can canni4 in this time.  When the poo hits the fan though, you need innate mana regen.  These are also reasons why you need a large mana pool, but that is irrelevent to this thread.<br />
<br />
That being said, here is my version of the proposed rabid bear improvements:<br />
<br />
Form of The Great Bear (included for reference):<br />
1:  Illusion: Bear <br />
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 2 per tick <br />
3:  Increase WIS by 10 <br />
<br />
Level 1 (3 AA):<br />
1:  Illusion: Bear <br />
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 3 per tick <br />
3:  Increase WIS by 12 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 1 per tick<br />
5:  Summon a spear equivalent to http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5800<br />
6:  10% haste, stacks<br />
7:  Grants bash skill about half as good as a cleric's.<br />
<br />
Level 2 (6 AA):<br />
1:  Illusion: Bear <br />
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 4 per tick <br />
3:  Increase WIS by 15 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 2 per tick<br />
5:  Summon a spear equivalent to http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=15996<br />
6:  20% haste, stacks<br />
7:  Grants bash skill as good as a cleric's.<br />
<br />
Level 3 (9 AA):<br />
1:  Illusion: GRIZLOR &lt;---- most important part<br />
2:  Increase Hitpoints by 6 per tick <br />
3:  Increase WIS by 20 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 4 per tick<br />
5:  Summon a spear equivalent to http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29365<br />
6:  30% haste, stacks (same haste as yaulp6).<br />
7:  Grants bash skill half again as good as a cleric's.<br />
<br />
It should have a duration short enough so that you don't have to wait forever to cast if you zone in and out (5 minutes), and a long enough duration that it isn't annoying (72 minutes).<br />
<br />
I feel that the stats I listed are fair and balanced, yet still desirable.  If this AA was implemented, I would definately buy it, but it isn't going to be #1 on anyone's list (unless of course you already have the good stuff).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Forgot to explain why I think a summoned spear would be a good idea.<br />
<br />
Clerics rely almost completely on procs in order to deal any melee damage.  This works.  Rabid bear damage parses were almost decent against mushrooms in FG while using the best weapon of the time (bone of bertoxx), but I am willing to bet that rabid bear damage against tier2+ mobs is completely laughable.  We miss miss miss miss.  The 200atk bonus does not make us hit any more, it just makes us hit harder when we connect.  Thus, we'd still be whiffing a lot, we'd just be hitting for 90 that one time we do connect, instead of 3.  If you were using a proccing spear, though, it doesn't matter if you hit or miss, and thus your atk doesn't matter.  All that matters is your dex (which can be easily capped with focus + anything from the avatar line), and your haste, which will be 90% without a haste item (SLTW + my proposed 30% for form3).<br />
<br />
If we got a proccing spear every time that we went in to rabid bear form, we wouldn't need huge atk bonuses, haste, and double attack in order to do a smidge of melee damage.  Lets face it:  Shamans getting a constant double attack is too much, and the clerics would whine.  On top of that, we wouldn't have to worry about lugging around a silly 2hb weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First of all, a 250 double attack skill with 109% haste and 300atk that functions full time is kind of ridiculous.

<br />
As you state later, it isnt, we will still have the tendancy to miss for the majority of the time, all that attack is doing is ensuring that we we do connect a blow, it'll actually land for more than 5 points of damage against most reasonable mobs.  This is also the reason why the innate proc is so toned down compared to the cleric's proc.  Shaman are much more physically orientated than clerics, and this means of melee damage output would reflect that.  Of course when the mobs defense is simply too high, it still gives us the option of digging out that low delay weapon and relying more on the proc damage.<br />
<br />
Infact, looking at your scale, if the 30% haste stacks with regular haste (Yaulp 5/6 are NOT overhaste, the haste element doesnt stack with regular haste), it would put out more dps than the hammer by a fair amount, and would do substantially more dps vs my scale against higher ac mobs, 30% overhaste is a hell of a lot =)  I'm not sold on going with a summoned spear instead of using an innate proc though, the innate proc adds the limation of needing to carry 2 additional weapons, but gives more flexibilty and strategy to getting the most out of the ability.<br />
<br />
I'll agree though, as is the potential damage is perhaps too high against low ac stuff.  Perhaps setting the regular haste element to 60% (IE same as sltw) and toning the double attack skill back down to what I had it before would ease that?<br />
<br />
But as is my scale without the double attack skill would actually fall behind cleric hammer dps against stuff that a 65 shaman would be fighting for xp or on raids.<br />
<br />
It would be great if SoE would stick this on test to see how well it parses out, I'd be willing to bet that wouldn't be as powerful as many think.  But it would be nice, and something worth getting for shaman that love or hate melee regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman are much more physically orientated than clerics, and this means of melee damage output would reflect that.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with this.  In the traditional D&amp;D style environment, clerics are NOT little wussies.  They've earned a reputation for sissiness in EQ because they are not at all self-sufficient, and the majority of clerics are dainty high-elf females.  The only real reason that shamans might be more &quot;physically orientented&quot; is because the original shaman races were all big and strong.  Since classic EQ, though, each expansion has brought us progressively wussier races.  Iksars are weak, Vah Shir are pussies (hrhrhr), and frogloks are just... well.... frogloks.<br />
<br />
You might be right though about the double attack thing.  A 250 double attack is way too much, but if they gave us a much lower DA, perhaps similar to what beastlords can obtain with their bestial frenzy AA (10AA total), then it would give us a decent boost without coming close to infringing on true melees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh agreed, if anything the EQ shaman is more like the D&amp;D cleric though, or at least it was in the orginal 'vision' =)<br />
<br />
*Edit*, I've toned down the haste and double attack skills on the listings at the top, how does that look?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Of course when the mobs defense is simply too high, it still gives us the option of digging out that low delay weapon and relying more on the proc damage.<br />
<br />
Just a minor point, but my understanding is that proc rate is independent of weapon speed. The proc rate is a function of the spell (i.e., it's coded into the spell) and probably the dexterity of the character. <br />
<br />
I've read accounts of tests done by Paladins using their weapon proc-imbue spells with weapons of different delay, and the rate of procs per time spent fighting was the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, thats something I'm trying to understand atm IE how the proc rate is actually defined, for example both Hammer of Judgement (Lvl 56 summoned hammer) and Hammer of Damnation (Lvl 63 summoned hammer) proc precisely the same spell.  So I belive the proc rate is actually specified on the item or buff that gives the proc effect, not in the proc itself.<br />
<br />
Figuring out what defines it is the fun part though =)<br />
<br />
With knowledge of how the proc rate is defined it would be quite possible to parse this ability comparitively to the cleric hammers via emulating a server.<br />
<br />
*Edit* this opens up another issue with how the double attack skill is defined within rabid bear unfortunately.  argh!$%&quot;~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the stats as posted right now, sounds like you change them as suggestions are made, so a couple posts above were confusing to me as I read them seeing only the most recent stats listed out :)<br />

<br />
   Having a regular access to some form of Melee damage would be supremely beneficial.   Would love to see the occasionall double miss and maybe proc while I am sitting in front of a mob bouncing slows off of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm nice ideas but none that look particualy enticing. Rabid bear looks a fun ability although it has a long reuse time and costs way too much. I would like to see a replacement for sure. But maybe not along the lines you have suggested although are good ideas but maybe too close to cleric change. Something along shaman lines, for example a pet melee discipline of some sort would be nice.(still waiting for a kinda pet buff upgrade to spirit quickening) Maybe ability to summon weapons for pet scaled 2 4 6. With different procs. Maybe bouncing too near the mage class but it is an idea. Or if it has to be a shaman melee thing then something which is strong against casters possibly. Hehe maybe a kinda silence or like caanus was talking about in another article being able to cast feeble mind on npcs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1: Illusion: GRIZLOR &lt;---- most important part LOL, what the heck?<br />
<br />
Edit: need to fix sig, Prophet now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree Sebazy, Rabid Bear needs fixing. However, it seems unlikely to me that Sony is gonna completely rework the whole AA and add those different levels in. I wonder if it would be easier to leave rabid bear on the long timer, but make it really kick butt while it's activated. Ideally when in rabid bear form the shaman's melee DPS should at least be even with a similarly equipped backstabbing rogue. That way even Hastened Rabidity would be useful and could remain in place. I'd bet this would be easier for the devs to implement with quick change.<br />
<br />
Currently, rabid bear adds a skill of 200 double attack for the duration<br />
<br />
 If it does then that's a good start, I guess double attack doesn't show up in the data Lucy parses:<br />
<br />
1:  Add Proc: Tainted Bite <br />
2:  Illusion: Bear <br />
3:  Increase ATK by 200 <br />
4:  Increase Attack Speed by 99% <br />
5:  Increase STR by 100 <br />
6:  Increase DEX by 100 <br />
7:  Increase Cold Resist by 50 <br />
<br />
 Hint to devs: Increasing Str and Dex doesn't translate into big melee DPS, it translates into a waste of effect slots. We can buff our own Str/Dex if we want to do that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think Rabid Bear should just be removed and replaced with combat AAs similiar to BST... like Combat Focus 1/2/3 which gives us an increase in weapon caps... and Advanced Combat Focus 1/2/3 which gives us double attack at 25 50 and then 100 or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ideally when in rabid bear form the shaman's melee DPS should at least be even with a similarly equipped backstabbing rogue.<br />
<br />
I don't think that would actually be possible without either a mindblowing amount of atk or a VERY nasty proc, both of which would likely cause somewhat big ripples of complaints from the other classes.  And of course 5 minutes of uber melee every 2 hours is only really useful against boss encounters, how many pop bosses can you stand toe to toe with and not die in short order to the aoes much like the rogues/monks.  It really wouldn't be that useful for soloing or even that great for xping, hence you effectively end up with the old rabid bear aka a party trick you fire off a few times then forget about.  Thats not whats wanted imho.<br />
<br />
Hence its more beneficial to give a more reasonable but potentially full time melee boost in line with the cleric hammers that also offers utility even if you have no intention of meleeing at all, this of course has the benefit of also wrapping up 2 other self buff lines that were effectively forgotten about since Velious.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it looks like all the various AA skills (Rabid bear, the beastlord AA thats already been mentioned, as well as harmonious attack for bards) that grant a basic double attack skill are hard coded.  Yay =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Personally I would be happy with rabid bear being available for use, more often, possibly full time, like mage elemental form and have the proc changed to DD, rather than DOT.<br />
<br />
With the recent Game Update from SOE indicating that high end melee is getting a boost to catch up with high end casters... well I just don't anticipate us as a caster class getting a melee damage increase at this time.  If anything I would shoot for small and simple improvements.<br />
<br />
In the unlikely case that the folks at SOE would be redoing the entire AA (and refunding the points of the original rabid bear) I think there are some very cool ideas here.  <br />
<br />
I don't think we will ever get bash or a &quot;hammer of the gods&quot; proc, that's something special and unique they gave out to clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think it should add a static 60% OVER haste cap.

<br />
The proposed rabid bear gives an increase to Slam, a skill the 3 original shaman races have had since day 1,  Far longer than clerics have ever had bash.  Its a small mod, but the intention is to allow the newer shaman to use it as well as to make it much more likely to actually connect in conjunction with the atk element.  Higher frequency weapons have been around for a while too, check the proc rate on primal 2 handers, its practically on par with the 56 hammer, the proc rate is the only simularity (and its proposed lower), ours is poison based, fixed damage and resistable, hand of the gods is random, but unresistable.<br />
<br />
I think it should add a static 60% OVER haste cap. This would make it so we almost attacked with the speed of a dual wielder. IMO Rabid bear should be a short duration metamorphosis that turns us into a melee BEAST, not just makes us &quot;slightly better at meleeing&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember the game engine can only handle a min delay of 10 after haste, we will never swing remotely as fast as an equivilently high end dual wielder.  Also swinging fast instead of more of a focus on slower but more powerful attacks would bring up the problem of us simply taking more damage than we inflict through ripostes the second we get in a mobs frontal arc.  A short duration but very dramatic effect simply wont be useful in pop without being unbalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ok , my 2 cents<br />
<br />
There is no way we are seeing anything in this thread. Its too much of a change. We have gone form a simple request of asking RB to be useable more often, to redesigning the whole AA. While i like the ideas in this thread and the other, i think its pretty easy to see once we sit back and think  realisticly, that they arent going to happen and asking for them probably hurts the original request of time change.<br />
<br />
So on that note let me share this. I was in dulak today, infact i am right now, and broke in and and busted out the RB for kicks and its not that bad as it is. Nice lil proc, melee boost, double attack and with my hammer of spirit calling that was doubling for 163. Me and puppy tore through the servant of hate i was munching on. Thats all it needs to be, a fun AA that boosts melee enough to not laugh at. I would reallylike to see the damage i was putting out compared to the avarage cleric with a proc hammer and im willing to bet id be right there with them or atleast close.<br />
<br />
All i want with this AA is 1 thing. Change the reuse time. Paying for hasten rabidity is a crime, truly, atleast for the amount of AA you have to spend.<br />
<br />
There is no reason that this AA shouldnt be inline with the mage AA. Frankly i hate to bitch about anything, i try to enjopy my shaman and complain very little anymore. But i do find it a little unfair that the mage has theirs adjusted and we still have a hour and 45 min reuse. Just stop and think about how useless a 3 min AA is once every hour and 45 min.<br />
<br />
So to sum up, just change the reuse time, thats all i want, change it to 10,20 or 30 min and just get rid of HR and refund the AA to the one shaman that got it.</div></div><hr />

 You got me, being able to do &quot;as good&quot; melee damage for 5 minutes out of every 2 hours (4% of the time) would just be brutally overpowered.. right? I'm sure it would single-handedly destroy the entire rogue class.<br />
<br />
IMO Rabid bear should be a short duration metamorphosis that turns us into a melee BEAST <br />
<br />
 I agree, that's kinda how it was advertised and it would be nice if it were so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like the proposed redesign.<br />
<br />
One big trade off about this is the mana regen loss from not being on horseback (or lizardback, for you freaks).  FT1/FT2 isn't gonna compare with Cannibalizing, so you lose melee time to regain your mana.<br />
<br />
Enough of a melee boost to put some fun back in the game at the higher end. Won't infringe on the real melee folk's role as primary tanks.  We're not gonna the primary tank in a pickup group with any stage of these AAs.<br />
<br />
Stat increases (aside from AGI and ATK) are negligible, considering that as proposed it won't stack with Voice of the Berserker.<br />
<br />
Haste increase is negligble for most folks -- we're gonna haste ourselves anyway.<br />
<br />
In all, very well balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Re: Litgruv, your correct, against lower mobs (A servant of hate is 48ish) rabid bear is still quite effective, its against the lvl55 to 65 mobs that a shaman is going to be typically encountering day to day where rabid bear pales.  You attack them from the back and you just miss with occasional tiny little hits, you attack them from the front and you'll likely kill yourself to ripostes before you do any reasonable amount of damage.<br />
<br />
The current proc is little more than a hinderance, 35 dd, 25 damage per tick over a minute, our level 24 poison dot does better damage (27 per tick) than rabid bear's proc....<br />
<br />
Shandy's run down of it is pretty much spot on, yes its a total revamp, but I don't think even VI could argue that Rabid bear/HR are not in need of attention, read into the numbers and think about what it will actually mean in use.  Its not as dramatic as you'd think, and it *should* prove to be quite nicely balanced as is, although actually sticking it on test really is the only way to be sure.<br />
<br />
/poke Absor, give us a sign or something =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As for the concerns over it impairing our mana regen, you can still fit in a canni 5 quite easily, and if you are doing mana intensive stuff like heailng for the group or trying to lay in all your DoTs, then there is little use for going rabid beyond the fact now you can hit TWO times between casts instead of 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sadinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">This ability DOES need to be improved . . . however any stat improvements / changes is just wishful thinking.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Actually I think Jinheim's proposal is fairly on the money; extending the existing spell line through AA with 3/6/9 upgrades, and making it something we'd keep on. Since a meleeing shaman isn't cannibalizing for mana regen, having a small mana regen component (smaller than the other class ones) innate to the form is at least something, and it's still useful to a small degree even if we don't want to engage in melee.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love bearform (not as much as Finaljustice, but still) and it'd be nice to have some reason to keep it up in outdoor zones instead of the sucky horse, particularly since the SoL models and chain graphics and animations are so embarrassingly bad.<br />
<br />
If I had an open choice to pick a form, I'd go with the velious Kodiaks tho ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yea but your not dealing with reality i feel. SoE does not have a track record for makig these kind of large changes and in their scope it will be large.<br />
<br />
Basicly we are asking for a complete revamp of the rabid bear system based on a simple time adjustment that the mages got. We arent asking for equality, we are asking for better. Thats how i veiw this anyway. Rabid bear was never meant to make us melee gods and though i want strong melee skills too, its obvious SoE does not want us to be strong meleers. now i used RB in BoT on occasion and no, im not hitting as well as i do in dulak, but you are not taking into consideration that no one is. Ask any ranger or warrior or whatever in which zone they are connecting most and you will get the same response.<br />
<br />
You mentioned that 55-65 is where we are going to be falling off, but on those mobs its more &quot;effective&quot; to be casting DoTs and stuff, anything thats 55+ in this game in 90% of the zones is hitting for 300+. Anything over 300ish starts to become ineffective to tank i feel and it becomes better to get on your horse and let puppy tank so you can regen mana and heal him while you DoT and such.  Anything thats 60+ is going to be hitting considerably more then 300 a pop and possibably doubling, again, clicking on rabid bear adn meleeing this mob to death is not going to be anything more then a attempt at sport, cause the efficient way will be to root and rot at that point. You can only keep 350ish a tick or so on you ( torpor/Q and regen items ) so in the long on on mobs like this your going to not beable to keep up and thats only if the slows are not mititgated.<br />
<br />
This is a AA i feel that has a purpose for being fun, great for clearing lower level camps like dulak and seb and PoG and possibly meleeing the back of raid mobs when we have done all else. When else do we really &quot;need&quot; it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
So again , i say just up the duration, or maybe even make it able to stay up 24/7 but with a penalty like it diables all flowing though items or something. Id be so content with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">How would this make us a melee god?  Even with every melee/atk/stat buff I can beg, borrow, or steal, I'm still basically tickling the thing most of the time, with a solid THWACK being the exception, not the rule.<br />
<br />
This addresses two major concerns regarding the late and end-game shaman class, and does so using mechanics that Sony's already implemented with other AA, spells, and the like.  So far, we have not seen a method of penalizing FT items like you suggested.  Not saying there isn't one, just that we haven't seen it.<br />
<br />
Damage done will be primarily through a disease DD.  Oh, look -- a spell to memorize to knock down risease resists and thus cut down on melee time.<br />
<br />
This change would let us have fun, do some damage, cut back on our frequently near-godlike mana regen (keep bear form or sit on horse... hmmm) while not crushing our primary methods of doing so, and cause us to make some decisions about how to tailor our play style.<br />
<br />
It'd be worth being furry and white and spotted from a mile off again.<br />
<br />
They could change the reuse time and I'd be content.  If they made it fun, I'd be happy.<br />

I dare you to kill a tier 2 + mob with ONLY our 24 dot (envenomed breath) just to see how insignificant that procs damage is.  All it achives is to make a mob unmezzable these days.  Its a pain.<br />

<br />
Go parse your dps with rabid bear on ANY ssra mob, (It'll likely be around 2 to 3dps) go parse your dps with rabid bear on one of the majority of PoP bosses (It'll likely be around 0 dps as you'll be dead to the aoes).  2 hours, 20 minutes, it doesnt matter what the refresh time is, rabid bear simply doesnt have any real use as it is.<br />
<br />
Basicly we are asking for a complete revamp of the rabid bear system based on a simple time adjustment that the mages got.<br />

<br />
but you are not taking into consideration that no one is. Ask any ranger or warrior or whatever in which zone they are connecting most and you will get the same response.<br />
<br />
And YOUR not taking damage bonus' into account.  Yeah all classes fall off to an extent going from greenies to dark blue xp givers.  But true melee classes do not tail of anything like we do (And they shouldn't either).  Rangers can still quite happily put out 100dps + in melee in BoT.  Imho there are only 2 zones in the game where melee actually start hitting as bad as priests, and thats Ssra and to a lesser extent ST.<br />
<br />
Being a little optimistic doesnt hurt, look at the stuff that VI has been implimenting on test lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">they key thing here, is that shamans are not on the damage table needed to hit mobs of higher level.  You need to be on that table to hit those mobs with any real regularity.  They could make it +400 attack and we'd still be doing worse than your average paladin vs. PoP mobs.  <br />
<br />
O and btw, i HAVE rabid bear, and it does add double attack.  I double attack quite a bit, over half my attacks at least are doubles.  With my 25/25 mace, I can crank out the DPS on easy stuff it is true.  But the duration and recast times just make it a novelty thing.  <br />
<br />
Another skill I am disappointed in is Spiritcall.  I forget to use it a lot lately, for all the good it does when I do remember it.</div></div><hr />

You missed the point, which is that this is not meant to be a viable scource of dps, its a toy and always has been a toy.<br />

<br />
<br />
You mean beating up greenies/light blues?  Thats the only thing it does well, and ever will as is.<br />

Yes, i think thats exactly the words i used, how often you see cleric being used as a serious source of melee output in BoT or PoT or more importantly, when facing a raid mob. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Go parse your dps with rabid bear on ANY ssra mob, (It'll likely be around 2 to 3dps) go parse your dps with rabid bear on one of the majority of PoP bosses (It'll likely be around 0 dps as you'll be dead to the aoes).  2 hours, 20 minutes, it doesnt matter what the refresh time is, rabid bear simply doesnt have any real use as it is.<br />
<br />
Well i dont know what weapon you use or what your stats are ,but i double 163 mobs in BoT and also raid mobs when i have a chance to click rabid bear in a raid. Yes i miss alot on raid mobs, but im not a melee class. Again , melee to use can be nothing more then a toy, once we pass that realm we infringe on other class abilities and we have a rep for being overwpowered as it is, so why stoke the fires ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The mage AA's give useful benefits, rabid bear does not, next point please. Your Comparing a kevlar vest to a silk shirt or like comparing a nerf bat to a broadsword, these are 2 differently designed &quot;skills&quot; which is the whole &quot;point&quot;. It is only the reuse time that we are comparing here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are asking for a mostly reduntant skill to be improved to the point where it actually has a use (And no I don't call beating up light blue/green mobs a use).  Again, its been designed to be a toy since day once. I see no reason it shouldnt keep its present incarnation, just more available.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so tell me precisely what part of my proposed rabid bear revamp makes us into a melee god, I really can't quite see it myself. It was a exaggeration, Hard to bring sarcasm across in text form.<br />

<br />
I think we should take a real look at Dps then without standing on theoretical beliefs then shall we? If i can get a PoP group today ill parse out how much Dps i can squeeze on a mob with my pet/BoN and rabid bear, this is a perfectly sustainable Dps combo, you can slow DoT and melee and just cause a DoT doesnt run its full course doesnt mean it cant be counted cause its still doing damage per tick. Actualy i just need a druid or cleric to help me on a stormrider and a good parser.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">One thing I think we all aggree on is that Rabid Bear needs to be fixed.  Currently, we have 35AA points devoted to absolutely useless AA skills:<br />
<br />
1.  5 for RB<br />
2. 18 for Alchemy Mastery<br />
3. 12 for Hastened Rabidity.<br />
<br />
The proposed changes by Sebazy and Jinhiem would be nice, but frankly, any change involving these skills would be welcome.  A minimum change to these skills should be:<br />
<br />
1.  Eliminate Alchemy Mastery and Hastened Rabidity entirely.<br />
2.  Alter the timing of Rabid Bear to be in line with the mage illusion skills.<br />
3.  Provide an upgrade path for RB to make it useful on PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
The suggestions here about how to redesign RB I think are useful, and I hope the designers take them into account in defining the upgrade path to RB.  However, the changes don't need to be earth shattering in order to make the skill useful.<br />

<br />
So basically making this permanent you would be able to do 50 DPS on PoP exp mobs(they don't mitigate damage really well) + a 50 CR. <br />
Now the DPS part is a joke, as i can do 33 dps without using mana on most mobs, regardless of their level of melee mitigation. <br />
Now add all the damage you will take from riposte and it isn't worth using it, unless you have the back of the mob 100% of the time. <br />
Essientially the dps part of this skill is negligeable in a balance discussion.<br />
<br />
Now one could argue that the 50 CR part is unbalancing for 5 points. Now 50 CR in itself won't do much, but i can see it being unbalanced compared to what other classes have to spend to get 30 CR from AA's. On the other hand the 50 CR you'd get from Rabid Bear would take up a buff slot and it would be dispellable. <br />
After taking the different Pro's and Con's into account i'd suggest to have Hastened Rabidity level 1 and 2 reduce the reuse time by 25% and 50% and level 3 making it a passive skill.<br />
<br />
17 AA's for 50 DPS(which have situational use) and 50 CR through a buff.</div></div><hr />

You can see alot of doubles coming from me in there and alot of them are landing for over 100. Again this was my first run on it and i had to bolt near then end so i didnt die, what i need is help so i can figh tthe whole thing then parse out the results. Ill try a lil harder to find someone to help on the next 2 fights. But even this fight and a unusual about a wiffs on my part ( for PoP mobs i mean ) and it was more then 0dps. It was even some what respectable for a caster when you take puppy into account, not to mention a low mana spell like BoN.<br />
<br />
Ill post more when i can do more tests.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I can do 54 DPS with one single spell, Blood of Saryn.  And I can easily keep the mana producing fast enough to do that indefinitely.  In fact, I can produce mana fast enough to tack on Ancient: Scourge of Nife at 46 DPS also indefinitely.  So indefinitely, 100 DPS thru spells, no uber weapons, no permanent 41% haste item.  <br />
<br />
Basically Giac, you are admitting that even tho you have a nice weapon and haste, both well over average, you can only do half as much DPS using melee as the average PLed-to-65-druid-gear shaman.  <br />
<br />
I guess that would be fine, if it were able to be accessed full time for the purposes of enjoyment.  But it's not, it's only available a VERY SMALL fraction of the time.  And THAT, my friends, is the real problem.<br />
<br />
I am not sure, if my post wasn't clear or if i worded it poorly. <br />
Check out this link Old Rabbid Bear thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=882) <br />
<br />
If you read my post from more than a year ago, you see me stating how this skill should have been a passive ability from the start. There was another thread in which i had stated the same after doing my own parses like 5 months before, when luclin went live. <br />
Back then i suggested to make Rabid Bear a passive skill, while making it more expensive(AA point wise), unfortunately, that thread is gone and i remember a few people telling me &quot;You are nuts for suggesting that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just thought i should clarify that Rabid Bear has been broken since day one and that my suggestion still stands. 17 AA's for a permanent 50ish dps melee + 50 CR buff is totally balanced.</div></div><hr />

1: Decrease Hitpoints by 25 per tick<br />
2: Decrease Movement by 60%<br />
<br />
easy hammer to get and cheap if you wanna just buy it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was fully buffed so stats were maxed, was 60% hasted , but i think that RB overwrites the effects of whatever haste you have.<br />
<br />
See, my arguement for this being only a toy is based on the idea that if we treat our melee skills to seriously, then it changes the direction of our class. If we want something we have to aim for ease and as lil impact on balance as possible, atleast for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Beargor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Hmm.....<br />
<br />
1) There's alot of complaints about the ability Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
The opinions I tend to agree with are those who incline it's more reasonable to ask for longer lasting / faster reuse of the ability, and not for the ability to be more powerful for the time it is activated.<br />
<br />
( e.g. if RB is to be fixed, then let it last longer and/or use more often, or be replaced with something useful<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I'm not alone in feeling that it's a pain (after some hours of grinding at least) to remember who you're supposed to Ferine Avatar next.<br />
<br />
<br />
3a) Our old spell Spirit of Bear is a stamina spell. Yet our Bear Forms does yield no stamina boost (doh!), nor do Rabid Bear nor any Avatar.<br />
<br />
3b) We can buff   +260 str, +245 dex, +200 agi and +60 sta.  We used to be able to buff stats evenly, but now we're lacking on buffing sta  /compaired/  to the other 3 melee stats.  And as any can se, we can easily buff up a caster-gnome up to the 280 cap of str/dex/agi  =)<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Spell-unification. Cleric had AC buff and two HP buffs ( hero and symbol). Now they got Aego/Virtue. Enchanter had + int/wis buff, ? mana regen buff and ? mana pool buff. Now they got KEI/Tranq/VoQ. Shamans have Focus, with is a unification allready ( Talisman (the HP buff line) + str buff + dex buff), Bih'Li, Primal Essence ( irritating VP hammer click thing, or agi if you don't have), sta, Talisman of Diaku, Avatar, Acumen, I want those merged.. to..  Form of the [Great] Grezlor (thanks Jinheim for that suggestion)<br />
<br />
Totally those buffs above gives:<br />
<br />
Increase STA by 80 <br />
Increase AGI by 160 <br />
Increase STR by 280 <br />
Increase DEX by 265 <br />
Increase ATK by 155 <br />
Increase Max Hitpoints by 544 <br />
Increase Movement by 55%<br />
See Invisible<br />
Ultravision <br />
Decrease Stamina Loss by 10 <br />
<br />
Though I know it'd be a pain for Verant to do proper stacking code, so more reasonable would be the spell to take hold instead of Avatar - like that chanter scarecrow illution spell, though the new Bear form would need more sta =P<br />
<br />
But.. should the spell be group (but not TGB / MGB), or single?<br />
<br />
Group would ease the shaman, however there's one other major thing..<br />
<br />
Shaman are supposed to be the best buffer of meleese right.. and especially a Warrior's best friend?<br />
<br />
Wich class is having problem in/getting grind groups? =)<br />
<br />
That's the warrior. I propose the spell to diable the target to cast buffs...  like the Voice of the Berserker spell line used to do or still does ? ( who have used that spell the last year?) =)<br />
<br />
This would be a major setback for all but war/rog/monk classes, and would promote Shm/war combination in groups (at high level at least), and not benefit the warriorkillers ( pal/shd)<br />
<br />
If the spell helped taunting ( add a taunt proc or whatever), then greater!<br />
<br />
Hm... mebbe the 'berserk' spell line can be useful again, if we can target others, with the benefit of +taunt and mebbe +ATK, but with the disadvantage of not beeing able to cast...<br />
<br />
Hopefully it won't make  monk or rogue tanks too uber =(<br />
<br />
Time for sleep before I start typing nonsense!  what you think? :)<br />

<br />
<br />
  A lower re-use is most definately in line for this ability.   Having so many class AAs that the community as a whole wouldn't even consider purchasing is quite an affront to decency.   And mainly it is due simply to Verant deciding that they don't want to give us anything NEW to play with cause we have proven able to turn any small ability into a large power gain in the past.   Result is that now in each expansion they upgrade us minimally and try to limit our capabilities :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Beargor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'm not smoking, /rude !  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Considering Bards get an aa they give them a perm double attack skill (granted at a much higher aa cost) RB being toned down some and being a perm skill would hardly be overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Hmm , toned down some would make it worthless to me, its already borderline and simply fun. If it was weaker it would lose its fun factor. The game has changed so much, classes are so much more powerful then before and we never really got anything upgraded well. This toy being left as is and giving us a bigger reuse tiem i dont feel is very  unbalancing at all</div></div><hr />

I was always told delay on a weapon doesnt matter whn you give it to puppy, but i gave puppy those luggard daggers which have a delay of 18 and you can clearly see his delay is 18. Intresting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Litgruv?  Safe to assume you hasted your puppy?  If so, isn't 18 his *hasted* delay, which implies that weapon delay doesn't change pet's native delay?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">By toned down I mean if it was an innate ability (not a buff) it would be overpowered. There would be no stacking issues at all then, and it would always be on (never dispelled). Just too much for 5aa then.<br />
<br />
As a buff it is way underpowered currently due to stacking issues with other buffs even if we could keep it up all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">By toned down I mean if it was an innate ability (not a buff) it would be overpowered.

<br />
Not really, it would take Rabid bear (5 aa) + Hastened Rabidity 3 (12aa) to make it an innate ability if we went with the other route thats been suggested (Which I think was 25%/50%/Innate timer reduction on HR?).  17 AA strikes me as reasonable, It'd be a shame not to do more with the rabid bear buff but having it full time would be a lot more reasonable than it is atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">ok well basicly what we can see from the crude graphs and testing that with puppy, RB puts out more then our level 65 DoT againts a level 62 PoP mob. Mind you this is not with a alpha 2 puppy ( procs ).<br />
<br />
So without getting help for a 3rd test i think ill just rest on these 2 on evidence for my arguement that RB needs no tweaking at all. It needs one thing, increased use for less AA. I will not spend 17AA pesonaly even if the changes sebazy and Jin were implemented. Perhaps if i had all other things that i wanted and was through inate stamina and inate resists would i think about it. There is no way to make this skill as useful as some have requested in this thread without unbalancing I feel. Any noticable strength added to it will tip the scales to our melee being the more viable damage out put. This kind of unbalance while fun, would make for bad for the class. Nerf to Can5, since we arent casting DoTs its unbalancing for us to have so much mana , or ateast this is what other classes and inthe end SoE would say. It , i feel, would become another sore spot attracting attention to us again in the light that we are &quot;overpowered&quot;. I would rather have that attention be on how screwed up out buff durations at 65 are or maybe a tweak on our heals or something that needs attention that wont be skipped over cause we are &quot;uber&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion anyway. Could be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Erm, your parses show rabid bear as doing 27 to 28 dps against storm watches, did you know that Blood of Saryn does 54 dps?  Why are you counting pet damage towards rabid bears dps? (I presume thats what your error is)<br />
<br />
So since you have that horridly mixed up, let me explain in small words what my proprosed changes do.  I'll keep it simple in the hope that you might understand it finally.<br />
<br />
It makes the damage you do more consistant no matter what you are fighting.  It doesnt substantially up the damage except against the higher ac mobs, the only place you'll notice a particularly big rise in damage is Ssra<br />
<br />
It adds additional effects that are useful, even if you are not meleeing. Remember, for every shaman that loves to melee, theres another that plain doesnt want to, rabid bear should be useful for them too, this makes it so it is<br />
<br />
Also, you have parsed a pretty weak BoT mob only, try some variety to demonstrate how rabid bear fluctuates massively.  Go on, parse a ssra snake if you actually care, you'll be suprised what the results are like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I am not sure why you guys are still debating.<br />
<br />
Anyways, a few things...<br />
<br />
1) What the heck does Rabi Bear have to do with the pet's dps btw, Litgruv?<br />
2) Blood of Saryrn is NOT 54(53.3*) DPS, it's 47(46.6*) DPS if you are lucky and catch a damage tick right as you finish casting it.<br />
3) 50 DPS is pretty much what you can achieve with RB in PoP and it is a 90% useless 50 DPS. <br />
There should be no question about this. Make it permanently available(passive, not innate) for 17 AA's(5 RB + 12 HRB) and Rabid Bear will be fine. The icon will still take a buff slot and it will still be dispellable. It won't work on a horse either, which is enough drawbacks for the benefits you get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Clerics should not be able to outbash us. Period.  What clerical race has an innate STR higher than 2 of the Shamanic races?  B*tch (here after SoE/VI will be referred to in that manner) please.  <br />
<br />
Mana regen for us in bear form of any lvl would be nice.  I will never put pts into RB unless it is upgraded in some manner.  I have seen too many of my friends burn the points then say, &quot;I should have gone Innate Poison Resist&quot; or something to that effect.  Hell, couple it with a massive self regen that doesnt allow us to stack our Regrow/Replenish.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a phased AA sytem of upgrading Illusion Bear.  I also like the idea of a summoned weapon to put us on par with a cleric.  We are considered freaking hybrids By Brell's Brass Bangers!  Hell, if they are going to keep it a toy though, least upgrade the Illusion to PoS bears and let us attack on hind legs, screaming fury, spitting froth and bearing (PUN INTENDED) our privates to any class brave enough to get in range of our DoTs.<br />
<br />
A 65 lvl cleric with &quot;The Hammer&quot; melee DPS prolly like a 50 lvl Monk/Ranger.  (Disregard mob level.  I am talking numbers, ie 60DPS or whatever it is if someone parsed it.)  Shaman, well, we melee nowhere close to our unbuffed pet unless we do VoB or whatever.  Then, our pet if it was hasted and buffed would munch us.  I am not asking for a mage caliber pet (or a multitude of pet variations, black dire wolf,dire wolf, ghost wolf or timberwolf, though it would be nice to see diff color pets doing diff stuff) I just want to be able to melee without playing my twink rogue.  I laugh everytime I am trying to melee a greenie and cant even hit them for more than 6hps with my epic.  B*tch, give us a bone here (free Bones of Bert woot!) and let us melee better than clerics and chanters.<br />
<br />
And another thing while I am ranting, By the Tribunal's Frozen Kilts, when we summon a freaking WOLF pet, LET IT RUN AT SOW SPEED ALL THE FRIKKIN TIME.  Why I have to waste mana on that is beyond me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">bump .<br />
gotta make the thread bigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">K, I bought rabid bear today. As I have decided that I have like 10 more aa that I want and will be prepared to get left. It is nice, especially breaking up those exp grinds. Dathor great Hammer I was getting hits of 312. As well as the odd double, but averaged at around 148 hits.  But slow hammer(.  <br />
<br />
It is nice to have, and  my main criticism now is the reuse time. Every 24 mins or so would be perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">So since you have that horridly mixed up, let me explain in small words what my proprosed changes do.  I'll keep it simple in the hope that you might understand it finally.<br />
<br />
No no my dear sebazy, i am fully comprehensive, infact if you had read my post i put in pet damage cause it brings the TRUE scope of our melee output to a PoP mob. <br />
<br />
Its the weighing of rooting and rotting with BoS vs full melee capability ATM, if your not  putting up your pet when you straight up melee, well you need to rethink things.<br />
<br />
Please dont confuse my inability to see what you mean with your inability to comprehend my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
It adds additional effects that are useful, even if you are not meleeing. Remember, for every shaman that loves to melee, theres another that plain doesnt want to, rabid bear should be useful for them too, this makes it so it is<br />
<br />
Rabid bear was designed to be a straight up melee upgrade, your redesigning a ability which while is nice to think about, isnt going to happen.<br />
<br />
Also, you have parsed a pretty weak BoT mob only, try some variety to demonstrate how rabid bear fluctuates massively.  Go on, parse a ssra snake if you actually care, you'll be suprised what the results are like.<br />
<br />
Sigh, lets just end it here then before it gets heated. You told me to parse a BoT PoP mobs cause RB would have 0dps, i have proved otherwise. A stormrider isnt exactly a weak mob, what do you wanna do, solo named?<br />
<br />
Anyway, i do respect your ideas, i just dont find them realistic, they are very nice and it sure would be nice to have. Let me know when SoE lets you know they are implementing them <br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
A pet has NOTHING to do with Rabid bear and there are plenty of times when a pet is used when you are not meleeing.  Keep it about rabid bears dps and don't scew the results with additional fluff, afterall, if your frame of mind was correct, why not add in BoS/BoU/Anc Scourge's dps on top of that?  Even if I meleed like a monk I'd never forget about my dots, but oh nos rabid bear can do 100+ dps~.  Yeah exactly, it doesnt work like this.  Keep it straight and don't taint results.<br />
<br />

<br />
For the last time, you really don't seem to grasp that my proposed RB isnt actually that spectacularly different to the existing one in usuage, Changes to spells are not beyond SoE at all, did you say the same thing about Torpor mk1 (If you was even around then)?  What about Str/talis of the diaku or group shrink/haste?  SoE have done a lot more tuning and tweaking to the game than you seem to realise.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day though, Hastened rabidity being tuned to enable RB to be innate would still be a nice change though and a huge improvement over what it currently is, if thats the best we can hope for then its still a massive leap in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">That simple . Improve Rabid bear(cause it's suck too much actually).Give it a reuse time of 1 minutes.(no duration altough for RB ,just the reuse,we chose when stop) and impossible to cast during RB.<br />
        So we can't stack poison dot+rb,that solve the dps problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">That simply won't work, the Fury line originally totally prevented casting too if I remember correctly (I think it was either a massive mana drain or maybe a self silence?), that didn't work either and had to be changed to be useful =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I know what would make Rabid Bear more desirable! :)<br />
<br />
One free self-quiescence :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...or yea, what everyone else said.</div></div><hr />
