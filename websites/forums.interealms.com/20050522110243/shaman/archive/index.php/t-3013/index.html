Poor wizards are gonna be crying bloody hell if this goes from test to all the servers..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think the story is true (test server's been down since the 28th) but if it is, how is Verant supposed to protect previous expansion encounters from the mudflation of the most recent?</div></div><hr />

Kinda stupid nerf.  I can come up with better idea (make Pvper immune to MB, make Boss Mob immune to the second MB for a couple of minutes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If Manaburn was a super rare spell I would be rather upset if they nerfed it like this but its an AA-skill that anyone can get. So I think its about time they did something about it. Just look at our AA-skills and tell me which one is even close to MB in effect? Pet Hold?, Rabid Bear?, Alchemy Mastery? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it is a hard one and i feel every sympathy for wizards but i cant see that allowing a small group of wizs with a skill that isnt exactly that hard to get be allowed to farm the kunark mobs. You see guilds prepping and then 5 wizs port in and nuke it to bits in seconds. It just triviliases the encounters.<br />
<br />
As usual though I think Verant has jumped in with both size 14 boots, maybe having a limit to the number of MB's that a mob will take as someone above mentioned or just make dragons immune to MB (players being immune to MB as well)</div></div><hr />

As for the nerf, i'm not sure what the point is.  If it's to stop the 4 man Gorenaire killings, there's got to be a better way to do it.</div></div><hr />

You could still use it to burn adds in various dungeons and unable to burn most targets that are not supposed to, like dragons, VS or many epic NPCs.<br />
<br />
All that talk about how it hurts the casual gamer more is a stupid excuse. A guild that can field 4 Wizards against a kunark dragon should be able to get a cleric or 2 and a warrior and/or paladin to nuke him down. <br />
If you are talking of &quot;Wizard mercenaries&quot; who burn for money then yes, that is somewhat a nerf to a small guild. Then again, this is most likely the reason for the nerf to begin with. This is more profitable than any trade skill for a Wizard and for sure not intended that way.<br />
Always wondered why Vox and Nagafen are still untouchable for 53+ players when mana burn was a legit progression in power.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cann V is nice but all it really does is make me regen mana faster - it wont enable 5 shamans to kill a dragon. I can cast more DoTs (that are highly resisted most places you go at 60) and I can heal a bit more and buff more (yay!). While this is all fine its not a huge jump in what I can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I believe the reason why so many people got suckered is that most people think manaburn is too good to last and does need to be nerfed in some way.  Can you imagine the frustration of buffing up your guild to take out gore, maybe get you Torpor or Malo with a bit of luck, only for a team of 6 wizards to run in and nuke her down in 4 seconds flat to then turn round and offer to sell you the copy of Torpor that just dropped for 50k?  Mebbe they do give away bard scales, but is it always to the bard that was in the guild getting ready to take Gore down, or that was waiting for enough people to log on to head to DL for the fight?<br />
<br />
I think they do need to do something, I dont want it nerfed out of usefullness and am not sure what they should do, but it does seem a bit excessive at the moment.  Apart from anything, with EQ getting so old now there are a lot of high level guilds and competition is so fierce now for the dragons and stuff from up and coming guilds that it seems unfair to allow those mobs to be taken out of the game by a single group, denying what is a great experience to so many (I still remember my first Gore kill :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can V is nice, very nice, but as far as AAs go, shamans (and many other classes) get nothing which compares to the overall damage output that the implimentation of critical damage has given wizards, not to even mention the various AAs of the melee classes. Wizards are a rather well balanced class as it is. With or without this ability. Frankly, I wouldn't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I feel almost sorry for the 6-7 wizards who farm regulary Kunark Dragons and VS to sell epic pieces and depriving guilds who are in the learning stages for these dragons or guilds that could take them down to actually get epics for their members.<br />
<br />
I almost feel sorry. Keyword here is &quot;almost&quot;.<br />
<br />
Manaburn is a great skill to burn away &quot;ENRAGE&quot; when an encounter isn't going your way, it's a good skill to stop a gater when melee seem to fail, but when 4-5 people take down a mob that is at least a 4 group encounter is WRONG. Dead WRONG, especially when the reward is very sought after.<br />
<br />
How many high level players still use Cloak of the Flames? Or Runed Bolster Blelt? Or Bard epic? Or warrior epic? Or the nice shields those dragons drop? How about the Damage III cloak? A lot. And still a lot of them would ... if the (insert server here) Manaburn crew wouldn't be greedy and farm them, then later sell them.<br />
<br />
All it takes is one hour investment per week to fix RoS faction. Walk up to dragon. Have a tea with it. Burn it down, loot, sell. Rinse and repeat. Too easy, the &quot;nerf&quot; is good.<br />
<br />
I just hope it's not a hoax and it gets on regular servers.<br />

A casual gamer guild with 1 Manaburn wizard trivalizes most kunark mobs for them. Let me add to this a casual guild within reason of having 3 groups 50+ with sufficent force 3 clerics 2 good tanks ect that are just up to that step, they get the mob to about 3/4 of its health and usually wipe out due to the enrages and there lack of good equipment they can't keep going because clerics run oom or other stuff, there 1 wizard with manaburn casts manaburn and hits a mb of 8k, mob is down guild succeds in taking down servilious, completely hypothetical situation but it is within reason that a guild with 1 manaburn wizard can do far more in kunark then they can without it.</div></div><hr />

If the wizard has 7000 mana, manaburn is a 7000 damage unresistable nuke.<br />
<br />
This isn't normally a problem, except with critical spell hits, it can do double this damage, and now 3 to 5 manaburn wizards can insta-kill any 32k mob in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">7000 mana?  Is that even possible?  Also, it's a better ratio than 1:1, although I'm not sure what the real number is.  As for a single group of Kunark dragon killers, who cares?  I guarantee that the same feat could be recreated with a group of non-wizards.  It just happens that wizards stack well.  The two-group Sont kill was pretty nifty too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The mana/damage ratio isn't 1:1 actually. <br />
Afaik it's 1/1.5 to 2.5(random component). A wizard with 5 k mana can hope for a burn of 25 k damage(crit). The average(3,5 k mana) non- crit manaburn will do around 7k damage.<br />
<br />
One of the Graffe moderators recently stated that the max manaburn would be doing 27.5 k damage. I think it's safe to assume the ratio is 1/2.5 max since 6.875 k mana is beyond the possible atm.</div></div><hr />

...wizards 'norrath's paranoid society'.<br />
Everyone knows mb is overpowered and will eventually get nerfed because it needs to be.  Even though the article was a joke/fake you can see by the reaction of the wizard community that they know its too powerful and needs toned down.  Just none of them want to come out and say it and be labeled the bastard nerf child of casters.  <br />
<br />
CT server had the first true MB wizard team and graffe's freaked out over the post with the screen shots.  Everyone knows it is being done, even VI.  Does the wizard community seriously think VI is so naive to let this slip by??  When they are done nerfing the bst pet (bst's charming low lvl npc's, level buffing them, then killing for exp) they'll get to MB, don't expect it for awhile but know its coming.</div></div><hr />

- MB is overpowered on 32k HP choke point mobs that are needed for epics and/or that still drop very useful items for high level people. MB is hardly overpowered on mobs having 100k + HP.<br />
<br />
Who cares of a wizard can manaburn to death a random froglok in Sebilis? But when wizards abuse their skills to charge 150k plat to burn down a dragon, that's wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">First of all, I am sure we all know that it is a false rumor at this time. <br />
<br />
That said, I think that Manaburn in its current form is horrid. It should never have been implemented the way that it is now. Every wizard I know that has manaburn says that the only really good use for it is against mobs like kunark dragons and such and that it doesn't have a lot of use in the high end game. Well, I think that what they should be doing to manaburn is making it more valuable of an aa skill for the high end game. It should definitely not be useable on mobs with 32k or less hp though, thats for sure. A group of wizards should not be able to take down mobs that are end game encounters for many people, with NO risk whatsoever. Thats where the problem lies. There is no risk whatsoever to the people doing it. It takes less than an hour to get max ally faction with kunark dragons, they walk up to it, coordinate timing for casting manaburn, then dragons dies almost instantaneously. No risk involved. Thats just not right. And again, the ones I know say that it is only good for use like that because the way it works it isnt that good for high end encounters. So my question would be, why aren't they upset that it isn't more useful for high end encounters? Why aren't they asking that it be altered to be better for that&gt;? I think it is because they are perfecly happy farming all the items that they are with this wonderful little skill. Wizards are already very powerful in luclin endgame content as it is, so they get that, then whack out some kunark dragons to sell gear, and away they go. In my opinion, manaburn would be better off as follows, or something close to it...<br />
<br />
1. Limited to mobs of 32k hp or higher<br />
<br />
2. Manaburn could be used as long as there was 50 or 75% mana left in the wizards mana pool.<br />
<br />
3. Manaburn would still be unresistable.<br />
<br />
4. Manaburn would be guaranteed to critical every time it is used.<br />
<br />
5. The damage done by manaburn would be no less than 20k damage, and no more than 27k damage. <br />
<br />
7. Maybe something added so that a mob would know it was being cast upon so that the no risk kills just because you have faction would not be no risk any longer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Something like that I think could make it more useful to the high end game, where most of the wizards that have manaburn are at anyhow. Anyone remember back at the beginning of kunark when they made it so that Vox and Naggy would banish you if you were over level 53 or whatever it was? They did that because of the way that the levels trivialized those encounters. And this is even worse, because even with vox and naggy, there would be SOME risk involved because the mob is guaranteed to be kos to you and you couldn't do instantaneous damage equal or greater than its total hp. With the way that manaburn is used currently, the only risk is that maybe someone would go linkdead heh.  I am not upset about it because of what it means to me since I am not killing or needing anything from kunark dragons myself. I am upset because I find it troubling that people that already for the most part are equipped in the best gear on their servers are slumming and farming what is endgame content for the vast majority of the eq community. Just because you have moved past the content doesn't mean that it is a non-issue. For the majority of the eq community, it would be like the way that many of us would feel if a group of wizards were able to spend an hour on faction, waltz up to Emperor Ssra, and kill him instantly with no risk involved. For those of us that are in the position to kill him or right on the verge of it, that would feel just like the 85% of the rest of your server feels when a group of them does it to their endgame content. <br />
<br />
I know that alot of wizards like to compare it to a single group of well equipped players taking on the kunark dragons, saying that if a single group could do it with melee, that there should be no problem with them doing it. The major difference is that that group still has risk, lots of it. We have all fought those dragons before. WIth 200+ resists, that doesnt guarantee you not to be ae'd or feared or stunned or whatever. There is still substansial risk involved there, but no risk involved in manaburning it. Give it a 30% chance of being resisted vs mobs with 32k or under hp though, and that would add in the risk to balance it out I think. However, I am betting that a 30% chance of resist would be a much worse thing to have altered than to have guaranteed crits for less required mana giving damage of a much improved ratio. <br />
<br />
My thoughts on the issue. <br />
<br />
and ps. Yes....I DO think it would be overpowering of shaman had an aa skill that gave them a unresistable 80% slow that landed on any mob no matter what, regardless of level, or number of aa points it took. I am interested in balance, not just balance as how it affects ME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rasaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">First of all... a 8k burn is 1/4 of a 32k mobs health... a 20-27 k is... yes... you get it... 1/4 of a 100k mobs health.  No point in that is there? they'd just farm other stuff and sell looting rights.  Manaburn is an annoying skill at best.  A raid I was on was short a few people to do it reliably so a wizard offers to manaburn it for us if he gets to roll on ANY loot that drops - regardless of class... we basically said screw him.  If Manaburn got nerfed i would be happy... the DoT thing sounded like a very good idea - but making it crit everytime would be pointless, because you can just up the modifier on the mana ratio, as well as would be 'always 20-27k dmg'<br />
<br />
There was a reason Dragonsbane and Giantsbane were made non usable on mobs below a certain amount of total health, so why wouldnt this work the same way?  and its MORE damage than those two spells.  Basically its a bunch of hipocrites working in the spells department ;).  If my monk was able to burn all his hp with some random modifier on a mob to do all his damage in turn with getting instant aggro and dying, hell... I would do it just to help guild raids out, but i dont have any skill like that.  Its the same thing with wizards - they burn 100% of their vital statistic (mana) in return for (on 32k mobs anyway, where tanks dont have time to egt aggro against 8k dmg) instant aggro and a big chunk of the mobs health gone.  On any mob where this would make a huge difference (traka, gore, talendor, sev, vs) the wizard would probably be instagibbed just as bad as my monk would.<br />
<br />

<br />
I must admit i have heard and read of these tactics before and i can't help but think whoever came up with it is retarded. If the fight is going to last say 15 minutes, why is anyone in their right mind thinking that starting off with a Manaburn just cause it has virtually no aggro is smart. Not like Wizards wouldn't have an unresistable aggro reducer and could manage their hate better than any other class.<br />
Even if you are going to eat rods and get FM in no time, the MB is better used near the end of the fight or do you see Rogues bust out their duellist at 50-60% ?<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to get a statement from some competent Wizard reading this board on what the advanatges of an early MB actually are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">lets say you're doing a 20 minute fight...you MB the mob at 95%, then start rodding up to fm. when the mob is at 80-85% you're fm again, and can start nuking. you can't start really blasting before 80% as far as i know anyway, so MB would be like free extra damage.<br />
<br />
at least that's how i understand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You could just use higher ratio nukes and use a concussion more between nukes than usually(25 mana) till you are oom and rod to FM, rinse and repeat. Would definitely net more damage i'd assume.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">or do you see Rogues bust out their duellist at 50-60% ? <br />
<br />
Yeps - doesnt really matter when that extra damage comes, its there and you get pretty much the same result from all your melees using discs at near full health as if them using it when the mob is near dead, in some fights, you even have the added bonus of discs having the chance to recycle if you use them in the start of the fight - if nothing else, they are ready for the next mob. :)<br />
<br />
As for manaburn, i dont really know if the extra 10k or whatever the wizard would do if he used regular nukes it worth it over the no agro shot MB gives - most wizards i know seems to apreciate using it at the start of a fight -  they should know more about than me i hope :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>1000xZero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I feel this is an important post. I play both a Wizard and a Shaman on Vallon Zek. While I do not have Manaburn I am looking forward to it greatly as well as Canni 5.<br />
<br />
I understand how MB can look overpowered but Wizards are supposed to be the greatest damage dealers period. Not Warriors, Not Rogues, and Not Monks. But this damage dealing comes at a big price. Lack of AC, lack of HP, and Long Casting times.<br />
<br />
As for PvP, if I do not get a HUGE first strike or a SNARE/Root(usually near impossible on VZ because of High Magic Resistances) I am DEAD very quickly. I am sorry but the melee's have a HUGE edge ATM and Manaburn is one balancing item for this. <br />
<br />
If the nerf bat should hit anyone it should be at Bards. Bards have many disruptive and un-balancing attributes. If you need to look just do a search on Fansy the Bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I fail to see how a lvl 5 bard training Sand Giants on to people over a year ago makes Bards *unbalancing*.<br />

<br />

Fansy is back!  You better watch it 1000xZero! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>1000xZero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It has to  do with being able to charm and fear PCs when for others it is not available. <br />
<br />
Also it is about have mana-less songs for DD. <br />
<br />
As for Fansy he is on SZ and was charming the NPC bards which made the PoD attack whoever attacked the NPC Bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">A class should not be nerfed just because it can cause people a lot of grief by using bugs on a NO RULES server. If bards got nerfed because of what Fansy did, that would be ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">try unloading 4000 mana in elnerick's to a mob at 95%. you'll die after 2 or you can use concussion too and waste your time casting it and using mana on it when you could be medding. thats why you manaburn at the beginning of the fight and chain nuke when its low. manaburn is extremely inefficient in terms of mana for dmg.</div></div><hr />
