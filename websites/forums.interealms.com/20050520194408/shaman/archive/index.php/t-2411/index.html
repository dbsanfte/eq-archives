<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read a post here on The Black Dire that you don't need to kill The Advisor.  Black Dire will spawn on his own if the Advisor is not killed.  The post said he was on a 4 hour time table &amp; stays spawned for 35 minutes.  This was great news to me as the Advisor has 4 other mobs in the room with him, and others in adjoining rooms.  I don't think I could kill him on my own &amp; gate out before the other 4 - 10 mobs kill me.  Soooo based on this info I spent 5 hours coming back every 30 minutes to MM Castle checking on Black Dire.  No wolf.  Come to find out as I asked on the auction channel that he DOES NOT spawn on his own.  I wish people wouldn't post info that they are not sure of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's easy to see why some people would think he might spawn on his own, the Advisor spawns in the Library which is no where near where the Black Dire spawns.  If a group kills the Advisor in the Library and the Black Dire suddenly spawned in front of a guy camping him, it would look like he just spawned.<br />
<br />
When all else fails, do your own research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well... There are guides out there, like http://everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Shaman_Spear_of_Fate.htm for example, that says Black Dire is a 4 hour timed spawn (OR can be triggered). Lots of young shaman like myself believed that. I've also read posts where people have &quot;duo-camped&quot; Dire to turn in pelts for faction (or something like that), leading me to believe that he can pop on his own. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, Belgar's epic guide does say Black Dire can only be triggered. <br />
<br />
After doing my own research at Dire's spawn point for 4 hours, I'm fairly confident that he's only a triggered spawn. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I soloed 46- 52 on those wolves in MM, the biggest pain in the arse was the black dire.  I usually camped the place late at night when no other group was around, and usually even 4 hours or so, the dire would just pop.  I killed him and tried the turn in a few times earlier, but since my faction wasn't up to speed I wasted the pelt.  I've gotta go back again soon to get it...it's gonna suck...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The BD on occasion will pop without the PH being killed for about 20 min.  If you kill the Advisor he will spawn for about an hour.<br />
<br />
I have seen it happen first hand.</div></div><hr />
