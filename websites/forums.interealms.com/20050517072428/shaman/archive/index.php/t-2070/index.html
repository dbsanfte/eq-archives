<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guys, I was wondering what resists are effective versus HTs.  I thought it was disease resistance, but I wanted to confirm.  I know HTs are very hard to resist, but even partial resists are nice.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Don't think you can resist HTs anymore. They used to be hard to resist, but it changed at some point i'd assume.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HTs are still resistable (magic check). There is a Class AA ability (Super Harm Touch) which make HTs nearly unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are talking pvp, HT is unresistable. In my two and a half years I have never heard of anyone even partially resisting a HT.<br />
<br />
On another note, I saw a 1320 HT crit yesterday in pvp. The receiving cleric didnt think it was much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sakshale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since they made the change to the resists on HT to make it better for SKs (If I recall properly they made it save more like a lifetap), I have never resisted even a single point of a HT with my monk. No matter what my MR, no matter what my DR, no matter what the mobs level.<br />
<br />
Prior to the resist change I would get partial resists (based on how my health bar moved from taking HTs pulling hate, the numbers were not displayed then).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hts were patched to resist like lifetaps (all or nothing and very hard to resist) so basically for mobs Hting you you will always take full, you Hting mobs they will take full unless 12+ above you or insanely MR/immune, and in PvP unless you are 12 levels above someone their harmtouch will hit you for i think its 68% (damage reduced when cast on players by other players to balance pvp)</div></div><hr />
