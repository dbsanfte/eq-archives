<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately Ive seen this guy up alot So I thought I would throw a jab at the main way to killing him for those who might just pass him and shrug.  Ok he is the last murkglider on the way to Wall of Slaughter, loc is about 1400, -800.  <br />
The named himself is up alot actually, as many people will either ignore him, or try him and wipe.  He spawns adds at around 50% and up to 5 or 6 spawn, they are Murkglider Pups. (Mostly Slowable, hit for 300's not entirely sure though, relatively low hit points.)  The Murkglider himself hits for 500's, mostly slowable, average hitpoints (16k~)? He will cast Numbing Touch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5992&amp;source=Live) .  Its a very annoying spell, but with around 250 Posion resist with Tribunal I resisted it 40-50% of the time he cast it.  <br />
<br />
Ok on to how to kill him, he is NOT soloable, unless you can manage to split adds off I seriously doubt any shaman could do it.  Any class that can snare and/or kite the guys around is good, but snarer is best.  A wizard works for AE snare, but ranger is good too as they can pitch in a heal or two and hit the Fecund Murkglider with arrows.  I could tank him with a virtue and self-buffs (6kish HP), but every once and a while he would take the advantage.  I was using quescience with tnarg's thrown in, and with BoSaryn, BoWunshi, and the rangers occasional damage it was easy (Pet died early on).  <br />
<br />
He drops minor, lesser, and muramite runes always, and usually an OK item.  Again if you can get the adds under control you will be fine, so if you ever need runes and happen to see him up grab and friend and enjoy, ive won 2 runes or so from these fights, hope those who need em will find this information useful.<br />
<br />
P.S. sorry is there is already info on this guy, I just figured posting this would give those rune-hunters like me insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's very soloable by shamans, either root-park all pups after he spawns them or root the fecund murkglider near a zoneline and zone when he spawns the pups.<br />
<br />
I've soloed it maybe 5-6 times and every time it has spawned a total of 5 pups. It has another spawn too, just under the last bridge to wos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, I really shouldve added I just have trouble as I have no AA's to help take damage, but yes he is splittable, I just always found it would be easier to just grab someone and kill it.  I myself dont find it as a breeze to solo the fecund one himself, let alone with his adds  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as a well equipped non guilded shaman I have soloed her , very tricky , but my trick was to hit spirit call at 60% then my 5 dogs keep pups busy for long enough for me to root park all adds , and concentrate on named . I did however use 5 stinging wort potions to help me out . AE slow is handy to have memmed aswell . Tricky but doable <br />
<br />
got lesser rune and fireguardian belt . and was happy as 2 time enabled players from a top end guild were loitering around waiting for me to die .. looted and gated out , came back and finished off the pups . ( dont like leaving a mess around for other folks )<br />
<br />
I have 4.4k hp unbuffed approx ( and i did have virtue and kei on at the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried this guys when i saw him up. i didn't relize he spawned adds...when they spawned they started eating my advanced SC dogs...they took a while to kill the dogs so i figured they were to sissy to bother with and i stayed on the main mob..was a bad idea as i was lucky to zone out alive.  next solo attempt will prolly be a win as this guy really isn't very tough as long as you control the adds (he seems to have pritty low HP really...)  GL on runes guys :)</div></div><hr />
