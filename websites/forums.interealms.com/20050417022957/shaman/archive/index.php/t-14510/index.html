<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't played EQ in about a year and a copy of it should be arriving in the mail tomorrow sometime.  I'll be playing my favorite race/class, Troll Shaman.<br />
<br />
The point of this is, how &quot;safe&quot; (haha) is Innothule these days for the wandering Troll?  I hate the fact that Grobb is gone, but I plan on perservering.  I still can't quite accept the fact that friggin' Frogloks are a race now, but I'll get over it.  Eventually.  My old newbie strategy was hang around the swamp till level nine, then go around and run errands for various folks for cash.  I made about 1k plat in two hours once just running backpacks and selling loot for folks in Cazic Thule, and they were always pretty liberal with the donations.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I ramble.<br />
<br />
Question still remains, how safe is the swamp for Trolls?  Are there high level FrogMobs these days roaming around now or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you should be okay if you stick near the upper Guk zone line. Any close to town and you risk being killed by the Guards. They do wander frequently but they dont go further than the PoK book and it is rare to see one there. Another reason is you want to be near a safe zone line because those burly kobolds are quite nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kurek da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are also a few Froglok Trainers (GM's sorta) located in the swamp for wandering frogs to train skills, get quests from, etc..should be labeled on the map if you got mapset from eqtoolbox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">running errands to CT ?<br />
i think in CT are 5 ppl...2 camping FT3 boots and 3 are 1 person PLing an alt or grabbing Tae blood.<br />
A good choice is selling goods in bazaar. i made some nice cash in buying Fuzzle Cutter (drink) in west FP and sell it on bazaar with like 5 gold profit on each bottle. People are lazy theese days and rather pay 5 more gold per drink then running to west FP. Also tradesupplies sell well. Spiderling silks, low quality pelts (get tailoring to 60 and combine both for leatherpadding), spider silks do decend cash. When i was exping in EK i kept all the spidersilks and after all of em were sold i had like 8k on my bank. Same goes for Bonechips. They sell pretty good and in large numbers, easy money to start with, not a fortune but enough to buy some gear.</div></div><hr />
