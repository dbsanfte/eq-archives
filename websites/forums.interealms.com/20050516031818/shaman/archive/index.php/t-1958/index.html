<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a view on my gear:<br />
<br />
<br />
Self Buffed: 903 AC, 190ish Wis (sheerly by accident), Maxed Pierce, 200ish str, 1400hp<br />
<br />
JBB + Epic<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, when soloing, I don't understand the WHY of using JBB in a pet/melee set up.  it's an 8second cast for 320ish damage and can be interrupted.  In 8 Seconds you have usually 3 rounds of melee putting out anywhere from 40-80 per hit.  I can get 6 hits in during said time span.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you use the JBB then if it's not gonig to put out a significant amount of damage compared to melee and holds a good chance of interruption as well (I've noticed clickies interupt a lot more)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any input as to th e why of this?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level and equipment are you using? I'm just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the JBB was interrupted every 3 seconds then noone would use it.<br />
<br />
the reason people DO use it is because its rarely ever interuppted.<br />
<br />
JBB can also be used to kill runners w/out having to run after them yourself, savin the danger of a add that otherwise wouldnt have gotten you(IE a kos mob that isnt social to what your gonna kill).<br />
<br />
<br />
And most people dont have maxed piercing and 200 str(save a few buffs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The JBB does 263 damage each 8 seconds, for a damage per second (dps) of 32.875.  Realistically, it's closer to 25 dps by the time you figure in lag, root breaks, the occasional stun, etc.  The JBB is rarely interrupted unless you end the cast at a different spot than you started it, or get the snot beat out of you while casting.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the epic DoT does less dps (around half of the JBB), but has the advantage of being able to be used on multiple mobs at a time, so if you're root-rotting three at a time, you actually will be doing more damage with the epic than with the JBB.<br />
<br />
Shaman melee generally doesn't get into the 25 dps range until very high in the game (with uber weapons combined with haste spells and haste items.)  Towards the end game, it is indeed possible to consistently melee for around this amount, if you have the right gear, AA, and buffs.  It gets tougher on Luclin mobs, though, which have a notoriously high Mitigations (AC).<br />
<br />
The JBB has the additional benefit, though, of freeing you from having to tank (and take damage.)<br />
<br />
Also in the end-game it's possible to consistently duplicate JBB type damage through regular spells (see this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=885) for details.)<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  The JBB is worth it for solo'ing unless you can consistently put out 25 dps through melee and make up for the resulting downtime you'll need for heals.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my experience, JBBing within melee combat is more effective than just strict melee.  I have tried it many times both ways.  I always killed things much faster if I JBB while in melee range than strictly melee.  You still will get a melee attack each time the JBB casts.  As for interruptions, that shouldnt be that much of a problem. Your channeling should be high enough that interruptions are kept to a minimum.  Use rage+dex and you should be interrupted even less.  Since we are not blessed with double attack or riposte, and our piercing skill is capped at 200 our straight melee dmg is pretty low.  Adding in the JBB to the mix makes us pretty effective in melee combat, against exp mobs, when using our pet.  I am sure someone has done some research and can come up with some numbers of our melee/pet dmg vs our melee/JBB/pet dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gear I'm using:<br />
<br />
Emerald DS Tunic (swap with Ikky BP depending on scenario/mana at the time)<br />
JB Gloves<br />
JB Arms<br />
JB Hat<br />
JB Boots (switch them out for resists or wis when I'm rooting/rotting)<br />
Rune Etched Wedding (the wis/int one from TOFS)<br />

Epic<br />
Sarny Shield<br />

Ivory Collar<br />
.... totemic legs.....<br />
Fear Belt<br />
<br />
<br />
Piercing is maxed because I solo a lot and with Haste on in group I can get one swing in between Canns and I bought the last 3 points because it WOULD NOT MOVE at 197<br />
<br />
Defense is maxed because I'm anal<br />
<br />
Strength is this high probably from my BP, Epic and being a troll.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya I know I need to do that Magelo thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the JBB, ok, I guess I haven't used it enough.  My epic was getting interrupted left and right so I assumed that was most clickies.  Though I see the runner arguement all day and twice on Sunday.  <br />
<br />
I'm still shifting to AC/HP with replacing my Tear ring with a 6/65 ring after I get my boots in Maidens (the 4to all stats, 12 ac ones) and probably doing the same with my forest loop if i can find a good AC/HP/Sta earring that doesn't cost me my first, second and 21st born.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Biggus, that makes a lot of sense on a factual basis.  My dream belt is a contention Belt (atm) and that makes a bit more sense from a DPS point of view.  Thanks again.<br />
<br />
<br />
(saves me from having to parse all that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's nothing anal about maxing your defence! Free AC is free AC :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A couple things not factored in are:<br />
1) add melee damage to your JBB, if you're JBBing in melee turn on auto attack to up DPS, you'll get a swing in between every JBB blast.<br />
2) root/back off.  Sometimes a mob gets lucky and starts to damage you beyond the norm.  with root, you back off letting cujo tank for a sec tossing in the bracer while you regen.  Essentialy you won't have to med back the heal you might otherwise need and you don't really lose much on damage.<br />
<br />
Lastly, although you hit for almost 90 max with the spear, your average hit will be MUCH lower.  No double attack and no listed haste item (in your listed gear) will mean there is no way you will outdamage your JBB mana free on a single mob.  This will be even more evident once you start to solo tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
BTW Luna, I'm impressed at the improvements you've made in your gear.  Grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have a horse you can JBB and med at the same time. If you melee you lose the meditation.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, you will be hardpressed to get 30 or so DPS until the very high end game. To compare, on my level 42 monk with Imbued Fighter's Staff (38 dam, 40 delay 2hb) 220 2hb skill, maxxed offense, 200+ str with shammy buffs, FBSS, alaccrity, double attack, flying kick and riposte was doing about 38 or so DPS on the average dark blue mob he was soloing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you can still med on a horse and it's not a bug I need to get me one.<br />
<br />
I use my JBB when soloing cause it's free.<br />
If I were going toe to toe I'd be taking damage, but if I sic Dogdog on something and JBB, after a slow, Dogdog usually survives and I don't take any damage, so I can heal with regrowth.  If Dogdog starts to die, then I can always step in and melee to take the heat off, but JBB is a fine way to kill things and still heal...even if it is a little slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>moops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I find that my pet tanks much better than me ( been soloing in chardok at 51 ). I like to pull with slow, send dog, plague &amp; canni &amp; jbb. With dog tanking I usually have to heal him 2 times per pull, this works out much better for me cause with me tanking, even slowed, I still get beat down pretty fast with 900 AC. With dog tanking I am free to canni &amp; JBB without any inturrupts. Jbb &gt; shammy melee at least for me  = )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You are always medding while on horseback, that was one of the two selling points of horses.  They are GREAT for Shamans with a JBB as you are medding while blasting.  I wouldnt suggest using the horse indoors but for outdoor soloing, its like having flowing though 20+.<br />
<br />
The horse can be pretty annoying until you get used to it.  For example, targetting something in front of you is difficult, you have to turn your view to one side and click on the left/right side of your screen.  Also, you are always considered sitting I believe so you cannot duck out of spells.  Oddly enough however you can cast spells while looking at your book...very funky.  Since you are always sitting you cannot just use the &quot;stand&quot; button to get out of your spellbook.  You actually have to click &quot;done&quot; every time.<br />
<br />
Ive been soloing for a few levels now and have my ac, self buffed at 57 (rage, guardian, deleriously nimble) up to 1063 and find it easier to just tank the mobs myself.  It makes the process simpler and more effecient.  I do however try to get puppy to tank as much as he can, but its pretty tough for him to keep aggro while Im chain blasting.<br />
<br />
As long as puppy's not at 100% health hes saving me damage Im not taking.<br />
<br />
As to the melee DPS possible by even the most well equipped shaman, I dont think it would come close to the JBB.  Add in also that using a JBB allows you to use a primary hand held item such as a Paw of Opolla, I doubt a Shaman's DPS would get much over 15, maybe 20.  I just remember missing a whole lot even with maxed offense and piercing.  Talk to any Paladin or SK, Im sure they would be the first to refute 30 DPS from a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I pull with slow and tank the mob,at 52 anyway. Probably get tougher as the mobs get higher but i see zero difficulty right now.I channel 9 out 10 JBB blasts through their pitiful melle (after slow) . <br />
<br />
With regrowth,ikky BP I end fights usually at full health,and 4 bubbs of mana. doggy is up with alacrity but he never tanks and i dont have to waste mana healing.<br />
<br />
Canni back the mana quickly and by the time i find the next mob im back to full health.<br />
<br />
JBB is god like,with slow you will rarely get interrupted,most shaman's melle will never get anywhere near 35 DPS .<br />
<br />
I have maxed piercing and I couldnt fight my way out of a wet paper bag.  JBB will rip that bag apart ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You don't always med on horseback (at least not for me). It gets cancelled out when you are meleeing or when you are running. Other than that it works always.<br />
<br />
I also turn the models off for horses so I can buff my run speed, duck to interupt spells and target just fine. <br />
<br />
Biggest thing though is that I cannot see myself doing that type of DPS with a weapon right now so it's not even a viable option for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once I got a JBB, I quit carrying a 1 handed weapon. Either used a paw/shield for those times I needed ac or switched to a 2hb if I wanted to melee. Didn't give away my dolly till I got my epic :P . <br />
<br />
As to the original question, I parsed my melee damage once in my low 50s, with a 2hb about the same ratio as our epic. It came out to about 10dps versus Seafuries. JBB can double that easily, even with interrupts (resists aren't usually a big deal since I always mal-x when soloing).  It seems to channel a lot easier than our epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont care much for roleplay in EQ, got over that a long time ago.  Even when I get my epic (/rude fear raids) I will switch back to my paw or a History of Di'Zok when not casting the epic.<br />
<br />
I havent meleed for a single point of damage in a very long time.<br />
<br />
Buuk, you get the standing med bonus from the horse with the model off?  Grr, when I turn the model off I dont get any of the bonuses or the drawbacks, its basically not there except for the spell icon.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can still cast SoW or Spirit of Scale on yourself when you have the horse models turned on.  It makes them gallop, pretty cool looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">JBB rapes melee. try it and you'll see :) it's insanely powerful particularly at the level you can use....you'll get xp so fast it's nuts. rarely interrupted. good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I will use it while toe-to-toe and melee between the blasts if I don't feel like moving my mana and health around lots.  It is more consistent damage than pure melee with a pet, but I rarely use the JBB with my pet since hitting 60.  I mainly use a JBB in pet/melee setup when:<br />
<br />
1.  I am lazy.<br />
2.  On solo break ins.<br />
3.  Confronting green trash.<br />
4.  Fighting mobs with endless mana that CH and don't interrupt easily.<br />
5.  I need a beer from the fridge.     <br />
<br />
My favorite thing now is to roll out big DoT's and Nukes while I cycle Cann/Torpor.  The mobs die a hell of alot faster and downtime is next to nothing once I find the balance.  Death by JBB can be horribly slow and rangers make fun of me for taking too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hail,<br />
<br />
Purchased my JBB at the beginning of 46 if memory serves.<br />
It COMPLETELY changed my game.<br />
<br />
Soloing used to be a dangerous adventure for me.  Doable, but the down-time and my own impatience with same left me leaving irritated and LFG.  I was much more comfortable as a group shaman.<br />
<br />
After the JBB (call it a crutch or a tool, your choice), I solo with confidence just about anywhere.  Without Epic or any Regen BP.<br />
If my guild or alliance channels aren't doing anything interesting or need my help, I can go and get exp on my own, suffering little to no down-time and almost no frustration.<br />
<br />
I'm capable of soloing now w/o it, but why would I?  I try mobs every so often without touching my JBB, just to see the difference it makes between not having it and using it.  Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
I don't use it as much on raids, but it is still an awesome tool, and helps out your group just as much as when soloing on runners, annoying green adds and such.  /gsay &quot;Save your mana, let my bracer finish him.&quot;  I need to make a hotkey for that I type it so often. ;)<br />
<br />
It was said so many times on the old forums, but I'll say it again.  If you can wear it (appropriate race &amp; level), you MUST have one.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels of E. Marr</div></div><hr />
