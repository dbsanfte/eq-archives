<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this is a crazy question, and i just havnt read this anywhere... but here goes... Why can neither Druids or Shamans score an Exceptional Heal on our CH % heals?  I have spoke to a few people in game and they have no clue...<br />
<br />
I mean when we do healing adept it effects our CH%, but healing gift does not crit heal our CH%<br />
<br />
is this working as intended?  only clerics can crit heal their CH?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, and I think we should be able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No you can't crit the % heals. Would be kinda nice i guess but the more healing aa's i get the more i use our fast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">with how ****ty our big heal is, we should be able to crit it. But yea, i just use focus and AA to beef up Tnargs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even if we could crit on it, it is still a useless spell, tnarg is the way to go. Get your AAs up! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nah, I duoed with a warrior once in Earth at the entrance, and I used Knargs on him to save mana in the long run.  I kept him healed just fine without chaining my quick heal.  Being able to crit it once in a while though would have been nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cattiebri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any % heal spell you wont crit on. To be honest I haven't kept Kragg's memmed in about 5 months. I use tnargs have all my healing AA's maxed and crit pretty often for 3400ish. Plenty for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used the shaman CH 1 time like I used agility 1 time. Then moved it to the back of my spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even if Kragg's critted, I still wouldn't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In the long term, and especially with max healing AA's done, tnarg is more effective than our CH. By far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think we misunderstood my question rofl.<br />
<br />
i asked WHY it doesnt crit?  is it in game flaw or working as intended?  I dont use the % heal either BUT i was just wondering why they crap on drood sham % heal like that...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With AA's and especially after you get a preservation of xegony or a mana preservation IV item, you're looking at 400 mana for kraggs and about 405 - 382 mana for Tnarg's with similar amounts healed, less than half the casting time, and a chance to crit on cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why? Because critted &quot;complete&quot; heals might infringe too much on clerics.<br />
<br />
Heaven forfend that you should be able to get by with less than a third of your raid being clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok sorry to hijack this thread so to speak but it still is on shammies healing.<br />
<br />
I was talking to a fellow guild shaman about training for Healing Gift and was told not to expect many crits even with Advance Healing Gift.<br />
<br />
How often does Tnargs crit once you have HG3 and AHG? Once I have completed LR5 i was considering doing HG but after talking to my guildmate, have second thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cattiebri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not getting crits on Kraggs is working as its supposed to. Cleric CH heals for a flat 7500 without AA skills, Kraggs is um, hell I can't remember off the top of my head or 75%. It doesn't have a set number or HP's it heals for. Hense why clerics can get crits on CH's and shaman and druids can not.<br />
<br />
Harena - I have both Gift and Adept maxed including advanced. I crit alot sometimes and there's times I go forever without one. Personally to me its worth every AA to max it out, you can't beat thoughs ***** crit needed now, bam crit for 3400+* times and it saves the tanks life when ass healing.<br />
<br />
I have Healing Gift 3 Advance Healing Gift 3 Healing Adept 3 and Advance Healing Adept 3. I have the Vallon neck which is Mana Preservation 4, Elemental Arms with Marr's Gift. On average I can cast Tnargs and heal for 1800 per cast. Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">not parsed, but i'd say i crit approx 1 heal on 5 with AHG maxed.<br />
<br />
I think it is worth it.... when you have done more important AA's of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kragg's is up to 1950 health for 400 mana, cast time 10 sec<br />
<br />
Tnarg's starts at 1300 health for 450 mana, cast time 3.8 sec<br />
<br />
I just can't afford to use Tnarg's as it stands.  650 less health for 50 more mana and no Cann V for me yet.<br />
<br />
I keep both memmed if I'm the prime healer for my group.  I keep Kragg's memmed when soloing or when duoing with my wife (warrior).  And I keep Tnarg's memmed when I'm a backup healer, for the speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use Tnargs for my healing needs, but I often find myself wishing it were better than 1300hp.  I recently got the ornate chain arms as a drop, and suddenly it *is* better.  Random, but still an improvement.  So I started giving serious thought to getting the healing adept AA skills (and in fact purchased the first level of healing adept).<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1.  With ornate sleeves (imrpoved healing iv) and advanced healing gift 3, what will the min/max heals be using Tnargs (without a crit)?<br />
<br />
2.  Would it be wiser to get healing gift first, and hope for the crits to make up the difference, or go straight for healing adept aa?  I have healing gift 2 already (heh - when you have every other useful aa, suddenly you start spending points on whatever catches your eye).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i use kraggs all the time its all about timeing and imo i think its alot more mana efficent then spaming tnargs in some situations  i use it in time alot too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is certainly not more mana efficient if you have the AAs.<br />
<br />
And while you cast 1 kragg, you can cast 2 tnarg. On spam heal raid situations, i think the choice is fast.<br />
<br />
Kragg 1900 healing 10 seconds 400 mana<br />
tnarg between 1700 and 1900 healing (not counting crits) 3.8 seconds, generally less due to focus effects, 450 mana, generally less due to focus effects.<br />
<br />
I cant even believe some people think it is a hard choice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's a hard choice if you're grouping with a warrior all the time and don't have the AA's or focus yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nothing is better than quiescence for xp heals, especially once you've done the AAs.  I duo with my sk and cast maybe 1 Tnarg's in an hour of killing when a slow gets resisted or something (all the rest of the time, I just heal with Q).  Kragg's is just pointless once you have Q.  I haven't memed it in ages.<br />
<br />
If you're raiding or something and need fast heals, tnarg's is the most useful.  I honestly can't think of any reason I would use kragg's any more (although I did use it when I duod or was main healer before getting Q, since couldn't torpor the MA).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heres the answer to the question:<br />
<br />
Warriors are the weapons masters and can crit with weapons.<br />
Rangers are the bow masters and can crit with bows.<br />
Clerics are masters of healing and can crit CH.(albiet not innately) (i think)<br />
<br />
A class that has a focus strength in one particular area gets perks, to make them stand out from everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Rogues crit with thrown weapons<br />
Warriors can crit with bows<br />
Wizards can  crit with damage spells<br />
<br />
<br />
All melee can crit with weapons when you spend AAs<br />
All Damage spell casters can crit with Damage spells with the right AAs<br />
Same should be for healing too I think<br />
<br />
What they SHOULD do, is allow the %Heal to Crit only up to 75% of the players hitpoints.  That way we still get the benefit of the crits on the heal, but it doesn't make it an actual complete heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Why do they not crit? Blame 5,000 screaming clerics for that. When shamans/druids got the % heals, a lot of clerics freaked out claiming that clerics would now be useless and no one would want them in a group/raid because shamans/druids could heal as good as them. They were quite wrong, but that didn't stop their tears. <br />
<br />
Now, hardly any shamans even use this heal that supposedly makes clerics obsolete. As others have mentioned, even if we could crit Kragg's Mending, I'd still use Tnarg's instead. 10 second cast for 1950hp heal is just horrible. I have all healing AA's and Marr's Gift focus. My Tnarg's can do over 1800 without crit, and over 3400 with crit. It's only what, 50 more mana than Kragg's and about 6 seconds faster cast (plus mana pres and spell haste focuses work on Tnarg's, but not on Kragg's).</div></div><hr />
