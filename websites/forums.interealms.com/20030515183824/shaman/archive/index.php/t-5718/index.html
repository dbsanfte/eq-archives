<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are ice burrowers in WW soloable at all?<br />
<br />
Also anyone tried doing the WW dragons that shaman said they could solo after the recent resist changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ice burrowers do not summon, hit for 400ish I believe, and flurry.  Would be a nice fight if you pulled it off, but I don't know if it is possible.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what dragons you are talking about, but the lesser AEing dragons (i.e. the ones near yeldema) are fairly unscary.  I am going to try them soon, b/c yeldema is really easy.</div></div><hr />

IMHO they have far too many HPs. I would run OOM for sure. And the gain wouldn't be enough to kite him around for 30 mins (including roots to canni for more mana).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i belive a mage can solo these .. jut gotta pet kite .. takes a while ..<br />
<br />
dont see why a shm couldnt do the same <br />
<br />
not a steady stream of exp .. but a personal change .. something for S&amp;Gs .. they give 3-4% exp of aa now solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done them. They are possible to kill, but not worth the effort for the EXP given. As mentioned, they don't summon, just a fairly basic kite. Druids can solo them also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I attempted one once... I had to zone because I got an add.  They are a tough fight.  Not sure if would have pulled it off or not.  They have a lot of HPs.<br />
<br />
I tend to be suicidal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They also proc a 500point dd and are pretty hard to slow (landed malo and couldnt land slow or malosini after 5 tries)<br />
<br />
They should give probably a blue aa though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, never tried them after patch where they changed resist code, but I did beforehand.  Pulled with malo, kited around, tried 20 slows, no effect, all resists :(<br />
<br />
They do move pretty slow tho, that's one plus, and that's one of the few 55+ mobs I'd say druids can solo more effectively than us (legit of course, none of that WW charm assist BS :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
a druid friend told me he take 40's minute to finish Stronghorn off with lots of charm animal;<br />
<br />
if we use dogdog kite then it maybe take 2+ hours to finish it off lol<br />
<br />
he is level 60+ mob, I remember I got 2% from ToV drake in group, so maybe it will give 8%(2 blue) when solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ceno what are S &amp; G's ?<br />
<br />
 and anyone who's done them did you root dot? how hard to root are they? tanked? pet involved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">S &amp; G's = ****s and Grins :)<br />
<br />
Never tried these.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Necro friend of mine solos these regularly looking for a tunic for his monk.  Takes him appx 15 mins....never has much trouble at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Right Hand (PoM) was red to me.  Gave me exactly 6% AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">did you solo it? or have someone not grouped assisting? sounds like getting AA points at 65 will be a tad too easy.</div></div><hr />
