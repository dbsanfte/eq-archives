<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like they didnt waist anytime changing our Proc Panther Maw SK  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6780&amp;source=Test) / Leopard Maw SK  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6778&amp;source=Test)  .  Chances are, the new proc will probably have BIG impact on proc rates for people and pets.  I guess they just could not stand seeing Shaman acutally happy (usefull).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, mind spelling that out for those of us who don't know what we're looking at, such as myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, mind spelling that out for those of us who don't know what we're looking at, such as myself.<br />
<br />
02-26 01:00 Changed Base2_5 from 0 to 400 <br />
02-26 01:00 Changed Base2_4 from 400 to 0 <br />
02-26 01:00 Added Slot 5: Add Proc: Panther Maw SK <br />
02-26 01:00 Removed Slot 4: Add Proc: Panther Maw <br />
<br />
<br />
Changed spell Base and name, Meaning &quot;Panther Maw SK&quot; is under a totally new definition.  In more simple terms, this is a different proc then &quot;Panther Maw&quot;.  And since there is no known bugs with the spell, nor are the other DoN spells being changed, logically they do not like the way &quot;Panther Maw&quot; works.  You figure out the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before the test changes:<br />
Pestilence Shock<br />
<br />
base2  	0<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Panther<br />
<br />
base2  	400<br />
<br />
<br />
So perhaps base 2 is the proc rate of a spell? Lucy gets confused by stuff sometimes, like for instance, check out <br />
<br />
Terror of Discord<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5329&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
The actual hate of course isn't 1, it's 1800 as listed in the Unknown154 section.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, I'm not exactly sure what they're doing with this, we'll just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
Edit: the beastlord pet procs have a base2 of 75, Rabid Bear has a base2 of 43, and Night's Dark Terror has a base2 of 1965. Most proc buffs such as Shroud of Discord or Pious Fury have this value at 0. There's just too much variance across the board on these types of spells to have any sort of conclusion yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sayoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, those procs that you linked on test server are for Shadowknights that can't proc the normal Leopard/Panther Maw. If you look at the Bard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6666) song (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6734) you'll notic that there are two procs (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=storm+blade+strike). The one with 'SK' in the name is the one that Shadowknights proc. They're the exact same thing except for the name.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in order to change the proc rate, they'd have to change the Spirit of the Panther/Leopard spells, not the Maw procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as an SK, let me explain the issue with SKs and procs:<br />
<br />
SKs get their own table of procs.  This started way back when necros had a lifetap proc that scaled with level.  An SK with the same level of scaling would have been imbalanced, so they made the SK proc not scale by adding a 2nd proc and putting SKs on a different lookup table for procs.  So, every proc buff that an SK can use will have 2 procs in the spell.dat file - one for Sks, one for everyone else :)<br />
<br />
The maw buffs didn't have a 2nd proc in the spell.dat.  This must be why when I cast leopard on my SK he never actually procs.  <br />
<br />
I sure hope they don't change the proc rate on these though.  Its a nice DPS increase for us that the melee and pet owners love :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, every proc buff has the actual proc (usually called &quot;[Buffname] Strike&quot;. There is a normal one and a SK one. The reason SKs have different procs is because back in the day, necros and SKs got Vampiric embrace. Necros get it at 8, SKs get it at 22. However, Sony wanted it to scale differently between the two classes but not make a different spell or something, so the necro version scales to a 70ish point tap at 50, while with the exact same spell. SKs proccing Vampiric Embrace only tap for 35ish at 50. or something like that.<br />
<br />
Since then, Each proc has had a normal version and an SK version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah, the spell isn't changed at all as far as I can tell.  Only for the SKs so that they can now proc it.  Also, in doing that I think that they made it so that it will now stack with the beastlords proc snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That will be nice, a 70 sk friend of mine was kinda disappointed that he couldn't proc it.  He had a hotkey all set up to annoy me.  I guess I'll be getting that tell alot when the patch comes through for it. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you let that hotkey work on you, Den, you'd better not whine about being annoyed.  It's up to you to shut that down from the beginning.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what you mean by shutting that down from the begining...<br />
<br />
If I understand you correctly, you /ignore the player or tell them to stop bothering you, OR you just do your job and keep the buff going without having to be asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He really just means that if you let them continuously bug you with a hotkey telling you to recast it everytime that it starts to fade, then they will keep doing it.  If you state at the beginning that you will cast it when you have the time/mana, then it shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Personally, from everything that I've seen so far, I will tend to keep it up on any pets I have before any normal melees, and then go from there casting it on whoever I can and when I can.  I'm not going to run myself oom (yes, it happens) trying to keep it up on 5 melees, especially if you sit there and bug me for it every time that it starts to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL.  The hotkey was meant as a joke.  My &quot;friend&quot; thinks teasing and annoying me is fun.  If he was serious about the hotkey, I would refuse to group with him. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
F*** no.<br />

That's the funny thing about EQ... it's a game, not a job.<br />
<br />
I'll keep the buff on whoever I please. It pleases me to keep it on as many folks as possible because I get enjoyment out of making spam at 400 dmg a pop. It further pleases me to have something to sit there and cast constantly so I don't get bored.<br />
<br />
However, the first person that starts bugging me about a spell that lasts for so little time having already faded, isn't getting it again :)</div></div><hr />

So its a buff now and not a nuke ? ;)  Its something we have to maintain? ;)<br />
<br />
Earlier you said this:<br />
Panther still isn't a buff, it's a damage spell<br />
<br />
Now I'm totally confused... :)<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I've told my guild I will not accept tells for panther, but that as a melee you should expect to see it anytime.  So keep a buff slot free.<br />
<br />
I've found the single best use for leopard is raid targets where I don't have much else to do (little curing, weak or no ae).  In Qvic last night I pretty much burned all my mana randomly tossing leopard on melee during Cyno.  That was some serious dps.  5-6 monks, 3-4 wars, 2 rogues, etc..   <br />
<br />
Groups are a little more random.  I tend to average keeping leopard on my pet, + 2 melee.  If my mana rises, I'll either A) cast on myself and have some fun, or B) cast on the cleric / druid if they're bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">... I then promptly kept it up on the Cleric to piss them off, because I'm mean like that.<br />
...... reading comprehension is your friend<br />
I read just fine.  You cast it on those who don't care, to piss off theones that do.<br />
<br />
I understand time/mana constraints, but being a total ass is a differenet story, especially to guildies/raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Why is it, that the damage output on this spell is only being compaired to DoTs/DD (not other buffs)?<br />
<br />
2) Why is this being totally substitiuted for our DoTs  ?<br />
<br />
3) How is it, that we can acutally parse this spell (knowing its exact dmg output) ?<br />
<br />
<br />
- None of this can be said/done with standard buff spells.<br />
<br />
I personally think that the jump was so big, from us not being able to contribute much dps (no matter how much mana we have) to adding a limitless amount of damage (all depending on how much mana we have), that some of us just do not know how to handle (pace) it correctly yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I tend to agree. I got the spell on saturday and really do like it but I don't consider it a buff. It's far too short a duration to try and keep it up on anyone constantly. Just far too much a hastle and ends up being fairly mana intensive over time. Instead it's taken the place of dots or nukes in my line up for doing dmg. In an exp group I'll usually try to cast it on a couple tanks when do a big mob or when we've got multiple mobs around. Seems to get the most of it that way. On raid I don't typically cast it on yard trash at all. When a big named comes in I'll find several people and cast it on numerous people.</div></div><hr />

1) Because there aren't many buffs out there that do what this does.  What else can you compare it to other than DoT/DD since it gives a DD proc.<br />
<br />
2) Totally substituting for our DoTs? Says who? I still use my DoTs when using these spells.<br />
<br />
3) You can parse any buff that deals damage. Damage Shields for example.<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Lepoard/Panther aren't unique, they are just specific to the Shaman.<br />

You could argue that the proc is comparable to a DoT, which is certainly true, but you first need to &quot;buff&quot; somebody in order to make him benefit from the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Beorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Im going to have to agree on one thing, on a raid, if we were to keep this up on all melee, this spell will be a pain in the ass to keep up, just like avatar used to be with its short duration.  Besides being mana intensive, for the duration that it lasts, it leaves little time for completing other duties on raids.  I'm not saying not to use it, just use it smart.  Currently I will cast it selectively as time permits.  In groups is another story, Usually keep it running on all melee in group.<br />
<br />
As far as requesting no tells on this during raid, ya, at least until most if not all shaman on raid have it, you would have a single leopard pimp full time, that is usually unfeasable unless you have 10 shaman in guild.  But I would definately still use this on dps for sure as time permitted.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents, take it or leave it.<br />

I basically have all monks, rogues, warriors.  Each has a hotkey (/tar PlayerX).  I just work down the list.  If my group needs a heal, I heal them and stop the panther chain.  Likewise for a cure.   Likewise when canniV pops or pained pops.  But other than that, I'm continually casting leopard.  <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
so there's your technical answer = It wasnt a technical question that I asked.  I was just pointing out that this spell should be treated as a damage spell not a buff.  <br />
<br />
but you first need to &quot;buff&quot; somebody in order to make him benefit from the proc = Well, doesnt the same thing go for our DoTs/DD.  Dont you need to cast the spell on somebody/something to benefit from the spell ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, it just seems like too many people do not seem to be useing the spell as it should be used, then complaining that its too much for them.  <br />
For instance, you would not use a DoT on a mob that only lives for 20 seconds or so right ?  Well, same thing goes for this spell.  If your raiding and mobs come only once in a while, and live for only about 20 seconds,  why would you even think about spamming people with this spell ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">you'd nuke it though, right?<br />
<br />
same point, making a mob that goes down in 20 seconds, go down in 10...or even 5.<br />
<br />
you can't gauge it on any scale besides DPS. its completely unlike any spell &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;we&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; have gotten so far.<br />
<br />
if you have to gauge....go by bard song, or other buffs that provide procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No? When was the last time you had to buff a player for your DoTs to be able to work?<br />
<br />
To make it simple, it goes like this: *IF* you buff a player and *IF* he procs you do damage. For DoTs the *IF*'s are one: *IF* I &quot;buff&quot;(or we could say DoT) a mob, you are doing damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am just replying to those saying this is not a buff, but a DoT/DD/whatever. <br />
The people saying this is a buff ain't stupid, they perfectly know what you guys are trying to say, but technically it's a buff and for many(not me!) it all boils down to this &quot;a DoT ain't gonna pester you to refresh it, nor is it telling you it's your job to keep casting it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to add that I haven't expressed my opinion on Leopard/Panther since it's gone live, but from what I read, I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Leopard gets the thumbs up from me. It's nice having a buff that increases dps alot, instead of ones that only give minor boosts. (At least that's how it feels to me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Actually, I can't nuke trash mobs in the time it takes my guild to kill them.  I generally stick to debuffs and heals.<br />
<br />
You can't guage this against other proc buffs, because it doesn't work the same way.  Other proc buffs tack on a pretty inconsistent 5-15dps over half an hour to an hour.  In other words, those act like proper buffs.  These spells do active-level dps on par with nukes and dots, in exchange for active involvement, just like nukes and dots.  Buffs are long term power boosts for a character, raising/enhancing their innate abilities.  You can run, but with SoW you run faster.  You have some hp, but with a buff on you have more.  You swing your sword, but with Avatar you swing it better.  The Maw line is different from that.  It's big-time damage, and it's not the character carrying it that does the damage, it's the shaman.  It's like you set a rat on fire and let it go.  You didn't give the rat a shot of caffiene and testosterone to make him stand up and kick some ass, you put YOUR destructive power on his back and sent him in.  It may look to the enemy like the rat blew up, and so he's awfully mad at that rat.  But it was YOUR firepower that did the burning.</div></div><hr />

I'm more than willing to treat it like an annoying, but nice dps nuke.  Thing is, is anyone else willing to treat it like that?  History says not only No, but HELL NO.  The problem will be the same as with avatar, contant tells for melee crack.  You might be counting it as your dps, but most assuredly, the melee involved count it as theirs.<br />
For raids, I've always had a page of macros set totally to /tar &lt;someone&gt; or /assist &lt;someone else&gt;.  The leopard chain will simply be one more row.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">All I got to say is sometimes it's good to be in charge. As an officer if someone asks for champ, Panther what ever and i'm otherwise occupied I just say no. Never goes beyond that. Sure on a big named fight I cast it like mad at the start, especially on pets, but anyone who thinks this is a buff that is going to be kept up on them at all times can kiss my ***. Even with 80% spell extension this spell just don't last long enough for that.<br />
<br />
I will say I love the spell. Been soloing some of the tasks lately and this spell adds alot of dps pretty efficiently. On one today I counted (didn't parse so not 100% sure) 30 procs on the one mob from my pet. That was an unsually good one and the mob died noticably fast but it's still 15k dmg from the spell.</div></div><hr />

Try duo'ing with a necro or mage.  Been burning through tasks that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Did some of the solo tasks tonight in stillmoon.  Removed bane from my solo spell lineup, but leopard in its place.  Pulled with slow, hit pet, hit myself.  Mob is dead long before buff wore off.  Thats about half the normal time per mob for me.  Used in that way, its pretty easy on the mana as well.  Would normally cast at least a pair of banes in there for about the same mana cost.<br />
Still, this is going to be a Huge pita in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Interesting - I don't find many soloable mobs that petsy can tank. Was the aggro on you or on petsy? (I don't find a ton of experience giving, soloable mobs that *I* can tank!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">The problem I see for soloing with this spell is it breaks root and since it procs a lot it breaks root a lot.  So in a place like lavaspinners I end up with adds.  And to top it off the pathing sucks.  But yea I have to do the tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">well, I personally have no problem telling someone &quot;no&quot; about this spell line.<br />
<br />
if a monk asks for it before a pull (I've seen it on every raid since I've gotten it so far) I'll tell him no. there is no point on wasting a 1.5 min buff on a 3 min split and pull. once the mob is engaged, as in, the MT has its attention, I'll toss it on him. but until then, no. MT is typically the first to get the spell if it will stick, then I toss it on random other melees.<br />
<br />
in groups, I typically toss it on whatever is meleeing in the group as the mobs are engaged. this gets a little mana exhaustive, but I'm able to keep pace, I just have to canni a bit more. <br />
<br />
the DPS is worth it, I killed Wong Li in about 10 seconds last night. expecting to be a little longer fight (red con mob), we engaged the mob, I tossed on a couple of melees and myself, I clicked epic, I swapped to my staff, one swing, 1225 damage (2 procs and a max crit hit) and the mob went down.<br />
<br />
here's to not having any melee DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The primary difference between this and avatar is leopard doesnt car which melee you put it on.  If a pally or sk asked for avatar during a raid, i'd tell him no just on principle.  But you dont say no to rogues or monks or rangers.  W/ leopard you just cast it on whichever melee are on the mob since the proc rate should be the same.  If i get the spell by tomorrow night, I will test it out on TZ in Time.  Thats a pure burn fight.  W/ leopard on most of the melees, I'd wager that he'd be dead in under 90 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I've been asked for the spell quite a bit, and have explained to people: &quot;This is very short duration and 'when mana permits.'  So don't ask.  I know you are a melee.  I will cast this buff on you, along the way.  But I will not maintain this buff on you.&quot;  It's new information for most people, and they accept the explanation without any trouble.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, a string of procs can easily shift aggro when people are not paying attention to that.  I've killed two or three people now by casting this on them: they say &quot;Woo hoo!&quot; as they proc 8 or 10 times, then they click the rezz box ... :)</div></div><hr />
