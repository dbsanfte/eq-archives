<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to find some good exp place for my brother and I to hunt in. Recently we've been doing:<br />
<br />
Umbral ent when we can get a group together. Bout 1 blue per hour for a full group and nice loot. Not always easy to get the group together though. <br />
<br />
Scarlet desert platue. Little more then a blue an hour dou. But heavly camped. <br />
<br />
SolB occasionally, but usally camped as well.<br />
<br />
Loot is pretty much secondary, I mostly want to get nice exp and have minimal travel time from bazaar. I'm getting sick of spending an hour traveling to someplace like chardok/seb to find a full group sitting exit and ent when they could move in further easily. I do like outdoors because of horse, but willing to do almost anything to get to 60. Torp and Malo buring a hole in my bank :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't want to do velks or KC. <br />
<br />
Both of us are well equiped and we will also occasionally have a chanter with us. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions will be great. <br />

Thank you friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check out the thread in this forum on the Darkpaw cave in Jaggedpine Forest. It's right next to the Surefall Glade Druid portal (you can invis if necessary until you get your faction up). The cave is usually deserted, or has someone pulling to the entrance, and could support 30+ people. It's all an outdoor zone, and there are merchants and a banker. Just keep moving; it wasn't built for you to sit in one spot and pull. You shouldn't really need an Enchanter but it wouldn't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Maybe Akheva near zone-in if you are careful.<br />
<br />
ME toiler hill should be good too if not over camped.<br />
<br />
Burning Woods Giant Fort is a bit of a haul (wait on DL spires, run to BW), but the two of you should be able to shred the whole camp if it is empty.  The exp should be okay there but not great, &amp; you'll have to move on after your next ding.  If it is heavily camped, just fighting mobs near the crater might be good.  Chardok entrance (which you mentioned) and Skyfire are close alternate locations for grindage.<br />
<br />
The outdoor Kunark zones won't be lightning fast exp, but the mobs are plentiful at least.  And they typically aren't populated the way KC/Velk's would be.  I HATE those two zones, and avoid them except for epic/shawl quest requirements.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replys. Checked the thread on jagged pines. Probably will poke around there a bit this week. We had checked it out before but didn't get into the caves really so mostly saw light blues. Sounds like it'll be great though.<br />
<br />
Toiler hill is pretty much perma camped by quad kiters on our server. Pain to find anything to pull but good exp when available. Haven't tried akheva, will have to look into that as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
