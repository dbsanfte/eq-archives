<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draxiss Darkmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night before the patch, I took a group of friends from a smaller guild to Acrylia to do the high priest quest which used to yeild the BoA cleric scroll.  To my supprise the area had been changed and the high priest was not in the room as it is now a new place for the zone in to inner acrylia.<br />
<br />
So my question is...<br />
<br />
Does the High Priest still spawn and if so where.<br />
<br />
Is there any other mobs in luclin that are rougly 2 groupable and uncontested like the High priest was...  Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
I know buying the spell is the easy way to go, but atm there is no spell scrolls forsale for the last 3 weeks : (<br />
