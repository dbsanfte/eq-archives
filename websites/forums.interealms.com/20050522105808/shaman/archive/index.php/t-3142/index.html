<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how widespread has this become, and how does it work exactly?  most of the bards on my server use bugs with charm as their main source of xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think you're referring to Western Wastes.  You first need a bard on cov faction, and then he finds either a rhino or mammoth to charm.  Once done, he aggroes something like an ice burrower, runs both the charmed pet and burrower to a dragon (or cragwyrm for that matter).  The dragon will assist your charmed pet and then aggro the burrower.  The dragon will not ks exp or loot either as the burrower is 55+.<br />
<br />
Another trick is to charm a rhino/mammoth, pull Tantor/Stronghorn, and run both around ToV entrance where Tantor will own practically any dragon except Sontalak.  If you're sure the dragon is gunna die, cast a harmful spell on him near death, and you'll get exp and loot too.  <br />
<br />
Another I thing I recently discovered was that Melalafen drops standard Naggy loot.  He's a dragon in Western Wastes, but he's not on cov/ring of scale faction.  He's one of the very few mobs that's on Disciples of Kerafyrm faction.  What the bard can do in this case is charm the same type of mob, pull Melalafen, and run both to Sontalak because the bard obviously wants Naggy loot.  <br />
<br />
For ae-type dragons assisting your pet, there is one slight problem though.  Dragons will assist a charmed pet but their ae will hit it as well.  This in turn will cause the pet to get pissed at the AE dragon and he will very likely aggro him.  If thed AE-dragon happens to survive the fight and prevail over Tantor/Stronghorn/Melalafen, then that ae-dragon will aggro you = near-certain death because they'll chain summon you.  Such is the case with Sontalak so if you ever plan on bringing Melalafen to Sontalak, be prepared to accept death, and have one of your group partners loot Mela.  <br />
<br />
I've experimented around with this a little, one of my best eq friends is a virtuoso, but this is an exploit, so I'd tred very carefully.  Anyways, not like I'm gunna get fried anymore, I'm max kos to CoV and thus Western Wastes is out of the question for me except for the occasional totally legit soloing of Yeldema.  Not like I need her though, already got my monk his talisman XD XD XD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have had low/mid-level guilds on my server do Sont ver 2.0 with 24 using this &quot;tactic&quot; (My guild has had a tough time with 50 in the past...wiped a few times too).  <br />
<br />
I have petitioned this before, the guide that answered my petition didn't understand the issue and claimed it a &quot;Class Ability&quot; of the Bard.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is talking about Dawnshroud peaks I bet :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First off you need to be a Humen wood elf or Val shir (No half elfs cant do it) Find The camp of Humens dwarfs gnomes That are inside the camps in dawnshroud. Then Find yourself a Random NCP Green con useuly works best, Go to the Camp with the humens and dwarfs con one It should be amibly (level 61) Now find what you want to die. aim for the other camp folk who are on a diffrent faction. Bring the red con dude to the first camp and charm the green con mob and pet attack the level 61 you just arroed. The Ones in the camp will assist your pet and kill the Red con mob your pet attacked and you will get experance for killing a level 61 Mob Druids Enchanters and bards step right up and lets exploit this into Nerfage!<br />
<br />
(This post is made with the fullesit Intent of geting this nerfed I want to make sure as meny folks know about it as I can so that Varent will take action and shut this down.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not so sure this is an exploit, since charmed mobs become pets and pets can be used to help you fight other mobs. <br />
<br />
However, if in your mind you think it is an exploit, then what the hell are you doing explaining how to do it? <br />
<br />
This isnt a Diablo forum. People keep answering these stupid questions and the other posts about 'how do I skip parts of the epic', and then the village idiots tell their other idiot friends that the Crucible guys know - go ask them. Just tell them to go read the EULA and ignore the question.<br />
<br />
Say what you want about Verant and their lack of customer service (yes, I agree on that), but at least they care about the integrity of their game and ban these idiots when they catch them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, tested it out in dawnshroud, and found a set of mobs I can 'charmburn' as its called on my server with a Gnome Enchanter of Bertox lol,  the camp doesnt work as a CT worshiping lizard shaman tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not just bards, but druids and chanters as well. One druid I know had farmed benevolence peices for a bit now by bringing his pet and the Kromzek Captain to Sonty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The more we openly discuss exploits (whether they be charm exploits or unintended epic shortcuts) the faster VI will get off its arse and fix said exploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thats my main reason for posting about it..  even if our server GM says it isnt an exploit (before rotating gms)  heh<br />
<br />
<br />
its bad enough people getting xp on it (let alone naggy loot), but its just damn irritating when people use it in PVP!  pvp on EQ is already jacked up enough lol<br />
<br />
<br />
oh well..  at least it'll be a good way to get my druid to lvl 46 so he can forage me some branches of planar oak, enemy teams seem to think they can stop us from getting blessed fishing poles unless we get em from legends :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is really similar to the time I watched a bard aggro Woushi to the giants,then got the killing blow. GM's said it was an exploit then, so whats the difference? Still, I hate bards anyhow, eversince the day Nyce charmed just about every mob in TT on my group and wiped us out when we were oom. /rude Nyce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The difference is catching someone in WW (a rather unpopulated zone on a regular basis) as opposed to a high traffic zone like WL where there are people on a regular basis.. kinda like the pots in Guk (ya I know how old that one is) or the roofs in CT.. unless random.GM was wandering through and checking, no one saw no one said.  <br />
<br />
I agree it's an exploit but life goes on.  Mind you, they fixed the hunting knife from Ferrott SO fast y our head would spin, but that was a simple non-coding fix and they've screwed bards up SO many times that I'd be fearful of fiddling with their code as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wandering Lands is a populated zone on your server?  On E'ci its virtually empty except for a tradeskiller here and there getting components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh, our server lead GM directly observed people doing it and declared it was perfectly legal :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My understanding is that this bug only works to get loot/exp on mobs over level 55.  I don't think that it would therefore be a reliable source of experience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't forget, Shaman's have charm animal too!<br />
<br />
Now we just need to find some low level animals that have friends that want to assist.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you don't have to charm to do this.  Just park your pet next to the dragon and pull tantor or what ever else to pet and the dragon will assist the pet.<br />
<br />
Only works if you're good faction with the dragons of coarse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So more or less any pet class can exploit this bug? i imagine it would be extra double potent if the exploiter has dire charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I haven't used it.  I have another warlock friend that has tho.  His favorite target is tantor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Honestly I'd try it just to see it work.  Worth a death that's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">bard on our server soloed gorenaire a couple nights ago, got a warning too, lol<br />
<br />
<br />
hopefully they are finally going to fix this BS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">However, if in your mind you think it is an exploit, then what the hell are you doing explaining how to do it? <br />
<br />
Why the hell not?  Their problem if they got caught, not mine.  I've done it myself before, but I shot my cov faction way down farming ss for oiled greaves.  So not only am I not gunna get fried anymore, but I don't really care if you rip that tactic off :D</div></div><hr />
