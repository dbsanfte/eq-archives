<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Feel free to add.<br />
<br />
1. Snakes that kick.<br />
<br />
2. The ability to speak, read and understand perfectly, some 14 languages making you the interpreter from hell.  Oh, and you're a Troll Warrior with an Intelligence of 45.<br />
<br />
3.  Every single merchant in every town is a retired adventurer who can lay some SERIOUS smack down on you.  Your ability to solo Lodizal, Trak, Yeldema et al, means JACK and SQUAT to the green-conning seller of crappy bags and even crappier weapons.<br />
<br />
4.  The ability to ruin faction on a continent or in a zone you've never been to or seen.  Is there some sort of insta-Norrath-wide communication device that alerts ALL Frogs?<br />
<br />
I feel like the guy in  Army of Darkness <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wait a minute, I've never even SEEN these a55holes before today!&quot;<br />
<br />
5.  Monk Specific. (And thankfully they sorta fixed this). It always amazed me when you would succesfully feign off a MOB, he would wander away, out of sight, be back at his house with fellow MOBs drinking coffee, watching The Norrathian News Network and KNOW the INSTANT you got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the? Oh that's it, grab EVERYBODY, we're gonna kill that Monk THIS time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course then they would fall for it AGAIN.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I thought you hit him!&quot;<br />
<br />
6.  The whole religion thing.  I can see the guards at the Freeport gate now with some sort of checklist:<br />
<br />
Guard: &quot;Human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fellow Guard: &quot;Check.&quot;<br />
<br />
Other Guard: &quot;Ok good so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guard: &quot;Class?&quot;<br />
<br />
PC: &quot;Cleric.&quot;<br />
<br />
Other Guard: &quot;Great, damn orcs been giving us what for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guard: &quot;Diety?&quot;<br />
<br />
PC: &quot;Umm Mithaniel Marr.&quot;<br />
<br />
ALL Guards: &quot;LIAR! WORSHIPPER OF INORUUKK ! DIE ! DIE ! DIE !&quot;<br />
<br />
(Now running PC): 'W.T.F Is there an eye above me or something?' Looks around.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk laughing his butt off.<br />
<br />
7. Spell fizzles.  You can be level 65 with 400 AA's and STILL fizzle twice in a row on a level 35 spell.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />

Instead of turning and taking the step toward you, which of course would be too easy, it decides to run the opposite direction into the room it currently resides in, pickup its friends, go across the street into the next house and invite his neighbors, and has time to pick up some grocieries on the way.<br />
<br />
Summoning - Nevermind that the mob you are facing lives in the sewers, eats its own feces, and has a brain the size of a pea, it still has the willpower to summon you from accross the room and proceed to pummel you into the ground. <br />
<br />
Slow Aggro - Even though the tank has stuck his sword over and over into its mullet, the ranger has made it into a pin cushion, the rogue has filleted its back and made it wonder if it should press charges or buy him or her flowers, nooooo lets ignore all this, and attack the shaman who has made it yawn!!??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here are a few things that I have always wondered...<br />
<br />
Why haven't the iksar rebuilt thier city yet?<br />
Why couldn't the devs just make a new frog city instead of boot out the Trolls?<br />
Is the construction in FV on strike?<br />
Why is it that Vah Shir eat more food?  Do cats really eat that much?<br />
Why is the Troll Beastlord warder so small?<br />
Wht is it that most always creatures stand in the same spot.. don't they get hungry or have to use the washroom?<br />
Why is the Vah Shir warder so big?<br />
Don't the merchants ever go home?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">why they stuck the totemic helm bit in a place where a nasty level 50 mob lived?<br />
how a level blue mob that you could probably win, flatten you in 4 sec onds?<br />
how an npc wizard has more hp than a warrior pc and can hit harder? and quad and cast while moving and out of sight and......<br />
<br />
and why in eq2 out of all the races they could have choosen , they choose rats?  prehaps they feel an affinity to them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why do mobs get to cast sow indoors (I've seen it before)?<br />
<br />
Why do bards get to play 4 different songs on different instruments, or maybe singing, while running, and can freakin' open their backpacks and sort through their supples while they're doing it all. Yet I can't open my packs while I'm casting, and I can't move more than 3 inches without disrupting my train of thought and forgetting where I was in my spell casting, cause I'm just that stupid. Blah...I forgot I was casting a spell when I shifted my weight. I didn't realize this until I was finished casting, so I'll have to try again guys... *Fizzle* Dangit. *Fizzle* Grrrrr!<br />
<br />
Much bard envy.. =)<br />
<br />
Why don't the guktans paint &quot;Gukta&quot; over Grobb on the stone in PoK? I keep thinking they're actually gonna get a different place for the guktans and give back grobb to the trolls...but then I reconsider and decide they're just lazy. =P<br />
<br />
Why can't I rarily actually get back on my horse when I'm drunk? I think I should be able to get on, walk a few feet then fall off again. Hehehe...<br />
<br />
Why do we have to use froglok blood instead of froglok meat to make guktan illusion potions? All the other illusion potions use parts/meats...<br />
<br />
Why do green mobs attack you when you sit down next to them with a RED conning pet? Hmm.. /sit *wack* *wood bark bark grrr* *bite* *bite* ...my brethern will avenge my death!<br />
Well that's great, I'll remember to sit down next to all of your brothers and sisters so they can try to defeat me too. =)<br />

Why do some shissar carry around bane shissar weapons?<br />
<br />
(Not sure if they fixed this one yet) We still can't fish on boats, can we?<br />

Milk comes from mamory glands from all mammary gland, which if you take any look around EQ, you will see a plethera of them.<br />

 QUOTE]<br />
<br />
it isnt meant to be that it cumbersome but that iron ( what most armors meant to be made of) its meant to interfer with spell casting, and you could where other stuff but spell casting was affect, though there is also the fact that general casters where weaker and didnt have the str to where some armor:). normally hybrids are from priestly types who as they borrow.beg from other powers which iron didnt affect. <br />
<br />
though i not entirely sure about sk, they where just evil pallies. whether they orignal where necro/war or just evil cleric/war not sure. eq doesnt really have a difference between evil cleric and good cleric at the moment though eq2 does, but whether that a real difference i not sure most differences ine eq2 between cgood and evil are mainly cosmetic.<br />
<br />
you could also get 2 class comination but a caster war if the war had iron stuff on didnt cast very well. so it wasnt a very partical thing to do.</div></div><hr />

Did my Barbarian self some how suddenly fool this person into believing I'm now a Human Cleric and if so is this really the person they want as their Guild Master?<br />
<br />
How come when I cast Flash of Light on a gnoll he not only still knows exactly which direction to swing in order to pop me but he is also able to hit me for more damage, stun  me, and interupt my spell, and then run away and bring back friends all before the spell runs out?   All this without the benefit of a cane or a seeing eye dog, not even a gnoll pup to steer him along his merry way.<br />
<br />
Why can a fleeing gnoll phase through a door to evade me yet any other time they actually stop to open it? <br />
<br />
Why won't the gnoll pups let me scratch behind their ears or rub their little tummies?  They are pups for crying out loud and all puppies will let you do that without complaining about me ruining their lands or trespassing.<br />

Yes, and as a Shaman I have been unable to yet find the &quot;snare&quot; spell in my line up so the mobs do run each and every time, especially the green ones.  Once they hit 50% off they go and if they've managed to stun me (happens way too many times) then they mosey right down the hall and come back with Guardsmen, Elites, and the like.<br />
