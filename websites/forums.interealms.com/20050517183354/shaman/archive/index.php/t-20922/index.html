<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This thread is not for the critical balancing and important type of issues like stat caps and burst heals, just for the little things that would make playing your shaman more convenient on a day to day level and would not be controversial or difficult.<br />
<br />
Number one on my personal list would be a long lasting pet haste. Like say 90 minutes of 35% haste pet-only.  It wouldn't hurt anything and would add a lot to the pleasantness factor of playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to hear what other suggestions you all might have along a similar line on removing little shaman annoyances.</div></div><hr />

Dammit, I want an upgade.  I've had this spell for 56 damn levels and it was druids that got the upgrade.  And not only that, but the DRUID HYBRID got an upgrade.  I got a group version that adds a bit of ATK.  whooptie frikken doo.  I could care less for the lev thing because I find it annoying and I can cast lev anyway.  But I would really like a 65%-75% speed increase sow.<br />
<br />
-Usefull pet buff<br />
We got one at level 50.  But at level 50 it was worthless.  +30 STR and 20% haste for 6 minutes?  so I have to devote a spell slot to a crappy spell if I want  to use it.  Well, at level 50 shaman can buff STR for more than 30, haste for more than 20% and increase AC for more than 19 AND it lasts longer than 6 minutes.  Maybe something along the lines of 60 STR, 40 AC, 50% haste, +mod to hit cause that shaggy bastard swings and misses more than my 5 year old nephews T-ball team.</div></div><hr />

What about adding time-level mods to Focus of Soul/7th?  Shielding/Avoidance and take away stat buffs.<br />
<br />
Add +strikethrough and +combat effects to avatar.<br />
<br />
Make FA/avatar group buffable and duration of 30 minutes (keep reagent cost for avatar, with four emeralds per group cast).</div></div><hr />

I think thats a great idea, i been thinking the exact ame thing for a long long time now. Frankly its the only way i can see us making our way to &quot;king of the melee buffs&quot; again or just making them worth casting for more then the HP added. But you know whats going to happen, they will raise the stat cap and say its all better and shaman rock again. They really dont understand our problems and thats our biggest issue ATM. Some how we need to make them see that stuff like you mentioned above is whats truly viable.<br />
<br />
Think about it, it would solve SO many problems. It would give us a unique buffing niche, it would give out melee a usefull addition and much desired addition to their abilities. What more does any shaman on this forum want then to just be needed/wanted again. Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wishful thinking.<br />
They aren't willing to let us have an endurance regen, do you think any of the suggestions will be even considered?<br />
They said that Group Avatar was out of the question.<br />
<br />
Here is my suggestion. Next Fan Faire tell them they will be physically assaulted if they attempt to feed us the same crap as this one.<br />
I am actually surprised we didn't turn into a mob and lynched them during this Fan Faire, they should consider themselves lucky.</div></div><hr />

well the most crying out ones are the stop clicky, so canni 5.5? ina zone we can get easy, group fa, and a group quin, these dont even have to be mgb, as our group shrink isnt so if soe played that one then they just lazy.<br />
<br />
a pet buff that does 544 hp, 200 to all stats(fo7,fa basically), 60% haste, innate dual wield,and adds that venom claw proc be nice:) (last 1hr 20)  (wish list would be to make it do the new spirit call pet damage)<br />
<br />
making fo7 add all stats str dex stam and agil, slots getting abit full now and gen not needed.<br />
<br />
thats a few:)</div></div><hr />

You don't do something to be rewarded, you do something to avoid the pain, and anyone who has tried to Sony's customer service can attest to that.<br />
You don't grind levels for fun, you grind levels so you may never do that again. <br />
You don't get flagged(POP, GoD) for fun, you get flagged so you may never do that again.<br />
You don't get your keys for fun (VT, VP, ST) you get your keys and you nver want to see those camps again.<br />
You don't camp items, tradeskill components, ANYTHING for fun<br />

Devs answer posts that are whining and only change things that are protested the most, so they don't have to hear the same bitching again.<br />
<br />
It only makes sence that a good way to get them to listen more is for them to avoid an ass-kicking once the get subjected to one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Circuits, please don't make suggestions of physical violence again on these forums, even in jest. This is your only warning.</div></div><hr />

I will alter and not discuss certain &quot;unpleasant&quot; avenues of thinking in an attempt to avoid punishment.<br />
<br />
Your way, not mine.<br />
<br />
You could have asked without warnings, however you opted to answer in a threat.<br />
You have authority on there boards and I am a guest, I would certainly not choose to overstep my boundaries and disrespect the board moderators and administrators, so a simple request would be sufficient.<br />
I do not think you have any previous experiences of disobedience from me so I don't see why you had to ensue your intentions in case I &quot;misbehave&quot; again.<br />
<br />
Maybe you think that way is more effective?<br />

Perhaps you are right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow, Circuits. I'm having a hard time understanding why you're still playing EQ. Perhaps your EQ is different than mine, because quite frankly, I *do* do things for fun. This is ... a game. It's not work, you can set goals and pursue them as casually as you wish or as hardcore as you wish. Some folks grind levels, I grind time with my friends. I get flagged for fun, honestly ... it's a thrill to get to see new zones and try new raid encounters. I can't say as though I ever enjoyed camping things, but bring a friend or two along, and somehow it becomes more bearable. Like I said, perhaps your EQ is different than mine, but if you're really not having all that much fun, end your billing.<br />
<br />
Devs answer posts that are whining primarily because those whiners are so far off-base with what they're whining about that if the devs *didn't* answer, a ton of misinformation would be floating about. At least, that's my take on it. They certainly don't have to answer any of our posts. I appreciated Brenlo's responses on the EQ Live boards about shaman pets. Didn't like them, particularly, but I appreciate the effort.<br />
<br />
At any rate, so far as modest improvements to our class go ... what Haagen and Bara Cudar wrote is right on, though I think a puppy buff like what Bara Cudar spoke of is not quite what the original poster was lookin' for ... &quot;modest,&quot; Bara, &quot;modest.&quot; :)<br />

<br />
Disagree, in fact a huge part of physical comedy is based on violence/accidents/physical harm<br />
<br />
Charlie Chaplin comes to mind as a glorious shining example<br />
<br />
Chris Farley/Adam Sandler/John Belushi/Jim Carey <br />
All have done slapstick and physical types of comedy and they all involved physical harm of themselves or others.<br />
In fact &quot;slapstick&quot; as a compound word suggests violence and it is synonymous with comedy.<br />
<br />
To quote one of the comedic Geniouses of our time:<br />
<br />
&quot;Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die.&quot;<br />
--MEL BROOKS<br />
<br />
<br />
Forum rules are forum rules, and you have to follow or you get canned by the people with the golden mouse cursors, but don't bring some moral command &quot;Thou shall not&quot; type of ideology on violence. Certainly Human nature and History suggest otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer to my kind of EQ. I still play, yes. I am trying to define goals for myself, but personal schedule is a problem at my case since my playing hours lie outside of normal raiding times. I have fun with friends, no matter what we do. I come off as cynical and pessimistic more than I should to many, but that is the way I see things. Fun or not is irrelevant, EQ is based on negative reinforcement. I asked the other day a question to a high-end Shaman about GoD and I replied to his answer that it's a PITA to do things this way and his responce was &quot;This is EQ man, when has anything here, not been a PITA?&quot; I think I concur with his feelings.<br />
<br />
I am sorry I have gotten off-topic in this thread, however talking about upgrades of any sort while we can't even shrink a pet, or when Our Endurance AA was revoked without refund thus far(please don't tell me that they put Endurance intead of health by mistake), well that makes a talk about upgrades of any sort only wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will not add another post, I do not want to spam further than I already have, I do however want to answer to Glorianna's following reply:<br />
I did not made known the intentions of my post, I did not say it was or was supposed to be taken as amusing, and I didn't say it wasn't to say what I had in mind is an assumption since I never mentioned anything.<br />
I did not claim to be a comedian or was I ever under the impression I was supposed to define or defend some definition of slapstick. What it may or may not include is up for interpretation and a whole different topic all together, I used physical comedy as a general term too, I thought slapstick reffered to physical comedy. Jackie Chan refers to his style as slapstick and he doesn't go around picking flowers and baking cakes.<br />
I made a point and argued for it's validity. I used examples that I thought were relevant and were supporting my argumentation, that may be in the post in question or later on the laughing matter of violence.<br />
May I point out that you are getting defensive? Last time it was a threat this time it is an insult, I don't think I deserve it to tell you the truth, If anything I think my posts are coherent, you can agree or disagree, I haven't resorted to personal attacks, and you are borderline hostile from the beggining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You, sir, are no Charlie Chaplin.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how threatening to physically assault someone (over a game no less!) can be considered slapstick.<br />
<br />
My request was clear and polite, this is not the place to threaten real life violence against another person. You received the one warning I allow for such statements. I did want you to know the next threat of real world physical violence would get you immediately banned.<br />
<br />
Since you considered your post &quot;amusing&quot; I think my warning of future misbehavior was appropriate or you might have been surprised to be banned for such a comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Back to modest suggestions.<br />
<br />
Make Talisman of Alacrity 60% (we can haste 60% with SLTW anyway so this isn't a big deal IMO).<br />
<br />
Increase the duration of FA to 10 minutes (base not extended, so SCRM would make it 15 minutes).<br />
<br />
The last one I have may or may not be modest. You be the judge.<br />
<br />
Lower the cast time of both Malo and turgurs significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Snare is not a modest request. <br />
<br />
Why is that not a modest request? Almost every other caster beside pallys get some type of snare...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Because snare is easily one of the best and most powerful spells in the game.  People regularly have invited druids and rangers into groups SOLELY because they have snare.  It's just that powerful.<br />
<br />
Me?  I would LOVE snare.  You bet!  I'd do any AA necessary to get it, too, you can believe it.  But...I would ask for it about the same time I ask for complete heal or FD or tracking or the like.<br />
<br />
I like having great abilities.  That's why I (used to) like SLOW so much.  But you gotta leave some for the other guy.  It's bad enough that they were so painfully lacking in creativity and insight that they whored out so many of our abilities to other classes -- it wouldn't help to continue and validate the tradition by making other classes have their glories whored out too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sure, give us snare. Then give Wizards slow. Then give Necros port. Then give BLs FD. Then give us the SD line of buffs. Then give Druids FA. Then give Pallys pets. Then give SKs Lay Hands. Then give Mages HT. <br />
<br />
OK, Mages HTing might be a bit much.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I want some utility back in my chosen class. I want my buffs to matter. I want my debuffs to matter. I want to be able to contribute some damage without burning 500 mana for 2 tics of Bane. These are not difficult suggestions. If they do not wish to unbalance the &quot;older, lower content&quot; with these things, then make them AA with ungoddly pre-requisites. <br />
<br />
I would personally love to have my new &quot;700 hp/+20 strikethrough/+20 avoidance&quot; buff on an AA hotkey instead of a spell, then I wont have to sit, mem, sit, re-mem, ad naseum all night if I want to go ANYTHING other than buff dead guys with FoS. <br />
<br />
How bout an AA that ONLY affects Spear of Torment? You need to have FoM3 as a pre-requisite (any shaman doing FoM is either looney or has too many AA or has a Sharkspine). This new AA cuts 1 second off cast time and adds 400 damage base. A 1K nuke. Wee. I mean, why not? They have an Ornate and EP focus that ONLY affects this spell. <br />
<br />
How about an upgrade to Cripple? Something that actually lowers the attack of mobs, not just its worthless stats. Something that MATTERS, since our best debuff, Slow, is being trivialized. <br />
<br />
This isnt Rocket science, and I know that the SOE devs know our situation and know whats what, I really believe that. I just think they dont much care enough about EQ1 anymore to be THAT concerned with it anymore. We wont see wholesale changes, we will see tiny tweaks, baby steps. A new heal, for a whole 200 more than our other one, whoopee.</div></div><hr />

Haste duration...please please please just extend it out...even with my EE4 and all my AAs this is just a joke atm...I'd rather bot a chanter just for hastes than have to recast all the time myself...It's a convenience and it threatens no one...just make it a little nicer for us during buffing rotations.<br />
<br />
Reduce the casting time on our ice DDs...at least a bit more...most raid fights now Dots are utterly useless and on any decent raid if I'm bored enough to cast a DD I still can't get off more than one blast for 925 before the mob is dead...in the mean time we all know what Druids are doing...<br />

<br />
I've previously been of the opinion that our nukes were ok at their level because we had our DoTs.  If Bane got fixed it would help some, but DoT application has been fairly removed from the picture in GoD, and a retuning of our DPS through DD might be warranted as a result.<br />
<br />
These are moderate issues IMO, and this as well as anything else should take a back seat to addressing our inadequacies in healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gangrelh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Improved invis doesn't make it so less things see you, it makes it so that there is a SET duration for invis to last.  No more casting it, moving 3 steps then getting the message that you feel yourself starting to appear.<br />
<br />
In my experiences does not seem to be the case.  ....Sometimes my Wizzy's Improved Invis comes off before my friends Invis!  I have ask others and they say the same.  Try it sometime and see.  It will not last the 27mins or whatever it says it will.  ...It may stay on for a little longer than invis on average, but it is still one of the worst upgrades in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Little things that would make my play more enjoyable:<br />
<br />
- fixed duration invis (potion or spell, whatever)<br />
- pet having innate SoW <br />
- easily quested clicky item that summons 1hand weapons<br />
- remove the recast delay on FA so I can swap it out (or make it an AA)<br />
- make canni4 an AA (to free up a spell gem)<br />
- eliminate the recast delay on SoW and BihLi<br />
- long duration &quot;all in one&quot; pet buff (focus + haste + FA)<br />
- talisman of alacrity should be 60% haste<br />
<br />
Slightly less modest requests:<br />
- lower casting time on malos from 5 to 3<br />
- add a &quot;hastened debuffing&quot; AA<br />
- add a &quot;hastened healing&quot; AA<br />
- add a &quot;hastened canni&quot; AA<br />
- increase healing on Daluda and Trushar by 30%<br />
- upgraded version of cripple (shaman only)<br />
- upgraded talisman of kragg (800 or so HP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Clicky canni4 item. Make it same cast time as canni4 spell+refresh so mana recovery rate is same as spell version.<br />
<br />
Make a head-slot item with a tiara graphic and the same stats as Vampiric Coif of the Grave (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44292) so I can get rid of this stupid horned helmet.<br />
<br />
The clicky is not that good cause I rather cast canni 4 then clicky turgurs (example) instead of a long canni 4.. and I LOOOVE the graphic on coif of the grave and am thinking of downgrading white dragon helm to it because of that.. also a part of the reason why I don't have elem or time helm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">All shamans come from large primitive races, we should be able to innately create two sharp sticks to serve as crude weapons to give our pet. <br />
<br />
Yes I'm saying a form of summon pet weapon, nothing fancy but &quot;summon sharp stick&quot; would be both roleplaying appropriate and not overpowered at all, it would just allow our pet to dual wield with no special procs or hit point bonuses on the sticks. <br />
<br />
It's little things like this that really help people enjoy their class and put up with the bigger imbalances that take longer to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think the niche of shamans as a buff class is buffing melee dps.  To that end, I'd like to see shamans receive a FA-esque buff that enhances melees much like some of the plane of time foci - specifically combat effects, accuracy and strikethrough, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at some of the defensive foci either, namely stun resist and avoidance.<br />
<br />
Add some of those effects to FA, or give us another buff (stackable with FA... maybe a buff like PE with relatively small increases to a few different stats (+10 or something to combat effects, strikethrough, accuracy) but a nice long duration (an hour+).  I dunno, perhaps this would make rogues outdo wizards in raid dps and thus upset soe's class balance or something.  But anyway I think a cool and reasonable upgrade would be a better buff to enhance melee dps, yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">AA fast cast (class aa) : reduce casting time by 5, 10 and 20% . Stack with every haste(spell ,aa , item)<br />
<br />
        Our spell are so slow that is not funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Our spells cast so slow that I'm probably the only class that has hassles with incredibly low level greenies.  They interrupt my slow spell casts so much that sometimes I have to run away to get a spell off just to get them out of my face while waiting at a LDON camp.  Thank goodness I'm an ogre.  Being stunned by these guys would be just too humiliating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm SO down for getting a sow upgrade, getting TA increased to 60%, getting dog-dog innate sow/dual wield, and a few other minor tweaks.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I'd want to bring these up just yet, though.  Bigger fish to fry and all that. *shrug*<br />

Be Well,<br />
