<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dear Mr. Smedley and Company<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;message.id=1702<br />
<br />
For a lack of a better place, I will post my message here.  This is an example of what your competition is doing, and doing very well, in the area of Customer Support and Communication.  Clear, concise, complete and timely information shared openly by senior members of the Cryptic team.  In stark contrast to many of the sarcastic, one-liners frequently provided as &quot;communication&quot; on these boards by SoE representatives.   <br />
<br />
This is one of the main reasons CoH has been such a success. <br />
<br />
First, a post by &quot;Stateman&quot;, Cryptic Studios Lead (the developer of City of Heroes) <br />
<br />
I arrived this morning around 9ish (as is the norm) and quickly checked my PM's. Someone asked about changes to Burn and Provoke. My curiosity was piqued; those changes weren't live yet to my knowledge (though they were in). I go to the boards only to be horrified at cries of &quot;STEALTH NERF&quot; and laments by Tankers. I checked the patch notes; the changes weren't listed. And then I turned to our servers - yep, those things were live. All I can say is: We're sorry. We've made a mistake. Whatever system we had for generating patch notes is going to be tossed out the window and redesigned. It is totally, completely unacceptable that our fans - our customers - aren't informed of changes to their game. Yes, their game. In the end, City of Heroes exists for you all. And I'm sorry that we've let you down - again. I'll post again today once I've undone this Gordian knot. <br />
<br />
Once again, I'm very, very sorry for this. <br />
<br />
Followed up by this post, by Geko, Cryptic Lead Designer<br />
<br />
As Statesman recently posted, an incomplete list of patch notes went up with today’s patch. Let me join him in apologizing for any confusion. There certainly was no intent to stealth nerf. In fact, many great improvements were added that we are sure you would want to know about and would be happy to hear about. So it seems like there was simply a copy/paste error somewhere and not all the notes were published. Again, we apologize. So here are the complete POWERS patch notes. Again, this is just Powers patch notes. All patch notes will be updated HERE (link removed) shortly, so be sure to check this page for the complete listing. <br />
<br />
Current Patch notes currently listed: <br />
<br />
Doubled duration of Deflection Shield and Insulation Shield. <br />
Doubled the duration of Fortitude (it does not stack). <br />
Reduced the END cost of Clear Mind. Decreased its recharge time. <br />
Increased the duration of Kinetics/Speed Boost and reduced its END cost. <br />
Decreased the END cost of Kinetics/Increase Density. <br />
Kinetics/Fulcrum Shift now buffs caster, and those near the caster, in addition to buffing those near enemies. <br />
Increased the duration of the Sleep/Disorient protection from O2 Boost. <br />
Fixed Short Help for Accelerate Metabolism (said it was a Team power but it is an Ally power). <br />
Reduced END cost of Super Speed. <br />
Regeneration/Instant Healing now accepts Recharge Enhancements and End Discount Enhancements and its recharge time is reduced to 60 seconds. <br />
Added DoT to Electricity Blast/Short Circuit (it now does significantly more damage). <br />
Increased damage of Energy Manipulation/Power Thrust. <br />
Increased damage of Energy Blast/Power Push. <br />
Increased Healing of Twilight Grasp and Transfusion. Increased Accuracy of Transfusion and Transference. <br />
Increased Recharge, Damage and END Cost of the following Blaster melee attacks: Energy Manipulation: Energy Punch, Bone Smasher; Electricity Manipulation: Charged Brawl, Havok Punch, Tunder Strike; Fire Manipulation: Fire Sword, Ice Manipulation, Ice Sword. This was to make them more useful and appealing as a secondary set power. <br />
Decreases threat level of Phase Shift, Dimension Shift. It will be much harder to hold agro with these powers now. <br />
It is now possible for some villains to resist Enervating Field. <br />
Sprint again accepts Jump Enhancements. <br />
Fixed a bug that let you select Leadership Vengeance before have 2 of the previous powers in the pool. If you already have Vengeance, but were not suppose to, it will NOT be removed. <br />
Reduced the END cost of Defender Blast powers. Slightly reduced the END cost of scrapper, tanker and controller attack powers. <br />
<br />
Additional patch notes that were missed: <br />
<br />
Hamidon has grown in power. <br />
You now produce less agro when using Phase Shift and/or Dimension Shift. <br />
Fixed Devouring Earth Swarm vulnerability (they were taking double and triple damage from some damage types like fire). <br />
More tuning to jumping physics. Jump Controls should be improved now. <br />
Behemoths should not longer appear in Kings Row. <br />
Increased Provoke Recharge Time from 3 to 10 seconds. Also, Provoke no longer Auto Hits. (It currently does not take ACC Enhancements, but this will be corrected in the next patch). <br />
Increased Fly Speed of Group Fly. Also fixed a bug that stop Fly Enhancements from increasing your Fly Speed of Group Fly. <br />
Removed Heal Enhancements as valid Enhancements allowed in Moment of Glory. MoG does not increase heal rate, and thus the Enhancements were not doing anything. <br />
Fixed Moment of Glory so you cannot regenerate HP while it is on, even with Instant Healing. <br />
Reduced Duration of “Burn” in half. Decreased its END cost to 1/3. Increased Recharge time. <br />
Fiery Embrace now Buffs the damage of all damage types for a short while (it still greatly increases fire attacks for a long time): &quot;Significantly boosts the damage of all your Fire attacks for quite a while. Also increases the damage of all your other non-fire based attacks for a short while.&quot; <br />
Fixed F/X for Fiery Embrace. <br />
Increased Damage and decreased END cost of Blazing Aura. <br />
Increased Damage and decreased END cost of Death Shroud, Spines/Quills and Lightning Field. <br />
Changed text help for burn, hot feet, and ice patch to indicate it can only be activated near ground (this is a text only change). <br />
New system chat message that Sprint is activated. <br />
Fixed Vengeance help text info error. (This is a text only change). <br />
Fixed Short Circuit help text info error. (This is a text only change). <br />
Fixed Tesla Cage help text info error. (This is a text only change). <br />
Fix Telekinesis help text info error. (This is a text only change). <br />
Fixed Singularity help text info error. (This is a text only change). <br />
Arch villains are more resistant to debuffs now. <br />
Fixed problem that made it difficult to select (click on) Devouring Earth villains. <br />
Reduced Ignite Duration. <br />
<br />
Future Power Patches: (these are NOT released yet, but are on the way) <br />
<br />
Decreased the difficulty of Higher level foes. It has been expanded so a Team can be created with a 5 level spread (you will be able to affect foes 7 levels higher than you). Please see my detailed notes on this HERE (linked deleted due to lack of permission to post links) <br />
Fixed a bug that made some powers that buffed/healed in an AoE if it hit a villain target (like Transfusion, Siphon Power, or Twilight Grasp) heal/buff less if the target was higher level. These powers will now buff/heal based on the casters level. <br />
Fixed a bug that was causing Scrapper/Regeneration/Resiliance to drain a tiny bit of END every 10 seconds. <br />
Fixed Short Help description for Claws/Focus (it said it was a Melee AoE, but it is a Ranged Targeted power. Power did not change, only description was corrected). <br />
Fixed Short Help description for Storm Summoning/O2 Boost (it said it was a Ranged AoE, but it is a Ranged Targeted Ally power. Power did not change, only description was corrected). <br />
Fixed Short Help and long description for Energy Blast/Explosive Blast (Actual damage is Moderate, but description said it was Minor. Power did not change, only description was corrected). <br />
Fixed O2 Boost and Clear Mind Resistance to Sleep (it would awaken slept Allies, but it gave no resistance). <br />
Burn now also protects the caster from Sleep and Hold effects. <br />
Damage Resistance will be capped at 90%. You will not be able to get your resistance to any type of damage beyond 90%. <br />
Fixed a bug that allows a power that can Slow a Targets Recharge Time to infinity. This would completely stop all of a Targets attack rate. The most you can Slow (increase) a targets attack rate will be 4 times its normal recharge time. This fix effects both villains and Heroes. <br />
Fixed a bug that allowed Damage Debuff powers to debuff a targets Damage to 0. The most a target can have its damage debuffed to is now 10%. This change affects both villains and Heroes. <br />
Added a Critical Hit (small % change to do double damage) to ALL Scrapper Primary attack powers (existing scrapper powers that already had critical hit damage have a higher success chance than other powers). <br />
Provoke will accept ACC Enhancements. <br />
<br />
I hope this clears things up. Again, our apologies for the confusion.<br />
<br />
GEE, CUSTOMER SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO REALLY CARE AND COMMUNICATE.  YOUR TURN TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP SOE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Someone's got some definite communications skills.<br />
<br />
I have a much more favorable opinion of them now, having read about the mistake AND the apology (and the apparent wilingness to fix it asap) than I had before I read this post - when I didn't know about the mistake at all.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm much more forgiving of screwups with good communication than I am of stonewalling and pretending the problems don't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That alone has just sold me.  I had planed to wait it out till WoW but I believe I will be the newest Super Hero today.  Thank you for posting that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sigh, gonna probably get a few more neg bumps here, but at this point, I really could care less.<br />
<br />
I love the fact that the CoH people have decided to be WAY WAY more &quot;straight up&quot; honest than EQs CS ever has been, but the end result is still the same. Why do people play EQ? Has EQ ever had great CS? Not really. Yet, here we are, 5year later. Why? I will tell you. Game content.<br />
<br />
There is a long long list of previous EQ killers. Lots of them offered great customer service. But at the end of it all, the game that people are going to end up playing more of is the one that offers more enjoyment and content. CoH is a great little game. I have a lot of guildmates who love it. I know lots of games like this. I play them all the time. But in the end, I still play EQ. <br />
<br />
I do not see CoH going the distance, already a LOT of folks who tried it from my guild are back, saying it got to be seriously repetitive fairly quickly. Will WoW have what it takes? Who knows.  But I am SICK and TIRED of people shoveling dirt on EQ based on a game that hasnt even SHIPPED. DAoC took a lot of big guilds for a couple months you know, and 1,000's and 1,000's of EQ players overall. But in the end, a vast majority came back to EQ. <br />
<br />
People should try and remember history a little better before they start jumping to these insane conclusions. I will buy WoW. I will play it. If I enjoy it, I will play it a while. If I REALLY REALLLY like it I will probably choose it full time over EQ. But right now, its a &quot;half-known&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally don't need or care for apologies like that.  No need to throw yourself out of a window for making an honest mistake.<br />
<br />
What I *do* need to see is somebody get some real sh!t done instead of inviting a few people out to a barbeque and then going back business as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe it's a good thing to hope for WoW to be the big EQ killer.  GoD knows they have taken all hope from the Shaman.  Everyone needs a dream. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Folks, let's not freak out here.<br />
<br />
Give Sony some credit.  They have in the past few weeks admitted their huge bungles and even pushed back an expansion in favor of fixing glitches.  Whatever negative and evil characteristics you want to give them, the bottom line is they are trying to communicate better.  Would they have had the summit were this not the case?<br />
<br />
So Rytan thinks, I'm sure for good reason, that stat buffs are useful.  So this runs contrary to what we think and want.  So what?  At least there's a dialogue.  I came back to EQ precisely because of this improved communication and dedication to pleasing their customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What is this supposed to prove, posting patch notes for a game that's barely a month or two old?  Of course there are going to be huge amounts of changes.  EQ is five years old and the codebase has to be getting brittle.  You can't just, as Brenlo said, &quot;wave the magic wand&quot; and make things better.  You HAVE to evaluate changes and make sure that the systems piled on systems that are in place do not collapse and put the game in a worse place.<br />
<br />
All this ranting is seriously getting retarded.  This is almost as bad as the monk boards and for all their ranting, they successfully got SOE to avoid their boards for over a year and a half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blazz, not sure if my post was the one that gave you the impression that the thread was about CoH over EQ, nothing could be further from the truth.  It's about CS personnel who are responsive and communicative, and a corporate attitude that fosters good relations with the player base.  No MUHAHAHAHAHAHHAs and other such taunts and one-liners from Brenlo and company.  No cover-ups and out-right misleading information (tell me again that LDoN exp is the same as when released, got 6% in 1.5 hours last night, what a bunch of B.S.).<br />
<br />
Just good old fashioned solid CS.  I posted in the hopes that SoE would emulate, since I too still enjoy this game and want it to improve.  So far they have talked a good talk, now they need to deliver.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At least there's a dialogue.<br />
<br />
Huh?  There was no need for any power lunches or company excursions in the first place.  There's dialogue right here on these boards.  There always been.  What they need to do is get off their lethargic rear ends and make some real changes to the game.  <br />
<br />
BTW, I don't buy the &quot;everybody I know went to DAOC and wound up coming back&quot; mantra that Blazz just regurgitated.  DAOC never had a drastic falling out of subscribers.  They climbed to a respectable 200-250k users and have held steady for a long time.  There never was some mass exodus of players who went back to EQ.</div></div><hr />

Haagen, sorry, again I did not bash SoE in my post, just gave them an example of good CS.  However, can you honestly say that the quality of the SoE posts has improved recently?  Maybe the quantity and frequency have increased, but the message is the same, &quot;prove us wrong&quot;, &quot;we are looking into it&quot;, &quot;wait and see&quot;, and the ever popular &quot;we don't agree&quot; (with no supporting rationale or evidence to counter our arguments).<br />
<br />
Again, I enjoy the game and really hope that they have MEANINGFUL discussions with the players.  Last time I checked, MUHAHAHAHAHAHA, was not a professional CS response.<br />

Matey, It proves that a major game company can have a positive attitude and proactive communication with its' player base.  I was not posting to compare the games or the process for making code changes.  I am pointing out the difference between one major gaming software company's level of customer communication and SoE's.  <br />
<br />
I enjoy EQ and sincerely hope they not only improve communications, but improve the game that we all love.<br />

<br />
Its one thing to communicate better but its another to fix something that is broken right away.  Not next year or next exspansion.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever system we had for generating patch notes is going to be tossed out the window and redesigned. It is totally, completely unacceptable that our fans - our customers - aren't informed of changes to their game. Yes, their game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another wonderful thing that they see that SoE doesn't &quot;THEIR GAME.&quot;  I dont believe that shaman are asking for the world just some fixes is that to much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is nice to see developers who care enough about thier customers to be upfront and admit mistakes readily. <br />
<br />
I don't see CoH being able to attract and retain people the way EQ has though. <br />
Given Blizzard's history with other games WoW gets a wait and see.<br />
The one product I do see with the possiblity of giving EQ a serious run for its money is Vanguard - Saga of Heroes. Most of the original EQ team is developing this game. If anyone has a good chance of taking the crown from EQ I would put my money on these guys. The only real concern I have with Sigil is how much is Mickeysoft sticking thier fingers into the project?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give them some credit? are you serious? the only reason they are catering to the player more now is because they actually have some worthy competition. they understand (from their own history) that once a player gets committed to a game they will stick with that game for a long time. so they see people leaving for these other mmorpg's knowing full well that they have potentially lost these customers for not just months, but years. <br />
<br />
they lost one in me. i loved this game for the longest time. sure my 2 accounts over 5 years probably only bought Smedley his starbucks every morning... but i'm ASSUMING here... with all these abrupt CS &amp; &quot;caring about what the customer thinks&quot; changes, something is going wrong with their financial projections. more people are obviously leaving than joining. <br />
<br />
5 years too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You are so getting deleted and banned...sorry bud...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You are so getting deleted and banned...sorry bud...<br />
<br />
If you mean me, then it's too late, billing period expires Monday.  If I decide to continue giving them my $12.95 a month I'll do so after considering the choices, on a monthly basis.  If they ban me from the EQ Live boards or the game itself, oh well, makes my decision easier.  This is not 1999, there are other enjoyable options out there now, and many more on the way.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to take the risk because the consequences are of little concern to me.<br />
<br />
P.S.  And please don't feel sorry for me, I'll be enjoying whatever game I chose to play.  I feel sorry for the folks that pay to put up with this B.S.<br />

If you HAVEN'T seen the strides Sony has made, player summit, much less restraint posting on non-Sony forums, opening the door to change(even if it's just a crack right now for Shaman), then you need to pay more attention.<br />
<br />
I'm not disgreeing that it can't be improved more, but to say that they don't have positive and pro-active communication with the players is just deceitful.  Look at all the threads they ran last month on their own forums.  Look how well it went overall in terms of player response.  Remember Whineplay a few years ago?  Those threads would have burned.<br />
<br />
Look, I feel the hurt that Shamans are in right now just as much as every other upset Shaman on these forums does.  Using insulting, derogatory and inflammatory remarks to try to heckle Sony into doing something doesn't work.  This tactic doesn't work on anyone, it just drives them away.  Making irrelevant and outrageous comparisons will just get you(and the rest of us, if this keeps up) ignored.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say that is entirely true....You see...the last time we heard from anyone about our issues was way back in April...soon as people started flaming the crap out of SoE on this board and SoE's offical board, Volia!  Not only one single liners of non-specific post comes out...but multiply posts directly telling the shaman community that SoE doesnt get a flying flip about shaman....might not be the progress we wanted...but hey, atleast it's something...now you can all end billing without hopes of, oh one day we will be fixed, blah...keep living that pipe dream...</div></div><hr />

I love the fact that the CoH people have decided to be WAY WAY more &quot;straight up&quot; honest than EQs CS ever has been, but the end result is still the same. Why do people play EQ? Has EQ ever had great CS? Not really. Yet, here we are, 5year later. Why? I will tell you. Game content.<br />
<br />
Game content....hmmm.....right now thats exactly why I am not playing. For the longest time my desire to play was primarily because I have friends that are still playing. Even though they are still in EQ it just got to a point where EQ for me was way way to repetive because I was more or less cut off from anything remotely new.<br />
<br />
I do not see CoH going the distance, already a LOT of folks who tried it from my guild are back, saying it got to be seriously repetitive fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
I kinda agree with you that at the moment CoH doesnt seem to have 1 year and much less 4 years left in it. But on the other hand this game that has only been out for a couple of months is far far more stable than EQ has ever been. It is very obvious that Cryptic focused on making a very good engine and held back on introducing tons of content (no points for pointing out what mmorpg that went the exact opposite way). I have so far seen 1 mob stuck in geometry in CoH and the only nuisance that caused was that I had to start over on my mission (=very minor deal since missions in CoH stay up until you finish them). I havent seen a single quest that didnt work and I have already done more in CoH in a little more than month than I ever did in EverQUEST.<br />
<br />
If Cryptic are able to add some interesting twists to CoH they could easily keep people playing and enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Edit: The CoH developers are even working on implementing a (very hard but still doable) quest that allows you to change some of your current  superhero's powers. That would equal SOE making a quest that allowed you to keep your level but still switch to another class if you were getting tired of being a shaman. When is that going to happen in EQ? Never! - would be my guess because up until now almost every progress in EQ has been a timesink and enabling players to switch to something the feel is more enjoyable yet still keep some of their hardearned levels and AAs is not acceptable. EQ as it is now is not about having fun its about being the best.</div></div><hr />

If you HAVEN'T seen the strides Sony has made, player summit, much less restraint posting on non-Sony forums, opening the door to change(even if it's just a crack right now for Shaman), then you need to pay more attention.<br />
<br />
I'm not disgreeing that it can't be improved more, but to say that they don't have positive and pro-active communication with the players is just deceitful.  Look at all the threads they ran last month on their own forums.  Look how well it went overall in terms of player response.  Remember Whineplay a few years ago?  Those threads would have burned.<br />
<br />
Look, I feel the hurt that Shamans are in right now just as much as every other upset Shaman on these forums does.  Using insulting, derogatory and inflammatory remarks to try to heckle Sony into doing something doesn't work.  This tactic doesn't work on anyone, it just drives them away.  Making irrelevant and outrageous comparisons will just get you(and the rest of us, if this keeps up) ignored.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's funny you should say that.<br />
<br />
We've got a rocket scientist here folks!  It's great to hear something I already knew.  How about you do a little experiment, Mr. Wizard, you try casting Slow over and over again on a BoT mob and see how much aggro you get with that(and how quick you die).  Now go do the same thing with Malosinia.  A resisted Malosinia doesn't generate nearly the same amount of aggro as a resisted Turgur's.  I can chain cast Malosinia and I won't generate enough hate to steal aggro from Warriors, let alone Paladins or SKs.  You try chain casting Slow and you're a smear on the back of the wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its ok for you to do that to someone on the boards here but not for someone else?</div></div><hr />

As far as my billing, that was a direct response to the guy that claimed that I would be banned.  Now that is an empty threat!  <br />

I stand by my actions, to demonstrate that a company can illustrate caring and open communications with its' player base.  Proactive admission of a mistake, and clear, concise explanation of both the situation and changes made.  A refreshing attitude by both management and customer support that I'd love to see by SoE reps.<br />

Matey,<br />
<br />
Please show me where I &quot;bashed Sony&quot; in my post?  Or where I misstated the truth?  I believe I was being very objective.  I posted what the Cryptic folks posted on their boards first thing this morning.  I did not edit or modify at all.  <br />
<br />
And, to be clear, they did not do anything wrong.  They just failed to completely inform the player base of the changes that went live.  But they did demonstrate a real caring for the players and desire to keep communications open and accurate.  I have not seen this commitment form SoE.  And if you believe that the folks at SoE have had a revelation and are now an incredibly caring company focused on CS, I would say they have taken a step in that direction, but they have a way to go.  We can all learn from those who do things well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't really live or die by the patch message.  It's a product; they make it; they can do whatever the hell they want with it.  If something changes, it changes.  If it really bugs me all that much and I notice it, then I can stop being a consumer.  But just because CoH has a detailed patch message doesn't make me say &quot;Holy crap, they have a *detailed patch message*, they're WAY better than EQ! *cancel EQ*&quot;  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Most of the games I play the companies hardly say anything at all to the players, and Sony does it all the time in patch messages, forums, etc...  Not like communication doesn't happen.  Sony just doesn't always say what the consumers wanna hear (and most of the time I don't blame 'em for some of the ridiculous and stupid stuff I hear come out of the mouths of consumers, making demands and threats... )<br />
<br />
But again, I play a game called EverQuest, not ConsumerQuest.  I don't sit at work all day fretting about whether I'll get a phone call from a dev if I died to a bug.  I know it's a huge game with immense detail, there's bound to be errors, and I get over it.  It's a game.  I contact CS maybe once a year.  It's a miniscule part of my EQ gaming experience, and not worth leaving the game over.  If I called EQ CS about dying to a bug or my account getting hacked and they replied &quot;I'm gonna kill you and your whole family and take your job&quot; then ya, I might have a reason to be pissed, but otherwise, there's nothing to complain about.  Contrary to a lot of yammering I read on forums, the ones I hear in-game are positive CS experiences.  Some people go so overboard about things, and then demand all kinds of attention and become jackasses when they don't hear or get what they want.  There are bigger things to worry 'bout in this world.</div></div><hr />

OK, you don't care about the patch messages, cool.  You also don't seem to care about the quality of Customer Support, again, that's cool with me.  However, I do, so I will continue to point out their failings in this area, especially when I know they could do better and help keep the player base &quot;happier&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Most folks on this board are upset about the state of the high end Shaman in some zones and expansions.  However, many people are outraged at the demonstrated poor Customer Service by SoE.  Whether it is poor communications, inaccurate information, unprofessional comments, or bad attitude.  They have shown that their Customer Service to the paying player base can stand to improve.  Yes, they are trying harder now, for whatever reason.  But they have a way to go.<br />
<br />
Again, you seem resigned to living with poor Customer Service and communication.  Remember, part of your $12.95 a month pays the salaries of the folks who provide that poor CS.  I guess you like paying for poor services.  I actually like to get my money's worth, I work hard for it, and expect them to do the same.<br />
<br />
Yes, Cryptic does CS better than SoE.  No, CoH is not better than EQ.  No, I did not say to cancel your EQ subscription.  Get your facts straight please. I'm working to get them to improve, which will help everyone with a subscription.<br />

Sony plays it too close to the vest for its own good, in my opinion.  If the SOE powers that be would set their developers free to explain their point of view and really engage the player base in debate about balance, I bet the anger level would go down a lot, assuming there are good reasons for the decisions being made.</div></div><hr />

Translated:  I pay $12.95/month, so I can be demanding and a jerk and make a big deal out of little things.  You base your playing experience completely off of the &quot;quality&quot; of CS?  (which is all relative --- what is good service to one person is crappy to another...  is that the company's or the user's &quot;fault&quot;?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">BTW, I don't buy the &quot;everybody I know went to DAOC and wound up coming back&quot; mantra that Blazz just regurgitated.

To some extent this is true, but I am willing to bet that a majority of higher end EQ players who went to DAoC came back to EQ. I use the 3 guilds I was very familiar with as the basis for this speculation. <br />
<br />
I agree that DAoC gradually added folks and rose to the 200-250K level. However, I think of you could see the numbers at 1 month, then 45 days, then 90 days, you would see a HUGE jump, then a big drop, and THEN the steady climb to 200K. The point I am reffering too, the &quot;EQ Killer&quot; portion of the release, is that first 90 days.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to pick on you specifically Thunder. In fact, I tend to agree that its nice a see a company that cares enough about its subscribers that it apologizes for its mistakes. EQ tried this too, at the summit, admitting they messed up the Gates release. Better late than never, but it may be too late for some.<br />
<br />
CoH has potential. WoW has potential. The thing the ruined games like DAoC and AC and AO for EQ players was the whole &quot;EQ Grind&quot; mentaility that is SO pervasive in games today. Too many people play these games for the end, not the ride. The want that LAST BIG HILL on the Roller Coaster and they want it ASAP, but forget how fun all those other hills and twists and turns are. I remember logging into DAoC 2 days after it was released (I dont live near a good software store) and seeing some of my friends at lvl 20+ already! Then they said &quot;Hey come with us, they have Power Level Code in this game, you can get XP mega fast if you play with us&quot;. I did that for an hourish and got 4 fast levels and then politely begged off and went to play with other friends around my level. I WANTED to play the game. <br />
<br />
In the end, I didnt find the amount of content to be worth the effort, so I left. Got 2 guys to level 20ish in that first month. shrug. AO (or maybe AC) was even worse. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, and I can only speak for myself, it will be REALLY hard for any game to take over the #1 spot from EQ in my mind, becase I highly doubt ANY game will ever be able to prickle the hair on the back of my neck and make me look over my shoulder in my own house when I opened the door to the house in Unrest that first few times. Vanilla isnt gonna cut it, no matter how good their CS is, or their graphics, or anything. I want Rocky Road, baby. I dont wanna know EXACTLY whats in that next bite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know Poguk I was trying to put a civil end to this discussion and move on.  Then you decide to come back to misrepresent what I said and start the name calling.  Man, it's folks like you who make these boards unproductive.<br />
<br />
I believe that most players would like SoE to improve their customer support and communication.  If you had any business experience at all you would know that CS, PR and customer relations are not &quot;little things&quot;.  Companies spend billions a year making sure that they present the right image to their paying customers, the folks that pay their salaries.  And in this online environment, the only way SoE can do that is through their online communication and CS, which have been poor at best.<br />
<br />
Again, you may be happy with the horrible CS SoE has provided in the last couple of years, but I would dare say that most players are not.  I agree, it would be my &quot;fault&quot; if my expectations where out of the norm, but I believe most players feel as I do.  Therefore, it is SoE's fault, not mine.  SoE reps have been rude, sarcastic, childish and I believe have even misrepresented the truth in some of their posts and released messages.  Taking 20, 30 or 45 days to respond to a customer complaint through a broken petitioning system (which after 5 years they are finally admitting is broken and replacing) is not acceptable by any business standards.  You don't care about that, since you say you enjoy the game anyway.  Fine, then be happy, but don't attack me for not sharing your opinion. <br />
<br />
I do care about CS, but no, I don't base my entire gaming experience on it.  If you bought an expensive car and the horn was broken, you'd get it fixed, not just live with the broken horn.  So why should I pay for a service that is not meeting my needs, or those of the vast majority of the players, and just &quot;live with it.&quot;? <br />
<br />
Also, I don't like being ignored, ridiculed, or lied to.  I only want SoE to provide the quality CS that any good company should provide its' customers, which is why I gave them the example of what Cryptic is attempting to do.  No, they are not perfect, but at least they seem to care and are trying, more than SoE has demonstrated in the past.  SoE may be trying harder now and actually improving in some respects, but they still have a way to go.<br />
<br />
I for one will take a &quot;groveling apology&quot; (not my words) over MUHAHAHAHAHA, any day.<br />
<br />
You may think I am a jerk based on my actions and posts, fine, I could not care less.  If you are happy with the game and quality of CS you get when you need it, fine, more power to you.  However, I am not, so I will continue to do what I can to hopefully improve my gaming experience.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

Give Sony some credit. They have in the past few weeks admitted their huge bungles and even pushed back an expansion in favor of fixing glitches. Whatever negative and evil characteristics you want to give them, the bottom line is they are trying to communicate better. Would they have had the summit were this not the case?<br />

So Rytan thinks, I'm sure for good reason, that stat buffs are useful. So this runs contrary to what we think and want. So what? At least there's a dialogue. I came back to EQ precisely because of this improved communication and dedication to pleasing their customers.<br />

[Proceeds to quote something I wrote nearly a year ago]Wow, did you even read what I was replying to?  The parent post was utterly ridiculous.  Yeah, I admit, it was a little inflammatory but don't tell me you've never flamed someone before.  Thanks for trying to derail the thread, please try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">You know Poguk I was trying to put a civil end to this discussion and move on.  Then you decide to come back to misrepresent what I said and start the name calling.  Man, it's folks like you who make these boards unproductive.<br />
<br />
I believe that most players would like SoE to improve their customer support and communication.  If you had any business experience at all you would know that CS, PR and customer relations are not &quot;little things&quot;.  Companies spend billions a year making sure that they present the right image to their paying customers, the folks that pay their salaries.  And in this online environment, the only way SoE can do that is through their online communication and CS, which have been poor at best.<br />
<br />
Again, you may be happy with the horrible CS SoE has provided in the last couple of years, but I would dare say that most players are not.  I agree, it would be my &quot;fault&quot; if my expectations where out of the norm, but I believe most players feel as I do.  Therefore, it is SoE's fault, not mine.  SoE reps have been rude, sarcastic, childish and I believe have even misrepresented the truth in some of their posts and released messages.  Taking 20, 30 or 45 days to respond to a customer complaint through a broken petitioning system (which after 5 years they are finally admitting is broken and replacing) is not acceptable by any business standards.  You don't care about that, since you say you enjoy the game anyway.  Fine, then be happy, but don't attack me for not sharing your opinion. <br />
<br />
I do care about CS, but no, I don't base my entire gaming experience on it.  If you bought an expensive car and the horn was broken, you'd get it fixed, not just live with the broken horn.  So why should I pay for a service that is not meeting my needs, or those of the vast majority of the players, and just &quot;live with it.&quot;? <br />
<br />
Also, I don't like being ignored, ridiculed, or lied to.  I only want SoE to provide the quality CS that any good company should provide its' customers, which is why I gave them the example of what Cryptic is attempting to do.  No, they are not perfect, but at least they seem to care and are trying, more than SoE has demonstrated in the past.  SoE may be trying harder now and actually improving in some respects, but they still have a way to go.<br />
<br />
I for one will take a &quot;groveling apology&quot; (not my words) over MUHAHAHAHAHA, any day.<br />
<br />
You may think I am a jerk based on my actions and posts, fine, I could not care less.  If you are happy with the game and quality of CS you get when you need it, fine, more power to you.  However, I am not, so I will continue to do what I can to hopefully improve my gaming experience.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

No, &quot;most&quot; players hear a few grunters complaining on the forums and decide it must be the cool thing to do.<br />
<br />
Your reasons are all hypothetical rhetoric.  You spout &quot;they lied, ignored, ridiculed&quot; you but that has never happened to me.  Every time I've dealt with them it's been fine, and for the most part from what I've heard from word of mouth on the game, people have been taken care of positively.  Then I come on the boards and read crap like yours --- what have they done to you personally???  Did you read somewhere on a forum about how one of the reps made an off-hand comment to some jackass on a Sony forum after the jackass made a jackass comment, and therefore *you* felt ridiculed???  Did they &quot;lie&quot; to you because they didn't include every miniscule change in a patch message?  No one wants to read every damn thing they touch up in a patch!  The list would be massive and cumbersome!  I want you to think about how much bitching EQ players have done about this game since DAY ONE, and then ask you why you think Sony ignores people!!  I don't blame 'em!  EQ players are probly the most whiny demanding people I've seen in any game, period.<br />
<br />
I just don't buy this bull.  Play the game and shush!<br />
<br />
Don't think for one minute that &quot;Cryptic&quot; has your needs/wants in mind.... deep down they are just like Sony -- all they want is your money.  They see all these whiners complaining about certain things about EQ, and say &quot;hey, we can suck those players over here by pretending to care about that crap&quot; and voila, you got suckered.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't derailing anything.  Was simply stating that you were not above flaming.  I believe that he also believed SoE to be utterly ridiculous.  Unlike you he didn't call them Mr. Wizard did he.  He stated some facts and  went on his way.  Your quote was rude abrasive and pointless to say the least.  Then you have the nerve to tell thunder how he should present himself or should exspect?  People exspect different things.  Someone might be happy with crappy CS more power to them.  Others might want more for there money.  Times have change people are happy with horrible cell phone service, cable service, and food service.  In the end it's whatever makes you happy I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">When It's all said and done, either you will play and be happy; or play and be unhappy.  One way or the other.  Let's all try to remember that this is a GAME we subscribe to.  And if you have a bad experience due to customer support...who hasnt? How many times have one of you gone into &lt;insert favorite fast-food joint here&gt; and ordered your favorite combo; only to have it come out jacked up?  Did you refuse to ever go back to the resteraunt based on that one experience?  Did you send hate mail to Mr. Mcdonald's house?  Or did you simply go on about your life, knowing that the next time you went and ordered your meal, chances are you were going to be satisfied?<br />

I died due to a zoning bug last night.  3 times.  I got my rezz(es), looted my gear, and went on PLAYING.  After all, that is why I pay $12.95 a month.</div></div><hr />
