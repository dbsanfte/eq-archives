<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have two of these, one REALLY old, one a year old:<br />
<br />
I was around level 20, as was my EQ partner.  His brother was uber and 45 (!) when all you could get to was 50.  So that my buddy (a chanter) could try a little PVP, his brother logged in his level 22 bard.  My friend summoned his pet and the fight began.  I couldn't heal or buff my buddy because of the code, but his pet was a different matter!  I just remember the bard, running in circles, in front of the EC tunnel, calling me every name in the book and yelling, &quot;that's not fair!&quot;  I couldn't stop laughing :)<br />
<br />
I had a group in DN, and we were crawling deep.  Some of the rats were none too happy with my attempts to slow them and my health was getting rather low.  My Guildboss targetted me and fired off DA.  Unfortunately, he had me already targetted, so he got my pet instead of me.  I'm rememming my spells at my bind point, while my pet's lolling his tongue in DN!  Everybody was laughing their head off, until my pet decides that they're laughing at him!  So he starts attacking the group and gets subsequently sent to pet heaven.  To this day, I have but to meantion this, to make Guildboss start laughing  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Funniest to date:<br />
<br />
We got a monk pulling in the north wing of BoT. MT in the same group decides he needs to go take a leak, so goes AF on a group memeber and leaves. As fate would have it, he went AF on the pulling monk. <br />
<br />
There we stood, 30 of us trying to clear the entire tower in less than 2 hours, and doing well. Until we see the monk head upstairs to begin pulling again. Old Zal was following Sarsh while Sarsh got aggro from 2 of the giants. Sarsh ran halfway back to the force, FD'd, and Zal got the living snot beat out of him. <br />
<br />
Everyone stood there like &quot;W T F&quot;??? Only after he came back ffrom afk and told us he had AF's the puller did we figure out what had happened. <br />
<br />
We got screenshots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't post the full story because I would get banned from these boards, but it involves a cyber mistell, my guildleader, a game of truth or dare, a very big train, and Derakor The Vindicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still laugh over the time I was trying to root-park a couple of sarnak in Lake of Ill Omen while my wife beat one down.  Got a bit low on health, TAB-heal and forgot to TAB back... root broke, so I recast root and then had to stand there and die.<br />
<br />
But my RL friend, the wizard, has that beat.  He rooted himself, also in LOIO, and then cast Shadow Step.  Ended up at the bottom of the lake in LOIO, no EB item, rooted.  Fortunately he had the presence of mind to sit, mem a gate, and get out before his air ran out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was fighting a 65ish mage today and I malo'ed his pet while it was killing my pet.   Went to turgur it.... resist.  Resist.   Resist.   Root.  Pet dead.  Resist.  Resist.  *** IS GOING ON?!   One last try.  Resist.   I zone out to PoK thinking man, what bad luck.   So I scroll up and see how I had resisted about 10 of my own roots.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While travelling through Upper Guk on the way to Lower, I decided that I didn't need a map to navigate around... and as the story goes, I got lost.<br />
<br />
Along the way, I came to realize that these green con frogloks would and did agro me at 65.  Much to my surprise, I soon had a MASSIVE train of the froaking devils chasing me, and at one point I was pinned underwater in a corner being &quot;ogre-blocked&quot; by an army of the devils.  <br />
<br />
I finally managed to duck, stand, duck, stand my way out of the blockade and manged to find the way to Lower Guk, but only after the zone mobilized in a futile attempt to slay the Bear invader, taking two health bubbles in the process.<br />
<br />
Scary stuff... /froak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funniest moment I had was when I grouped with this guy who had vowed to KS everything that a friend of mine and fellow guildmember was camping.  I went anon and was all buddy-buddy to him to get his trust, telling him to ignore the newbs and I'd help him KS everything.  I was on my druid. <br />
<br />
Well we were in Butcherblock (this is a long time ago) and while he's fighting some skeleton on the chessboard I hit teleport to Toxx :)<br />
<br />
Needless to say I wish I could have seen the expression on his face muahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my funniest moment is preluclin , sitting naked with two females at the entrance of velks ( back when everyone and their mother went there ) . we just happened to be grouped and cybering when just as people zoned out of velks due to a castle train i hit ;g instead of /g on a particularly salty message .....<br />
one hour later got tell from gm for zone disruption , but i laughed so hard it was worth it , especially when a guildmember tried to blackmail me with screenshots .... and a prude high elf wizard female went so indigned that i am sure i turned red ( the good part is afterwards i became good friend with that last one ) .<br />
picture the barb with a human female and a DE female , all 3 naked at velks entrance and the grp chat going public for a second ..... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, this didn't happen to me but to a friend this morning. It's just too funny not to share. Here's what he wrote up on it on the Tunare Boards this morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was sitting in the bazaar this morning trying to push my wares when a level 9 barbarian shaman /shouted &quot;How do you find someone you want to buy from?&quot; Someone responded, and told him he had to right click on the name.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass, and he comes by me, and up to someone beside me. (Let's call the trader &quot;Jones&quot; cuz I don't remember the traders name). Then I hear the shaman, very politely say, &quot;Jones, I would like to buy that tunic you are selling.&quot; A couple minutes pass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jones, would you please sell me that tunic?&quot;<br />
<br />
I check a /who Jones - he's afk. I wait a couple more minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jones, it's not polite to ignore your customers, can I please buy that tunic you have for sale?&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time I really have no idea if this guy is serious or not.. so I tell him &quot;Jones is AFK, but you can buy the tunic by right clicking on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shaman apparently figured it out because he sent me a tell shortly after saying, &quot;Thanks for the tip. I've never met Jones before, so I don't know if he really is afk or not, but he's certainly not as nice as you are.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just remembered the stupidest thing I had done...<br />
<br />
I went LD on a boat... at level 16 or so.... way back around release... and I came back in the water... swimming and panicing because stamina was running out... I petitioned the gm... to move me to land... I swam for about 25 mins... till... I noticed... my spell gem for gate.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
always wonderd why it didnt help  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">First thign comes to mind is a group i was in in dreadlands in my first guild, I was hihg 40's and there was a SK friend that was 51 i think. Well im in the group and he comes up and joins and we fight for a while. well a cleric comes in the zone and he tries to send me a tell &quot; Lets drops one of the rogues we dont need 2 &quot;. Well the group chat was dead silent as everyone read his mistell into group chat lol. He didnt even realize till one of the rogues goes &quot;Yes lets drop one , they suck&quot;. My poor friend just disbanded he was so ashamed and ran off, which made it all the more funny ;)</div></div><hr />

Wodon attacks Zeek, Zeek begins to cast a spell..... You have been struck down by the wrath of the gods for 825 HP. Double the HP I had. !@#$% Halfling Shadow Knight.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think my best one was when I got a tell from a total stranger (a level 2 character, as it turned out): &quot;Can I have all of your money, please, I need it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Left me speechless for a while :)<br />
<br />
And the most embarrassing one must be joining my guild, forgetting to turn the /guildchat channel on and wondering (for 2 or 3 days!) why it was so dead there and why nobody was even responding to my /gu :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The funniest thing I have seen just happened the other night and I'm still kicking myself for not getting a screenshot. I was running about in Steamfont when a group of 6 gnomes went streaking by. All of them were mages and they all had water pets. 5 were on AF. I would swear that it had to have been one of those mythical 6-boxers because they all had variations of the same name. I just stood and watched the parade go by, laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Funny, accidental:<br />
<br />
I'm playing my 55 cleric in OS. We just formed our group and began marching our way to the disco. We encounter some mobs, the tank is starting to get beaten down into CH-territory. I stand up, hit the hotkey to cast CH. Hmm, that's odd, CH seems to be pretty fast... &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT&quot;. ***? Oh, I had put Gate in my CH slot. DOH.<br />
<br />
Funny, intentional:<br />
<br />
Gnome Day in Gfay. Our guild &quot;raided&quot; GFay. We all made lvl 1 gnomes, ran to GFay and got bound near Kelethin. We promptly began to run riot, attacking guards, the PoD, forming conga lines jumping off the Kelethin platforms and so forth. There had to be hundreds of gnome corpses. There were so many corpses lying around that the zone began to bog down. Four (4!!) gms showed up to make us stop because we were apparently about to bring down the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Spookem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was grouped with a war and mage in OS, our war not sure if the mage had been to the camp before asked him if he knew where zone out was.  The mage replied without missing a beat. Sure third spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That Gnome day reminds me something my guild did a long time ago. Troll raid on Freeport. This was pre-luclin with the old mods too which made it even more funny.<br />
<br />
We all got bound just outside the Gates in the newbie area and all storm the gates over and over again and see who can make it the furthest. In EFP someone made it as far as the docks, in WFP I actually made it to the Arena.<br />
<br />
It was great, had people there cheering us on and all. :)</div></div><hr />

Went to Oasis and while waiting on the boat to Overthere (pre PoP and SoL) I /ooced &quot;Wow, check out this cool feature. When you type /ex you can check your exp status&quot; and watched the zone get empty...<br />
<br />
Sat down with my rogue in GF Woodelf bank and made a hotkey with &quot;/em steals 5 pieces of gold from YOU&quot; and watched the tells roll in...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Way back when, Prolly close to 3 and half years ago. I was playing my thief Feather. Exploring that dangerous zone High hold keep.  There was a wedding outside so I figured I would be undesturbed as I ransacked the place. (GM's used to come and officate weddings sometimes) Now you could be on fire with Gnomes violating every orafice and a Gm would not bother to put you out or make the gnomes stop.)<br />
<br />
Well.. I was sneaking around casing the joint.  Oooh and Ahhing at all the neat stuff when I started hearing moans from a bedroom and such.<br />
<br />
So naturally I listened.. To a couple who had just been wed talking and emoting and getting hot and heavy in one of  Carson McCabes Bedrooms.<br />
<br />
They were quite inventive. And also quite shocked when I Dropped a flower on the bed next to them. And Bolted out the window and towards south Karanas. Laughing my ass off the entire way.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second time was much much much later in time. Feather was now level 60. Pre luclin. I was running along in West Karanas headed to my Parents home in Qeynos. I figured nothing could harm me there with my exalted level and all.  So I ran on Secure in my knowledge of my place in the world as a supreme thief. Silent, deadly, and unnoticed by the world around me. (Went afk for a moment for a knock at the door)<br />
<br />
Well Water doesnt care how sneaky you are. And a level 60 thief saying they drowned in guild chant and need a res... well. I caught alot of flack over that one...<br />

Me and my wife gated our characters out at the bottom of the mines leaving my bro's 60 monk and a 45 pally friend of ours stuck there, which wouldn't have been a problem except for the new see invis mobs they added at the bottom of the caverns. Well since my pally friend would have been lunch my bro decides to train everything out ahead of him. He gets every grimling he can on the way up the the cave entrance, the runs around GF picking up all the ones he can, the runs them over to the cat outpost by TM and FD's right in the center. <br />

Was funny as hell watching the kitty's kick the crap out of about 50-70 grimlings and other assorted mobs. The kitties didn't lose a single one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Exploring new zones for the first time. Helping other people (even guilded which I always thought was odd), getting an Epic Component. <br />
I must have done the Dire Wolf in MM at least 3 times for other Shaman. (With my Monk).<br />
<br />
Leading raids. For awhile I was part of a small team of 2, and 3-boxers doing Epic and single group named encounters. (Scout in WL for example). That was fun.<br />
<br />
The ol faction game. Nothing like having maxxed out faction in NFP with a DE Enchanter. In natural form. Nothing like getting better faction with the Monks than my Monk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey could you talk to my Guild Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, there are always a slew of factions, and take a wrong turn and you hear this:<br />
<br />
&quot;IT'S DARK ELVES / ENCHANTERS LIKE YOU THAT HAVE RUINED THIS PLACE!&quot; (or words to that effect).<br />
<br />
Going into some newbie zone, seeing folks not being PL'ed and buffing them as much as possible or saving their bacon. A favorite tactic was to aggro the zone and chain stun while the level 1-x'ers got the exp.<br />
<br />
Really nice in Black Burrow.<br />
<br />
Making or combining things for people doing quests. I am also a tradeskill whore (in addition to faction whore), and the (at the time) &quot;no fail&quot; combines or at least &quot;trivial&quot; for me were fun in that I knew it made somebody else's day.<br />
<br />
The absolute last pinnacle was soloing in The Hole for my Enchanter's Epic piece. Couple of deaths and incredible situational awarenessl. I did it at 59 there were other (better) Enchanters who did it at 53. Suffice to say, the pixelated pucker factor was very high.</div></div><hr />

I finally raised a good sum of cash, around 30k, maybe I could get real lucky on a Topor scroll, for the next 5 months I kept searching the bazaar, &quot;Topor&quot; &quot;Topor&quot; &quot;Topor&quot; NOTHING, I figure this must be the most god awful spell in the game to obtain, then one day a friend had obtained a Scroll for himself while hunting in HoB, OHHH It's spell Torpor /shame.<br />
<br />
<br />
I once got stuck in Halas right after I got my new levitate spell. I petitioned, and waited 3 hours for a GM to come get me. When he got there &quot;Why didn't you just gate?&quot;</div></div><hr />

People are making strange follow up comments to stuff, laughing at nothing in particular.  And the SK is very quiet thru all of this.  I start thinking about it, and I haven't seen him say one thing in 30 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Dude, SK_Man_01 -- cat got your tongue? Why aren't you talking?&quot;<br />
group: &quot;***, he's chatting up a storm...&quot;<br />
/ignore SK_Man_01<br />
You will no longer ignore SK_man_01<br />

Place: Citadel of Runnyeye<br />
<br />
Scenario: My two barbarian friends (warrior and shaman) and I (paladin) are looking for a new place to hunt, getting tired of the overcrowded train station that was Unrest at the time. So, we'd heard about the goblins in Runnyeye, and hey, everyone loves gobbos! Plus, we'd had some 'bad experiences' in Permafrost (low dps + no snare = bad idea for dungeons). Added bonus, we were still trying to become one with the #$&amp;&amp;^$@# wall (a running joke to this day for any non-halfling that ever attempted the quest), and the gobbos all gave good faction hits.<br />
<br />
So, we run down towards the Dazed area (we just figured down = better hunting!), and for whatever reason took the left to go towards the King. Well, in the room where the hallway down ends, there is already a group there, bummer. After attempting to communicate with them and getting nowhere fast (they were all Korean I think and had no english speaker along) we decided to 'politely leap frog'...<br />
<br />
As soon as the barbarian shaman in my group opens the door, out come about 20-30 goblins led by the Goblin King himself! Needless to say, we immediately turned tail and fled to the zone screaming like school girls as the other group (who in hindsight must've let a runner get away) got slaughtered. That shaman not only would not set foot in Runnyeye again except to run from Misty to the Gorge, he also would not open any doors in any dungeons, and was a real pain to just get INTO a dungeon after that. He still gets ribbed to this day about the Door of DOOM and what happens to curious shaman. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">My recent one was I just completed my cleric's epic.  I was eager to try out the epic after all so took the healer geisha bot on a LDON run.  Of course my buds with me knew I wanted to use the stick but dammit just refused to die.  We pulled hard and still no deaths.  Near the end of the run I was kind of disappointed I would not get to play clicky stick rez when the tank ran too far and brought back too many goblins (was in EF).  My wife slaps down the evac and *woosh* back to zone in we go...except the cleric...  Needless to say healer geisha bot was finally able to use her rez stick...on herself as the first rez.  :P<br />
<br />
Funniest story in the 4 years of playing (god I need a life..rofl) was when I was camping goblins in oasis for the opaline helm.  Was helping some friends get some bard quest armor.  This newb walks up to my dog and starts asking for buffs.  My druid friend, not in dog form, suggests the person ask the shaman as that &quot;druid&quot; was afk for buffs.  Person got angry and demanded that Jobantik buff him regardless.  We just howled.  At one point the newb was cursing Jobantik and threatening to report him to a GM for being rude (how I dunno since Jobantik was just sitting there quietly).  The whole zone was laughing over this for days. rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Sudorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Funny, accidental:<br />
<br />
I'm playing my 55 cleric in OS. We just formed our group and began marching our way to the disco. We encounter some mobs, the tank is starting to get beaten down into CH-territory. I stand up, hit the hotkey to cast CH. Hmm, that's odd, CH seems to be pretty fast... &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT&quot;. ***? Oh, I had put Gate in my CH slot. DOH.<br />
<br />
Funny, intentional:<br />
<br />
Gnome Day in Gfay. Our guild &quot;raided&quot; GFay. We all made lvl 1 gnomes, ran to GFay and got bound near Kelethin. We promptly began to run riot, attacking guards, the PoD, forming conga lines jumping off the Kelethin platforms and so forth. There had to be hundreds of gnome corpses. There were so many corpses lying around that the zone began to bog down. Four (4!!) gms showed up to make us stop because we were apparently about to bring down the zone.<br />
<br />
OMG that is some funny shiot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was getting rdy to do a MM adv., and i had to get c3 and Virtue. grp goes ahead without me, and i try to gate back to BB. well i go LD in between zoning. still had &quot;Entering Butchberlock&quot; on the screen. i come back, and am falling through the zone. sky around me, nothing else and i can't move. i had gate up, and was registered as in BB. gate. &quot;Loading. Please wait&quot; i scroll up and it says &quot;You have fallen! YOU have been hit for 20000 damage by non-melee (not sure wut it says about non-melee).<br />
<br />
