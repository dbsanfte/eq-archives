<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fifner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The next step for my SoF quest is to get the books from Ghiosk.  I would like to do it with a minimum of fuss, so i'm wondering about the minimum number of people I need to use to kill him.  Do you think that two 60 mages and a 60 cleric could take him?  If not, what do you suggest?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For ghiosk i'd say 1 solid group with a good tank can handle him easily. You need to have a rogue at least to pick the door. With a 60 warrior and a rogue added to your group i'd expect you could do it easily assuming you don't mean rak not ghiosk.<br />
<br />
Rak is the one with the fire ae that you want mage pets for and you would need to add monk and some sort of mana regen to the group too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ghiosk is quite heavily magic resistant - at 51 when I did him, I couldn't land anything on him, no slow, no malx, no DDs, no DoTs.  Rely on brute force - so a solid tank, and rogues/monks etc and a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last weekend, I took 3 friends with me to CoM to kill Neh'Ashiir and as many reavers as we could get our hands on (including Ghiosk).    The group was a 60 cleric, 60 warrior, 58 rogue and me (59 shm).  The only time that we had any trouble was when the warrior accidentally aggroed Rak'Ashiir causing us to run.  Unfortunately, the cleric &amp; warrior didn't make it, but the rogue made it an easy CR.<br />
<br />
If all you're after is Ghiosk, get a solid tank, cleric &amp; rogue to help you out.  He spawns off of the reaver on the ground floor of the castle, so you don't have to go further than the bridge to do this part of the epic.  Get the rogue to open the door, tank pulls the reaver with a range weapon (or spell), kill, kill, kill until you have your books.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done Ghiosk (and all the reavers and Neh'ashir) with Cleric, Magician (me), Rogue, and a miscelaneous Tank. The fights would have worked just fine without my involvement, but pulling would have been more problematic (we were CotH splitting the reavers).<br />
<br />
Anyway - all you need to kill ghiosk is Cleric, Rogue, Tank. Assuming reasonable equipment of course.</div></div><hr />
