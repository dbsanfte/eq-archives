<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I just took a visit to the Bazaar arena last night to do some duels with people and most of them time I found every single one of my spells except Malos being resisted.  Is there some special trick to getting around these peoples' resists, or are Shaman just not on par with everyone else when it comes to PvP?</div></div><hr />

Any spells against another PC tend to resist more often than not if the specific resist is over 100...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Before you do anything..SPAM CANCEL MAGIC!  You have no idea how much this can mess someone up.  If you are fighting a pet class, cancel magic their pet first, it will usually be the bigger threat.  Remember to utilize Spirit Call and ole' speed bump.<br />
<br />
1. If the person is a higher level than you, they are going to resist your spells more often.  Once you hit 65 resists will happen less.<br />
<br />
2. I usually hit them with XXX decay and spam Grummus until it sticks.  Once this has happened i'll MaloXXX them and try to root them<br />
(while all this is happening, i've sicked dogdog on them, sometimes they will get off your and focus on the pet.  If you have spirit call, use it now.)<br />
<br />
After they are slowed, your job becomes much easier.  If you are fighting a melee (especially rogues) put your back against the wall.  This way, they will have a harder time interrupting you and backstabbing.<br />
<br />
You should usually never have problems when fighting a melee.  The only people that have given me much trouble are bards (of course) and necromacers.  Generally, just make sure to keep them (or their pet) slowed, and keep Qui/Torpor on yourself.  Remember to use spirit call!  It's more usefull than most think.  It can throw them off guard, and if they are a caster, they'll have a heck of a time getting a spell off with 3+ dogs beating on them.<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's what I usually do.  It's worked pretty well for me, but i'm by no means a hardcore PvP'er.  So, take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you lose against a melee, he better be elemental geared.]<br />
<br />
you probably can't beat a hybrid, or a mage, or a necro.  you can only beat stupid bards, and they are out there; thank goodness.  same with rangers.<br />
<br />
against melee, start as far away from each other as possible, so you get the spell in first.  against casters,  get as close as you can to interupt.<br />
<br />
use alchemy.  DShield and heals.  cure poison and cancel magic.  click em as needed.  cancel magic against druids and a DS for rangers and all melee.<br />
<br />
HEAL yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;jousting&quot; is a higher delay weapon, and being able to click off attack when running out of range and the skill to time atk when you are in melee range.  if you stand toe to toe with any melee/hybrid class you will lose.<br />
<br />
if you can lower resists to get blind to stick, you have em.  99% of blue server pvp is not equiped to seeing a black screen.  (on pvp servers we keep gate memmed and spam it when blind)<br />
<br />
Malos, Malo, Blind.  then if you can get a blind, dot.  IF you live that long.<br />
<br />
i looked at your magelo.  a wiz or mage can take you with one crit.  (me too)  an SK can melee us for a few rounds and then the HT drops us.  Pallys are the bitch because you have to kill them twice.<br />
<br />
after you cannot land blind, run.  unless you have the troll snare neck.  i carry root clickes for duels, but not worth it.<br />
<br />
position the pet between you and the ranger, so the arrows hit the pet.  better yet, ,grow the pet and shrink yourself.  pet will be snared, but use it as an arrow block.<br />
<br />
use alchemy against the druids, and necro dots.  cure and cancel magic.  save the mana.  HEAL yourself.<br />
<br />
also, i looked at the magelo.  your standard resists suk. lose the rings, the wrists, the face, the cloak.  and get a pvp weapon that is decent, a interupt or stun effect or knock back or something.<br />
<br />
now lets look at it.   we are hard to kill and take a half hour to kill good stuff.  we heal ourselves and kill stuff over time.  if you can't survive the time, you will not win.<br />
<br />
40 on Vallon, 52 on Sullon and now 65 on Prexus.  if you thing the high end player versus environment sucks for shaman, it is worse in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree with almost all of the replies here. Maybe its because of the people I have been fighting, hard to say.. <br />
<br />
Melee's will kick yer arse for one simple reason: they will resist your spells and laugh as they beat you down.  (if you cant land a root to stop them, you dont have time to dot or DD either)<br />
<br />
Casters (being people you stand a chance against interrupting when it counts, *hint* - their primary DPS method) is mostly a matter of luck due to relatively low hps.<br />
<br />
My opinion for shaman /duel against a caster (not intending to give good pvp-SERVER advice, as I have little Zek server experience) is to do the following:<br />
<br />
* pet-up, haste pet (prior to duelling)<br />
*malo (malos or not, cast this first, it may be the only spell you land)<br />
(*)Malos<br />
* Spirit Call (immediately after malo, dont have it? Bend over...)<br />
* Dispell<br />
* waste NO mana, cast NO dots. Epic and JBB only. (dont have either, bend over...)<br />
<br />
Use your mana to Q yourself. Outlasting is your best bet. Pets will be a pain to a caster once you spirit call (immediately), giving you time to click epic. Dont waste your mana on dmg. use it for Q and a quick tnargs when needed. JBB and epic and your pet are enough in most cases.<br />
<br />
* If the caster you are fighting finishes a spirit call (or their equivalent) before you, duck outta yours and run around (clicky sow boots right?) til their pets are gone, then finish your SP.<br />
<br />
You arent meant to deal damage. You are meant to live...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Geez, thanks for the info, guys.  But from the looks of it, I'm probably screwed for now as far as PvP goes. :P I still get to say that I owned the 65 BST I dueled the other night. :D Yar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have 500 to all resists during the entire duel and I have hardly ever resisted spear, and poison rain AE isn't resisted much either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have 500 to all resists during the entire duel and I have hardly ever resisted spear, and poison rain AE isn't resisted much either....<br />
<br />
and I have under 100 poison resist and constantly resist spear and tears... /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you're casting root or blind in a duel, then either<br />
<br />
1) you're a lowbie, which usually means<br />
2) you're fighting somebody with crap resists or<br />
3) you don't know how to duel/pvp<br />
<br />
but it's usually in that order...<br />
<br />
with magic being the prime resist in pvp, casting any non lure detrimental magic based spell (except for cancel magic and snare) is a waste of time, mana, and effort.<br />
<br />
to answer your question though, it kinda depends.  you're seeing a variety of opinions in this one post mainly because of variances in gear/aa, skill, and personal experience.  pre 50, we are the strongest pvp class in the game, even with the influx of new gear.  after that point however, our relative power begins to significantly decline.  since our nukes and dots spells have no negative resist component to them, and malos is not significant enough when dueling vex thal + geared folks, you will find it extremely difficult to actually kill your opponent.  if they're not geared in such a way, and you have decent gear and aa, it will still be a war of attrition so be prepared for the long haul.<br />
<br />
your tactics will vary depending upon your opponent's experience and skill, class, and gear/aa.  but if you expect to last in the arena, you first need to get your magic resist above a base of 150.  150 is the magic number.  it used to be 100, but after they changed resists around on blue servers, the base seemed to change.  after buffing, you should have close to 200 svm.</div></div><hr />
