<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wrote this up for my guild, but I think it would be other people had access to it as well.  Might want to sticky this in that other forum?<br />
<br />
Please post any modifications I should make and I'll edit, though I'm 99% sure this info is all correct.<br />
<br />
If you think you should be able to zone into Tower of Sol Ro, the Elemenal Planes of Air/Water/Earth, or the Plane of Fire, but you can't, try this:<br />
<br />
First, make sure you have all of the following completed to enter Tower of Solusek Ro:<br />
Grummus kill, Carpin Cycle (/key will show key to lower depths of lxanthom or something like that), Bertox kill<br />
Hedge Trial, Terris Thule kill, Keeper of Sorrows kill, Saryrn kill<br />
Manaetic Behemonth kill, Tallon Zek kill, Vallon Zek kill<br />
Plane of Justice Trial (any), Aerin'Dar kill*, Dragon Trial, Princess Trial, Villagers Trial, Mithanial Marr kill<br />
* you can skip AD kill and still get ele plane flagged, but you need to be raided into HohoB under 85% rule to do so. Just get AD flag anyway because being raided into HohoB is a pain.<br />
<br />
To be able to enter the Planes of Earth/Air/Water you need all of the above flags, Askr the Lost's key quest into BoT, and Agnarr kill, as well as Rallos Zek kill.<br />
To be able to enter the Plane of Fire, you need to have the 3 Ele Planes flag, and get Sol Ro kill.<br />
To be able to enter Sol Ro's chamber, you need the 3 Ele Planes flag, plus all 5 minis in Sol Ro, though it's possible to skip the minis by being raided into Sol Ro's chamber under the 85% rule (get all 5 minis anyway because raiding people into Sol Ro's chamber is a pain)<br />
<br />
So you have all the kills, and you still can't get in!<br />
This is what you do to fix up your flags (get a Sow because you are going to be running around like a madman)<br />
<br />
To fix up the Bertox series of flags:<br />
1. Go to Adler Fuirstel outside of the PoD<br />
2. Hail him<br />
3. Say &quot;what ward&quot; to get a character flag<br />
4. Go to the Seer in Pok and unlock memories<br />
5. Go to Adler Fuirstel again<br />
6. Hail him<br />
7. Go to the sick room in potranq<br />
8. Find Elder Fuirstel lying on the ground all alone in there<br />
9. Hail him and get a character flag<br />
10. Hit the Seer with an unlock memories<br />
11. Find Elder Fuirstel again and hail him and get a character flag<br />
12. If he says &quot;welcome back friend.....blah blah blah&quot; you have your full Bertox Flag<br />
<br />
To fix up your Saryrn flag:<br />
1. Find Adroha in the sick room in potranq sitting next to Elder Poxbourne<br />
2. Hail her<br />
3. Say &quot;tortured by nightmares&quot; and get a character flag<br />
4. Hit the Seer and unlock memories<br />
5. Find Elder Poxbourne and hail him to get a character flag<br />
6. Find Fahlia in the sick room sitting next to another sick dude.<br />
7. Hail her<br />
8. Say &quot;what plane of torment&quot; and &quot;i will go&quot; to get a character flag<br />
9. Hit the Seer and unlock memories<br />
10. You should have full Saryrn flag now<br />
<br />
To fix up your PoTactics flag:<br />
1. You need someone to let you into the factory in PoI if you don't have the flag to open the door. (the flag comes from the dragon in zone. It's unnecessary for anything except opening the door for the entire raid in PoI)<br />
2. Hail the gnome you see there and say &quot;i will test the machine&quot; to get a character flag<br />
3. Hit the Seer and unlock memories to get access to Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
To properly get your PoJ trial flag:<br />
1. Find Mavuin in PoJ<br />
2. hail him<br />
3. uh....read what he says and say the [bracketed] words to get a character flag<br />
4. Head to the Tribunal in the middle east side of the Trial area<br />
5. Hail him<br />
6. say &quot;i will plead mavuin's case&quot; (SPELLING COUNTS. NO PARTIAL CREDIT FOR TYPING PART OF IT WRONG)<br />
7. Head back down to Mavuin<br />
8. Hail him and get a character flag<br />
<br />
To get your preflag for the Plane of Fire:<br />
1. go to the red drake outside of PoF<br />
2. hail him<br />
3. Follow his [bracketed] text until he gives you a character flag<br />
<br />
To properly get your Tower of Sol Ro flag:<br />
1. get all your above flags fixed up first<br />
2. Get a levitate. If you don't, get a cleric to stand next to the bottom of the elevator in PoK because there's a good chance you will fall for 20000 points of damage.<br />
3. Hit the seer and unlock memories<br />
4. Go up the elevator in the library<br />
5. Hail the Grand Librarian Maelin. say &quot;what lore&quot;. say &quot;i have new information&quot;<br />
6. Hit the seer and unlock memories<br />
7. Go up the elevator in the library<br />
8. Hail the Grand Librarian Maelin. say &quot;what lore&quot;. say &quot;i have new information&quot;<br />
9. Hit the seer and unlock memories<br />
10. Go up the elevator in the library<br />
11. Hail the Grand Librarian Maelin. say &quot;what lore&quot;. say &quot;i have new information&quot;<br />
12. I'm not exactly sure how many times you have to do this, but it's at least about 2 or 3 or 4 times.<br />
13. You can stop this cycle of visiting the grand librarian when he says something about gathering some stuff from the elemental planes to power a machine to take you to the plane of time to rescue Zebuxoruk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just recently finished up the Sol Ro entrance myself, and I only had to see the Librarian once. I had never talked to him before.<br />
You hail him, you get a flag.<br />
You say What Lore, you get a flag.<br />
You say What Information, you get a flag.  <br />
<br />
Only need to do it the one time, but you DO have to have unlocked all your memories prior to seeing him.<br />
<br />
Edit: The part most people forget is that they need to Unlock Memories more then once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry to bump a year + old thread, but i'm desparate:<br />
<br />
I have killed TZ<br />
I have killed VZ<br />
<br />
I have properly completed Bertox chain, Saryrn chain, and MM chain.<br />
I had the message &quot;The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.&quot; and &quot;The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend&quot;<br />
<br />
I went to the seer, did the &quot;unlock memories&quot; thing a bajillion times<br />
I went to the librarian and hailed, got flag, said &quot;new lore&quot; and &quot;I have new information&quot; got flag.<br />
<br />
Went to seer, did unlock memories.  Now I only have &quot;The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend&quot;.  No mention of Vallon.  I have rinsed/repeated Seer + Librarian 50 bajillion times.  No flags, no new messages on unlock, nothing.<br />
<br />
This is the only thing I need for SRT access.<br />
<br />
I've /bugged this /petitioned it, and emailed sony at their designated email address.  Is there anything else I need to do?  Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thorzek, do this:<br />
turn on your log<br />
visit the seer<br />
do an unlock memories<br />
do a guided meditation<br />
post the results here<br />
we can figure out what you are missing.<br />
<br />
here's some key things I want you to do as well, just to make 100% sure you are fixed up:<br />
<br />
Find Elder Fuirstel, hail him, verify you get a character flag and he says  &quot;welcome back friend.....blah blah blah&quot;.  This is Grummus/Bertox flag completion.<br />
<br />
Find Fahlia, hail her, say &quot;i will go&quot;, verify you get a character flag.  This is Saryrn preflag.  You are absolutely 100% sure you did the hail after killing the Keeper of Sorrows in PoSuck, before you did the hail after killing Saryrn?<br />
<br />
You've done the prehail of the gnome in PoI and said &quot;I will test the machine&quot; for preflag for MB?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a checklist of flags you need:<br />
-Grummus ---&gt; Carpin Cycle (key to lower depths of lxanthom or something) ---&gt; Bertoxulous<br />
-Hedge Trial ---&gt; Terris Thule ---&gt; Keeper of Sorrow ---&gt; Saryrn<br />
-any PoJ trial ---&gt; Aerin'Dar ---&gt; Villager, Princess, Dragon HOHO trials ---&gt; Lord Mithaniel Marr<br />
-any PoJ trial ---&gt; Askr's quest for BoT access ---&gt; Agnarr kill<br />
-Manaetic Behemoth ---&gt; TZ + VZ ---&gt; Rallos Zek the Warlord<br />
<br />
Do you have all these kills completed?  (AD can be skipped, but you still want that flag anyway for completeness and maxed out charm and the free AA)</div></div><hr />

The History translated for you reveals the fate of<br />

MM / Agnar completed, said &quot;new lore&quot; to Maelin in the library. Do not have RZ.<br />
<br />
The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms<br />
for a brief moment then fades.<br />
Completed Saryrn and MM flag lines and hailed librarian (Grummus, TT, Bertoxx, KoS, Saryrn, HoH trials, MM, and all preflagging). <br />
<br />
You have completed all of Honor's Trials.<br />
All 3 hoho trials done (duh).<br />
<br />
You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself<br />
honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
Killed AD in PoV (duh).<br />

Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before<br />

Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should<br />
seek, could be quite useful.<br />
You've done a PoJ trial.<br />
<br />
Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
You've killed KoS and hailed Tylis afterwards (Sayrn preflag in posuck)<br />
<br />
Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is<br />
forever in your debt.<br />
Terris thule dead.<br />
<br />
Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever<br />
in your debt.<br />
Bertox dead.<br />
<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to<br />
the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your<br />
might.<br />
Grummus dead (duh).<br />
<br />
The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a<br />
language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
You've killed TZ (duh).<br />
<br />
You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to<br />
the right on the bottommost rivet should open the<br />
door'.<br />
You've killed the dragon in PoI for factory access (not necessary, but useful).<br />
<br />
I have also killed Vallon Zek.  Visiting the librarian cleared the message &quot;The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.&quot;, and should have cleared the Tallong one too.  I've gone back over 20 times to librarians/seer doing the &quot;what information&quot; &quot;unlock memories&quot; cycle.  Nothing is working.<br />
Grummus &amp; Bertox are done<br />
Hedge &amp; Terris Thule &amp; KoS and Saryrn are done<br />
PoJ &amp; AD &amp; all 3 hoho trials &amp; MM are done<br />
From what I can tell, you have issue with either MB flag completion, or possible BoT key.<br />
<br />
Lets try fixing it:<br />
1.  type /key<br />
Do you have BoT key on your keyring?  I think it's called the Talisman of Thunderous Foyer, but I'm not positive.  You have to do Askr's quest in Storms before you get full credit from Agnarr.<br />
<br />
2.  have you killed MB?  I think you have from the flag list (though it's not mentioned) because of the way it's telling you that you've killed TZ.<br />
<br />
3.  have you killed VZ for sure?  When it says &quot;The pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.&quot; that means you have TZ dead as well as MM/Saryrn chain preflags done.  I don't see &quot;The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.&quot; appearing in your flag list.  This is telling me you haven't done VZ yet, or you screwed up on the final hail, or EQ screwed up on it or something.  The librarian won't just &quot;clear&quot; your VZ flag message.  He'd get rid of both the VZ and TZ flags.  If you've done both VZ and TZ, your flags for them should say the same thing, or have neither mentioned.<br />
<br />
4.  You are missing rallos zek flag, correct?  I see no mention of it anywhere in your flag list.<br />
<br />
5.  if you are 100% sure you've killed VZ and got the flag, and MB, and BoT, then do this:<br />
a)  bind affinity at the seer<br />
b)  go to the seer<br />
c)  unlock memories<br />
d)  go up the elevator in pok to the librarian<br />
e)  target the librarian<br />
f)  hail the librarian (keeping him targetted)<br />
g)  say &quot;what lore&quot; (keeping him targetted)<br />
h)  say &quot;i have new information&quot; (keeping him targetted)<br />
i)  gate back to the seer<br />
j)  unlock memories<br />
k)  go up the elevator in pok to the librarian<br />
l)  target the librarian<br />
m)  hail the librarian (keeping him targetted)<br />
n)  say &quot;what lore&quot; (keeping him targetted)<br />
o)  say &quot;i have new information&quot; (keeping him targetted)<br />
p)  gate back to the seer<br />
q)  unlock memories<br />
r)  try running to Sol Ro Tower and see if you can zone in<br />
s)  try running to the Plane of Earth and see if you can zone in<br />
<br />
Do all these *exactly* as I indicated above.<br />
If you can zone into PoE you have all your flags fixed.<br />
If you can zone into Sol Ro but not PoE, then you are missing RZtW flag.<br />
If you can't zone in to Sol Ro, you are missing a preflag kill.<br />
If you can't zone in to Sol Ro, do a guided meditation, and unlock memories and post *both* results here again.</div></div><hr />
