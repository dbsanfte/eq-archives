<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alot of other games hand out other classes spells to other classes.<br />
How about after  you hit 65 or so, and so many aa's you can memorize another classes spell up to lvl 30 or so. Yes I know many people would scream class balance, maybe it would help a tiny bit probably not. I am sure some spells would have to be exluded like FD spell and invinceble type spells(divine aura) just for example. Others might need modification, like our 29 slow would be 50% at 65, maybe make it the min of 35%. By the time your 65+ most of the 30 and less spells will be trivial, but nice to have such as being able to port, snare, 30%rez, maybe crowd controll(but probably not)<br />
<br />
What class set of spells would you guys?<br />
If you choose a cleric you can rez, and they can summon a hammer for dog dog.<br />
Druid you could snare and port around if you wanted to.<br />
Yes crazy idea, but it would be pretty cool eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Snare<br />
Feign Death<br />
Divine Aura<br />
Tashani<br />
Tagar's Insects<br />
Summon: Coldstone<br />
<br />
How about no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want FD and snare and group heals :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately, that would be very unbalancing :\<br />
<br />
Snare, Harmony, Cleric Heals, SoW, Sham's lower Insect line, Harvest, Breeze, Illusions...<br />
<br />
The list goes on and on.  It's a fun idea, but would unravel the balance fabric as we know it to a good extent.  There are just too many low level spells that have use in the high game.  Sorry, we don't need a dr00d, our enc can now snare as well.  Just an example :(  There are just too many ROLE defining spells below that level.  It would be the equivilent of giving shaman a snare AA or giving druids a slow AA.  They already give enough role defining spells out to other classes, heck, the list of slowers is growing, and I'm surprised they haven't given Berserkers a summonable throwing weapon that procs a 50 percent slow yet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in a MMORPG, fun takes a backseat to balance.  In a single player DnD campaign, go ahead and multiclass your character all you want, but in EQ, the closest you'll come is with Hybrid classes, and heck, if you pick the right one (/cough beastlord /cough) you'll even get additional spells your parent casters don't!<br />
<br />
Also, at high game, most people who raid daily care more about 733t stats than they do fun.  Why pick a guy for a group that plays for fun, roleplaying a tribal Shaman, when you can pick 733t $|\|0b Cl3r|c 023 with ubar heals, fine nukes, l33t sony love, and an attitude to boot?<br />

No room for the roleplayer when you got the above classes pushing the limits of effectiveness in one area.  People love to brag about high effectiveness, not high numbers of areas in which they can perform.  But I'm getting off topic now, so I'll shut up :)</div></div><hr />
