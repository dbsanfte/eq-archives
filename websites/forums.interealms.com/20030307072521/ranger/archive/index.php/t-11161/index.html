<br />
Now for the strategy...<br />
<br />
NEEDED:<br />
There are 3 things needed before tackling this mob. <br />
<br />
First you must make sure that the Dark Masters are chanting. You will know this when you see the zonewide message stating that the Masters begin chanting for the coming of Doom.<br />
Second, you must make sure that you have between 25 - 35 people willing to take down this mob.<br />
Third, make sure that you have at least 4 clerics to set up chain heal rotation for the MT.<br />
<br />
BEFORE THE RAID:<br />
Set channel for the raid itself and make sure everyone is in it.<br />
Set up a group leader/raid leader channel to ensure communication between teams.<br />
Make sure that your MT and ST is in a group with the highest lvl cleric.<br />
Raid leader MUST discuss loot distribution BEFORE the raid begins. Make sure everyone understands how loot is distributed.<br />
Make sure that each class knows their responsibility during the raid. Everyone Buffs Each Other.<br />
<br />
Cleric - Chain Heal team must keep MT Targeted and make sure that ST is targeted if MT goes down. Set up Chain Heal with 7 sec interval due to Doomshade flurries. Outside of that, provide tanks with HP buffs. Provide rezzes. A clerics job is very important in this kill.<br />
<br />
Enchanter - Provide C3 to casters. Ensure during the fight to debuff and stun Doomshade as much as possible. Mezz any adds that may come during the pulling.<br />
<br />
Wizards - Provide Full power Nukes at 30%.<br />
<br />
Necromancer - Attempt to use undead spells against Doomshade. Use Pets to help tank. Also provide mana dump to clerics.<br />
<br />
Magicians - Provide Mod Rods in a designated area given by the raid leader. Provide pet for attack as well.If you have mana left at 30%, help the wizards by providing nukes.<br />
<br />
Druids - Provide druid buffs to all tanks. During the battle, spot heal your group.<br />
<br />
Rangers - Max melee attack. Ensure that you use jolt throughout the battle.<br />
<br />
Warriors - Highest AC/HP warrior will be set as the MT. ST will be the next highest. Make sure that MT and ST uses disciplines accordingly.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight - Max Melee attack. Enough said.<br />
<br />
Monk - assist in pulling Doomshade to zoneline. After engaging, use disciplines and attack.<br />
<br />
Beastlord - Provide pet in attack. Max melee attack as well.<br />
<br />
Paladins - Be careful to not gain aggro by hitting with epics to not cause aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pulling: <br />
<br />
This job is usually done with a monk, but can be done by a ranger or necro. When starting the raid, clear out all of the Moktors from the tunnel entrance to the Dark Assassin area. Once that is complete, then move to the Dark Assassin area. Notice that you have Dark Assassins in the front. Take those out first. Once that is complete, go back to the Dark Assassin area and FD. Once you FD, notice that the Dark Assassins move from the left side to the right side on occassion. They leave one side open to pull from at all times. Before pulling the Dark Masters, be sure to let the raid leader know you are ready to pull the Dark Masters. Once you pull the first Dark Master, you have 20 minutes to pull the rest. Begin pulling from the side that is open. Pull the Dark Master in the front first. Once he is down, pull the left and right one at same time. After those two, pull the last Dark Master. <br />
<br />
Engaging Doomshade:<br />
Once all the Dark Masters are killed, you have 2-3 minutes to buff, med, and pray. During this time, there is potential for respawn at entrance of the tunnel. Take out the moktors that respawn first. This will keep Doomshade from pulling them with her on the attack. Due to Doomshade possibly snaring the monk, a ranger is preferred to pull Doomshade. Before pulling, MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS READY. Once raid leader says pull, the ranger will superior camo up. The ranger will get in position and shoot and arrow at Doomshade. Once she is hit, pull her to the entrance to the tunnel. When Doomshade is at the tunnel, she will most likely follow a pathing routine to get inside the attack area. Once she is in attack area, the MT will engage only! Once MT has been fighting for 30 sec, then the ST will engage. 15 secs later, the MT will shout for everyone to engage. All tank classes will then surround Doomshade at max melee range and commence attacking. Clerics maintain your CH on MT and ST appropriately. All other classes, provide support as mentioned above. NOTE - If Doomshade moves into a wall, everyone stop attacking and let MT pull Doomshade away from wall! If this is not done, Doomshade will either A) Fall under the zone and start summoning people, or B) she will gate back to her spawning point and start summoning people there.<br />
Throughout the attack, mod rods will be in place in a designated place for casters. Also, if there is an epic cleric available and the MT or ST goes down, battle rez them and get them back up. If both the MT and ST go down and Doomshade is 50% or more hp, EVERYONE zone out and try again. Once she is at 30% health, ALL CASTERS except for the clerics will provide maximum nuke damage.<br />
<br />
If everything goes as it should, you have just taken out one of the high end mobs of the game. Doomshade has been known to drop up to 4 rare spells each time she is taken out. i.e. - Blessing of Aegolism being one of the spells. Other loot dropped by Doomshade can be found at <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice guide Soloed him last night with my Ranger LOL JK<br />
<br />
but i could solo him if i was main tnaka nd had like 30 cleric doing the CH rotation on me at about .2 second interval sure it would be a 1+ hour fight but hey who cares LOL as logn as they aint in my grop i soloed it Woot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very nice guide will use when m guild able to do this i think they are but hey!! thanks ALOT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On pulling:<br />
<br />
There is a much easier way to bring him into camp. Have a monk pull him then FD at the end of the tunnel. Make sure everyone is lined up against the wall so that doom doesn't agro pre maturely. Doomshade has no set pathing. She will stay whenever she is pulled to (this also means she camps corses should your raid fail). Now, knowing this, all you have to due is have the monk FD and wait for all the adds to path back to their spawn point. Eventually, Doomshade will be standing there all alone. Now, have your MT tag Doom with arrow and start the rotation while Doomshade is running towards the MT. 7 seconds is way too long. Doomshade quads for 420 + flurries and cannot be slowed. His damage output is almost as high as Vindicator due to the constant flurries. Supposing you have a 6khp tank I would recommend a 5s rotation or 3s without defensive. Have all your rangers/druids/paladins/shamans casting fast heals while the rotation starts. If they fail to do this then the first couple clerics to land a CH will die due to heal agro. This goes for any CH rotation strat.<br />
<br />
On debuffing:<br />
<br />
Doomshade cannot be slowed so die trying. You must CRIPPLE doomshade. This will reduce the flurries.<br />
<br />
On drops:<br />
<br />
Doomshade will always drop:<br />
<br />
- 1 Umbral stat bracelet (ie: bracelet of strength, fortitude, etc...)<br />
- 2 weapons for the radir/tawro loot tables<br />
- 1 unique drop (haste earring, bow, ft3 hat, or ft2 arms)<br />
- 2-3 spells<br />
<br />
Therefore, probably that Bow of Doom will drop on any particular kill is 25%.<br />
<br />
On spawning/despawning:<br />
<br />
Dark Masters will chant once per three hours when Doom is spawnable. If you spawn Doom, you have 2 hours to kill her before she despawns. If she despawns, you have to wait 3+ days for Masters to start chanting again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how do you spawn doom?<br />
<br />
<br />
... i always thought doomshade was just a mob that poped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tananthalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You must kill all 4 dark masters to spawn Doom.  And you must kill all  4 quickly, there must be time for Doom to pop (about 1-2minutes) before the 1st of the masters you killed pops again.  I am not positive but I believe I have seen Doom pop at the same time that the first of the Masters we had killed re-pop'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uenolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye you can use a monk to keep doomshade at the tunnel ent, this is the method we use.  We also push her up and down the left wall when facing out of the tunnel, not int eh tunnel mind you.<br />
We flip as required to keep teh rogues BSing.  All melee hit their offensive disc at 20% or so, watch enrage cause that will kill you quick.  Cycle attacks and jolt at random times to keep from stealing agro.</div></div><hr />
