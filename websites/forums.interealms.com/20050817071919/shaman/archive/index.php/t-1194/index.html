<br />
Currently we dont have any shaman in my guild that has Malo -- is there any way to stick a normal shaman slow on the entry level ToV HoT mobs without it? We've gone a couple times and have been forced to use the plague of insects spell instead.  We do have a bard with OOS but doesnt seem to help from what I can tell.  On side note I've killed upwards of 70 skyfire guardian wurms trying to get a copy of Malo in guild without luck.... any suggestions on that front appreciated as well thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know that it will be impossible to land but it will be exceeding difficult in most cases. make sure it get malosini in first to lessen your aggro. the chanter will need to use their strongest tash. thus tash, occlude, malosini. Also get in really close proximity to the mob when trying.  Have a mage cast mala if you can, it's a comon spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's possible, but extremely hard/rare for it to happen, so you're better off using poi while you've got it.  Sometimes it's still tough to land a slow with malo/tash/oos -&gt; malosini, depending on your luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've done lots and lots of HoT and i can tell you the shamans always had a hard time slowing even with Tash, Malo and occlussion. most mobs are pretty MR and require several attempts to get slowed even with full debuffs.....so Malo is pretty needed :/ but of course you can kill without slowing, just a lot more downtime and more deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We started doing HoT when I (the only Shaman) and our Enchanter were only 58, I think.  Sometimes we could get slow to land, sometimes not.  I always kept ID and PoI loaded and would use them if necessary.  Not every mob needs to be slowed, it will just make you more efficient.<br />
<br />
Have the Shaman and the Mages keep trying to land Malosini, too.  It will help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm perhaps you can just have a mage cast Mal-A if you don't have a shaman with Mal-0. If you can't find a mage with mala that is just sad hehe, I have seen mala being sold on vendors :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In general non defensive warriors don't tank those mobs when they are unslowed.  The other problem is that under level 60 warriors don't taunt HoT mobs worth a damn.<br />
<br />
We have two warriors, level 58 and 59.  Our primary tank tends to be a level 60 SK unless we know the mob is unslowable.  An SK can outtaunt  tash easily, of course he gets the piss healed out of him until the slow lands.<br />
<br />
So our strategy with or without Malo goes like this:<br />
<br />
1.  Cast Malo (you skip this step, no Malo).<br />
2.  Enchanter casts tash.<br />
2.  Chain cast Malosini until it sticks.  <br />
3.  Then cast slow.<br />
<br />
Between the enchanter and I casting slow the mob gets slowed pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
I think the real key is having a class that can taunt, my regular group has never had a level 60 warrior to work with, so I can't comment on their ability to taunt mobs off of debuffers.<br />
<br />
With that strategy it has been quite easy to do HoT with two groups.  I'm not talking about gimp camping the entryway either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mala is a good idea and with a bard to occ is just as good as tash/malo without a bard (a situation I have been in lots). I believe mala is 10 less than malo on MR and Bard OCC is around that.<br />
<br />
Vehement Wyverns = nasty when slow resists...so nice to have a couple shaman slowing. Actually most of the mobs in HoT lend themselves well to having multiple shamans slowing. Either way it also increases your chance of landing slow *quickly* and without too much worry if you get a couple resists which is my main point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xorgo Gorgonzolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have 3 60 shamans but our highest mage is 57 :(<br />
I've got 3 copies of mala in bank and at this rate may powerlevel a mage to 60 and just give up on getting malo off the guardian wurms (have gotten 4 malosini though bah!).  We're pretty casual guild so snagging the dragons is tough for us, so far we've got talendor 2x and Severilous 1x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no malo...no warlord.<br />
<br />
well you are going to have to chain cast slow regardless until it lands...even with tash and bard.<br />
<br />
you might aswell be assigned as MA because no non warlord is going to get the HOT mob off you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">slowing in HoT:<br />
<br />
dispell (white wurm cast resist magic on evetything that cross their way)<br />
malo/occlusion of sound<br />
tash<br />
malosini<br />
<br />
the slow will land easy. malosini being the only hard spell to land (can take a few cast), but at least you don't die slowing being resisted.<br />
<br />
organize a special channel where you see when the mob is tsahed/occlusioned; and drop your malosini when its the right time.<br />
since shaman stack very bad in raid we often end with 3 60 shaman with malo so we each cast one spell then we DOT :p<br />
<br />
Occlusion of sound repalces malo very well. without any of those 2, you can not slow (you can , but you wil die more often than you slow, not worth it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Xorgo,<br />
<br />
If you need someone to help you out, just give me a call with some lead time.  I can usually break away as long as we don't have anything scheduled.<br />
<br />
No Torpor yet, but I can help you in the Malo department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Again the argument that shaman stack bad...sorry don't buy it.<br />
<br />
I have been the only Shaman with slowable mobs and I have been with others...It is always easier with multiple slowers.<br />
<br />
a) Slow sticks quicker<br />
b) less deaths<br />
c) the raid doesn't fall to pieces if shaman dies on resist<br />
<br />
Not to mention the *many* other things we can do on a raid. Particularly in the case of multiple lvl 60 shamans with Torpor. They become excellent caster healers during fights...anyways I could go on an on but I won't! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, granted, I only have 3 hot raids under my belt.  And only 1 time doing slow work.  But I didnt find it that hard.<br />
<br />
First 2 trips we had a 60 casting malo and slow.  The last time 2 shaman on the raid, me and another 55 shaman.<br />
<br />
Our debuff usually consisted of mala, tash, and occlusion.  After the other shaman and I heard the last of the 3 announced, we both started trying to slow.  On about 75% of the mobs, one of us would stick slow on the first try.  Not always both of us, but at least one of us.  For the rest, all but one was slowed on the second cast by us.<br />
<br />
One mob never got slowed at all.  But of us shaman died on 3rd of 4th attempt at slowing.  After the other shaman went down, the mob had less than 50% health, and I started to give up, but had to try one more time....<br />
<br />
That was my only death of the day.  I think the other shaman died 2 times.<br />
<br />
Might have just been a fluke day for slow resists.  Since it was only 1 day, my experiences may not be the norm.  But after 8 hours of very little resists, I'm ready to go for the next time, to see if it holds true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heya Xorgo.<br />
<br />
If you can, try Gorenaire.  She drops Malo more than the other dragons.  Also, there are rumors of Malo dropping off of juggs, so you might try to do that.  If Trak isn't up, you could go try Jumpy and the Protector as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you mobs mobs slowed in HoT you need either Mala/Malo or occlusion of sound. If you have neither get your CH cycle ready. With a 60 chanter, 60 shaman with Malo, 55+ bard and a decent puller, HoT is cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gorenaire is a bit tougher than the other outdoor Kunark dragons due to that nasty slow which makes makes melee damage inefficient.  The key to Gorenaire is MR and boom boom (ie nuking wizards, mages and druids).  She either dies fast, or you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Levels really help, Xorgo. If you have a level 60 shaman without Malo, he'll still be able to slow some mobs if he has support from an enchanter and bard. <br />
<br />
Malosini will get resisted a lot, but if the shaman is persistent he could probably stick it on at least half the mobs, if not more. I usually wait til either the bard or enchanter gets their debuff in, then start casting malosini. I will cast malosini 5 times (unless it sticks), and if that doesnt work I throw 1 Turgur just to see if it lands. By then, if nothing sticks the mob is half dead or more and I just go cann/torpor mana back in the corner. If malosini sticks, I can usually get Turgur in one or two casts. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt really recommend Insidious Decay/Plague of Insects, since that combo tends to draw insane aggro (worse than malosini/turgur), and if you dont have a 60 warrior the shaman is dead and mob possibly out of position.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops, I'm a lurker again. Somehow managed to find my old login. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">without Malo/Mala it's goingto be hard, but bards can really work wonders in HoT.  Ask your bard to use their drum, and not their epic, to play occlusion for you.  They can also try and stick their slow while you are working on slowing.   If they have a tash orb, I think they can use that to stack on top of enchanter tash for a little extra debuffing, though I am not exactly sure of that.<br />
<br />
I never ever slow before Malosini lands in HoT.  We do it with one group and I am responsible for healing everyone but our warrior so I can't afford to get insane agro.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">nice to know about the white wurms casting resist magic on everything... that may help me out in the future.<br />
<br />
I've found that occ + tash + malosini can work great... but other times malosini just wont land. I think that the level of the bard makes a huge difference... when the bard was 58 I had no trouble, but when the only bard was 56 Malosini wouldn't land.<br />
<br />
Could just be the luck of the night of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, I didn't realize the white wurms were buffing up the others with resist magic.  That's an excellent argument for dispelling first.  Dispelling won't remove slows anymore btw, but it will remove Malo/Mala/Malosini. <br />
So you need someone who's really fast on the dispell, using Annul Magic.  Then you need a shaman with Malo or Mage with Mala, either works fine.  Then you need everyone who can to SINI till it lands, and then they call it in the channel you're using for calling debuffs.  Then everyone tries to slow.  If you have a bard along with ooS it makes it much much smoother, but you can do it without that bard if you have to.  Bard oos only debuffs around 16 MR, which isn't a ton, but helps.  On certain mobs, it makes a big difference.  <br />
<br />
Another angle nobody has mentioned yet.  Get the bard using a Journeyman's Walking stick.  Have the bard melee the target until tash procs.  Due to coding, spells casted (or procced) by bards stack with other spells.  So you get bard tash plus chanter tash.  If you use an Orb of Tashani on the bard, you can really make up for some serious lackage in the Malo department.  <br />
That's about the only way it makes sense to Turgur HoT mobs if you don't have Malo/a working for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Done tons of ToV raids, and never dispelled first, but that's an interesting idea.  I haven't actually cast that spell in ages -- heh, probably in years.  Does it have much aggro?<br />
<br />
The bard tash stick stacking is also pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
As to HOT without malo, it's much much harder.  It can make your chanter eat more deaths when they try to tash, too, as they will generally be casting it a few seconds earlier in the killing cycle than they would if they were waiting for malo to stick and get called out.<br />
<br />
I've died to several dragons in a row at 60 with malo and malosini in, as well as tash and bard occlusion.  Sometimes it's very rough, and the shaman dies a lot.  This is why I always insist on cleric buffs in ToV; if someone's too cheap to spend a peridot on me and would prefer me to die instead, he can get his own damn armor.<br />
<br />
I remember once another shaman in our raid was doing the slowing and maloing, before I even had 60.  He died six times in a row.  He got pissed and passed the duties to me for a while -- fairly silly, considering his superior equipment, torpor, and that his slow was much more likely to land than mine.   I was I guess in the mid 50s, and landed a couple slows right away.  Poor guy -- I woulda felt better for him if I had died right away.  However, I rectified the situation by promptly dying a few times over the next handful of pulls.<br />
<br />
You can die a lot in ToV, even with tash/occlude/malo/malosini.  Unless your puller dies on the pull, the shaman will usually be the first guy dead, and while others may not die at all in a raid or for a long time, the shaman may be a constant sacrifice to the dragon gods.  Plus, I've found chain our rarest drop by far.  Oh well!<br />
<br />
If possible, level everyone as much as you can.  It helps enormously with resists, with slows, etc.  A 60 warrior to establish and keep aggro can make your job far easier.  It can be dispiriting to die too much because you have no melees who can taunt off you once you slow.  (Or even worse, have to try slowing multiple times because it doesn't stick.)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even bother with the disease slow unless you want to die every time for just a 25% slow.  If you have a big, high-level raid going on with excellent clerics and the ability to taunt off you right away, well then, maybe.  But if situations are less than ideal, disease slows can mean very regular dying.  My hitpoints aren't that fantastic, so others can take more abuse than I can by far.  I have less than 2000 hitpoints without buffs at 60(can't even do canni 5, though I have it).  But if you don't have the equipment to get slammed around a lot more than I do when I cast disease slows, I'd stay away from them.  It can be very hard to lose that aggro; you may not have the time before dying.</div></div><hr />
