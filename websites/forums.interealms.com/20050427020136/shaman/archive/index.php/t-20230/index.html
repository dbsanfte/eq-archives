<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just recently broke into eles about a month or so ago.  I've been pushing my tradeskills really hard for aid grimel quest.  For the pottery one, you need a combine that requires three sacred waters.  These waters drop off the Valorium Guards.  I've only hunted them with a group so far, and from what I've seen, they seem kinda hard to single pull.  I was wondering if anyone has tried soloing these guys, and if they have, if anyone could share some advice on pulling them.  My biggest concern is that even if I get them solo, some of the named can't be slowed and/or can't be rooted/snared.</div></div><hr />

 I think he is saying have someone or yourself pull alll the guards and zone out then spam Hail, Johaan Landro.The rest of the guards will return to where they came from leaving just the guard you want nice and close to the ZO if things go awry.<br />

Yeah, that's the normal technique, but the mob he named is in the middle of the zone, in the big middle building with the bridges that allow you to cross over to the other side.   Just thought it an odd mob to name, usually you use that technique with the ones in the camp closer to the zone out.</div></div><hr />

The water drops from the named guys in the tent camp to the east? of the zone in. A necro friend and I did these guys to get him the water he needed. The procedure we used was,<br />
<br />
1. Target the named &quot;Sgt whatisname&quot; etc then I slap a malo on him from outside the tents area at almost max range.<br />
2a. Shaman runs screaming to zone with the entire tents guys after me. (may need to wait for the named guy to get close to zone).<br />
2b. As the named gets near to zone necro friend (or anyone) hail him repeatedly to get him to stay in one spot while the rest all go back to their spawn points.<br />
3. Shaman zones back and casts Turgurs on now singled named.<br />
4. Shaman zones to avoid agro. (these two steps are repeated until slow lands on mob)<br />
5. Shaman zones back and Necro and Shman proceed to beat down the named for the water.<br />
<br />
This was fun and the trains you pull are amazing, but safe (I think), they didnt agro on anyone including the Necro so seems like an easy way of doing it.<br />
<br />
There are 4-5 mobs in the camp that we pulled this way, <br />
1. Sergeant Johson Popoah<br />
2. Sergeant Gerrin Bakeside<br />
3. Lieutenant Aiden Finn<br />
4. Captain Ryglot Cupperhide<br />
<br />
(seems to be another sergeant in the tent are but I dont remember pullin him, name is Sergeant Sikfaun Bowah)<br />
<br />
No faction hits for killing these guys and I think they all have a chance to drop the water.<br />
Be sure you stay away from the guys at the edges of the camp while pulling and you may need to change sides of the camp to get within range, even though you cant see them in the tents Malo still hits them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I imagine that soloing them would be pretty hard, since they triple for 700-800 (the ones that drop the water), and summon. I imagine that you would run out of mana long before they are dead. Best bet is to team up with a melee. Pull with malos and make a bee line for the zone. The split is then done by your partner hailing the named. Zone back in and then either root/slow, or slow at a distance (make sure your partner is ready to grab agro right away if you do that). They are fully slowable. After that heal with Q and the odd tnargs thrown in. The amount of healing required depends on your tank of course. When I was farming the water with my shaman/warrior pair, it would take 40-60% of mana per kill (thats without VoQ or active mana recovery during the fight, other than 1 canni5 at 70% mana). If the named is not slowed, you will probably run out of mana before the fight is over.</div></div><hr />
