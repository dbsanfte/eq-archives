<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sallaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is a question for you all, would Imbued Northman Armor be much better than Totemic armor since it brings with more wisdom and AC, since we dont really need SV Disease and etc and STA and STR and etc twinks with it because we already have our buffs which raise the AC HP STR STA DEX and etc sept for WIS and INT, so wouldnt it be much better to have Imbued Northman Armor cuz it brings more WIS which = mana which = ownage!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you will find the imbued northman armor to be rarer and more expensive than totemic armor.  If this is not an issue, by all means buy it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sallaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, in your own opinion do you also think it is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Northman armor is per piece 2ac greater than banded.  This means it is 1ac less per piece than totemic.  <br />
<br />
However totemic is only visible pieces.<br />
<br />
You can also make a neck, mask, cloak, belt, mantle of the northman which makes decent gear.  The problem is this.  Mudflation.  It takes alot of time to collect the stuff to make northman armor.  Pieces should sell in the range of 250pp and up to make it worth the hassle.  However you can now get really nice items for cheap that replace even the non-visible northman pieces you would use into midlevels.<br />
<br />
If you have a smith who will do this for free or cheap it would be a nice set to last you into your 40's.  If you are spending significant money to have it made you can probably do better for the same cash.<br />
<br />
If i was to moderately twink a shaman I suppose i might go with full visible totemic and non-vis northman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No offense.<br />
<br />
I think Rygorr is better than totemic and Imbued northman.<br />
<br />
But of course  Jarcrap &gt; Rygorr, totemic, Imbued northman..<br />
<br />
Blame the mudflation.</div></div><hr />
