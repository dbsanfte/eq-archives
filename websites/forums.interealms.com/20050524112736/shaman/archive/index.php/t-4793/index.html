<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about this since we were debating over it. This is what I came up with: Our dots only have one resist it is checked for, but the DD portion is all or nothing. If a mob or player resists the DD, then we get a resist. I once thought that it checked for DD AND Dot in seperate instances, but it does not.<br />
<br />
What we need to ask Verant for is a DD that can be partially resisted, so BoN might hit for only 10 damage, but the rest of the dot portion goes along its merry way. Or we could ask for a dot like the druids.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this post is redundant and we already figured it out.</div></div><hr />
