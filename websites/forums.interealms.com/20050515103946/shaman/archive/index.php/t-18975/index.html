<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I've seen some poeple mentioning an AA canni ability, but it doesn't seem to be present on Lucy.  I saw one ability called &quot;Ancient Chaotic Pain&quot;, but if you follow the link from when it was created on 1/10 it goes directly to Ancient Chaos Breath, which appears to be an improved (slightly) Q.  The change list shows that the entry *used to be* ancient chaotic pain, but got changed.  So whats up?<br />
<br />
Can someone point me in the direction of this AA canni?  I'd be pretty interesting in seeing what its all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We are looking at this AA Canni (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Test), when referring to the new AA Canni.<br />
However, in our joy we might have been cheering too early. This could still turn out to be a craptastic spell upgrade to Canni IV instead of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very wierd -- if I click your linkk, it goes to the right place.  If I search for &quot;chaotic pain&quot;, it just takes me directly to the wrong page.  If I search for &quot;chaotic&quot;, it just doesn't appear in the list.  Must be something wierd with Lucy.  Wacky!<br />
<br />
I do hope it goes live though (either as an AA or even just as a spell).  I would obviously prefer an AA (even if it was the same or worse compared to canni IV) but even as a spell it would still be handy to have a slightly better Canni IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very unlikely it's an AA skill, it is setup exactly as an upgrade to canni4.  There's a whole thread around here somewhere dealing with it and other spell upgrades.</div></div><hr />
