<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow shamen!<br />
<br />
Well it's been a while since my last post, but I am still there:p<br />
<br />
Anyway I have now 29 AA got innate run3, regen 3, MC 3, Canna V and SC 1.<br />
<br />
So I saved up 2 AAs and wondered if I should spend those points on<br />
Radiant Cure 1, Planar Power 1 or Spellcasting Fury?<br />
Planar Power I think as I could increase Wis and Sta by 5 pts.<br />
Which would you take? Maybe a total different skill?<br />
<br />
I am playing in a elemental raiding guild and Group more than solo as Info btw:)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance brethren and sisters!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of the 3 you suggest, radiant cure all the way.  It's probably even more useful on a PvP server than I find it on a blue server ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">radiant cure definitely.  one of my  favorite aas for sure , especially since i pvp alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">radiant cure is good.<br />
<br />
I have like 49 and havnt bothered to touch planar power.. but *shrug*. Spiritcall is fun, but its usefulness is limited, same with Virulent paralysis(which gets resisted alot in pvp anyway le sigh)<br />
<br />
Its not fun but SCM3 aint bad. Healing crits are fun as are dd crits. ND is fun for the &quot;piss off the other priests with your mass of more hps then them&quot; sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say go for ND3.... it's a free 250HP's, at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You play in an elemental guild?  <br />
Get MGB.  Until you have that skill you aren't up to your raiding potential.  <br />
It's not the most fun skill to get or use, but it does benefit your guild the most of any other skill you could train.  <br />
After that, get Radiant Cure, to at least lvl 2. <br />
That will also help your guild a lot and you'll gain immediate status in your guild and appreciation from your guildies.  <br />
<br />
After that, it's totally up to you, but I'd recommend ND3 or CA3 or SCM3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Landragoran;<br />
<br />
Raiding Guild = MGB a must, 5 more pts for myself till I get it.<br />
<br />
Non Raiding Guild = Radiant Cure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">planar power is silly unless you have AAs to spare imo.  A lot of beter things than 5 more wis/sta.  RC is very good fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its Shaman, with an A! There's no E, ever, not plural, not single, not ever.  Damn people, its not that hard!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
;-) Just kidding, you can spell shaman however you want, I'm just messing with you.</div></div><hr />
