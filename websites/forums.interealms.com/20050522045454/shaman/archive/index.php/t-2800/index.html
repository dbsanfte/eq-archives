<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had posted a note earlier regarding equipment and what I could use/needed to get.<br />
<br />
I just want to thank several people Formally here on the site.<br />
<br />
First of all, Kubax. You have been undoubtedly sent from the Tribunal themselves! Thank you for your assitance, advice, equipment and friendship!<br />
<br />
Next, Malaak...You have supplied me with some things that would otherwise been many levels off! Thank you for your kindness!<br />
<br />
Ragnorakk...Thank you for taking time to travel to me within the game to talk to me and provide me with those items! Surely your kindness has been granted to you by the Gods!<br />
<br />
Dweebil...Thanks for taking the time to explain little things about the game, and for inviting me into your guild! This is rapidly becoming a very interesting game!<br />
<br />
<br />
Again...it is really neat to see people giving so freely of themselves in money, time, advice, etc...I was hesitant to start playing Everquest because I wasn't sure that I'd be able to get into a game where people have been playing for years. <br />
<br />
Thank you all!<br />
