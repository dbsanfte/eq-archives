/envy<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
I spend weeks and months, farming and trading and selling, over and over, hoping for a break to get cash... yet people who have access to solro are making hundreds of kpp selling ornate stuff.<br />
<br />
I spend weeks and months, exploring and killing and grinding, over and over, gradually getting an extra AA eventually.. yet people who have elemental access get 10 AA a day pretty easily.<br />
<br />
There's a glass ceiling in this game... and it's called being in a small casual guild of friends, meaning I need to abandon them if I want to progress any further.<br />
<br />
The only difference between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot; is our choice of friends.  The game isn't about skill or hard work-- well, yea it is to some extent, but to a larger extent, it's about who you know.  And if you're not in an &quot;uberguild&quot; you're stuck there with a false smile, listening to people show off about how much great loot and cash and xp they're getting.<br />
<br />
Man, I'm so jealous...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong-- my brother and I are by no means poor-- we've scrounged up enough to buy most of my 65 spells, and a salindrite dagger, fleshgrinder, and even a mask of tinkering and flayed barbarian skin mask.. but we've worked really long and hard to get enough cash to buy them-- and in many cases we've just been lucky to find amazing deals and hand-me-down prices.  Everyone in my guild wonders how the heck we get so much cash, and struggle to even get 1/1000th of the cash we accumulate from our adventures.  But man.. now people who have access to sol ro can take advantage of the ornate rush and make 400k in one day.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
<br />
Before you yell at me for saying something wrong, I'm just venting my frustrations.  Of course things I'm saying are inaccurate.  I'm sure the people in the uberguilds work very hard to get where they are as well.  I'm sure that if I'm in a small guild that I'm in then I really don't need those cool superitems that everyone keeps linking for what I need to accomplish.<br />
<br />
But I can be jealous can't I?<br />
<br />
..and that's the point of this thread.  To vent my /envy. :)<br />
<br />
I wonder if Sony will ever address this issue, or change their stance that you need tons of very dedicated non-casual people to get really cool stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yet people who have access to solro are making hundreds of kpp selling ornate stuff.<br />
- It's called retards who are willing to pay 80k for plate boots. Or 250k for a BP. Wait a month or 2 and prices will plumet. Hell on my server silk is selling for 6-10k already.<br />
<br />
.. yet people who have elemental access get 10 AA a day pretty easily.<br />
- You can get that in BoT easy too. Or in PoV. Just have to know the &quot;mechanics&quot; or mojo involved in it.<br />
<br />
 listening to people show off about how much great loot and cash and xp they're getting.<br />
- I am in an &quot;uberguild&quot;. I have 13k plat in my account. I have barely 110 AA. I know people not in any guild who have 400+ AA and millions in bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bro the concerns you raised are pretty common ones, and its something that forthcoming MMORPGs (not to mention the next EQ expansion) are actively trying to work around:  the issue of a casual player being able to log on for a couple hours and actually get things accomplished.<br />
<br />
I know WoW is really gearing content towards being able to make strides in a limited amount of time, instead of spending 6 hours online to make minimal gains.  The EQ devs have addressed this issue numerous times.<br />
<br />
So no it's not wrong of you to be jealous, there are lots of people who feel like you.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A fast killing group is lucky to get a single piece of ornate in an hour of hunting.<br />
I've never even been in a group long enough to actually see enough ornate to drop so each group member walks away with something.<br />
If you know how to not suck as a puller, you can get an AA in PoV in about an hour.<br />
Shut up about your woes.<br />
I've been hunting in Sol Ro exclusively for xp since the ornate patch, and I've won a might 3 items so far that have upgraded my own armor and given me a grand total of 100k pp.<br />
Don't even ask me how many backflags I've done in order to be flagged for Sol Ro.<br />
I've earned that right to see ornate drop as often as it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;I've earned that right to see ornate drop as often as it does&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the problem is not to earn it or not...<br />
<br />
I am sure he would do the same as you if his small size guild was able to do the needed flagging process...<br />
<br />
<br />
People where barking at trials for pos/pov because they were 'difficult' for some people to get flagged (at that time for some people it was)...but at least you could get flagged by one GROUP of people.<br />
<br />
casual guilds do not have the power, even if they have very good/skilled people, to do the events or kill the required monsters.<br />
<br />
They are ready to try 20 times like other guilds to find out about strategy and such things. However the problem is to have enough people to kill the encounter...<br />
<br />
and yes, hardcore gamers should have more loot, because they raid more...people always online should have more AA than others, so be more powerfull.<br />
About the content, any moron can join a raiding guild and be flagged for elemental planes...he doesn t deserve it more than a guy always online and very skilled, very appreciated, but in a guild of friends not big enough to do these events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, you make it sound so easy.  Yeah, we had elemental access almost overnight and just waltzed into our flags. :p  The reality is more like we spent many nights actively figuring out how to take the next step to get farther up the PoP ladder and afterward doing what seemed like months of mindless backflagging.  It takes commitment to a goal to advance in PoP and you need ambition to get there.  Sitting on your hands and whining when you could be recruiting or trying the events involved for ToSR is pointless.<br />
<br />
Grab a group and go kill in CoD/HoH/BoT if you want more than one AA in a day.  SOE did not hand you perfectly good exp zones so that you could stay in PoI.</div></div><hr />

You are in a fairly good position, don't knock it :)  Its natural to be envious, but also make note that your position is better than at least 50% of the Shamans I know out there!<br />

<br />
To me, this symbolic of a game design theory taken too far and become distorted.  <br />
<br />
But hey, it's the biggest game on the market.  <br />
<br />
There's a great post on the ranger forum related to this idea.  Essentially the model that that you have to be in 70 person raids to get the best loot isn't necessarily the best model - it's simply the one used now.  It's not the model used previously in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If yer content being in a go-nowhere guild and doing no real raids that would advance your character, more power to ya!  <br />
<br />
If you're envious of people who are in real guilds doing real raids and advancing their character, it may be time to drop the whole &quot;woe is me, i am stuck in a small guild with friends&quot; bit and join a raiding guild.  It's really up to you where you go in this game.  With the recent outflow of lots of people who quit EQ, spots open all the time in raiding guilds.  <br />
<br />
Good luck with your decision!</div></div><hr />

as it should, cause most of that gear pretty much sucks ( shaman gear at least ) for folks who are in raiding guilds at least. Some of the effects are ok.<br />

Pretty insulting to call us casual guys not real is no better than above where I call uber people unemployed social misfits, is it?<br />
<br />
There needs to be a balance, and for the most part, there is not. Ubers should get better stuff, but they shouldn't be greedy or spiteful.<br />

...I am willing to do it...however my guild is not big enough to do it...even if we spend years working on strategy...<br />

The only possibility for people to get flagged is to change to a guild with enough people...that means a lot to me to leave my guild. Is it worth denying me content? I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or simply tag more players into your current guild.<br />
<br />
You think those so called Uber guilds where formed on a day and being uber the next day?<br />
<br />
Besides that I have a decent amount of cash (400K or so) but who cares.<br />
Not like I need pp for anything besides some fun potions, some food/drinks and some donation money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For starters, ornate drops in BoT like candy as well.  Usually you see a pattern every hour to 90 min in the right spot, while geting an AA in about the same time. I ground out ND3 on Saturday, all 6 AA in about 9 h BoT, no stress, just decent pick-up groups.  I'm in a non-VT non elemental guild with no real plan to get there, and still managed to become decent equipped and with full spell book.  Being a powergamer helps, but even as a casual gamer you can get there.  It just takes you a bit longer RL time.  In played time you're most likely faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Celebel, you never have to leave your guild.<br />
<br />
We started with about 12 people and added a few here and there until we got about 25-30 regular people.  The guild wanted to do more and eventually take on NToV baddies so we started to think about merging with a guild we liked lots who was gutted by DAoC.  After the merger we numbered about 50 peeps and went on to add a few more and go after every challenging encounter out there.<br />
<br />
Due to some great leadership and great people we have made it through all the big encounters and into the mental planes.  NONE of this would have been possible without recruiting more people when we realized our numbers were lagging.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is there are more people out there that are playing EQ, looking for a good guild, and are like-minded than you think.  If you are lacking numbers to do game content RECRUIT, RECRUIT, RECRUIT!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There IS another option.<br />
Somehow, I managed to get so disgusted with the uber-race - what it did to my friends, the people around me, myself - that I lost all motivation to play THAT game anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm in a RP guild now that has gotten to the point of licking Tunare very easily - not sure where that puts us, don't care overmuch.  I got my first rune yesterday, and it thrilled me more than it had any right to, even if it WAS frickin feral avatar.<br />
<br />
Every time I log on, I'm at the top of MY game.  I lost the need to be at the top of THE game.  I stopped gauging my success or fun level against what other people in the game are doing.<br />
<br />
I really started listening to the people I know in these uber guilds.  &quot;Yeah, we're STILL killing the emperor, I really wish I could go to sleep&quot;, &quot;I'm so sick of farming key parts&quot;, &quot;man, these people are loot grubbling little pricks&quot;....  it goes on and on.  You can't have an uberguild without having a large percentage of soulless little dum dums who do absolutely nothing else with their time.<br />
<br />
In short?  It's not worth it.  There may be big-time guilds somewhere with nothing but good people in them, but they ain't on Xev.  I'll take good company over fat loot, thankyouverymuch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Experience in Halls of honor, Bot, Pot, and crypt of decay  are for the most part exellent if you make good use of thegroup xp bonus.

<br />
Yes there is a glass cieling for small guilds, it's part of the game. What it comes down to is choice and the need to make one. Everquest is what you make of it. If your choice is to do raid mobs and advance in pop then you join a raid guild and expect to work your arse off with late night raids, multi hour events and countless backflagging so no one gets left behind. <br />
<br />
If the people/guild you play with are more important than personal advancement and experiencing the high end game, then doing one group dungeon crawls is just as valid and probably a helluva lot more fun than doing organised raids.... And Low and behold ! An expansion chock full of nothing but dungeons is on the horizon. Don't worry about the loot, verant seems to finally be getting a reasonable understanding of risk versus reward if chardok b and veksar are any indication. Expect to see some very nice items coming out of those dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you have no goals left to achieve, then this game becomes a glorified chat room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm in an elemental guild, I had over 150AA before we got there.  I had exactly 8AA when POP came out.  I probably got over 100 of those in valor.  Join a pickup group, shut up, and get over yourself.  I have a grand total of about 30k, lots of people in my guild have less than 5k.  I guess that's cause we aren't selling ornate, we're either trading it for pieces we want or giving it to our friends.  <br />
<br />
If you people stop paying stupid prices ornate will come down, unlike torpor/malo it's dropping a lot.</div></div><hr />

Good call. It is all relative anyway really, I can have as much fun screwing around in guk when it is too high level for me as doing any of the uber stuff, uber stuff just takes longer and more people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I lead a small guild on E marr.  Drowned Legion. On avrage we have maybe 12 people on line. Some of those are hot boxes. Normally we have two total clerics. On a busy night we can have up to 24 or even 28 on line.<br />
<br />
We are never going to get anywhere. I even had a RL ex friend tell me one day. You are stuck in the same place you were a year ago. doing **** encounters with your **** guild and will never amount to anything in the game.<br />
<br />
I laughed in his face. <br />
<br />
When I log on. I can see a target up and can have the people we have on come and we can go try and kill it. Or we can xp. And have fun. Or we can do gamesweeps for the tradeskillers.  Or we can solo. Or whatever. (Oh and 98% of the guild is flagged for Tactics now)<br />
<br />
If I want to get people to go drop a big mob. Well there are other small guilds out there. I could start talking to them. Get an alliance formed and do the bigger mobs. It isnt a question of ability. It is a question of drive motavation and desire. You know what a 100K item is? 30 more hps. Or such. It is a whopping 2% better item than what you are wearing. It is a half second differeance tween living or dying..<br />
<br />
One of the best equipped shaman in the game is the Elder Chukzombie. An old school player. He has been around since Jump. He has seen and done damn near everything in the game. I don't envy him his gear or what he has seen. I don't envy him all the headaches he has had to go through either. (Most uber guilds are HARDER to play in than a casual guild) More egos more greed. More people. More problems. More broken encounters. The whole point of the game is to have fun. And As a GM in many a pen and paper Game I learned a long time ago. no matter how uber you become. No matter how powerful a player is No matter what they have. <br />
<br />
There is always something stronger. Better. Able to kick thier ass.<br />
<br />
I have taken out things that were flat out impossible. That I knew I was gonna die leading my friends to. And we won. (And on many we have died as well) How is that different than killing Quarm. ?<br />
<br />
The reward to me is the same. the memories of a challange overcame. Of teamwork and friendship and tactics and a little bit of luck all combined to overcome an obstical. And it doesnt matter if it is that Grizzly bear at level 5 than me and some friends killed Way way way back in the day when Runnyeye was a death sentance, or the biggest most anal encounters in the game. <br />
<br />
Folks, I know most will simply not care. But all the loot in the world is not going to be anything but the carrot. And if you keep chasing the carrot like it is the holy grail all that can make you is an ass. (Or donkey I should say) <br />
<br />
Play the game as entertainment. Sure it is engrossing entertainment. But when people are so caught up in the carrot, the never seem to realize what or who they hurt in thier rampage to get the next peice. <br />
<br />
Just have some fun. Make a friend. Make an enemy. Go see something new. Go back and kill Tovax Vmar in Q hills. (Kill him an extra time for me &lt;Spits&gt;) Just remember one simple thing. At the end of the day, If it is the sleeper you just killed at level 65 with the best gear in the game and 5 hps left. Or the red con kodiak at level 5 with most slots empty and 1 hp left, both of those people are the same. The scale is different and the image. And the loot. but if you are in the right frame of mind. The memories will be the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Snoww Silverhammer -  Amen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just came back to EQ after 8 months off.  I used to care about chasing loot, levels, and AA and the shamans ahead of me in my guild... a lot.  Too much.  I got sick of chasing the carrot and left the game.  I got burned out by trying so hard... I began to hate the game. <br />
<br />
I got bored of the other games on the market and came back.  I won't catch the shamans ahead of me in my guild, and I don't care.  I'm just running around the new zones I haven't seen yet... checking out the Nurga/Droga revamps, went to PoS for the first time last night (I &quot;quit&quot; shortly after PoP was released), also going to check out Veksar and the LoY zones I haven't seen.  I stopped watching my exp bar so much and drooling over that 20hp upgrade in the bazaar that would cost me plat I really don't have.  I'm finally having fun again in this game, because I just don't care about the carrot like I used to.<br />
<br />
I agree with Snoww.  I made a newbie monk, untwinked, levelled up to 14 or so, was soloing around and got an add.  Won the fight with 2hp left.  It was as exciting as my toughest raids, maybe moreso.  Exploring Nurga... I pulled an SK mob, slow resisted, HT for 700-ish, getting pounded, an add comes almost immediately, (wizard mob) and nukes me for over 1000, that's a good chunk for my &lt;3k self-buffed hp when starting a fight at 80%.  But I pulled it out and it was fun.  My reward was a whopping 10pp or so and a salt.  But I was happy.<br />
<br />
In 8 months off I got something far more valuable than a buttload of AAs and phat lewt.  I got my perspective back.  Uber envy = teh suqx and it'll make you crazy if you let it.  Play and have fun.  The rest will come.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the longish rant. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I ran into this, myself.  I had spent about a year with a guild, raided, contributed and worked my way through a portion of the game.  I left the guild and after milking as much enjoyment as possible out of a brief solo career, I found myself bored, jealous and frustrated.  Bottom line, though, is that you are not going to see the big game unless you ditch the &quot;family guild&quot; and join up with a high-end guild.  You've got to realize and accept it.  There are a lot of ways to play EQ now, some suit others better than others.  If you play to hang with friends, getting access to uber content isn't going to give you your fix.  <br />
<br />
O.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've played in both several small guilds and an uberguild.   I always hated the seperation EQ put on people (I won't say forced, you can always choose to recruit for an uberguild, or leave an uberguild for smaller guilds).<br />
<br />
These are just my opinions, and right or wrong, there are also exceptions to every rule.   Not every guild thinks or behaves the same.  I know this.<br />
<br />
It's very hard to blend the two.  If you're in an raiding guild, chances are they want you to raid... especially if you're a key class, like a cleric for example.  If you take 50% of your time off to just go xp with your friends or just hang with small guilds... they probably won't like you.  I mean during prime raid times.     Your guild says &quot;Everyone lets go, we're killing 'ubermob'&quot; and you say &quot;Nah, I'm crawling nurga&quot; ... that doesn't always go over well.  Sure, sometimes you have to have your own life or take a night off... but if you do that a lot... they'll probably question why you're bothering to be in a hardcore raiding guild.<br />
<br />
The reverse is partially true... in non-raiding guilds... if you run around and find a mob up that you think your guild can kill, or think you can at least give a good go at and learn something... people aren't acustomed to jumping at the first sign of a mob, or racing another guild.  It can take real time and real effort to get the needed resources to try.  And even then, odds are a 'raiding guild in training' or even a raiding guild will beat you to it.<br />
<br />
Rhag 1 and 2 are examples that come to mind... nice lower level raid targets... trivial for any seasoned raiding guild... yet often killed... sometimes just for the chance to get Remove Greater Curse.<br />
<br />
The suggestion that a small guild just recruit more people and build towards being a raiding guild (even just a small one, or eventually an uber one) isn't really valid.    I mean, that's how it works... you start with something and you learn and grow... how far you go is mostly determined by the people you get and who is leading them.     But the simple fact is that all small guilds don't want to be raiding guilds.   Sure, they wish they could kill some mobs here and there... but if they wanted to be in a raiding guild, they'd go try one.<br />
<br />
Talent is widly spread around in EQ... you'll find some of the nicest, highly skilled, and smart people in small, more social like guilds.    They could easily get into a high level guild if they wanted to... but some either have no desire to do so, or have been there and don't want to go back... are happy with where they are.<br />
<br />
And I guess that's what it's all about... being happy with where you are.  If you're just not happy... if you need loot and high end raid challenges to be happy... try out for an uber guild... if you're happy grabbing a group and crawling Nurga... more power to you.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem in EQ, is that it makes you choose between the two.   I think it's very hard to do both... chill and be social, and raid.  The reason is pretty simple, raiding takes a lot of time and effort.<br />
<br />
I consider uber guilds to be very well skilled, and to put lots of effort into what they do.   Sure, some mobs you can zerg... throw 50 people at it and you might win... but i know that doesn't apply to every guild out there... they try, they learn, they fail, they come back and kick ass.   They work towards harder goals, and hopefully get there. <br />
<br />
In Everquest ... loot is a huge factor in what most people do.   Some people it consumes them, some people are happy for an upgrade every once and awhile... but loot is there.<br />
<br />
I hate the fact, that for most good loot, you have to be in a raiding guild.   I do respect the work that raiders do... sometimes it's mindnumbingly boring on raids... 6 hours for 1-2 drops among 35 people... night after night.<br />
<br />
I think people who do that effort deserve great loot.   When I see someone walk by with a particle effect other than an epic... that person probably earned it.<br />
<br />
However, I really truly think that non-raiders should have a chance at items like this.   Not everyone agrees with me here... and that's okay... it's my belief.   <br />
<br />
If a monk can raid the Avatar of War for Flayed Barbie Leggings... I think a non-raid monk should also be able to quest for an item that is of LOWER value... but close.<br />
<br />
When I say quest... I don't mean 5 minutes and your monk has Legs of Divine Uberness... and I also don't mean a quest where you have to kill something like the Avatar of War to get a quest piece.<br />
<br />
The quest could take weeks... months... several drops.... you can even make it use the raid features of PoP... crawl a dungeon that requires 12 people ... or kill a mob that requires 15 people.   But keep it small, and manageable to non-raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
And time.    I definatly am not saying you should be able to quest something in  a day... just that there should be alternatives available.<br />
<br />
I'm also not saying that every uber item out there should have a quest alternative.    Just a lot of good items for any given class.<br />
<br />
Uber and non-uber warriors alike should be able to look forward to an uber sword.   One of them might get it after 3 raids, defaulted, or until they earn enough DKP to get it... the other may crawl and camp for weeks and weeks, but they'll get something eventually if they keep it up.<br />
<br />
I will say though, that I don't want a repeat of epics.  I think epics caused a lot of competition and greed.   But I don't know... maybe that's what you get if you make a great quest reward that everyone can get.<br />
<br />
I just hate that most people have to choose loot vs guild.    If you're in a small guild, with the exception what you get off a named mob here and there, you're restricted to what you see in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'll end with... I had uber jealousy issues in the past.   Big time.   I always wanted... I always dreamed... the one day I got the chance to get uber items... and it was great seeing things I have never seen... killing stuff bigger than a  giant in Kael... but I didn't love the lifestyle... and when I won big loot... I realized that it didn't really make me better... 5 more wis, 35 more mana... whoopie... I just wanted more.<br />
<br />
Now... I just try and have fun... so far it's working.</div></div><hr />

But it seems to me that if my quild doesn't have the manpower to raid in the higher plane tiers, then I don't need the weapons and armor that drop in those zones. The fun in playing this game is in winning despite the odds, thinking you're going to die and then surviving, whether you're soloing or part of a smoothly-functioning guild group. Using third tier armor and weapons in Gunthak would be too much like farming, very low risk of dying. If you and Jabober are finishing your fights at 80% of everything, and you can't remember your last CR, then its time to move up to something that scares you.<br />

<br />
A couple of friends of mine are in a much larger raid guild and I have raided with them a few times for flags, but it appears that this doesnt seem to be the norm, flagging events seem to be the province of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds and they want to keep everyone else out. <br />
<br />
I think that this is biggest pain with the flags in PoP. Now I cannot group with friends as most of them have moved on to the Elemental planes, and dont want to spend their time in less &quot;uber&quot; places. I am quite annoyed at this as I dont wish to leave my current guild, but feel that I have to in order to see half of an expansion I have already paid for. <br />
<br />
I am not asking for a free ride or instant access, but find it frustrating that there is a widening of the gap between the haves and have nots in EQ with the quality/rarity of drops available between the planes. The Uber guilds insure that they remain Uber by having the best gear available and as most of the replaced gear is no drop there is little or no trickle down of gear. To me this seems to be one of EQs mojor problems and I hope that Sony will work to fix this in future expansions and EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you are doing something wrong if it takes you weeks and months to get an AA.  As for getting &quot;10 AA a day pretty easily&quot;, 10 AA even in PoEarth would take 6-7 hours, which is about the same time that I could get 10 AA in HoH.  I've gotten 8 AA in 6 hours in HoH before, last I checked HoH was open to any level 62+.<br />
<br />
But man.. now people who have access to sol ro can take advantage of the ornate rush and make 400k in one day.<br />
<br />
Very few if any are making 400k in one day,  I've spent 20+ hours the last 3 days in Sol Ro and have a single Chain Glove pattern to show for it, there are 3 other Chain Gloves in Bazaar atm for 35k each.  Unless you get EXTREMELY lucky and get 2 BP drops you aren't making 400k in a day, and you sure as hell aren't doing it every day.<br />
<br />
And if you're not in an &quot;uberguild&quot; you're stuck there with a false smile, listening to people show off about how much great loot and cash and xp they're getting.<br />

<br />
People that have a lot of cash generally work hard for it and know the best ways at making money.  Sure, I'm in an Uber guild now, but before I joined I was in a small friendly guild yet I managed to have 660k cash and decent gear.  In fact, if I had never joined my guild I probably would have easily gotten my bank account into the multi-million range, but most of my time is spent raiding now.  I'd probably have a lot more AA as well.<br />
<br />
There are people in Uber guilds that have less than 10k to their name, just as I know people not in any guilds that have 7 figure bank accounts and the best gear money can buy.  There are people in my guild with less than 100 AA, and there are people that aren't in any guild that have 300+ AA.</div></div><hr />

I will respond to the last post, though, just to put things in perspective-- the salindrite dagger and mask of tinkering were purchased cheaply, before someone woke the sleeper recently, and the flayed barbarian mask was purchased at an unusually low price.  Like I said, lots of luck was involved.<br />
<br />
As for people who don't have much cash in uber-guilds, one needs to account for the equipment and spells they do get from being in that guild.  The money I make outside of an uber-guild goes into outfitting my brother and myself (and my guildmates and alliance friends) with decent near-competitive items and spells--- to compete with nodrop items that come from raids.<br />
<br />
People in uberguilds show off or /mourn when an amazing item rots because of DKP rules.  Heck, an Umbracite Swarm Orb has more stats than a lot of my equipment combined.  They may mourn, but I /weep-- what a waste of much-desired equipment.<br />
<br />
The best item I have is a Wicked Mail, and that was only because I helped a guild with Rumblecrush, and no one in their guild really needed it and they had pity on me because I died because of a single rampage.  Still, people are able to get bracers that are much better than the breastplate that I got out of pure luck.<br />

While I completely agree that you get out what you put in, uberguilders should not have twice the hp of someone in the best droppable gear along with ft15, 50/tick regen, and every single focus effect.  Velious got the difference just right imo.  I'm not sayinig there shouldn't be a discrepancy (there should) but that the discrepancy is far too big.  It is in large part due to the recent expansion being made specifically for uberguilds, but I don't see the ideals changing anytime soon, and I'm not about to buy LDoN to see if it evens out.  PoP was just too disappointing for me to buy any more of their expansions.<br />
<br />
The discrepancy I'm talking about goes far beyond gear...  twice the available zones and easy platinum are just two prime examples.  I love hearing all this talk of 'its not so great being in a uberguild'.  Who do you think got the 165k I spent on my 65 spells?  People who got lucky rolling on rune drops in BoT?  Ha!  Who's getting rich off farwater scale and earthweave caster armors?  Off elemental bows and focus range slots?  Give me a break.  And backflagging new recruits does not entitle you to it, get over yourself.  You wouldn't have so many new recruits to flag in the first place if so many people didn't see the direction EQ's headed in and quit in the first place.<br />
<br />

They love for us to think that.. its the same thinking that keeps old-school metallica fans buying the new crap that they keep putting out.  If you recall they make some sort of statement about each and every CD like &quot;its gonna be fast and hard like the old stuff&quot; - then the top40 stations start playing it and its the same crap they've been doing since the black album.  Plain and simple, they can't get back what they lost.  They sold out, and the karma forces that be won't allow it.  Sorry to put it this way, but you've gotta give up that hope.  Hope leads to buying their sh*t-in-a-box products, which leads to them claiming success and making the next expansion the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This is a funny thread.<br />
<br />
A lot of stereotyping, jealously and also good perspectives from some players.<br />
<br />
It is narrow-minded to try to stereotype players with uber guilds and uber items.<br />
<br />
Not all members from elemental guilds bragged about their items/HP/stats.  I have seen lvl 40+, 50+, 60+ and players with all kind of equipments boasting about themselves.<br />
<br />
Those in uberguilds do not necessary abandon their 'family guilds'.  In all likelihood, they are once family guilds who later grow into uber guilds due to the dedications of their players.<br />
<br />
As in all things, be it RL or in game, you put in more efforts, you achieve more things.  Keeping and organizing a large guild is harder than holding a small guild together.  Just look around you and you will see many guilds breaking up.<br />
<br />
Even if you join an uber guild, you have to forgo something.  Assuming you are a typical player with 5 hours playtime everyday, you are likely to be unable to grind for xp or farm pp if you are raiding now.<br />
<br />
For those people who are playing many hours a day, powa to them for being able to raid, gain AA and farm tonnes of pp, but they are trading their RL for EQ and it's their choice.<br />
<br />
The rule is still..if you put in more hours in EQ, you get more out of it.<br />
<br />
In any good game, there must be items which are hard to get and rarer than others.  If all items can be gotten by anyone playing the game, and dropping in any zone and at anytime, the game will lose a large part of it's appeal.  There must be some kind of progression that players can aspire to achieve.<br />
<br />
Players who work harder and smarter get better rewards.  Everybody pays their own subscription and their PC to play this game, trade their RL hours for EQ hours, they all have their rights to choose their playing style.</div></div><hr />

You're a shaman. Unless you're in a DKP guild, don't expect much loot. That's just the way things go, I think. Least that's how it goes in mine hehe. We have friggin mages getting AoW rings before us. /sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually that's how it works in Utopia which, sadly, is not the land of Norrath.  <br />
<br />
Player A spends 8 hours online in one sitting as his guild raids VT, elementals, NToV, whatever.  Player A will be massively rewarded in terms of loot that 90% of the playerbase will never, ever see.<br />
<br />
Player B spends 8 hours online in 2 hour blocks, fitting the game into his real life schedule.  Player B will be wearing bazaar gear at best that is substantially inferior to Player A AND for which they will have paid lots of plat while Player A only invested time (something Player B invested the exact same amount of).<br />
<br />
Putting in lots of hours in EQ will not get you anywhere unless it's done in such a way as to maximize the benefit to you based on the game mechanics.  Post-Velious, that means unless you want to raid, forget about getting the top gear.  Post-PoP it also means forget about exping in the best zones because you can't even get into them w/o a raid guild. You will play longer for less rewards than the average raid guild player who simply shows up each night.<br />
<br />
EQ's design has shifted over time to cater 100% to the top 2% of the playerbase, though lately that pendulum seems to be swinging the other direction.  If WoW delivers on its promise of content balanced for 5 person groups and little to no raiding, it will corner the casual market.<br />

The problem is, if 30 people can do something, then 70 can do it better.. IE 30 of you do an encounter over and over and get 4 items/hour.. the 70 people will get 20 items per hour ie a little over double the people but well over 4 times the loot..</div></div><hr />

This boasting has its place though.   In doing this I would now and again get a tell with an offer to join a guild that was fighting the things I wanted to fight. My passion has switched from dragons to gods now and for a long time I craved getting drunk on that victory but I just couldn't leave my friends.<br />

  One day I got another tell from a shaman in the uber guild and he told me that once a long long time ago he was just like me.  Soloing this and that going on this and that adventure and all of his friends in his guild wondered how he could do this or how he had so much money until one day he had realized he wasn't in that guild anymore at all.  <br />

 Though technically he was a member I will arrogantly say he had become peerless. There was more out there for him just like there was for me but I did not let my friends go and you dont have to as well.  You also dont have to give up the random chatter you share and love.  Dont forget you can make a chat channel just for you and your friends.  No one can take that away and even while you're out there soloing RZ while your buddies are fighting a lessor mob things can be as they were because true friends would understand this is the path you want to take.<br />

<br />
I do not think this is true.<br />
<br />
These 70 person raids didn't start because it's a collection of 70 people who simply love to be together.  They started because they were necessary for some encounters- to access more loots and see withheld zones.  <br />
<br />
As people learn and get more stuff, eventually 50 people will be required for some of those same encounters.  And you will see fewer 70 person raids.<br />
<br />
It is not true that encounters designed for 30 people will result in double rewards if 60 people show up.  <br />
<br />
And if they don't get double rewards, 60 people won't show up - because many of these people are in fact driven by the prospect of getting loot.  They follow the loot, and if the loot isn't there, they won't be either.  <br />
<br />
Heck, I remember when folks laughed at the idea that raids could require more than 30 people.  That was a long time ago.  <br />
<br />
It's certainly true that EQ does not reward time - it rewards CONSISTENT TIME in 4+ hour intervals.  Any other effort is not rewarded in the &quot;end&quot; game - which you will not access.</div></div><hr />

You assume the mobs are allways up, unbugged and intelligently implemented.  In a Raid guild the limit of mobs and loot isn't necessarily the speed at which you kill the mobs, we're not farming Rath mountains for pp here. The Limit is how many raid targets are up and how contested are they.  Getting one or 2 raid mobs every one or 2 nights is pretty much average for us since there are quite a few other guilds hunting the same mobs and that's assuming they are even functional. <br />
<br />
Half our guild is still missing Saryne because she crashes the zone when you engage her and just last night we spent 8 plus hours cooling our heels in Vex thal waiting for a gm to even show signs of life because of bugged warders preventing us from even engaging our targets. After a night of frustration and yet another example of just how inexistent gm's (and customer service in general) can be, the officers decided to call it off.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like fun I'm thinking, so I give someone a tell in thier guild and ask if I can tag along.  Of course they let me and I had a blast, and made some new friends.  <br />

Moral of the story is: there is more than one way to skin a cat =P</div></div><hr />

you are missing the point...I admit completely that it needs commitment and dedication to get the flags...<br />
I am even willing to invest myself twice more than you did, if that can get me flagged, but that won t help...That s my point.<br />
<br />
...I am willing to do it...however my guild is not big enough to do it...even if we spend years working on strategy...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only possibility for people to get flagged is to change to a guild with enough people...that means a lot to me to leave my guild. Is it worth denying me content? I don't think so.<br />
<br />

Last August my guild had maybe 10 - 20 people on every day unless we had a specific raid goal, and even then we never killed mobs bigger than Rumblecrush, Vindi, Doomshade, ect.  Now we have up to 70 on a night (usually closer to 50 or so, but 70 sometimes), are ele flagged, and just got finished with VT.  If you want to be in the higher end zones, get the higher end stuff, you dont have to LEAVE your guild, just get more people in it.  Its a choice you have to make, stay a casual, friendly guild, or get bigger, work hard, and make it to the higher end game.  You CANT have both and hope to succeed.</div></div><hr />

You make a very good point.  I'd just like to counter with, not every guild WANTS to turn into an uber guild.    Everyone isn't exactly saying they wanted Ele access as such... they just want to close the equipment gap from an 8 hour family guild player compared to an 8 hour raider.<br />
<br />
I've played both sides... I fully support hardcore raiders having the BEST gear in the game.   Fully... no argument at all... doing those encounters takes TIME, skill, dedication, and teamwork.   <br />
<br />
I'm just against the fact that a non-uberguild player has little to hope for outside of Bazaar buyable stuff, unless they become an uber guild, or join one.<br />
<br />
A player who plays every night working on thier character, helping friends, etc... deserves some good stuff as much as any player in the game.   NOT as good as the PoT rockin player.... no... I'm not saying that... but good, questable stuff.<br />
<br />
A 50 hour quest, broken into 25 small 2 hour camps... isn't that worth something (I prefer 25 x 2hr than 2 x 25hr, but that's just personal preference).</div></div><hr />

These 70 person raids didn't start because it's a collection of 70 people who simply love to be together.  They started because they were necessary for some encounters- to access more loots and see withheld zones.  <br />
<br />
As people learn and get more stuff, eventually 50 people will be required for some of those same encounters.  And you will see fewer 70 person raids.<br />
<br />
It is not true that encounters designed for 30 people will result in double rewards if 60 people show up.  <br />
<br />
And if they don't get double rewards, 60 people won't show up - because many of these people are in fact driven by the prospect of getting loot.  They follow the loot, and if the loot isn't there, they won't be either.  <br />
<br />
Heck, I remember when folks laughed at the idea that raids could require more than 30 people.  That was a long time ago.  <br />
<br />
It's certainly true that EQ does not reward time - it rewards CONSISTENT TIME in 4+ hour intervals.  Any other effort is not rewarded in the &quot;end&quot; game - which you will not access.<br />
<br />
I agree with you on the points you make, my poit was for example in eplanes you can do every encounter with 45people, but in lets say 6 hours you can do 3-4 mobs, while if you have 70people, in 6 hours you can do everything in a zone like pofire including fernin..<br />
<br />
so if 2 guilds are competing, one with 45 peeps and one with 70, the 70 people being pst guild, then guild (45) will clear lets say up to fernin then have to log because they can only clear so much with their numbers in a 6 hour span.. meanwhile the 70person guild given the same amount of time will be able to clear lets say poAir, then come and take out fernin too... the encounter isn't different / hard or easier, just takes a lot less time with 70.. that's what I meant.</div></div><hr />
