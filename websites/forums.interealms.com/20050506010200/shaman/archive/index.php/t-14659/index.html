<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
My guild is just getting strong enough to do raids where /random just won't cut it anymore. I've read numerous posts extolling the pros and cons of Merit vs DKP, but since DKP is only 3 characters I cannot use search engine to look for info. Can anyone link a site that has an explanation of, or shows how to create and manage a DKP system?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

is a link to Afterlife's DKP system. I believe it was the first.  There are many variations, and your guild will have to decide how to determine how to award DKP (i.e 1 pt per target or 1 pt per hour raiding or 2 pts for this god, 1 for that miniboss etc).  The other option is to decide how points are spent.  <br />
<br />
My guild is currently using a weighted bid system where raidleaders ask for bids on loot, and you roll /random 1 (bid).  The winner has their bid deducted, and loot moves on.  While this isn't true DKP, this works very well for us.  Sometimes you bid high and roll low, it happens, you move on.  Other options include having a commity of some sort set a point value for each item, have everyone interested send tells to the raidleader, and the interested person with the most points wins the item and has that many points deducted.<br />
<br />
The big chore of DKP is keeping track of who has how many points.  In some guilds the officers keep track and update their lists constantly (microsoft excell works well for this btw).  Some guilds have their members login to a webpage and update their own points, with just Big Brother to watch over everything.  My guild uses this second option, and we keep everyone's points totals public, though I have a friend in a guild where the officers run everything, and only post a list from first to last of who has the most points, but they don't disclose the totals.<br />
<br />
There's a couple options, and different things work for different guilds.  Deciding what will work best will be a chore, however, the number of loot complaints have dropped to basically 0 in the 6+ months we've been DKP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would recommend trying to keep it simple.<br />
<br />
Our guild runs a DKP system where you only get points per target killed, the value of those targets is decided by the guild officers and a list of targets is in our forums.  These values also change monthly re-adjusting the points so as stuff gets easier and we work out strats etc the points value of the mob then gets lower.<br />
<br />
We have no minimum bids (well....1 is the min I suppose), loot is called, bids are taken, when the bids start to slow the officer in charge gives a 10 second warning, after that the highest bid is taken.<br />
<br />
Before a target kill the officer does a log of /who &lt;guild&gt; and the logs of that are posted on our forum.  Anyone in that log gets the dkp added to them, if you were there and not on the log for some reason you have to post and say you were there.<br />
<br />
All in all it is very easy and works very well - we started it last august and it has run like a dream since then.  We also use the DKP software linked to by Salorm - tis v v good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My old guild had a system I liked a lot. <br />
<br />
Acquiring pts:<br />
<br />
We got 1 pt for every raid we went on and 1 pt for being at the raid at &quot;start&quot; time. This has the advantage of being very simple and easy to keep track of and also encourages people to show up at the raid on time. This has various disadvantages (like measuring a 10 hour raid the same as a 20 min kill), but all systems have some compromises.<br />
<br />
Spending pts:<br />
<br />
When an item drops that people want, the raid leader asks for bids. The bids are used as modifying odds to a roll. For example: Gandalf bids 5 and Frodo bids 4. The raid leader rolls 1-9, where a roll of 1-5 gives it to Gandalf and 6-9 gives it to Frodo.<br />
<br />
Their are several advantages to this system:<br />
- even if you only have a few points, you have the chance of winning something<br />
- there is no fixed cost for an item, each player can bid what they think the item is worth to them<br />
- the hard-core raiders have a better chance of winning an item than a casual raider (assuming that they bid more points), but they can't completely hog all of the equipment.<br />
<br />
Buy outs:<br />
<br />
If a player bids 25 pts ( a lot given you get 1-2 pts a raid ), then it enters into a straight bidding. I.e. highest bidder wins, no rolling. This is usually used on high end items. This is handy since it lets a person pull out &quot;all the stops&quot; if they really want an item.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are a zillion systems out there, but I found this one very simple and generally fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The guild to which I used to belong used DKP, and I highly recommend it over any merit or loot committee method. We used the eqdkp automated system, which is really quite phenomenal, just do a /log, do a /who guild to show everyone in the zone, and plug the resulting text blurb along with the target and who looted what, the system does all the math.<br />
<br />
Our system worked on DKP awarded being equal to the cost of items bought divided by the number of people present. Ex: 50 people kill Lord Inquisitor Seru,  dropping X, Y, Z, which people all buy for a total of 80 DKP worth of items. 80/50 = 1.6 DKP for everyone present. A bonus is added for a first time kill of a given creature. PoP flagging encounters award a flat 1 DKP to all present, successful or not. Items have a set value determined by the DKP officer, if nobody bits on an item it ROTS. This is to preserve the integrity of the system to prevent all members of a given class (esp. a low population class like shamans) from banding together to not bid on a class specific to try and get the cost lowered on the spot. If an item is consistantly not bid on, then its value will be lowered at the DKP officer's discretion.<br />
<br />
It was murderous hell until we started using the eqdkp thing to automate the process (it involved a TON of manual work before, and we burnt out DKP officers at a rate of about one every 5 weeks), but it is wonderfully fair. People who attend the most (and thus contribute the most) get first pick of high value loot by virtue of having more points to spend, but nobody is ever shut out.</div></div><hr />
