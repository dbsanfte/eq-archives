<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ab4430</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
A newbie question here, I am just about to start playing a ranger and want to know what animals I should not hunt because they will give me bad faction with other rangers?<br />
<br />
Some I can guess like Wolves and Bears but what about other non-monster animals like Mammoths and big cats?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hey, anyone ever wonder why, if we're supposed to be all cuddly with animals, that they give up spells specifically geared to scare and massacre them?<br />
<br />
Why do they sell leather armor IN Surefall?<br />
<br />
Seems to me they're so protective of their bears cause it's their precious bag material resource.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kedawen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only ones that will have bad faction hits are the bears in Surefall glade. No other animlas modify faction, but you need to be careful hunting in Qeynos Hills since Holly Windstalker will attack you if you are hunting the local animals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, be careful hunting animals near a druid ring.  I don't think its all rings, but some of them, if you are attacking an animal, the druids don't like it very much and turn on you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Basically my rule of thumb is if it cons Amiable I won't kill it. That still leaves lots of animals for you to choose from Rats Cats Mammoths Raptors Snakes Griffons all come to mind as animals that either con indifferant or don't like us</div></div><hr />

Heh, good insight; I'd like to add that the newbie quest armors are leather and that the leather needs to come from somewhere as well.<br />
<br />
Treants in Jaggedpine have faction hits you may not want, Citizens of Jaggedpine and Treants of Jaggedpine that I'm aware of (Citizens of Jaggedpine is fixable).  I'm not sure what level these trees are, they're light blue or green at 56.  Mid 30's maybe?<br />
<br />
Level 20-30, Treants in South Karana have tiny faction hits on several Qeynos factions, however all of them are fixable iirc.  It takes dozens of them to lower you one faction with any of the factions lowered, plus they're the best exp in the zone South Karana.  I know from experience.  They drop the Treant Heart for the Rain Caller quest (although you can do it without killing trees in West Freeport, I prefer doing it this way :D).<br />
<br />
Wolves, bears?  No faction hits, despite conning amiable.  I stay away from the Surefall Glade animals, but kill anything else (including panthers in Jaggedpine despite the TINY faction hit, smaller than South Karana treants mentioned above).  Let Hager Sureshot have the Surefall Glade bears to hunt for leather.</div></div><hr />

Actually, after many hours of hunting, I do believe all the newbie armor quest leather items are engineered from various orc body parts..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cosimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rounlin, have you experienced a treant faction hit?  Or are you just speaking from rumors?  SK treants aren't huge hits.<br />
<br />
What is a huge hit?  Stanos Herkanor in Highpass has a huge faction hit (max ally to max kos with several factions in one hit). <br />
<br />
SK treants don't even compare...  after an evening in SK I'd lost 1 faction level with the trees themselves, no faction with Qeynos guards, and I'm still amiable to Protectors of the Pine, which I know I did not raise after that session.  I forget the other faction hits, but they were on the same magnitude (either hardly affected or no visible change).  It's been a while, but I probably spent a couple hours there.  This is why I'm saying the faction hits aren't that large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I go with the rule of thumb that a druid buddy of mine taught me...if you pull up a list of animals in PoG and see it on the list, dont kill it.<br />
Basically that means no bears, wolves, unicorns (KOS ones don't count), treants (plants I know) and the odd ball cat here and there...individual /con will lead you.<br />
On a fun note the rabid grizzlies and wolves in QH are KOS to everyone, even druids, I wore them out as exp mobs with my handy dandy Crystal Fiber and full suit of banded way back in the day :-)<br />
<br />
edit: I need a spell check on this darn thing.</div></div><hr />
