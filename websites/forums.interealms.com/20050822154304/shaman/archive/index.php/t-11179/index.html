<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gumdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone ever go to this zone ? On my server the only time anyone is in there is if people are doing the Saryrn/Keeper of Sorrows events or people camping the gate necklace quest piece off the spiders. <br />
<br />
The exp is sub-par compared to all the other Tier2 zones (PoV, CoD and Tactics). The loot is horrible throughout the entire plane, including Saryrn herself who drops items that are worse than items off Terris Thule. I find this (insert Spock voice) highly illogical considering TT flag is required to even get into Torment. <br />
<br />
Add to this the fact that TT can be bumped off fairly quickly for a good couple of items, while Saryrn takes forever and then some + you have to do a lame key quest to open the doors to her tower. <br />
<br />
This is by far the worst designed zone in PoP so far IMHO, and probably will stay that way. Its a shame too, I kinda like the graphics and the atmosphere but they just didnt do it right. If they would at least bring exp up to par with the other Tier2 zones, it would give smaller guilds who are able to do TT another zone to exp in. As it stands right now this zone is a waste of my HD space. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was wondering the same, I was bind sighting around today, zone looks great, music is fantastic, but I can't even convince guildies to check it out with me cause everyone says xp is so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone is so Spoiled. I say , go back to UP, or anythign Pre-PoP for 2 hours , then say how bad the XP is , just go there and enjoy it , they are fun zones , put XP ont he back burner in your mind and after a few hours of FUN , you will blink as you look at your AA bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jesus christ, have you ever been to Potorment?  &quot;Fun&quot; is NOT the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still like BoT as the most &quot;fun&quot; zone I am flagged to enter.  I haven't gotten around to checking out Torment yet, but I've zoned in once to look around.  Good idea with the bind sight thing.  I'll have to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Add Plane of Grummus flag, Plane of Bugs ... erm Innovation, Plane of Slow mitigation ... aka Storms, Bastion of Thunderous Nerfs, Drunder, Fortress of &quot;drop rate fixes&quot;, Plane of Execution trial and you got a crapload of badly designed PoP zones. And people wonder why Valor is an over crowded clusterf_ck of a zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoth Utgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the zone has a lot of potential, but there doesn't seem to be much point to for a single group. The mobs are hard and diverse, which I like, but with next to zero loot (the occasional ethereal and tradeskill junk), subpar exp, and a 30 minute (?) GY timer, the zone doesn't have much replay value.<br />
<br />
If they would put some decent loot-dropping named in the zone that a single group can go after (so that its not just an extremely tough grind), and maybe decreased the GY timer, it would be a pretty decent zone, IMO. Also, for the difficulty of some of the mobs compared to other Tier 2 zones, spectrals should be dropping.<br />
<br />
They need to overhaul the zone, using Chardok, CT, and CoD as a guide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spectrals do drop in Torment, I've looted them myself.<br />
<br />
As for the GY being reduced, no thanks, nothing sucks more than being in a zone where you can't CoH, can't rogue drag, can't corpse summon and have a corpse get sent to zone before you can rez it cause you had a mini wipe on a raid.  If you are doing XP a rogue with shroud can pull your corpses down to zone in within minutes, or a good enchanter can as well.<br />
<br />
With a slightly lower amount of hp on mobs, and a couple of random loot drops this zone could be quite good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Torment was properly named.<br />
<br />
It's litterally sheer torment to spend time in this zone.<br />
<br />
Drops suck.  xp sucks, the mobs suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would be nice if 3/4s of the mobs in the zone weren't slow immune. The inability to pull less than 6 mobs from the houses without multiple feign pullers is also a &quot;treat&quot; I could do without. You know you are in trouble in that zone, when the 3 birds at the entrance AE silence.<br />
<br />
Plus, they really need to up the drop rate on the strands of living chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pulls of 6+ mobs are common in one of the buildings you need to camp for key parts....and they are casters.  /wave dead monk<br />
<br />
A huge portion of the zone is slow immune too, and they randomly flurry and rampage too.   Weeeee.<br />
<br />
Only good part about the zone is you can travel to almost anywhere in the zone with minimal killing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">only been in the zone once .. killed sarym .. out of the zone now<br />
<br />
i guess i'd go along for more sarym kills to get people flags<br />
<br />
the zone looked nice and it was a fun raid my first time around .. <br />
<br />
i haven't tried single group exp there .. and maybe that isn't the best of ideas with AE silence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I actually got the key to enter this zone (the quest isnt all that hard), and of course am the only person in my guild flagged for it as we aren't exactly uber.  Let me just say right from the beginning I was extremely dissapointed.  No way am I going to be able to solo here.<br />
<br />
Zone in, invis up and can only go over the first bridge where one of the two guards sees invis.  Try to pull a bird instead .. AE silence and dead in two seconds due to a pathing bug that brought all 3 birds (fun!).  Say ok birds suck move up on the bridge and try to take out a gaurd.  Snared!  Beaten to a bloody pulp.  Unable to split them solo cause they're too close together.<br />
<br />
/sigh oh well at least it wasnt extremely painful getting the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok birds are easy. You just have to learn how to pull them and they come single every time, and the silence only lasts like 3 ticks (during which time they might do 1k damage to you if you are decently geared).<br />
<br />
They are fairly easy to kill with the pet tanking, but it does take a long time (as do most pop mobs). They have a lot of hp, and I haven't killed one and kept my pet alive the whole time yet (he usually dies at about 4% left cause I screw up on the healing)<br />
<br />
Then you move further in, and you run into the stupid spider traps. Those give like no experience and take another 20 minutes to kill.<br />
<br />
Ok, so you've finally moved in a bit farther, and you get to pull your first wolf looking mob. Whoops, that's actually 4. No problem, train back to zin, paralyzing earth one, zone out, come back, there is your single pulled mob. These seem to die faster than the birds, but they suck cause you have to remake your pet every time.<br />
<br />
The biggest advantage that this zone offered me was no competition. Getting half the experience of pov/bot in an hour does suck, but on the other hand, sitting lfg in pov/bot for an hour is ZERO experience.<br />
<br />
However my guild finally got flagged for CoD (grummus was an easy kill for us but it took forever because everyone else was getting him before us) so that's my new zone. I still like bot better though, I think.<br />
<br />
Soloing in torment IS an option though if you have a lot of time on your hands :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok i'll bite, how did you single pull a birdy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Never had a problem with multiple bird pulls at the entrance...hell, you can walk right down the middle without aggroing them, their aggro/assist range is pathetic.<br />
<br />
This zone needs some non-tradeskill/quest drops from stuff that isn't behind the locked door of Saryrn's tower. It needs a LOT fewer slow immunes, and to go a bit lighter on the mob density in the buildings.<br />
<br />
It also needs it's XP modifier raised a bit.<br />
<br />
Highly dissapointing zone. The mini-nameds on the way up to Saryrn don't even have the decency to drop an item every time, and the only Spectrals I've ever seen drop were from Saryrn herself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tactics count as tier 2? :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">tactics is tier2/3, it was going to be tier2 and war was going to be tier3, but war got scrapped because of pathing, and rallos zek got moved into tactics<br />
<br />
though I don't really see what this has to do with torment<br />
<br />
if you meant torment, yes it is considered tier2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah how about the mobs that proc that unresistable snare, chains of ______. thats real fun to deal with as well. this zone could use a revamp, it wouldnt be so bad if they had put some thought into it, the map of the zone is nice. no drops in there and lousy exp make it a raid only zone. even after you have the key it takes most of the night to fight up to and kill saryn, whom isnt very hard nor rewarding of a kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wierd that Torment is Tier II, considering you have to pass two trials in two DIFFERENT zones to get there.  What's Crypt of TT considered then?  Tier 1.5?  I know it does suck, unslowable mobs and no loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lair of TT is still tier1, PoEarthB isn't tier 4.5, and HoHb isn't tier 3.5........... they just wanted a seperate area to host some boss mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yup, Torment sucks so hard.. Especially after you fought your way up and fight Maareq the Prophet.. And when he dies the ae-crew manage to kill a nice little green conned Tylis Newleaf~</div></div><hr />

OMG !!! HAHAHAH =) sorry but it's too funny<br />

Killing npc that you are supposed to save and that will port you to keeper of sorrow is not a good idea =)</div></div><hr />
