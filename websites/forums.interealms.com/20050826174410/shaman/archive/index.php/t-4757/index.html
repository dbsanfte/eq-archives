<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I've been playing my alt Druid and Wiz and have noticed that for some odd reason. The shaman's in there 30's and even 40's don't use canabalzie anymore. When I ask why they say it's no faster than medding like everyone else.<br />
<br />
My concern is that they are getting to this lvl and still not understanding what makes a shaman so great.<br />
<br />
As an example I was in a group where we had 2 druids 38th (me) and a 35th druid, along with a 44th shaman. Then 3 mele types both myself and the other druid were always running lom. After a big battle everyone in the group was down on health with the exception of the shaman who finished the fight with 80 percent mana and full health. <br />
<br />
I asked the shaman if he was slowing the mobs he goes and I quote &quot;I can if you want.&quot;, When the mele's needed buffs he simply stated that if he buffed the mele's all 3 of them then he would be oom. I go well just use canabalzie to get mana back.<br />
<br />
He was completly without a clue as to what a shaman was.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if you all are seeing the same thing with the shaman you group with as an alt, or if I've just been unlucky enough to keep seeing bad shaman in the making.<br />
<br />
BTW my rule of thumb until I got 60 with torpor if a shaman is full health / full mana he's not working hard enough. )<br />
<br />
Sorry for this being so long but this just rubbed me the wrong way.<br />

BEDIN! how's it going? You probably dun remember me :( I think we were in Freedom Guard together? It was so long ago hehe :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, yes I twinked a Ranger a bit and have found that many of the low-mid (10-50) shaman (at least on Povar, one of the original servers) barely have a clue as to what they're supposed to do in a group. It's hard, because I don't like telling someone how to play their shaman, or insert class here, especially when I'm not on my shaman or don't have a character of inserted class and still know what they should do better than they do.  (&lt;-- that sounded a bit redundant)<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked the shaman if he was slowing the mobs he goes and I quote &quot;I can if you want.&quot;, When the mele's needed buffs he simply stated that if he buffed the mele's all 3 of them then he would be oom&quot;<br />
<br />
I got that kind of response a lot especially in places like LOIO, FM, OT, and DL, which are the most popular exp spots through the mid levels, and also are filled with the some of the most opinionated and ignorant people I have ever communicated with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To be fair, right through the early 30's I was not slowing mobs in groups because the cost/benefit ratio just wasn't there.  A group would rip through a mob in 30-45 seconds and bring another one, so I'd always be OOM if I slowed.  I chose to keep Quickness up on all the melees instead, since we'd kill 3-4 mobs before Quickness dropped, and there wasn't enough mana to do both.<br />
<br />
I grouped once with a shaman's alt in FM giant fort and he asked why I wasn't slowing.  I explained my reasoning to him and got the impression that he didn't agree with me, but was going to let me play as I saw fit.  I figure that even if his shammy was higher level than mine, I knew my capabilities at my level better than he did at that moment, and stuck with what I was doing.<br />
<br />
Togor's at lvl 39 was the slow spell that tipped the scale for me.  In most good XP groups Togor's is worth casting, paying for itself within a few ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Slowing useless till Togor's for the exact reason Twoflower mentioned. Buffing is next to useless unless it is 35 pts or more to the individual stat. We don't get a decent HP buff til Tnarg, and even then its like what.. 80hp?<br />
<br />
Also, in your 30's 40's and early 50's you can't tank. This is mostly a factor of gear as most non-twink shaman don't get above 850 AC until after level 50. Best way to hunt solo is root/dot until you can tank. Cannibalize is NOT faster than meditation until Canni2, especially as most shaman don't get Canni2 and wait til canni3 at 53. I would use Canni 1 at 34, but by the time 45 rolled around I would only use it if I was in a position not to sit down.<br />
<br />
I soloed Snow Cougars from 35 to 40, and they hit HARD at the time. No way I could take the beating and still cast and hurt em. So I root/dot and sic pet after em only when they started running away. At 40 I went to Dreadlands and stayed there til 48 in groups, after 48 I soloed. Still root/dot. From 50-54 was just awful. There weren't any good places to solo (Luclin wasn't released), and the only place to group was Karnor's, and it was chock full o noobs. Sebilis was still for the l33t only.<br />
<br />
56 was when solo powah really kicked in. Chardok had been revamped. I managed to get a copy of Bane, I had a JBB, Epic, and Fungi. At 56 you can single pull in the entrances of Chardok and Howling Stones. My gear received singnificant upgrades as the guild I was in gained in strength. I'm not talkin ToV either, I mean Planes Gear. Now I'm 60 and just about every I can group I can also solo, I just kill things slower than a fukll group.<br />

And yes - GREAT point about canning. Those Shaman will be in for a rude awakening when they fumble their way into Seb / Luclin lfg and met up with non-guildies who won't carry them.<br />
<br />
I honestly wonder tho - hmm you aren't slowing, you like to buff and sit on your butt, you spot heal...tell me again why you are playing a Shaman and not a Cleric? (cough Spirit of the Wolf cough)<br />
<br />
I was slowing and healing in Sol B since 44-45 or so.  Certainly those folks can have more than one &quot;ghetto mezzed&quot; while the group is polishing off the first.</div></div><hr />

They don't see it as any help but more as an expenditure in mana.  Matter of fact I really get on the druids about not casting group Regrowth... I works for the tanks, it works for me, it works for the Necro's... IMO Regrowth is a great spell, and the Group version is a blessing to any group.  Yes I realize it is a pain to keep it going all the time, kind of like casting Alchery on tanks it is annoying to no end. <br />
<br />
I have gotten to the point if I don't have the spell regeneration running I go nuts... and to top it off I am a troll with built in regeneration.  <br />
<br />

I always figured if I cast a regeneration type spell that I had to make the mana back up somehow to justify the expense of it.  So if I casted Regeneration I cast Cann1 4 or 5 times to make back the mana I just spent.  And then I sat while I either healed or scraped off more mana from my health.  It is always a balance with CannX and Regeneration though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Canni1 is faster then med i bet.<br />
<br />
can cast it 2 times a tick atleast, and you get about as much mana from canni as you do a med tick.<br />
<br />
Of course its not till canni2 where you can just run around chaining canni and get back significant returns, but the ratio isnt as good as canni1, so its questionable wether its worth it or not.<br />
(hell i havent been able to find a yun shaman yet, even w/ my bard friend running around TT half the time looking, and im 51 =\)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good thread, and yes I do notice the idiots.  I'm currently 35 and play mostly in OT.  I grew up in LOIO where the idiots roam, and whenever I met a crappy shaman I was sure to let him know that he was crappy.  Most of these idiots transfer over to OT so I can't get away from them.<br />
<br />
For you people who say that Canni 1 is no faster than medding, here's your sign.  There is NO comparison between normal medding and canni-dancing.  I can remember many times when the groups main healing duties was split between myself and a druid.... we'd both get to 10m and say &quot;med break&quot;, and 1 min later after Cannibalizing I'm at 70m or 80m while the druid is at 30 or 40m.  Then the druid would say something like &quot;damn shamans and their mana-regen&quot;.  I canni-dance like a damn fool, and I got plenty of mana to show for it.  It's not even a contest.  It's free-mana, people!  How can you not see that?  With regen on, if you're full health then that regen is going to waste.  Canni down a few hundred hitpoints (you're not using hitpoints in a group anyway, the tanks are) and gain extra mana.  Then regen those hitpoints back again and Cannibalize again....  It's not even comparable.<br />
<br />
About buffing, I kinda just go by what I'm capable of doing.  If there is no other healer but me then I gotta do what I can.  If the tanks are dropping like flies then I just give them all regen, haste and then just heal --- not enough mana to heal and fully buff every tank.  If there is another healer, I'll buff fully every tank.  The benefits of buffing make a very noticeable difference, and I buff whenever my mana allows it.  But next time you're in a tank-heavy group, fully buff all the tanks and notice a fairly large difference in the decrease of damage taken and the speed that the mobs drop.  <br />
<br />
About Healing, yes it sucks when you gotta focus only on healing, but we can heal pretty darn good in the 30's, so if that's what you gotta do, that's what you gotta do.<br />
<br />
About Slowing, there is two factors that determine if I slow or not: 1) how fast the tanks are ripping through the mobs 2) if everyone is buffed and healed, then I slow.  In tank heavy groups where mobs are dropping fast it's not mana-efficient to slow.  But in groups where the mobs take forever to die, then slowing is very beneficial to reduce the amount of damage taken over the long haul.  Same thing for quest mobs that are difficult.<br />
<br />
And also I'd like to say that while I *can* tank a bit... it's not the best way to go about things.  Yes, shamans can take a hit better than most other casters, but that doesn't mean that you should be the main tank and only focus on hps and AC.  Then you're just a ranger, basically, defensively.  Get your hps and AC to respectable levels but don't forget about Wis and mana gear.  I try to find a healthy balance of both.  I focus on Hitpoint/sta and mana/wis gear, with AC bringing up the rear.  Tanking is not something shamans specialize in, just something that we can play around with.  It's not good enough to depend on.  At 35, with all my AC/hp gear and fully self-buffed, i can still get my clock cleaned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best way to show a shaman the error of their ways, politely point them here, and hope that they come.  Lore them here with Epic advice and level guides.  Once they beging reading they will be hooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have always grouped with my wife, an enchanter, up to 54, and I have been canabalizing since 24.  It is not faster to med, its just more work.  I got more mana canabalizing, EVEN WITH CLARITY.<br />
Its just like a bard who wont twist.  They are lazy<br />
<br />
There is a warrior in my guild who has a shaman lvl 51 alt.  We were in hate and he said he had yet to canabalize.  Hes just a worthless druid who cant snare as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
To all of the shaman, who think that we cant nuke as well as other classes, or cant heal as good as druids, or cant do X Y or Z as good.  These shaman fail to understand that we can canabalize and as a result, we can nuke 2 times as much as the wizard in our group.  We can heal 2 times as much as the druid in our group.<br />
Learn to dance.  If you dont, then think about that bard in your group who doesnt twist and think about how you feel about how he plays his class.  You are worse than him.<br />
<br />
On the note of slowing.  Guys, if you have 3 meele or more, its probably not worth slowing, haste on all 3 tanks, an incapacitate here and there.  If you have a cleric, its probably not worth slowing until turgurs.  Use the clerics mana while you do damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny how I could buff full groups, slow, speed melees, dot once in a while, root park, etc. while never dropping below 50m, while using Can 1.  I never got Can2.  I used Can1 til i got Can3.  I guess i'm strange for thinking I regen'd mana faster than the other casters in my group who were doing alot LESS than me.<br />

Did I ask your opinion?  Thanks for gettin' &quot;snapy&quot; with me, Dragon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, did I even define a crappy shaman for you?  I'm talking 'bout the d00dz who hear that &quot;shamans can solo Lodizal at later levels&quot;, so they PL up as fast as possible using improper shaman techniques and just hang around the group throwing a heal here and there every once in awhile and yelling at people when they ask for regen or speed.  The d00dz who constantly claim &quot;oom&quot;, and then yell at people when a groupie says &quot;Canni-dance shaman, if you're oom&quot;.  Or say &quot;What's the point in buffing or slowing?  It doesn't do anything.&quot;  That's like saying &quot;What's the point in playing a shaman?  They don't do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can tell a difference between the players who genuinely are inexperienced and are seeking advice in how to play a shaman, and the people who don't WANT to know how to play a shaman.  You can bet your bottom dollar that I'll give as much help as I can to a genuinely inquisitive shaman, and I do VERY frequently.  And you can bet your bottom-dollar that I'll rip a shaman a new butthole if he's just plain stinking it up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shamans who don't buffs, slow or canni would be so much better off playing druids. If nothing else, the root-dot'ng kinda of give them away.<br />
<br />
You know, it was a while ago, but a 29, I vaguely remember getting Targar's Insect. Starts as a ~30% slow when you get it and gets better as you level. If you're soloing, that's a MOB hitting you 30% less for 30 to 70 HP a pop. If the fight last, say, 60 to 90 seconds, that's about 400 to 900 HP that you don't lose and don't have to heal in combat. If you're in group pulling yellows and reds, that's another 800 in damage that doesn't get dealt on a tank per 45seconds fight. And that's only if the MOB is a normal, double-attack MOB. If it's dual-wield or a monk model, you can easily add half again to twice that amount. And that's only if there is a single MOB.<br />
<br />
Believe me... in the thirties, the cleric could tell INSTANTLY when the slow was landing on the MOB. She just had to watch her mana melt away.<br />
<br />
Talking of clerics, or druids for that matter... what do you think they prefer when they have 2 minutes to think about it: a) Heal melees in a rush while they're being pounded flat by an unslowed MOB? b) Heal at leisure a shaman cannibalizing hp into mana after the MOB has been effectively neutered by a slow?<br />
<br />
And by what twisted math does one arrives to the conclusion that cannibalize doesn't net you more mana then med'ng? You can cast Cannibalize BETWEEN med ticks. Or do you think the regen spells only counts down when you're not at full health? Look at it that way: you're FH, not FM, got a regen spell on and are sitting on your butt med'ng... every tick, you're wasting mana. Hell, you're not only wasting mana, you're wasting your perfectly good innate regen too. That's bad enouhg when you're a barb, a cat or an ogre but it's downright criminal when you're a troll or a lizard.<br />
<br />
From 35 to 45, I melee'd down Cyclops, Drolvargs, Giants and the like while Fido nipped at their heels.. You know, with slow on, they don't hit as often and casting between the swings isn't that hard. You also kill them twice as fast with the same mana spent. Strangely enough, my channeling, defense and offense were also always max'd for my level. And it wasn't that I was twinked or anything.... I was wearing totemic, banded and WIS jewelry at the time.<br />
<br />
45 to 54 before Velious/Luclin? Welcome to Drealands and Burning Wood, where the blues a fast, easy and single-pullable if you're remotly careful. And CoM, where the both the MOBs' HP and resist are amusingly low. Hell, if you don't like getting out of the old world, Ice Giants, Seafurbies or SolB are perfectly soloable, not to mention profitable.<br />
<br />
Also, it's amusing to see the &quot;Buff don't do ****&quot; crowd slowly move to the &quot;buff below 35 don't do ****&quot; position. So, you're not buffing, you're not slowing... you think you got a better use for that mana? Here's a clue: Clerics, druids even, heals better than you do and about ANY caster does damage better. So, yes... throw a DOT in. And when you're not doing that, keep the tanks happy with buffs and the MOBs slowed. And when you're not doing THAT, learn to dance around the tick.</div></div><hr />

That being said, ramming on the cannabalize button gets old.   There were times during the exp grind where I was content to have clarity and sit and med.  There were times where I was watching for even the slightest movement on the mana bar before standing up and cannabalizing between each tick.  Not everyone wants to have their finger glued to a button.  Maybe you just caught that crappy shaman on a bad day or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Heh!  I just finished the Kromriff Military Leggings quest and grimace every time I see myself in 3rd person view!  They a decent upgrade over Totemic legs, but man, I wish I still had the plate look!  )<br />
<br />
EDIT**<br />
On the canni-dance discussion, I feel lucky that I found the Crucible when I was in my teens.  I had my canni-dance buttons made when I was lvl 23!  :D  I still remember getting a tell, after finally scribing cannibalize and regen, asking if I had clarity when I was in a group at the gnoll spires in S Karana.  We had gotten a couple of adds, and then a re-pop, and it turned into a tense situation!  (I hate dieing!) I kept calling out &quot;OOM&quot; and then casting shortly thereafter.  Three times I ran too low to cast a heal or re-slow, but canni'd enough to cast again.  Finished the fight OOM and 20% HP!<br />
<br />
They must have been all new players because none of them knew that shaman could cannibalize.  I enjoyed basking in my short moment of glory after saving the party from wipeout!<br />
<br />
This is my opinion, freely offered, so take it for what you think its worth:  if you're not canni-dancing you're just holding yourself back!  If you don't want to work at being a shaman, go make a druid!</div></div><hr />

As a cleric I love slow mobs.  I have learned how to tell what is slow and what is not slow.  I spend my mana to heal the shaman when I have nothing else to use it on.  (Love those perfectly timed CH's!!) <br />

I try very hard to not *tell* shaman how to play.  Because 9.9 times out of 10 Im a cleric and that just isnt polite.  Though it is very hard when I realize MY shaman has more ac then an Oracle.</div></div><hr />

I recently aquired a JB Bp on a bard trak raid.... it was the second happiest day of my life as I am one step (JB Legs) from being an old school uber shm :) back when we wore plate graphics and still carried big 2 hand bonking sticks...  *wipe a tear from my eye* those were the days I tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The thread went from &quot;Shaman Problems I've seen recently&quot; and cannibalizing to something like &quot;Shaman n00bz just don't know how to play their character these days&quot;<br />
<br />
The overall tone of the Crucible boards from the time of it's inception has, in my eyes, diminished to a large group of high-levels and threads like this one which equates to a bunch of pimply kids (perhaps not age, more like mentality) standing on a mountain in their uber-AC shaman gear and hanging out their schlongs to whizz on those shaman lower than them.  Statments like &quot;that idiot will never get a clue&quot; and &quot;man, they should be playing a druid&quot; or even &quot;some day they'll see the light&quot;  smacks of skidmark underwear and nogzema.<br />
<br />
To some degree the higher-ups might as well insist that all new shaman bleach their hair blonde, and wear swastikas and learn how to goosestep.  Because, hell, if you won't get in line and do what the vocal shaman are doing, you should be gassed.  Heaven forbid there be someone marching to the beat of a different drummer.<br />
<br />
We all can be intolerant of people when they don't know how to play.  To be a condescending pr1ck and tell them to get the heck out of the business if they don't shape up is flippin' rude.  What?  An incompetent shaman is chain DD'ing?  They aren't slowing? Woah, a shaman that thinks they're a puller?  OMFG this shaman doesn't know how to control aggro!!  Ok, now to top it off, they don't even know how to canni-dance or care to know.  Well, there goes the neighborhood.  I'm so freakin ashamed of all these n3wbs,  *sigh*.  I've made my mistakes many times over.  Thanks to lots of in and out of game input I've learned how to do things differently regarding the shaman class.  After a years break from the game I'm halfway back to level 52 from level 46.  Before I quit it wasn't a big surprise that a thicker skin helped in higher levels. Having a balanced inventory can help.  Sure, you can take stock of the equipment available and crunch numbers to come up with the &quot;perfect&quot; magelo stats.  Hell, add some hydraulics and a little calvin piss sticker on the back of your headgear and you're set for the next shaman-show.  If someone is driving around their little beater Yugo-shaman than let them.  If someone wants an SUV shaman, than yippeee.  Oh hey, that shaman is driving the Honda Accord econo-version.  It's not screaming but hell, it get's you from 1 to 60 and can pack on the mileage, to boot.  Add some ground-effects, a spoiler, a coffee can for the muffler, and it looks spiff.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of shaman have learned things from the forums, here, and were ignorant at one point or another on some things.  It's easy to look at the 5 year old kid and chide them about something they may know nothing about.  Sure, make fun of them because they put their underwear on over their pants or their shoelaces are untied.  Damn, I for one never made a mistake like that in my life.  But if I did, I doubt that I'd learn differently until a Nelson from the Simpsons came along and laughed at me for it, &quot;Ha! Ha! You st00pid n3wb!&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.aol.com/ecsull2/private/audio/haha.wav&quot;&gt;Hah, Ha&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
It's easier to criticize someone than help them, I know, I find myself doing it, too.  Really, when you offer advice and it gets thrown back in your face, it's hard not to say &quot;Well, than f* you, I was just trying to help&quot;.  I'm sure if the shoe was on the other foot, pride might take over and we'd might end up perpetrating the same crime.  Aw, come one, don't say that you are an ideal shammy and never lost your cool when someone told you how to play your character.<br />

This problem certainly isn't class-specific.  I believe a large part of it is the result of &quot;Twink and Power Level&quot; breeding.  There's nothing inherently wrong with twinking.  Powerleveling is fine... in moderation.  The best players of any class tend to be the ones who have done the grind.  They learned to think inside the box, then learned that the box is just a place to keep your tools for when you're thinking outside it.  PLing fast-forwards you past all the annoying down time, past all the disasters, the CRs, the boring forced grouping, and past discovering little ins and outs of your class that come with time.<br />
<br />
Who wants to play next to a PL'd wizard who can't get a spell off reliably because their casting skills are still 15 levels below them?  If you do, please feel free to invite the monk who can't FD and that shaman who can't cann, and that warrior who can't use anything other than 1hs, and 2hs only when absolutely necessary.  What, he doesn't own a shield?  Never bashed in his life?  Over there with the ranger that can't shoot, please.<br />
<br />
This obviously doesn't hold true all of the time.  I know a few very bright people who have PLd alts... and *can* play them well.  They tend to be people who are versatile in RL though, and excellent examples of how to play their main character's class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I played a semi twinked cat shaman up to 53 (my main) and it was tough to play the &quot;right&quot; way.  When i was younger, I healed as well as a cleric and everything else in my spellbook was marginal at best.  Ya i could slow, but it wiped the mana bar, and the uber twink tanks were killing mobs every few seconds so slow was a waste.  Buffs just weren't worth it either - noone's weapon procced at those levels, and the stat increase was barely noticable - again because the tanks were using uber twink gear...  I found the most efficient use of my mana was healing and nuking =\<br />
<br />
By no means am I agreeing with the statement about canni dancing not being useful, or trying to take away the multitude of things a shaman CAN bring to a low level group.  But the reality is that I didn't feel like a shaman until very recently because nobody needed me and my unique spells until recently.  Let's face it - a monk decked out with his fungi tunic and bad ass beat you up stick simply didn't need me and my crappy slows :)  lol<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it really doesn't matter how the pre 50 crowd plays their toon - i found it easier to play like a cleric or a druid, and I eventually learned the power of a well balanced (ie not wisdom happy) shaman.  Most of the true tards give up on a class when they reach the post 50 game anyways, so let's not all get too upset over people playing &quot;stupid&quot; when they are in their 30's.<br />

Excuse me ---  You've never grouped with me, so how do you know anything about my playstyle?  Did I ever say that I do nothing but spout opinions and tactics to other classes the whole time I am grouped?  Conversely, I normally don't say anything to anyone about how they should play their class, but I do speak up when someone is glaringly bad.  If you don't like the way I said that some people suck, than that's your problem.  Are you denying that there are sucky players in the game?  <br />
I never said anything derogatory towards you, yet you unleash a barrage of venom my direction in a way  that you seem to think that it's me that has a &quot;communication/social&quot; problem.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If you recall when I started the thred I never said anything about low lvl shaman. But by the time your mid 30's the buffs/slows do make a difference.<br />
<br />
My point was that the shaman I have grouped with neither knew how to play a good shaman or wanted to know.<br />
<br />
I don't expect anyone to know everything there is to know about any class even at 60. But you need to be willing to learn. And from what I have seen recently quite a few arn't willing to even think about learning.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong there are still some good shaman out there. But at least I'm starting to see fewer and fewer of them.<br />
<br />
Just rember if people don't learn to play there class and use it's abilities then why play the class. The picture that came to mind for me when I started seeing the trend is.<br />
<br />
Guild goes to TOV. Melies ask for buffs and the shaman goes I could buff you all but then I would be oom. Is that what you want?.<br />
<br />
Mobs get pulled and after 3 wipeouts somone asks the shaman are you slowing them? And the shaman goes I can if you want but I might get agro.<br />
<br />
end example.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it will be that bad but thats what came to mind.<br />

Sorry for sounding off but seeing mid lvl shaman who don't know the basics and not wanting to learn really gets to me.</div></div><hr />

I really don't know if there's a trend or not, because I honestly don't play alts.  I've got about 218 days on Khallin, and a couple alts spread out that I messed around with for a short time.<br />
<br />
However, I do see the obvious sha-druids from time to time.  (You know - books, leather, gold booties, bare arms...)  I don't laugh at them, taunt, or tell them they suck - I talk to them.<br />
<br />
That's all, just talk.  Get to asking what their AC &amp; Wis are, how well they manage aggro, etc.  I ask them if they've visited this site, as it's a great Shaman resource, and give the URL if they need it.  And then I ask if they'd like some advice - if they' get ripped to shreds trying to slow mobs, I suggest that they pick up some cheap AC gear.  Bump up their AC without dropping Wis under 160 or so, and play a week in that gear, to see how they last in fights.  I tell them that in my opinion, AC is vital to stay alive when that slowed mob turns on us (especially with resists), and that Wisdom doesn't matter if we're not going OOM - and that with Canni, there's no real reason to be OOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The beauty of the Shaman class is its versatility. There are so many different ways of playing a shammy that we are just spolied for choice. <br />
<br />
Me - I play an old fashioned AC shaman tank because I play at a lot of strange times, so I generally have to solo &amp; tank for Dogdog. But I play on a PvP server, so that effects my gear choices and even my spell lineup (the most efficient PvE spell lineups are signing your own death warrant in PvP). Now when I do get to go on a raid or even just get in a good exp group for a change, I swap gear, swap spells, swap play styles - adapt! The point is that we can adapt.<br />
<br />
I make a point of always inspecting other shaman (I ask first, of course), and I am constantly amazed by the amount of difference I see in the equipment that people wear - I never criticize, and I am often suprised at the efficiency with which other shaman perform while wearing gear that is counter-intuitive to me. Unless specifically asked, I never offer advice, because letting people keep their own prejudices regarding what is the &quot;right&quot; gear reduces the competition for my preffered stuff!<br />
<br />
So, be tolerant people - there is no &quot;right&quot; way, and it is useless to speculate on who is or isn't an *******: Its just conjecture and hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, many people who has a shaman as a primary char failes to communicate well when trying to &quot;teach&quot; someone else how to play a shaman. The way you say the things you say determine how well they will be recieved. If you go aroud saying &quot;hey n00b, start canning already&quot; or &quot;*** are you doing sitting down?&quot; then you bet you are going to have a very defensive player screaming at you for being a know-it-all. Use some diplomacy, try some subtle hints, etc.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, plenty of new shaman players, or shaman twinks, already have a &quot;I'll play my class the way I want&quot; mentality. It's frankly a pretty stupid attutude, considering you are playing a support class, and everybody in the group is depending on you to play your class well in order to survive. Now, of course know-it-alls are annoying, but they ARE trying to improve their chances for survival. If you can't take constructive criticism, then perhaps you should rethink why you wanted to join a group. Remember, it's not personal, they are only trying to help you, so you can help them stay alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I am lvl 36 and at 35 was in FM trying to &quot;solo prestige&quot; a HG.  It took me a few times but I did it.  I tried tanking it with pet.  Big mistake took me out real quick.  Tried root and rot.  Nope root wouldnt take and either would malaise to debuff it.  My solution was to dot and run like a chicken with dog nipping at its heals.  Well it worked.  The giant hit me maybe 4 times before he was in his death walk with back turned to me.  I am not twinked and I don't think non-twinks can tank mobs solo as well as you think they do.  I was going to go ac hp all the way but now I think I will sit right in the middle and balance things out.  But I will admit that tanking to keep your defense skills up is a must.  What I do is go next to guards at outpost in OT and tank a mob as long as possible till I run and let the guards kill it if I can't take it down.  Sounds like a waste of exp but it sure makes the ac go up without having to buy armor.  I know Im not in the &quot;high end&quot; game yet but isn't it best to able to play either way?  I'm sure not going to stand there and die to a mob tanking it just because I don't want to look like a druid.  And it would be really nice to know what some of the PVP oracles have to say on the matter.  What is a fight like Oracle vs. Oracle?  Who wins ac hp, wis mana or something else.  That I really would like to see.</div></div><hr />

You have to look at these &quot;problems&quot; with who your referring as stupid newbs with a more open mind...we have all read the many many threads on gear, asked for advice on here, and looked at each other's brag pages (IE Magelo) and taken that to figure out what we should be wearing for gear.<br />
We have also read various threads on how to dance right, how to set up hot keys for dancing, etc and use that in our day to day play, be it low end exp grinding or high end raids.<br />
Newer players to the game have no clue that these pages even exist, have no clue hot to play ANY class other than by what they see or hear in their newbie zones. When you first started the game did you even have any clue how powerful a shaman can be? Nope and dont lie and say you did. <br />
I will be the first to admit, in my low 20's I wanted a Testament of Vaneer (or however you spell that darn thing), but I was clueless as to how to play a shaman and what it meant to be a shaman, I just played as a druid with buffs and no snare /shrug.<br />
But I met a few other shaman that NICELY (key word here people) guided me as to what my class defining abilities are and what better to do. They didnt call me an idiot, or tell me that I was wrong, they gave USEFUL, CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, something that many people that post here sorely lack.<br />
If I am on an alt and see a new shaman not cannibalizing, I politely ask why he is not, if I see him packing a book in his off hand, I ask why....basically you have to approach things with tact and with useful advice, not harsh thrashing.<br />
Now I know better, now you do too, its why your a level X shaman and still climbing, earning AA points or regular exp. Its why your guild is always thankful that your there on a raid, its why your welcome in groups. Dont forget that you had to learn somewhere and that you either did it old school way (IE hard knocks) or you read a thread on here about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems an everyday occurence to see lvl 40-50 wars,rangers,rogues with weapons that they sould not have unless they were in a ubber guild and upper 50's.  That is helped the new shamans loose the path of what a shaman can really do IMO.<br />
<br />
This is hurting the shaman class as a whole because new shamans dont really relize how effecient a shaman can be and why a good shaman will never be OOM<br />

<br />
Good point, over 3 years EQ probably sees more alt/twinks in the lower levels as opposed to fresh-meat joining EQ for the first time.<br />
<br />
With the saturation of good gear placed on  lower level PCs, I'd imagine that present day up-and-coming shaman aren't as hard pressed to keep that  meatshield decked out in buffs.  Where there was a time when shaman of yore had to hustle their a$$es off at the lower levels to keep up with the action and demand, now they might find themselves with more breathing room to do stuff, or to do nothing. . .while in groups.<br />
<br />
So with low demand due to better gear on the melees, could it be that today's low-shaman skills are &lt;a href=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?atrophy&gt;atrophying&lt;/a&gt; (gotta use my big word of the day)?  So will these low to mid-level folks never appreciate what the old-farts had to earn until they too hit post 50 levels?  Or will the advent of another expansion just worsen this disparity?<br />
<br />
So taking Karadan's thought and running with it: any disgust that people are expressing over the ignorance or obstinance of the low-levels is really just a natural turn in the decline of EQ civilization.<br />

Let's a gather into a circle, clasp each others hands and meditate on such a tragic thought. . . .</div></div><hr />

Much as I wish that were possible, it ain't gonna happen with any weapon that I'm familiar with. Conservatively, lets figure in interrupts and resists and use an average of 23DPS on a JBB. With around 200str against a low blue you hit around 40% of the time, you can also figure that average damage will be around double base damage for any weapon (against a low blue). Fudge some numbers and you'd need about a 42/35 weapon with a Cloak of Flames and Shissar (100% haste) to eaual JBB damage. ... and note that the best case for meleeing, against a low lvl blue. I haven't parsed damage against higher level stuff lately. <br />

<br />
On the more general subject raised in this thread, seeing a leather shaman doesn't bother me. My guildies and I don't agree on shaman equipment, why should I expect a stranger to. Otoh, a shaman who can't handle agro is a waste, imo. I'd rather have a chanter slowing. <br />
<br />
As far as tanking goes, I do it constantly. Admitteldy, not as the main tank in a group except on Guardian Wurms where I can mana dump to help kill em quick and keep agro while the tank gets behind him to avoid 530pt ripostes. Heck, I've tanked one of the unslowable elite guards in Ssra for almost the entire fight. Dotted too early and kept agro, ... I'm still not sure how the cleric managed to keep me alive on that one (or why he bothered &lt;g&gt;). <br />
<br />
I do tend to off-tank almost everying in my groups. It lets the melees concentrate on killing the main mob faster while I root park the adds or just keep em busy while the enchanter mezzes. In any kind of an overpull, I'd much rather have the mobs beating on me than the cleric or chanter. I'm a big fan of Tigir's for just that reason (thank God it doesn't cause agro when resisted). <br />
<br />
I do have to admit that last weekend I ran across a leather shaman that bothered me. I was off to HS to help a friend and decided to head over there a few minutes early. My last attempt to solo the zone in (at 55) ended after about 10 seconds and 2 harm touches. I figured this time there would at least be a cleric on the way to rez me if it all went horribly wrong again. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I zone in and the only two people in zone are a 60 druid and 59 shaman camping zone in. Epic shaman is wearing a lime green BP, leather skirt and light blue boots (no clue what those were). I sit down to watch a bit till my group shows up and the druid is actually doing all the tanking! <br />
<br />
Much as the druid impressed me, having a druid tank while a shaman meds is just WRONG! Sheesh, it's embarrasing. <br />

As far as using canna, i think canna is a skill,  you cant just pound that canna bottom. the trick is to be sitting then the mana tick comes and  standing/canna when its not. me .. i put on regrowth and when my health ticks i jump up and canna , sit right bakc down , by the time the visual effect/sound effect runs out im ready to tick again , jump up and repeat . you cant deny the difference when you do that</div></div><hr />

Couple nights ago we had a guildie group working the front of Ssra Temple in the Grey.  55 Warrior, 56 Paladin, 55 Enchanter, 53 Shaman (me), 55 Shaman, and 54 Necro.<br />
<br />
The Necro tanked a slowed Timeless Golem.  Everyone backed off, he broke mezz and tanked the golem for his pet.  We all just stood around and waited for him to be a paste on the ground, but he ended fight at 100hlth and 70mana.  510 AC, 1100hps or so, skinny little dark elf.  It was quite impressive.  I challenged him to do the same with an unslowed mob, but he declined. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually a 55+ tank will still have Defensive up for a while after the slow lands, and a warrior can parry and riposte the GW's ripostes fairly often, aside from parrying and riposting the normal wurm attacks.  Yes, I tank stuff regularly (I rarely have a chanter around and am usually the crowd control) and focus my gear on HP and AC, I have maxed Defense and all that (I'm a million miles from uber but I manage to break 3khp and about 1070ac with buffs from a low-50's cleric)... but my lifebar drops noticeably faster than my warrior friend's if I take aggro from him on a GW.  'Course, I don't have Torpor, which is why I'm killing GW's in the first place. ;)  I just don't see myself tanking a GW as a 58 shaman being more practical than a 59 warrior with defensive up tanking it.  YMMV and all, and I'm sure Torpor changes things considerably. ;)<br />
<br />
Back on topic... I'm not on low or even mid-level pickup groups much (if at all) anymore, but if I see shaman not canni'ing, I ask politely in tell why not.  They tell me it isn't faster than medding, almost invariably.  Then I ask them if they want to know a trick...they'll almost always say yes.  Then I explain (politely) how to dance, and most of them see the difference.  If they don't... I did my part. :)  If the conversation continues, I point em to these boards.</div></div><hr />

Last time I was in SF hunting GWs, I was 57 or 58 <br />
doing a marathon 10 day Ragefire camp with a friend. Maybe 60 GW total and the only decent spell we got was Pox, which I already had. Haven't been able to force myself to go back since then. At the time, we usually didn't have the luxury of a defensive warrior, group was usually a 60 monk, 58 cleric and me. Monk goes stonestance till I stick Malx and slow, then I'd stack cripple, BoN and EB to keep agro and kill it quick. Worked surprisingly well with the cleric usually ending up around 50% mana after spamming Divine Light on me.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how having a defensive warrior around would have changed the equation. Certainly he could have been healed a lot more efficiently (even w/o defensive) but the fight is going to last a lot longer with the warrior only doing <br />
a fraction of his usual damage and me unable to stack dots at will because I'm afraid to catch agro. Figure with 2 BoN, 2 EB and assorted JBB clicks, I did between 8 and 9k worth of damage during the first 2 minutes of the fight. Woulda been even nicer at 59 with Pox.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm advocating this strategy on other mobs, I just thought it was a nice counter-example for the shaman-can't/shouldn't-tank crowd and heck, it's a rush to tank something that hits for over 500! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">When learning how to play a shaman, it has taken me 60 levels to at least get a bettter understanding of the many great things we can do.  Gear, your hit points, AC, acquiring new spells, and the roster of your group will determine how to buff, debuff, dot, and heal.<br />
<br />
While some shaman might be terrible, hopefully as knowledgeable shaman ... you can learn from their errors or even suggest to them a better way for them to play.  When we were growing/leveling up we learned from experience and advice.  <br />
<br />
Even though many here might be oracles, as a whole I would rather take the time to help a fellow shaman then condemn them.<br />
<br />
On another note, it's good to know there are bad shaman out there cause at least it gives you an idea where you stand in the mix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't sit anymore.. it's always chain cannibalize and heal as necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Am I the only one that thinks the role of a Shaman and his prefered gear changes through the levels?<br />
<br />
Gosh, I was a leathery wisdom type Shaman in my teens, I even tried to camp some books (but the guy in Highpass Hold never came, pity me), I wore some frigging EFREETI BOOTS!<br />
<br />
I needed that mana, I was the mainhealer for untwinked tanks in that time, a manapool too small and I couldnt keep up healing after a new round of buffs.<br />
<br />
After drawing more aggro with my slows and the realization what Cannibalize could do to me, I grew into balancing (lowering) my Manapool according to my role in the group. I had Wisdom Gear and AC-gear, which I changed as needed. I gave away my Wisdomgear once I realized I didnt use it anymore.<br />
<br />
Then, many levels later I switched to HP-gear so that I can safely cannibalize while in combat. I once again have two sets of gear, HP-heavy and some Gear to bring up my <br />
AC to higher levels if the zone warrants it.<br />
<br />
Dont tell the people what they should do. Tell them how they can achieve best what they want to do. The Shaman class is about versatility, everybody who only plays them one way misses some of that. Yes, today I shake my head in wonder about leather shaman in Wisdom gear, but if they are smart and willing to experiment, they will find their own balance. Getting smeared into a pulp with every slow resist is a sure way to think about different equipment. Or different playstyle.<br />
<br />
If their playstyle does allow them to play druid-like Shaman and they have fun with it, who are you to tell them otherwise. Sure, they are holding themself back, but they are not neccesarily stupid. They may like to prefer that playstyle, the may be happy with their role and never tried anything different.<br />
<br />
And do you really think somebody who reads &quot;High AC gear, go AC and HP&quot; here and decks out in AC gear just because you told him is any smarter? Ive seen Wis Shaman that do wonders at avoiding aggro, dancing on the verge of destruction if they time their spells bad, and Ive seen lousy AC shaman that dont know the word timing because they ran around in a hard shell from level 1 on and dont care if a mob hits them or not.<br />
<br />
There are good Shaman and bad Shaman everywhere. Who can be the judge? The environment and their success, certainly not other people that preach their prefered tactics without anybody asking.<br />
<br />
Sorry if thats a bit flamelike, dont want to annoy anybody. Just point out that too much selfrighteousness is not a merit, but a flaw! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">have to agree that undercutting canni is foolish.  Learn how to cannidance.  Put it on a button if you like.<br />
<br />
And I strongly disagree that &quot;in your 30's 40's and early 50's you can't tank.&quot;  I tanked like crazy during those levels, and even did it at 52 with 120 wisdom.  You can't tank if you dress like a druid, true.  And if you're like 90% of all new shamans and closer to 100% of all twink shamans, you ARE dressed way too much like a druid(if not entirely) and have spent as much time as possible doing the root/DOT business, and your defense completely sucks. <br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many shamans I see at high levels, even in the top guilds on my server, who are afraid to take a punch.  They wait till it really doesn't matter anymore to slow because they're terrified of being hit.  Their defense doesn't max till their high 50's, if not level 60.  And they play as if it never maxed at all.<br />
<br />
Shamans are very powerful and flexible, but the moment you start saying &quot;can't,&quot; there's a very strong chance you're starting to describe your own shortcomings and, well, screw-ups.<br />
<br />
Further, there are plenty of good places to level.  Much depends on your gear of course.  At 52 I got a JBB I think, and made great experience in Cobalt Scar and Emerald Jungle.  I also did Spirod Isle in Timorous Deep.  I did Cyndreela up until somewhere around that level, and then did the wizards in Neriak.  When I could get in a group there, I did fine in Chardok and Velks.<br />
<br />
I also think most shamans do a really crappy job with their pets.  I see them losing their pets all the time because they just don't see things through -- or else they get so frustrated or pessimistic that they just don't summon them at all.  If your pet is getting killed too much, call it back from the fight or conduct part of the fight out of range of the dog's guard point.  Lead the mob back, or lead the dog in, when the time is right.  I virtually never lost a pet and still almost never do, because I paid attention to what was going on and learned from my mistakes.<br />
<br />
I too notice that most shamans these days suck.  I often play my monk as a single, and a great many shamans refuse to buff or put on regrowth.  If you're VERY luck you get a HoS and that's IT.  No AC buff, no HP, no nada else.  I'd say well over half of the shamans I meet in pick up groups are like that.  Some are even too low mana to heal or even slow because they fall in love with their DOTs or(shudder) their DD blasts.<br />
<br />
See a lot of other classes doing that too -- druids and clerics who won't buff, chanters who won't mez, etc.  Fact is, a lot of people these days are bots.  Worse yet, they're know-it-all bots, who can't take the slightest bit of people saying, hey, are you AFK?  What's up?  How come you're not doing &quot;X&quot; (your job).  But some are not bots, just twinks, which some people figure is a license to leave your brain on t.v. while you play, since you already know everything anyway and people should be glad someone like you is around in the first place.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I grimace sometimes when a shaman is in the group because I've come to expect the worst, and more than half the time, I see it.  But on the other hand, I'm well aware after a long time of being 60 what the difference is when you get a shaman who knows what he's doing.  A lot of which really comes down, in the end, to actively thinking through what you're doing and adapting, the best strategy for any class.  Both know-nothing/know-everything twinks and old-timers can be too fossilized to do that.</div></div><hr />
