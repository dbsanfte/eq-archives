<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to hit level 59 on my Shaman, and I have 0 aa's to my name :(  I have been trying to get caught up with some friends, but lately most of them do not play that often so that incentive has less meaning now.  I regularly log on and search for groups for hours and usually end up trying to solo for a bit of exp while I do this, but solo exp at level 58 isn't exactly quick (at least in the places I have tried soloing).  What I am curious about is if it would be a better move for me to start working on AA's during the times I am LFG and soloing to make some progress towards getting Cannibalization.  <br />
<br />
I've read some posts and guides here about AA's and alot of people recommend waiting in most cases, unless you have Torpor (to make use of Cannibalization).  I do not have Torpor unfortunately, nor do I have Quiescence.  What would you all recommend for my situation?<br />
<br />
Also, if I do decide to solo during my LFG times, what zones would you all recommend for good clean AA exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You do have Stoicism, so you can use that for Cannibalization.  This is what I did until I was able to purchase Quiescence.  Canni V is a life changing event; sometimes it could turn the tide if you are oom, canni v pops, canni, and crit heal to save your dying tank.  This happened to me quite a few times :P<br />
<br />
I would get level 60 first.  Turgurs will slow 75% for you at 60, and after you have a little xp buffer, work on AAs to purchase Canni V.<br />
<br />
For places to solo xp: I think you have a few options.<br />
<br />
1) Sebilis - I see that you are keyed there.  Earn some plat and make some xp.<br />
2) Get your Hollowing Stones Key - you can get xp as well as work on getting goo for epic 1.5 if you are working on it.<br />
3) Chardok -  you can work your way towards zone out, slaughtering mobs in your wake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I second the level 60 idea - Get a slight buffer, say 3 blue bubs into it and you won't have to worry about de-leveling hopefully...It will take less time than you think.<br />
<br />
I did 3 AA points in Innate Regen and 3 points in Run Speed in the 50's.  Now at 63, I want Canni5...But to get Canni5, you need Mental Clarity first...So, now I am grinding AAs solo and grouped.   :mad: <br />
<br />
Anyway, the fastest xp I found at 58+ was in xp groups in POValor.  If you are solo, try Natimbi, Nadox, Even Fungus Grove (if you really want to know the meaning of grind, hehe) <br />
<br />
In order of difficulty, I would rate FG lowest difficulty, but lowest xp as well, followed by Nadox, followed by Natimbi as most xp, most risk.<br />
<br />
Old Sebilis would be good if you like to make some decent coinage on a regular basis, but you need to go in a ways to get past the LB mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How fast do you level would be my question.  I guess what I'm saying is.  When you are LFG, peeps look at your LVL not your AA's.  I would suggest lvl'ing all the way to at least 65 maybe 70.  Once you get higher lvl'd you can get groups easier...at least that is what I found.  I stopped at 60 and 62 for AA grinding and to be honest, it wish I would have bowled through.  Another reason why I wouldn't stop at 60 is because then you may feel obligated to buy/camp your lvl 60 spells which are all pretty much upgraded between 60 and 65.  Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I guess I should make note that I have all of my level 60 spells now waiting in the bank for when I hit level 60, including Torpor!!  I have alot of my 61-65 spells, (missing Quiescense and Fo7, but that is about it).  <br />
<br />
I do not level very quickly due to limited time I have to play, and the little time that my friends are on, and the fact that everyone seems to look for 60's+ for people to group with.  I had the strangest situation last night though.  I usually never see Cleric's lfg on my server when I am lfg, but for 2 hours I saw 3 clerics LFG (levels 56, 56, and 57).  While I was LFG I was helping a friend get some exp on his paladin, and once he leveled I sent a tell to one of the clerics asking them if they wanted to try forming an Adventure group.  She said that she already had a group forming up so she asked me to join.  After that we got our group up to 5 people, and figured we might as well ask a second cleric.  That was the first time I think I have ever grouped with 2 clerics at the same time :0  Is it just me, or is finding a group getting harder for everyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bullian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The way i do it is, i go for AAs when i solo. the xp is slow and really not going to make you xp bar go anywhere but will help in the AA bar. <br />
When in an xp group i go full xp. just my 2 cp's worth. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwynfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure it's the most efficient way to do it, but if you're not into min/max'ing I've found it a good comrpomise. Since about 55th (just hit 58th now) I've set AA exp at 50%. By the time I hit 60th I'll have Mental Clarity 3 and be ready for Cann 5. For now, I find that Regen 3 is a real bonus with Cann 4, plus a couple of hp regen items and my Spiritseer neck. When I hit 60 I'll AA grind for a piece to ensure that I have a well rounded character (also working on group leadership and tradeskills). As the ranking shaman in my guild (the guild is strong on clerics and DPSers, ok on casters, but not to good on the tank/slower/all rounder front), I feel it is more important for me to have depth so I can adapt to any situation, whether it be a Grummus raid or helping others with epics/quests.<br />
<br />
For soloing, I recommend Natimbi. If you're the cautious type, go north of the camp and pull turtles back to the camp with slow, root them, rot them, and let the pet go to work. I use slow, PE, anathema then cripple, and finish off meleeing to ensure I keep raising my pierce and 1hb skills. When the turtles/stonemites run out, go for a quick dip and grab a couple of crayfish. Squid under the bridge are fun too. Just be sure to keep lots of fish scales handy. I find I don't solo long before I get a souls group, or a group in my new favourite spot, at the top of the stairs behind the souls. Masruqs, hynids, lots of the named versions, and pull nocs from the other side. Just watch for the Cragbeast Queen.. she be a mean one hitting for 4k+ a chomp.<br />
<br />
On Xegony I have no problems getting groups. Slowers are always being called for in PoI, PoN, PoV, PoD, and the tanks/DPSers always crave those shammy buffs. I'm oft-times on with my cleric firiend, who is also 58th (we ensure we stay within about one yellow of exp by fiddling the AA exp %). With a cleric/shaman base to a group we swiftly fill the remaining slots with, usually, one tank and 3 DPSers, or a tank, 2 DPSers and a caster. Our best group for LDoNs seems to be something like Shm, Clr, 2 of Bst/Rog/Mnk, 1 of Nec/Enc/Mag/Wiz and 1 of War/Ber/Pal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just in case you didn't know, you don't need fish scales anymore :)  Everlasting Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2881&amp;source=Live) the level 51 version of Enduring Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=86&amp;source=Live) doesn't require them.  I need to get Gates one of these days so I can get me one of those necklaces :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm very much in your situation with levelling and play time and I totally recommend getting 60. There may be some debate when you get certain AAs but having recently reached 60 myself, it is every bit worth getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I have decided to go to 62 and then stop for AA's until I am satisfied :)  I have all of my level 62 spells, but only a limited amount of my 63, 64, and 65 spells.  I am choosing to do it this way because of the insane rate my friend is getting AA's while grouped with me in Valor.  He is 62 and has gotten 5 AA's in the same time I have gotten 3 orange bubbles of experience.  At that rate I could have Cannibalize 5 in a couple of weeks and I think that will make a big difference in my mana regen capabilities and give me time to save up money for my missing 63-65 spells.</div></div><hr />

Level or go for AA's anyway you see fit.......There is no right way to play, it is after all a game.......Do whatever makes you happy and above all make sure you are having FUN.....If ya ain't having fun then why the heck are ya even playing?   ;) ............All of the above suggestions are very good.....whatever fits your play style and goals is the one to pursue......All that being said level 60 is sort of a &quot;epiphany&quot; level when the power of a character dramatically increases....I believe that is why many folks recommend getting to 60 :D <br />
