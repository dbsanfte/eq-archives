<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I am a long time EQ player that has recently moved to the MAC server. There is only one server right now and pop reaches all of 150 at peak. I am having a ball playing. It is rather refreshing to ask someone if they would like SoW and hear them reply &quot;What is SoW?&quot;. <br />
<br />
I have to say I have a new found respect for shaman. I had always thought you were an overpowered class that whines far too much :) But I never knew what a hard grind it is getting to 34th! The 19th level spells did not help much and 23rd almost broke my heart. I now realize any shaman that makes it to the high levels has paid some dues to get there. <br />
<br />
I have a question regarding Totemic. Should I get Totemic or raise Smithing and get Imbued Ogre Splintmail. While Totemic is better I am sure I do not know if the time required to get it justifies the item. What are your opinions regarding Totemic?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're going to Smith anyways...  may as well grind for the Barb Cultural, the Shaman Chain is very nice.     Totemic really isn't very good armour and the game being as it is, Even Ry'gorr and the Kunark drop Jarsath armours are superior.<br />
<br />
Totemic is pre-kunark quest armour.    Considering how long it takes to quest, there are better options available to you for less work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Wargbearjumper<br />
<br />
Besides, totemic costs so much... the Dufrenite was like 170p per piece... I know the mac server is new but somebody is going to be farming Ry'Gorr soon and it can't cost that much more than 170p.</div></div><hr />

Quick question for you Bufr(and forgive me for not having really anything to add to your question);<br />
<br />
How many expansions are open now at the start of EQMac? It was my original assumption it was going to just be classic EQ at first, but is EQMac starting at classic----&gt;PoP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only expansion MAC players don't have yet is the LoY expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All but LoY is correct. With the PoP so low I do not know if we will be getting LoY anytime soon. Also the software is a couple of &quot;builds&quot; behind the currect EQ. We do not have chat channels working. You can not play in window mode. The group EXP mods have not been updated. (WHich can be a blessing depending on point of view :) )<br />
<br />
Also there are couple of annoying bugs. Windows will lose focus. You may hit a hot key and get no response or start typing a command like '/reply Hello' and get nothing. You have to left click in the play field or in the chat window to get it to work. Also you can hit a keystroke combo that seems to repeat last command over and over. (This may be a feature on the MAC.) This happens when I am turning occasionally and I get stuck in a merry-go-round until I left click in middle of screen and hit a direction arrow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my opinion dont do Totamic.  It came out before all the expansions where the was better sources of armour.<br />
<br />
When i started on FV it was basicly the same, just higher population.  And i did not do totamic quest, the only piece that would be usefull is the helm, which isnt bad.  and Wis doesnt hurt to all you anti wis people.  Especialy when there arent many High HP items easy to get.<br />
<br />
I had a LOT of banded growing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember the first time seeing myself in banded.  Had to trade a few HQ bear pelts to get a full set =p .  Man, no equipment upgrade to this day can rival the first time I saw myself in metal at the character select screen.  I was so excited haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i went out and did the totemic when I was a new starting out shaman...their really was only two pieces that I didn't get..and one of them was the bp (stupid grizzleknot...I just didnt' feel like sitting there camping him since the treats beat my ass hardcore when I tried to solo them once).<br />
<br />
Honestly..it depends on what you want for your shaman.  Granted...I searched around for my totemic pieces and did them not cause it was the best armor out there...but cause I wanted to feel like a real shaman..therefore I did the quests that shaman long ago had to do.  If you want to feel like the shaman of old..then do them...otherwise like what has been said..the quest results themselves doesn't make it worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looking back on it, the Totemic quests were some of the most fun quests in game back then, especially for the levels they were intended for. I recall the absolute RUSH I felt when ol' Grizzleknot wandered through our Paw Spire camp when I was 34 and had just gotten my pet. My group quickly dispatched him so I got my pet and my Totemic BP in the same day. Talk about a feeling that kept me coming back to the game?!<br />
<br />
The things we take for granted now days is really a shame. It may not be the best gear today, but back then, and for the levels it was intended to serve, Totemic rocked. And the quests were a lot of fun as well, at least for me they were.<br />
<br />
BTW...Bufr...is Norrath the same on the MAC version? IE, do zones/mobs look the same/have the same lore, or did they change it up a bit like they did for EQOA? What's the quality of the graphics? If different than that of the PC version, mind posting a screenshot or two (links would be fine. embedded images can be a pain for some).<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I thought the totemic quests were fun, BUT that was a different day.<br />
<br />
IMO, jump on the early adopter train and start smithing.  Banded should sell pretty well to start, maybe some fine plate, then you have to chunk through the stupid farming part, but who knows at that point, you might be of the right level for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The MAC versuion looks just like EQ prior to LoY. The zones are identical. I do not believe Veksar is present though. The UI is the current XML stuff and you can use the player made UIs it seems. Overall the experience is the same as the PC excpet there are 93 people playing on a Saturday afternoon. Most I have seen in Paludal has been 14 players and this is a brand new server.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do the totemic quests.  They are extremely good quests.  I do remember the thrill of being awoken by my brother in the middle of the night telling me Grizzleknot was up, and me racing over from Oggok praying no one would kill him.  I remember binding down in the underwater caves in Everfrost Peaks and failing to find the giant bear several times.. and after almost giving up I remember the adrenaline pumping when the humongous bear was finally up!<br />
<br />
Do the cannibalize 2 quest too.<br />
<br />
You get very little reward from these quests except for the satisfaction you get from doing such great quests-- if you're new to the game, these quests will have you flying all around the world.  It was great for me to learn places I've never been to before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Indeed a different time, are the totemic quests worth it?  It definitely was worth it for me at the time, but it was the best I could get and it was really fun and felt like an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
The parts arent that hard save for the bp and Grizzleknot, if you do decide to do them, I wouldnt waste much time on the bp, I ended up buying the drop from someone and multiquesting it.<br />
<br />
Would I do them again if I started fresh on another server?  I started a warrior on another server (and wife started cleric) and we quested all of that armor except for the bp which I found a great price on, so my answer is, probably.  Would it be the best equipment you could get your hands on?  No, with the bazaar, you probably will find better stuff.<br />
<br />
I would say try them, but dont waste a rediculous amount of time on any one piece, do them when they are level appropriate and you will get experience as well.  My totemic served me well up to my high 40s and low 50s before I started replacing it with Jaundiced Bone.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if it seems Im hijacking your thread again Bufr<br />
<br />
But I have to respond to this reply by Valgoth,<br />
I had a similar experience as I was 34 at the time as well..it was one of the biggest rushes Ive had in my EQ life too :) I was running around at night, in the rain. I came upon what I thought was just a regular old Treant for me to hack down when low and behold my target came back &quot;Grizzleknot&quot;. Man that got my heart going and I was just -barely- able to take him down solo for the kill...took awhile to get some people go Kedge though. <br />
<br />
Had the same feeling months later when I took down Quilmane(sp?) months later.<br />
<br />
I wrote this in a post somewhere but Ill re-say it here...new players are at a loss since they'll never get to experience that golden age of EQ when it was a mystery.<br />
<br />
Hope true newb MacEQ players are getting to experience that same feeling :) well, and you too Bufr ;)</div></div><hr />
