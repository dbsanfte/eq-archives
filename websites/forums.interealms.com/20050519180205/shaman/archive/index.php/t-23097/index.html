<br />
August, 11th Update 3:00pm<br />
<br />
- Wake The Dead code has changed to allow for future improvements. You shouldn't notice any changes but please /bug if you do.<br />
<br />
- Changed proc'ing so that you can now proc for an item and from a contact innate buff in the same round.<br />
<br />
- The switch to Aerin Dar's lair now has floor collision. You should no longer fall inside of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Couple of sleepers, but #2 can be significant to melee classes, especially ones that with self buff procs.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking of changes.<br />
<br />
Yesterday a friend was in Karnors and died to Verix Kylox's Remains.  He ran back to KC and waited for me to help him get back since he was naked.  By the time I got there his corpse had popped to the zone in.  I don't remember this change.  How long have corpses popped to zone in's in Kunark zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luccus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a nice change I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed yet. We now get 2 MGB =)<br />
<br />
Whenever I cast MGB Fo7 there is always some people it won't stick on because of there other buffs (Wiz shield with + mana regen, and others). Right after the message of &quot;This spell did not land on your target&quot; (or whatever it says)  I get the yellow text for the &quot;This ability timer has been reset&quot; just like when you interrupt on VP or other hotkeyable AA abilities. So then I get a chance for a second MGB, which is usually Stamina and that always lands on everybody.<br />
<br />
So it's a sweet bug for now if you're the only shaman with MGB on a raid, which I usually am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen it from time to time, but since I die less now I just assumed that still happened occasionally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I recall, you had to die in lava for your corpse to pop at the zone line.</div></div><hr />
