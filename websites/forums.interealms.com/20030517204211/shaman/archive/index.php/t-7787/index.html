<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zygan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if anyone can show me how to create a macro to indicate to the group that a monster has been slowed.  Is that possible?  Sometimes I cast a spell on an npc and it gets resisted and still the message pops up.  Basically all I want is for the message to appear when the monster is actually slowed, but if it gets resisted, then it won't appear.  I apologize if this is confusing!  <br />
<br />
Do most of you high level shamans bother creating a macro to indicate to a group that your healing &quot;%t&quot; or slowing whatever monster?   Please let me know.<br />
<br />
One last question.  What is the name of the snare necklace for troll innoruk worshippers?  Thanks :)!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't be done. All you can do is create a hotkey that tells the group / raid etc that the mob is slowed and hit it when you see the slow take hold.<br />
<br />
I only call slows on raids, I dont do it in groups, the people I group with are competent players who invariably have spell messages for the group turned on and can see slows when they land, the only time I'll comment on slows in an exp group is when it won't land or we're in danger of wiping and the group needs some reassurance.<br />
<br />
I never call that I'm about to slow or trying to slow something either, nothing more annoying than spamming people with irrelevant information over and over again.<br />
<br />
I do call torpor and kraggs in groups due to the negative side effects / cast time, I dont hotkey quick heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to have spell cast IN the macro that said mob was slowed.<br />
<br />
I got tired of spell being resisted and message going out.<br />
<br />
So I have 2 hot keys right next to each other.<br />
<br />
One is the spell icon for Slow.<br />
<br />
One is the macro saying the beastie has been declawed.<br />
<br />
That way group gets correct information.  Except on some mobs in POP. :D<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mine just says /g 'Hey..%T is slowed. Hit it faster!' <br />
It sits apart from the actual spell-icon hoykey.. so if it resists.. I don't tap the group message. Found it easier than having to then say /g 'nope,.. he resisted..'. <br />
Grp's have enuff spam as it is.</div></div><hr />
