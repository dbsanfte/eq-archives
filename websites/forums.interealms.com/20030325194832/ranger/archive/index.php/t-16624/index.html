<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>A_Ranger00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some opinion about what next...<br />
<br />
My AA now:<br />
<br />
General<br />
Run3, Regen 3<br />
<br />
Arch:<br />
CF2, CA1, CS1, FB1<br />
<br />
Class:<br />
EQ, AM3, Innate camo<br />
<br />
3aa banked.<br />
<br />
What should I go next? :confused: <br />
<br />
I am thinking should I go for more crit (CF,fury of age) or go for extra stat (Dex/sta/ND) or other way I didn't think of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're using archery primarily, finishing off CF3 and getting FoA3 might be a good choice.<br />
<br />
  I'm also a big fan of the first level of GotF, just for the fact that it bugs wolf form, and I despise the illusion part. <br />
<br />
  ND and PE are also good skills, since you've already done CS1 and CA1, if you grab ND1, and then PE, you'll get a cheap bonus to HP and defensive skills.  <br />
<br />
  I took a lot of the melee skills myself, as quite often mobs are shoved in the wall.  It's not as big of a deal now with PoP, but depending on what you're killing, you may want to consider ambi and/or ferocity as well.<br />
<br />
  Now that you've got the archery stuff done, you can start to have more fun with them, pick the ones you think will help you personally, and go with it.  We all play differently, and there's a /lot/ of good skills for rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps Ambidexterity for when Archery just wont cut it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would go max out the nd line and do pe next thats pretty much what I did after I got am3.  The extra hps really help more than what most of those do and it really goes by quickly.  Then after you get the extra hps you can work on ambi, ferocity, cf or defense skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>amgaladh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">personnally if you are headind to use your bow mainly i can give you what i done just to give you an idea.<br />
Go to CF and then FoH then go to hp line.<br />
i really noticed a true difference each time my crit AA increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3 ND3<br />
<br />
PE<br />
<br />
Combat Fury/Fury of the ages3<br />
<br />
Ferocity3 or Guardians of the forest for a bit of archery boost.<br />
<br />
What I would do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would do ND3 and PE in any order. Lack of hit points is the leading cause of death in everquest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also hon <br />
<br />
Not sure what your equipment is. For example, I do not have a primal bow, but I do have a Primal 2HS -- I chose triple attack 2HS to help proc avatar quicker for bow battles, and increased damage on things like Dain when he is pinned to the wall.<br />
<br />
Then I went back and started working the other AA. <br />
<br />
Just another viewpoint :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For increasing damage per second:<br />
Combat Fury / Fury of the Ages are always good<br />
Ferocity if you melee a lot<br />
Ambidexterity if you dual-wield with a good offhand weapon<br />
Punishing Blade if you use a 2H weapon a lot<br />
<br />
Useful abilities:<br />
Entrap - manaless snare<br />
Innate Camouflage - almost-instant cast invisibility<br />
Guardian of the Forest 1 - brief ATK boost and lets you use wolf form in zones where it's KOS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>A_Ranger00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks heh *more confuse than before* <br />
<br />
I think i will try afew skill for lv 1. MC1, DN1, guardian1 and cast fury1 before I save up for anything big.</div></div><hr />
