<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd do the Ice Forged Shackle quest, and upgrade the plat fire wedding rings to velium fire, but neither is all that major a shift. Go out and level, young ranger...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trueshotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok ty kensi....is the quest hard?????? and does anyone else know if i should do anything else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're out doing the Ice forged Shackles, you might as well try 2 other quests (needs a few people to help you).<br />
<br />
1.   Eye Patch Of Plunder<br />
2.   Helm of The Tracker<br />
<br />
Be warned, there's an extremely long camp for the first quest. Heh heh I got the 2 map pieces that are easiest to get but just can't bring myself to actually do the long camp. <br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He's 47 so the helm of the tracker is still 8 levels off. <br />
<br />
The shackle is a good quest, not soloable at level 47 but with one other those monkies are easy enough.<br />
<br />
Coldain ring quest of course, once you get to ring 8 some can argue it's a good tradeoff for a velium fire wedding ring, certainly it has value as a insta-click item.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Truth quest is possibly doable with friends but if you have a group with you in that area you might be better off killing 4-arms in ME for their rare drops. Nice belt and neck piece are uncommon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ice Forged Shackles is not very difficult and their a good item with pretty good staying power.  The only part that I couldn't solo when I did it (high 40s, I think) was the Holgresh.  Those flying monkeys are casters.  The rest was pretty straightforward.  Allakhazam should have a walkthrough, or you can search on this site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The flying monkeys are a pain, but with one other person along to help you should do fine. Resist gear for them is big though, it helps a TON if they can't land spells on you, or at least not for full damage. Again, resist gear, resist gear, resist gear. If you can bring a healer or even another ranger about your level you should be able to gang tackle them. Just go for the wandering ones though and stay out of the cave. The raptors you need are easily fear kited, so no problem there. I think the shackles quest is a good idea, it is fun and a decent item. Another ranger and I did it for both of us in just a few hours, and we had a blast. <br />
<br />
As far as helm of the tracker, you need to collect a bunch of heads, and one of those (I forget the name) is in the same zone (WL) as the other mobs for the shackle quest. You can't do the turn-in until 55, but if the giant you need is up in WL I would shout in the zone for some more help and grab that head if you can. The other heads are all from Kael in the arena, which you will need some help (usually a Kael raid) getting. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Earring of the Solstice, since you can buy everything in the bazaar and it's a no-fail combine.<br />
<br />
- Chardok rings<br />
<br />
- Bracer of Bene if you have the faction for it.</div></div><hr />
