<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having trouble finding some upgrades for a few of my armor slots.  I know i need to get a 6ac/65hp ring to replace my jagged band, that's my next purchase, but I am also wearing imbued northman ringmail on my legs and wrists that seems like it needed to be replaced.  Any suggestions?  My magelo link is below.  Also, am I just at the point where i'll need to spend a min of 750-1kpp for any upgrades?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the advice so far.  I recently replaced my Beetle Stinger in the ranged slot to a Goranga Idol and replaced my jagged band with a Platinum Fire Wedding Ring.  My guild and I hunted in Burning Woods last night, killing apes, sarnaks and undead since the giants were camped.  It was fun but we didn't have a cleric so we didn't want to try Guller.  We are talking about going back when we have a Cleric to try to kill guller for a Tattered Mantle.  If we can't, I was planning on picking one of those up as well.<br />
