&quot;Focus Items - Biggest balance screwup ever introduced.&quot; is the title. Worth a good few chuckles.<br />
<br />
Also, in a surprising development, VI announced they screwed up! Some focus items got the wrong effects. Amazing stuff.<br />
<br />
Hi all,<br />
We got a few of our focus effects crossed up in this patch, and will be patching servers tonight at 3am PST to fix this issue. The same items will have a focus effect on them, but in some cases we assigned the wrong focus type to a given item. <br />
<br />
We'll be updating them in tonight's patch, so you might want to hold of on any expensive trades until after the patch since the effects on items may change slightly. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

Woo hoo another patch. Thank god for the world cup!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I swear, next time a read a thread full of people complaining that 'casters are overpowered' then mention nothing but wizards, I'm going to go postal...     lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, with endless quiver, and AM3, rangers do OBSCENE amounts of damage on raids. They have always been effective in groups, and yet they have perpetual second class citizen syndrome.<br />
<br />
It is also amusing to watch people like Venture (whose spewings I've read and laughed at for years on the everquest newsgroup) spouting off complete disinformation as inarguable fact.<br />
<br />
As for Furor...he really needs to stop playing (for good, this time), cause he's clearly far too obsessed over a game.<br />
<br />
I look forward to fixing the assignment of effects (like the NoS, or testament of vanear), but I am already a big fan of focus items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Huggem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How did that thread turn into a ranger whine? The first post is a rogue vs wizard thing.<br />
<br />
He's right that wizards (and any nuking class) can get &gt;30% more efficient. Thats pretty big. And it's only on the first items introduced - who knows where the highend items are going to end...<br />
<br />
That's a pretty radical change to gameplay. Naturally people are going to discuss it. That thread is 3 pages long already.<br />
<br />
But dont turn it into a ranger whine, because is isnt.<br />
<br />
And btw, to get am3+eq, you need 45AA points. Plus a good bow, plus a good arrow. Plus its very situational. And trueshot disc refreshes in 72 mins. Not like every ranger is doing INSANE dmg all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh VI balanced it out lo, now casters are a &quot;bit&quot; smarter, casting Ice Comets, Ancient spells etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are now a couple Rangers on my server with Primal Velium Bows, Endless Quivers, and AM3. Obscene may be one way to describe the damage for some, breathtaking came to my mind. <br />
The Ranger class is a powerful, useful, and fun class to play. Good ones have nothing to fear about class imbalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also play a ranger, and the only thing I'm complaining about is they nerfed my happy good effect Cougar Claw earing, into a worthless puddle of assjuice effect wise :(</div></div><hr />
