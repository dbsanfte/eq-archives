<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this on page 5 of the nerf bat thread.....<br />
<br />
Im going to repost this as a new thread because:<br />
<br />
Im interested in seeing how some people view this perspective on the gigantic Affliction *Nerf* issue. I know that some will just flame away blindly..typical, but Im sure there are some with the power of reason here that might actually see a point in this post.<br />
<br />
Ok, <br />
Im sure Im going to lose every friend Ive ever made on this board after this post...but Enkebesh, is the only one of you whos using any logic in this argument. <br />
<br />
Now, I understand when a person is angered they get tunnel vision and its hard for them to see the bigger picture, but for everyone who is sooo quick to blame Sony about this...consider.... <br />
<br />
One of the first lessons I learned in life is...ignorance is no excuse...period. If you do not know every detail about a thing...you have no business doing anything with it. <br />
<br />
I see everyone crying out rage, falling into two groups.... <br />
<br />
1. Those that knew, some where deep down that this would be changed again someday. I mean c'mon...Sony SPELLED IT OUT FOR YOU in a patch message...sure 9 months ago, but it was there in BLACK AND WHITE. This is the group that knew the details of the effect and knew there was always going to be a chance it would change. I would say a -majority- of the player bases is WELL aware of game mechanics...down to number crunching...the effect info has been there for you to read since DAY1. <br />
<br />
2. Then we have the rest who aren't really involved with the mechanics...they wait for the hard-core players to explain things to them...they go solely on what they've been told, which most often proves to be myth. I find its generally not a good idea to trust in mass ideals...research them your self. <br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion neither of these groups can blame Sony. Sony didn't allow you to believe these items were working as intended(as proven by the patch message that keeps popping up in this thread)...YOU let yourself believe this item was working as intended. Now, I understand this is a hard concept to understand for some...but back to my original point...ignorance of -the facts- is no excuse. <br />
<br />
I try to be as respectful as possible, especially on this board that Ive loved for info for three years. The info is few and far between now, one of the only valid arguments Ive read recently is removing the useless stat buffs from our 63-64 line-up. The rest is all bitching about this or that...it all boils down to some un thought !@#$! &quot;Im angry because I cant &quot;win&quot; at EQ. <br />
<br />
Im ready to take my medicine...let the Evel flames roll, but for anyone who looks at things with an adult perspective...you must see a point in taking responsibility for yourselves on this one. Sony has made -allot- of goofs in the past. Nobodies perfect, but Id say they give you a -damn- good product and piece of entertainment for a measly 12$ a month.../shrug. I sight more than warrants this kind of...&quot;The end is near...were all DOOMED&quot; type 5 page post. I really think that -this one- falls in the laps of the players to take responsibility on...think about it after you calm down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I disagree with you on point one.  I wear a Circlet of F-whatever.  Every single day I play I cast innumerable numbers of Malo and Slow spells.  Over the past nine months, bug or not, the amount of time it takes to cast a spell, the manner in which I pull, the mobs I can pull, tank while slowing, etc has all been heavily influenced by the focus effect Affliction Haste III.  Sony has made a change which severely alters the manner and ability with which I can do certain things.<br />
<br />
I did not acquire the item to exploit a bug or to do things I should not be able to do.  I acquiredan item and it has behaved this way for many, many months.  The manner with which the change was made (and I would argue the fact it was made at all) is yet another demonstration of Sony's blatant disregard for customer service and a fundamental lack of understanding of the game.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I have cancelled pre-orders of LoY for my two accounts and I am considering leaving the game altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lyzzt,<br />
with all fairness...you've missed every single one of my points. I maybe should not have posted this...as some will never see outside the box known as anger :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you need to reevauluate what you think this &quot;anger-box&quot; entails... from what I have read in the &quot;other posts&quot; as well as the response here I think you are simply just labeling people that disagree with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There was a point?<br />
<br />
The only point I read was the silly one that said &quot;9 months ago, Sony said it should only impact dots.&quot;<br />
<br />
All well and good, they said that.  And in response to that, people said &quot;this sucks, change it back.&quot;  And, it was changed back.  There was no message, so people asked, &quot;is it supposed to be like this?&quot;  And they got no reply.  They asked again and again, with no reply.  And time passed.<br />
<br />
9 months, 9 months with affliction items glowing for all sort of nifty spells, for classes that, if the people that work on EQ play at all, would have noticed.<br />
<br />
Comprehende?  Don't try to say &quot;they told you so&quot;...yah, they said something 9 months ago, changed it back to how it was very quickly thereafter, never responded to people, and left something that was super obvious in the game for a very long period of time.<br />
<br />
Actions speak louder than words.  And those actions said it was working as intended.<br />
<br />
So, in my opinion, you can't blame the players.  They asked to have the change undone after the first nerf.  They asked again and again for clarification.  And then they made choices based upon what they knew.<br />
<br />
The only people to blame are Sony.  They screwed it up.  They are screwing it up now, making an unnecessary change that doesn't benefit anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Painting every one of us who is frustrated at this as &quot;an angry shaman who isn't thinking logically&quot; = http://forums.off-topic.net/images/smilies/greddy.gif<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a nerfed class, feel free. Don't force it on us.<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be fun. Being nerfed, or &quot;fixed&quot;, call it whatever you want, is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm one of the people who started a shaman within the period between the second time they broke and the nerf. I had no idea it wasn't intended, and I'll explain why I feel the nerf is not necessary.<br />
<br />
The main issue is, our DOT's suck, even at my level (49) they aren't impressive at all. I don't like to use them, poison is way way way to much agro, and disease takes way to much time to work. I solo alot and even in that situation unless I'm fighting mobs with massive HPs, I'm not getting all the damage from disease. In groups slow is enough agro, poison locks the mob on me and while this doesn't much matter cause I tank fine, it causes problems within the group chemistry. Tanks resent me, and some groups have gone so far as to make me MT. The only reason to use any affliction item was for the other detrimental spells it worked with.<br />
<br />
Until they decide to make our DOT's viable, this nerf is a problem, especially to shamans. It's been pointed out (in group situations), it requires 5 seconds to Malo, 2 second or so recast, 3 seconds to slow, then another 2 second or so recast. Thats 12 seconds in a fight that lasts 40 to 50 seconds. Due to agro if we try to use our poison DOT's you'd prolly haveta wait 10 seconds to cast it (and even then you end up with agro a fair amount i'd wager). The alternatives are our underpowered nukes or our rains. Recently wizards did parsing on rains, and even their lure based and -10 resist rain got resisted often enough to make it barely better then their nukes. For us it's even worse so I find this to be an unsatifactory substitute.<br />
<br />
The nerf in a single narrowminded sense isn't huge, but you can't just look at it for itself, you have to look at the whole picture. In the big picture this nerf hurts alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not arguing to argue,  Hrothgar, anyone can stymie my argument right here and now if they can produce -anywhere- at -anytime- Sony told you these items were to be used with slow, malo, ect...<br />
<br />
Now the facts are that Sony told you quite the opposite. My point is that ignorance (ignoring thee facts) is never an excuse.<br />
<br />
They didn't nerf you...you got some free toys for 9 months...You let yourself believe it was forever.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can someone tell me why it's overpowered to be able to have a little longer slow/mez when a wizard can get a nuke that does 20% more damage for the same mana?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think folks are missing the point, nobody is argueing that the change doesn't blow, I think we all agree, it sucks rocks. The point thats being made, at least from the way I read it, is that we -knew- it wasn't supposed to work that way, or would, if we read patch messages or ever looked up the focus effects.<br />
<br />
apples... oranges ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This doesnt affect me personaly since I never had one of the focus items, but....<br />
<br />
It is NOT my responsibility to do outside research to play the game.  All of the outside resources for finding information are just that.. they are outside of the bounds of the game.  It IS Sony's responsibility to tell me of things that will affect my gameplay.  They typicaly do this with patch messages.  <br />
<br />
It is NOT reasonable for an end-user (of any product) to be expected to recall a message from 9 months ago about an item they did not have at the time. (If you had one you should have paid attention to the message saying &quot;Hey, we are changing this!&quot;)  When I encounter an item in the game and try it out (or right click on it) and find that it does XXX, I reasonably expect it to continue to do just that -unless I am notified by Sony otherwise.<br />
<br />
I understand why they changed it. It is well explained, and makes sense.  It is poor business practice to make a change such as this without notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Beyond my argument here, I can empathize with people who were effected and upset by this...Im going to go out on a limb here and make an assumption of my own....<br />
<br />
With this kind of upset they have created...I could see them creating a toned down focus that -dose- effect slows, malo, ect...<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of assuming an fighting posture with Sony, the shamans concerned here can petition to develop this effect...instead of foaming at the mouth doubt a &quot;nerf&quot; that was really a bug to start with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fanboy,<br />
<br />
Sony has spelled out a lot of things in black and white: &quot;Melee will never be able to bind&quot; is probably Absor's most famous quote.  Soulbinders look like they are here to stay so.<br />
A whole new line of focus item was introduced with the PoP expansion.  This was 5 month after the infamous &quot;working now as intended&quot; patch message.  They affected slow, malo etc. No reason to presume otherwise.  I'm a GM potter who made those things, and advertised it to his fellow shaman as being great for slow and malo. Now I'm standing there with egg on my face, because I'm known as someone who usually knows what's going on with the shaman class, and with tradeskills.<br />
This nerf makes a whole class of foci items useless, the affliction haste.  For that deadly quickshot dot?  The other items are marginal to begin with since you rarely see the effect of an extened affliction, or great mana savings from dots.  A shaman that can make a dent in his mana casting dots has aggro to the point of quick removal from the gene pool.  And the additional tick from our poison line of dots is unreliable.<br />
My suggestion would be, change all affliction haste 4 items to 20% haste, and allow them to work on slows again. <br />
Change the AE and EA items to 50% extention/mana savings for dots.  Then people might use them.  The way they are right now they are trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Um, you missed a third category of people, thanks to your amazing ability to label everyone in narrowly defined terms: people who just started playing shaman who never paid attention to affliction focus mesages because we never had any reason to.<br />
<br />
That's me.  My shaman is new, and used these items from his date of creation.  Are you trying to tell me that I've been incompetent because I didn't go back to verify/debunk every rumor that was ever posted on every message board?  That's the message I'm getting.<br />
<br />
There was no mechanism in place to tell me that this was due to occur.  I purchased several expensive items with these effects, solely for debuffs.  There was no patch message about it during any of my shaman-playing time.  I consider that to be an incredible breach of trust.  I trust SonyEQ about as much as I trust most politicians at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Slurm,<br />
That patch message has little do do with the bigger point Im making here....<br />
<br />
How did you learn what that effect did? Did you look it up or did you let someone tell you what it did....If you think about it the only real way any one could have thought the latter was if they bought into mass assumption...in that case....blame the player base into misleading you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sony also told us:<br />
<br />
Manaburn is working as intended and will not be nerfed.<br />

Hell levels can not be removed from the game, the experience coding is too integral to the function of the game to be changed at this late point.<br />

Monk FD is working as intended...then 6 months later Monk FD was never meant to be used to split mobs<br />

<br />
these are just off the top of my head....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">By the way, I agree with the idea to tone down the percentages, keeping them between generic spell haste/extension/efficiency and the current percentages.  I think this would be an excellent compromise, because most items would retain most of their value.  The main reason I'm complaining is that they completely removed a very useful effect, turned it into a useless effect, and destroyed the value of my items.  This compromise would remedy all of those problems in my opinion, because I will not be seeing a spell haste IV item anytime in the future.<br />
<br />
They need to accept that dots will always suck (relatively), and either address the problem by actually changing the spells themselves (duh) or keep the Affliction line of foci very similar to what it has been for the past 9 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">By the way, there are other places to look up focus effects besides Lucy.  You make it sound like that is the only source.  There are a ton of reputable websites that discuss the focus effects, including a nice thread here.<br />
<br />
Was that word of mouth?  I know enough about the game to know how effects work.  I read that X effect does Y, I bought one, and it did exactly Y.  I still fail to see how I was supposed to know that this change was about to occur, or that I am somehow an idiot because the game worked the way I thought it was supposed to.<br />
<br />
Why did I think that?  Because having those effects only work on DoTs is, for the lack of a better term, lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try investing into something because the masses told you it would be good for you. Watch it fold and ask for your money back and see how far that gets you...my point is its an individuals responsibility to research things.<br />
<br />
Im not talking about every patch message or every line of code...Im saying that Xanden is -your- character and thus -your- responsibility to equip...are you going to trust what people tell you wis dose? If so be prepared to blame them if it isn't the effect they promised...Sony didn't promise you that these effect would work with Slow....ever.</div></div><hr />

Personaly I didnt.. I dont have one.  But you right click on the items in game and they tell you the effect(name at least if not actual % like with some other effects).  You equip one, cast some spells see what happens... &quot;Hey, that spell took less mana and cast in half the time&quot;  Thats when Sony becomes responsible for notifying you of changes.<br />
<br />
I agree Sony has no responsibility for correcting information gained from sources outside of the game.  But if its IN game, they should.  They didnt, at least not when the change was made -which IS relevant if you encountered the item after the first message.<br />
<br />
Obviously they dont have to tell you... but it is good business practice to inform your customers of a change to a product or service before implimenting it.</div></div><hr />

Your examples are like comparing apples to oranges...as Sony -never- made any statements that this effect would work with slows, malo...The last -fact- stands at that patch message which they never reversed...it was the assumptions of the player base that is to blame here.<br />
<br />
Are you upset that the game changes? Most the examples you've listed are positive ones and if Sony had ever stated that &quot;Affliction will work with Slow&quot; your argument would be valid.</div></div><hr />

Sony didnt promis that they would, that is true.  But in game investigation (which is really all that is valid, as out-of-game stuff isnt supported by Sony) shows that it does.  Why would you assume that to not be true tomorrow?<br />

That is the implied promise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm asking for is simply for SOE to provide better information. Unofficial spoiler sites are just that, unofficial and most are filled with more bad information than I could ever sort through.<br />
<br />
Is it too much to ask for a list of bugs on the official site so that I can know what will eventually be changed? The fact is that the patch messages are unreliable at best, they do not give accurate information on the intended changes and it is SOE's policy for their CS staff in game to not provide &quot;spoiler&quot; or game mechanics information.<br />
<br />
No Sony never announced that these items WILL work with slow, malo, etc...Just as they never announce anything officially with the intended effect and specifics of items. However, when these items were put into the game they DID work with those for some time. <br />
<br />
Yes, 9 months ago they announced they made a change to the function of the Affliction Focus items, and after much uproar about 1 month later on test those changes were gone, SOE was aware of it and chose to make that change live. At no point did they make any comment that this change was not intentional. And again, it is SOE's policy to not officially divulge specific game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Because of this, it is impossible for me to divine what changes they intend, and which they do not. I do not try to guess at motives for the changes, because that really doesn't matter. But until they provide consistent reliable information on the official website and patch messages in a timely manner then all I am left with are &quot;assumptions&quot;<br />

<br />
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA DO THAT...I just thought it was cool.  I didn't know the effect was 'bugged'...I didn't think I was getting away with something.  I simply had an item that helped me do my job (debuffing) a bit more efficiently.  I didn't know focus items helped with slow..I was pleasantly surprised and continued on my way.  I thought ALPHA was a bug..I KNEW that FoS and Dex buffs shouldn't stack and would be fixed..but this effect never even crossed my mind.<br />
<br />
This is a massive communications gap.  What's next? Are they going to change my epic to &quot;cast infravision'?

<br />
Hehe.  Come on Evel - look at what you've typed BEFORE you hit submit.<br />
<br />
Sony has never told us specific details about a huge majority of the game.  How do you know how much damage a DoT does?  Is it in any literature or a part of any official Sony website?  SOE has never promised us that our DoT's wouldn't turn into heals, debuffs, buffs, resurrection, levitate, or bard songs either, but I know I'd be rather upset if a future patch turned my DoTs into yet another crappy heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">BattleAxe,<br />
<br />
They DID very much so tell everyone (who cares to follow the details closely) that is was -only- intended to work with DoTs. That is fact and was -never- reversed no matter how long this -bug- was left to let the players -assume- that Sony decided to let slows-malo work with Affliction x. It cannot get clearer than that from a logical point of view.<br />
<br />
I usually think quite analytically before I hit &quot;submit&quot;...maybe thats why Im in so much trouble with The Crucible at the moment.<br />
Although I can empathize, Im not blinded by outrage and can see the matter from another angle then just jumping on the Sony is trying to kill us slowly wagon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Nice sidestep, Evel.<br />
<br />
The fact that it made one patch message but was reversed in the very next patch after this same cry went out has obviously escaped you.  As I mentioned - a huge majority of the game is purposefully undocumented officially by Sony.  The fact that this was reversed in the very next patch from the one you're harping on and undocumented is not much of a reason to expect that it was &quot;bug&quot; and not &quot;feature&quot;.  Your logic is flawed in that it ignores the history and methodology of Sony with regards to this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">BattleAxe,<br />
<br />
Your point is stepping into that gray area allot of folks like to play in called &quot;Sony is out to pull a fast one on me and shoot my blood pressure through the roof&quot; or something like that haha. Anyway, Im basing my argument on fact...i.e. things that can be proven. Not the general consensus that Sony is underhanded in how they communicate with their players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Evel - did I say underhanded?  Did I say they pulled a fast one?  No.  I stated that Sony from the beginning of the game has purposefully not documented most of the game.  That is part of the design.  It's why there is no official documentation from Sony that tells you how much damage any specific DoT actually does.  You want facts:<br />
<br />
Fact:  Sony purposefully does not document a large majority of the game.<br />
Fact:  Sony &quot;fixed&quot; the affliction items in June and mentioned it.<br />
Fact:  The fix was reversed in the very next patch after a hue and cry went out, but did not mention it.<br />
Fact:  Sony was made aware by bug reports and Fan Faire discussion of this &quot;feature&quot;, but took no action.<br />
Fact:  6 months later - Sony fixes a &quot;bug&quot; causing Affliction IV items to not work on 60+ spells, and mentions it saying that the items are &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
Given the above - there is no reason for a player to expect that the items were &quot;bugged&quot;.  In fact, players were led to believe that the items working on slow, snare, etc. was a &quot;feature&quot; and that it was how they were intended to function.  To believe otherwise is to fall into your grey area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">your point in fact 3 is yet again an assumption of your own...Indeed Sony dose not spell out every line of code that is EQ for you....but ask yourself....if they made soooo many player angry by removing slow-malo from affliction X...wouldn't it be a great  p.r. op. to say &quot;Hey..we looked at the matter more closely and...here ya go!&quot; I think they would have announced that. As it stands its neither of our call to say whether Sony placed this back into affliction or if it was bugged out coincidentally one week later...thats all part and parcel with the gamble so many took.<br />
<br />
And my point through this whole night has been that the PLAYERS lead THEMSELVES to believe that....Sony never gave any -clues- other than not adressing the bug...how long has it taken for an number of other fixes to this game...think about it?</div></div><hr />

I was never told about this , i didnt know about it . Its all fine and dandy that they made a message in a patch i never saw. Fact is though that for 9 months this has worked like this.

In order to take your stance, you have to assume that Sony is so incompetent that they would:<br />
break a bugfix the very next patch after they fixed it<br />
ignore for months the fact that it was rebroken even though it was pointed out to them<br />
place new items into the game with the same broken effect (intended for higher level spells)<br />
fix these still broken items to work on higher level spells<br />
Say these still broken items are &quot;working as intended&quot;<br />
Accidentally fix the bug after 9 months and not mention it<br />
Mention it a day later when people noticed<br />
blame the players for misreading Sony's intent<br />

I think there is a very legitimate point that these toys were not &quot;free&quot;...   <br />

Unlike exploits, no one was reprimanded for using these toys...  After the flip back to working, there was at best no clear message regarding a future change back... at worst perhaps an unintended communication that it would not happen.<br />

well believe it , cause im not going to hide behind bull**** lies and claim ive never made a thread that was a attention getter for the wrong reasons , theyw ere delt with as they should have been just as this should. I think its time you realized that too my friend ;)   Anyway personal nipping aside....<br />
<br />
Just because you decide to take take a cross and bare it and to stand valiantly alone doesnt make you right either. Saying &quot; you gambled and lost &quot; and blaming ignorrance in this situation is a cop out. Your saying i/we played a hand that might not have won , that I took the risk. I say i never had the cards , **** i was just standing in the room and didnt wanna even play . This &quot;bug&quot; was corrected then re-introduced almost instantly again and left alone for 9 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please show me where they tried fixed this again and againmate , show me the posts where they said this will be fixed in a week or 2 or will keep trying untill it is fixed. Show me the patch messages where they said &quot; sorry its broke , dont make use of it. &quot; Where have they tagged this information. why is this not well known knowledge by every class and every person. Why am i NOT the only one suprised by this then ?<br />
<br />
Your logic in this situation takes no responsablity and forces blame on everyone else except the people that caused this situation. A simple &quot; hey sorry , its fixed now&quot; doesnt cut it dude. If sony had fixed this even 1-2 months after this was broke again , then it would be another story , but they decided to let 9 months go by and only &quot;fixed&quot; it to nerf the enchanters and mages charming. Come on man ..<br />
<br />
You know in alot of ways your acting just like how you claim everyone else is. your idea is one sided and not open to discusion or change . Your here to preaching and not try to validate a point.<br />
<br />
As you stated ....  just cause the mob believes something doesnt make it right , but another fact is , when your outnumbered 100 to 1 then you better be prepared to fight tooth and nail and to take some punches to prove your point. Preaching and telling us we are all wrong &quot; you gambled its your fault &quot; &quot; Your ignorance caused this&quot; isnt going to help win anyone over to your idealism if that is indeed your goal. Its not &quot;wise&quot; approach ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hi Evel,<br />
<br />
Your different perspective involves simply playing with words?  In the world of adults, things are a bit more sophisticated.<br />
<br />
Let's assume everyone reading this board has some form of intelligence and can practise lateral thinking. <br />
<br />
There are two possibilities here: <br />
<br />
(1) SOE keeps using the wrong term &quot;damage over time&quot; spells when they actually meant to include malo, slow and such spells. <br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
(2) They really only intended to include &quot;DAMAGE over time&quot; spells. <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they : <br />
<br />
(1) let it remained that manner for 9 months; <br />
(2) keep introducing new items that also behave in the same manner; <br />
(3) send out mixed signals, e.g. 19 Nov Patch <br />
<br />
which would you conclude? <br />
<br />
In the court of law, do you think judges will play words with you or you think judges would consider the circumstances or evidences of the case?<br />
<br />
By the way, what do you want from us?  Play words with you or you want our attention?  Finally get a chance to get many replies to your post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">In Business Law class I learned that such actions constitute an &quot;Unconcionable contract&quot; whereby the rules the party was constrained to follow are so heinous and blatantly unfair that nobody would ever willingly agree to those rules. <br />

&quot;try to convince them a toned down slow-malo focus is needed/viable&quot;<br />
<br />
And how am I supposed to do that? By using /feedback? /bug? E-mails? Posting here? None of these methods are proven to have any effect at all. SOE has to be one of the least &quot;listening to the customers&quot; companies there are. And I think the reason they behave like that is that they make sooo many blatantly obvious mistakes that they know they would get tons of complaints if they tried to &quot;open up&quot;.<br />
<br />
Defending a company like that seems like an awful lot of waste to me but whatever floats your boat :)<br />
<br />
A strange thing about this nerf is that I am damn sure that if it had been deemed a huge benefit to us that the focus effect worked on slow/debuff it would have been fixed much much faster. Only explanation seems to be that SOE doesnt know what a shaman does - far fetched I know ;)<br />
<br />
Just for the record I also thought that it was never intended to work with slow/debuff so I never got one of those items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">It was decision/responsibility of VI/SOE to:<br />

(let's gamble, name me one COMPLETE patch message)<br />
- include minor patches WITHOUT any patch information<br />
- give out wrong informations (no, no alchemy isn't broken ...) without proofing the facts<br />
- changing their mind on basic game design issues literally every week.<br />
<br />

- Evel is continuing discussion about a problem immediately, not 8 months later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Evel, <br />
<br />
your logic is amusing.<br />
<br />
Your list of Facts go like this:<br />
1) Sony Announced it a Fix<br />
2) Hence you shouldnt be upset<br />
<br />
What you are simply doing is using worse logic, and worse arguements supporting sony than anyone who disagrees with you.<br />
<br />
Timeline goes like this<br />
1) Sony Announced Dots only --- Sony Fixed to Dots Only<br />
2) Sony Changed it back to All Detrimental Spells<br />
3) Sony introduced a new line ((level 4)) items that Also worked with all detrimental spells<br />
4) Sony Nerfs it.  (8 months after 2, 4 after 3))<br />
<br />
Your arguement is that because 1 was a message, 2 &amp; 3 shouldnt matter.  That doesnt follow Sony's pattern<br />
There are numerous spell changes, unannounced.  There are many other changes unannounced.<br />
<br />
I would think that if 2 or 3 didnt both exist, you might have a point.  However, they do.  I find it hard to believe that Sony was unaware that they &quot;accidently undid it with #2&quot; and continued with it undone again on #3.   <br />
<br />
No the far more likely, and far more angering possibility is that Sony changed its mind and undid thier announcement.  Now they are changing thier mind again.<br />
<br />
Sad truth is, we are very very likely caught in the crossfire aimed at the charmers.  Afliction Haste + Charm = nasty.  Considering all the other Anti-Charm stuff lately on test.... this supposition is again more likely than yours that it was a bug.<br />
<br />
Prefirst change ==- bug.  Patch said so.<br />
2 Subsequent reversals, and its more likely a feature than a double bug.</div></div><hr />

Im going to repost this as a new thread because:<br />
- You want attention.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand when a person is angered they get tunnel vision and its hard for them to see the bigger picture, but for everyone who is sooo quick to blame Sony about this...consider.... <br />
- It's a well proven fact that: <br />
(A) VI has no QA (did you like last patch before tuesday's?)<br />
(B) VI has no source control (last January patch is shining example)<br />
(C) VI has no competent programmers (too easy)<br />
(D) VI has no competent designers (racing for entertainment content, perfect example!)<br />
(E) All of the above.<br />
<br />
The obvious answer is E, but yes blame the players whom a large majority never even heard Lucy is, they prolly think it's a character from Hollywood Hillbilies series.<br />
<br />
One of the first lessons I learned in life is...ignorance is no excuse...period. <br />
- What part of the November 19th patch is SO HARD to UNDERSTAND? The part that says Affliction Focus Something IV is working AS INTENDED? Yeah I thought so. There was NO IGNORANCE. Verant, as did it in the past multiple times, either:<br />
(A) Lied<br />
(B) Lied<br />
(C) Lied<br />
(D) Lied<br />
(E) All of the above.<br />
<br />
Again, the obvious answer is E. Another proof how the left hand doesn't know what the right hand was doing. I remember the: Alchemy is working fine, really, it does.<br />
<br />
If you do not know every detail about a thing...you have no business doing anything with it. <br />
- Now that's a retarded statement. I sure don't know everything about computer programming, even though I've been doing that for the last 9 years, should I stop doing it? GREAT LOGIC! I guess since no player knows every intricate detail of this game, EVERYONE SHOULD QUIT AND CANCEL THEIR ACCOUNTS! OMG THE HORROR!<br />
<br />
I see everyone crying out rage, falling into two groups.... <br />
- I see, difference of opinion is called &quot;crying&quot; now? Interesting.<br />
<br />
1. Those that knew, some where deep down that this would be changed again someday. <br />
- I knew it, still doesn't make it right what VI did.<br />
<br />
I mean c'mon...Sony SPELLED IT OUT FOR YOU in a patch message...sure 9 months ago, but it was there in BLACK AND WHITE. <br />
- You should follow your own advice, the one VI spelled out crystal clear, as you would put it, &quot;BLACK AND WHITE&quot;. Please see mid November patch for reference.<br />
<br />
This is the group that knew the details of the effect and knew there was always going to be a chance it would change. <br />
- I knew this the day it was made to work with debuffs. However a few weeks later, seeing how powerful yet BALANCED these effects were, I thought VI did an un-announced change (like the myriad of changes they did in the past) and it will stay like this vitam eternam.<br />
<br />
2. Then we have the rest who aren't really involved with the mechanics...<br />
- It's called 70%+ of EQ's playerbase.<br />
<br />
they wait for the hard-core players to explain things to them...they go solely on what they've been told, which most often proves to be myth. <br />
- Retarded comment numero dos! Everything you see posted here by people who know game mechanics is a myth, same is on Safehouse, over at FoH boards, everywhere people with game experience and good game mechanics knowledge post is nothing more than a conspiracy theory to overturn the alien invaders of planet Earth.<br />
<br />
I find its generally not a good idea to trust in mass ideals...research them your self. <br />
- JoeNotAMillionaireButAverageDude reads The Crucible. Many people post after a patch that Affliction Focus items work with debuffs and they are really nice effects. At this point no one should beleive these people right? Retarded statement numero three!<br />
<br />
In my opinion neither of these groups can blame Sony. <br />
- Blame the Tooth Faerie for this monumental bug fix fvckup?<br />
<br />
Sony didn't allow you to believe these items were working as intended(as proven by the patch message that keeps popping up in this thread)...<br />
- I think working as intended message in the mid November patch is clear enough. The fact that people complained mid summer after first nerf and it was quickly turned back on is a good indication.<br />
<br />
YOU let yourself believe this item was working as intended. Now, I understand this is a hard concept to understand for some...but back to my original point...ignorance of -the facts- is no excuse. <br />
- Please see mid November patch message. There was no ignorance, infact for doubters like me, that patch was a pretty clear signal telling me that it AF is working as intended, wich includes affecting debuffs. Again, follow your own advice, ignorance IS NOT an excuse.<br />
<br />
I try to be as respectful as possible, <br />
- Hypocrit. Stop labeling people &quot;crying&quot; when they have a difference of opinion. Then talk about being respectful.<br />
<br />
see a point in taking responsibility for yourselves on this one. <br />
- Yes, us the players must make sure we code and put content on production servers in a rigurous way to make sure no older bugs resurface. And the same time, WE the players must make sure to correct bugs in EQ as fast as possible. Oh wait, don't tell me ... we the players have to design game content too? If that's the case, where is my pay? Dumbass.<br />
<br />
Sony has made -allot- of goofs in the past. <br />
- A lot is an understatement. <br />
<br />
this one- falls in the laps of the players to take responsibility on...think about it after you calm down. <br />
- CRAP! I didn't realize the players broke Affliction Focus items. Must have been some 31337 h4x0r!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your &quot;logic&quot; fails to work due to it being wrong over half the time.<br />
<br />
9 Months ago,  Affliction Haste and its ilk were changed to work with DoTs only--after massive complaints,  it was changed back to working with all detrimental spells. Was this intentional? We don't know. However, it was done and a few were skeptical.<br />
<br />
Fast forward a few Months, Planes of Power is released and with it came new Affliction Items--5 more levels of spells effected.  If they were emant to be DoTs only, then they failed yet again on another focus line _AND_ failed on the fix of that Focus Line. What is the player to believe if after a new Focus part is introduced and is then fixed--ie, made &quot;working as intended&quot;--to work with all DoTs and Debuffs? Logic dictates that we should think that  they're meant that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
man, if thats not calling the pot calling the kettle black...how long have I been a member of this board...observe my post count? Im not one to needless through my name into every pointless thread on this board...Im trying to make a point..one that no one can see because yes, their vision in tunneled with anger.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand when a person is angered they get tunnel vision and its hard for them to see the bigger picture, but for everyone who is sooo quick to blame Sony about this...consider....  <br />
<br />
the last three of those are totally -your- opinion Zorlac...not fact.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand when a person is angered they get tunnel vision and its hard for them to see the bigger picture, but for everyone who is sooo quick to blame Sony about this...consider.... <br />
- It's a well proven fact that: <br />

(E) All of the above. <br />
<br />
<br />
My whole argument can be stopped dead in its tracks if someone can sight where they said they specifically changed Affliction items to work with slow...As of Nov 19(2.5 months ago mind you) Affliction was still *bugged* for all intents and purposes...saying working as intended doesn't necessarily reverse the original statement they made about it working on dots only.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you do not know every detail about a thing...you have no business doing anything with it.  <br />
<br />
people can act like this whole thing comes as a total suprise if they want to, but they were either told that Affliction works with slows, BY THE PLAYER BASE...or they assumed it themselves...period. Hell you dont have to know every detail...Im hardly what you'd call a hard-core player...eyt I find the time to keep up with game mechanics...especially class based issues.<br />

- You should follow your own advice, the one VI spelled out crystal clear, as you would put it, &quot;BLACK AND WHITE&quot;. Please see mid November patch for reference.  <br />
<br />
Show me where, Zorlac, that message says Working with SLOWS as intended...for all intents and purposes of my argument Affliction was still bagged at that point...granted...this may be the one and only single point where the clueless player who cares nothing to follow up on class issues might have been mislead by what Sony 'implied'..Ill give you that....but Zorlac...you're not clueless and can't really use this against me in your favor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- I knew this the day it was made to work with debuffs. However a few weeks later, seeing how powerful yet BALANCED these effects were, I thought VI did an un-announced change (like the myriad of changes they did in the past) and it will stay like this vitam eternam <br />
<br />
Its hard to believe that someone so knowledgeable about that game would make this statement....compare to me in terms of usefulness and power...what a full set of Affliction items did for a shaman as compared to say Spell Haste for wiz...yeah, look at the bigger picture here...thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Retarded comment numero dos! Everything you see posted here by people who know game mechanics is a myth, same is on Safehouse, over at FoH boards, everywhere people with game experience and good game mechanics knowledge post is nothing more than a conspiracy theory to overturn the alien invaders of planet Earth.  <br />
<br />
I think if you really look at it...well shoot...how many SONY IS OUT TO KILL MY CLASS posts do you see a day? people in general -want- to believe the man is out to get them...we had a myth thread last month..its so true how, if something becomes &quot;mass assumption&quot; some how magically its deemed fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- JoeNotAMillionaireButAverageDude reads The Crucible. Many people post after a patch that Affliction Focus items work with debuffs and they are really nice effects. At this point no one should believe these people right? Retarded statement numero three!  <br />
<br />
Okm Zorlac..inc point that Im trying to make...stay with me here....<br />
Its great to trust in what the players tell you...if thats your thing...they told you Affliction is -suppose- to work with slow, you bought it, good for you(not speaking to you directly)The player base was right in that it did work with affliction...but not that it was -intended- to work with affliction...so in the end...whos to blame??? Did Sony lie to you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- I think working as intended message in the mid November patch is clear enough. The fact that people complained mid summer after first nerf and it was quickly turned back on is a good indication.  <br />
<br />
Once again Im not sure your so clueless that -you- can make this argument with me...maybe someone else...but you know to much about this game...and admitted that you were one of the ones that 'knew' it was always in danger of a *nerfing*.<br />
<br />
- Hypocrit. Stop labeling people &quot;crying&quot; when they have a difference of opinion. Then talk about being respectful <br />
<br />
I clearly used 'crying' in a figurative way...now I know your comprehension skills are sharper than to jab me with..your calling people names..blah blah blah...once again...not my style.<br />
<br />
- Yes, us the players must make sure we code and put content on production servers in a rigurous way to make sure no older bugs resurface. And the same time, WE the players must make sure to correct bugs in EQ as fast as possible. Oh wait, don't tell me ... we the players have to design game content too? If that's the case, where is my pay? Dumbass.  <br />
<br />
After presenting yourself to me as someone who understands the game and keeps up with it...to make this statement really is to say YOU let yourself be duped...Its not that tough AT ALL to find out THE FACTS....I will give that one patch message from 2 months ago as MISLEADING to the clueless...but once again Zorlac....I have 100% faith that -you- are not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- CRAP! I didn't realize the players broke Affliction Focus items. Must have been some 31337 h4x0r! <br />
<br />
Whats players fixing broken items have to do with ANY of my point....my point is players CHOSE to overlook the fact that there was a clear and present danger of these items changing...at some point...period.- You want attention. <br />
<br />
Soge99: No..Im tired of half the threads on this board being nothing but bitching and complaining because people are finding it hard to &quot;win&quot; at EQ...this is one matter that..although 99% of this board will dissagree with me, is NOT one sided against Sony...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your point, and I still don't agree with the conclusions you chose to draw.  <br />
<br />
They screwed up in this case.  Isn't that clear?  <br />
<br />
Unless there was an unbalancing nature to the existing focus items, then I don't understand the change.  Because if it wasn't unbalancing, why make it? And not only that, but wouldn't those items then be necessary for balancing?  <br />
<br />
If they were unbalancing items, then I think you or someone who likes this change should articulate how or in what way shaman or classes who used these items *as they were introduced into the game* were unbalanced.  <br />

Everyone is in an uproar, but we still don't know for sure yet whether a new line of focus items will come out (which was sort of mentioned briefly in Alan's message).

This arguement 100% shuts you up.  If Verant says Affliction Extension 4 is now &quot;Working as Intended&quot;.  what part of english language is wrong there.<br />
<br />
Working as Intended = Working as Intended.<br />
Period.   your arguement is dust on the wind.<br />
<br />
As you put it, its there in black and white.<br />
<br />
Now, months later, Sony changed the item.  Obvious it was not working as intended in which case they deserve all this critism and scorn for all the wasted effort that is THIER FAULT.  or they changed thier mind in which case they deserve all this cristiscm and scorn for undoing our gear selection effort and its THIER FAULT.<br />
<br />
Don't come here and preach &quot;But the patches said in black and white&quot; and then ignore patch messages that RUIN YOUR ARGUEMENT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I never bought an AF item.  I thought that we would eventually get screwed over with it. <br />
<br />
Notice, that I thought,  not that VI said, or Alan said, or the Dev Team said,  or a GM said, but that I thought.<br />
<br />
Not because of the patch message as I do not read them very often, but because VI screws us all the time.  <br />
<br />
What is posted on the patch message means dick.  It's simply a message of what the dev team thinks they fixed and sent to Alan.<br />
<br />
I bet what happened was they fixed whatever issues it was with the charm spells and found that the only way to fix it was to mess with AF.  They probably couldnt tweek the one without messing with the other.  VI often changes things in the game and doesnt tell anyone.  They might state that something is a bug but later feel that it is not and leave it alone.  They arent going to contridict themselves so they dont tell anyone anything.  Hell back in the day they told us almost nothing in the patch message cause they didnt want to give anything away.<br />
<br />
We as the gamming community cannot hold VI accountable to everything they have ever said in any patch or MB post because many times they cannot be met.  There used to be huge arguments between VI and the players about holding statements from SoE accountable.  <br />
<br />
The old,  show me a log/ show me the post arguments were a big thing a few years ago.  So much so that VI eventually shut down thier MB.  <br />
<br />
I do think that this is a nerf.  9 months is too long to leave something in the game and not comment on.  The idea that VI fixed it, then undid the fix and never responed to any questions on the issue is absurd.  And then to stelth nerf it is cowardly.  They knew the kind of **** storm this would create and tooks the easy way out.  <br />
<br />
AF has been to visible for too long for there not to be a statment on the intent of the effect and the status of any changes.<br />
<br />
If there are no facts, assumptions must be made.  One patch messege from 6+ months ago is not good enough.  <br />
<br />
This entire issue could have been resolved easily and quickly if SoE had addressed this at any point from July2002 up until the patch.  <br />
<br />
This just smells of CYA.</div></div><hr />

Didn't even read your post past this statement.  This is a perfect example of what I posted about earlier.  You, sir, give the Crucible a bad name.   <br />
<br />
Show me ONCE that Evel has posted some personal attack, or has resorted to name calling.  Please.  What's that??  You can't..... oh, that's because HE HASN'T.  But yet you stay set in your ways calling him names.   <br />

Good point to a degree.  But I disagree with your assertation.<br />
Evels first post &quot;Sony SPELLED IT OUT FOR YOU in a patch message...sure 9 months ago, but it was there in BLACK AND WHITE. &quot;<br />
<br />
He may not have outright called me an idiot, but this phrase sure implies it.  <br />
<br />
You do not have to call names to imply insult to intelligence, Evel's choice of phrasing, capitalization, and outright refusal to accept any disagreement with him having any validity, are all insulting.  <br />
<br />
Its the proveribial &quot;look down your nose&quot; as you talk to someone.<br />
Or &quot;racist/insulting tone of voice&quot; attitude that is prevalant in <br />
many many posts by him.<br />
<br />
So perhaps, I took the fast way out, in calling names.   But in no way, do I feel Evel's been &quot;respectful&quot; through this or the other thread as well.<br />
<br />
Just for another example: Evel quote: &quot;Now the facts are that Sony told you quite the opposite. My point is that ignorance (ignoring thee facts) is never an excuse. <br />
<br />
They didn't nerf you...you got some free toys for 9 months...You let yourself believe it was forever.../shrug&quot;<br />
<br />
The implication is that if you didnt agree with Evel's arguement you are &quot;ignorant&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Evel, I am quite dubious as to your motivation here.  Why are you trying so hard to convince the Shaman of EQ that this was their fault and not SOE?<br />
<br />
I dont know if many people know this and I myself am not privy to all the details but your Guild The Pantheon, formally of the Innoruuk Server, did some extensive testing for SOE/VI (whatever they are called now) during the PoP development?<br />
<br />
I remember seeing threads form other guilds on test complaining about the use of the Pantheon.  In fact, several people from the Inny server claim to know for a fact, that some of the members of the Pantheon were actually VI or Sony employees,  some developers in fact.<br />
<br />
Could this be that you are infact affiliated with EQ in some way and mearly trying to perform some kind of damage control?  Honestly I find it strainge as to why you are working so hard to convince the overwhelming majority, that they are to blame and not SOE/VI.<br />
<br />
I am not attacking you but simply trying to understand your motivation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">As I've said here and on the other threads, I disagree that &quot;players CHOSE to overlook the fact that there was a clear and present danger of these items changing...at some point...period.&quot; or that we should have otherwise just known the true intended effect.<br />
<br />
Evel has said several times that because SOE never said Affliction focus WILL work with slow, debuffs, roots, etc.. that we should not expect it to do so. Ok, if that is the criteria then please show me where SOE has said (and I'll just a pick a few here off the top of my head):<br />
<br />
<br />
Primal Avatar will take no component?<br />
<br />
Cripple will reduce the combat power of a mob?<br />
<br />
Focus of Souls will increase your maximum hitpoints?<br />
<br />
<br />
Apples to oranges since I'm not doing effects?...hmm..ok show me specifically where SOE says <br />
<br />
Vengeance X will be better than  Vengeance I?<br />
<br />
Aura of battle will regenerate hit points and provide an attack bonus?<br />
<br />
Again...pick one, you know it is SOE's policy since the launch of this game to not provide that type of information on the specific effects of spells or items. So following that logic, since SOE has never stated affirmatively that these things WILL be that way, it is acceptable to now change them and we as players should  bear responsibility for making an assumption?<br />
<br />
When affliction focus items were put into the game they worked with slow, roots, debuffs, mez, charm and dots.<br />
<br />
On June 6 in the patch message it says Affliction will now only work with DoTs. (Note: It does not say in that Affliction focus items were never intended to work on any other spell, only that it is being changed at this point to work only with dot spells)<br />
<br />
On the next patch, the effect changed back to working with debuffs, slows, etc... with no message given. At this point you can either assume this was an intended change or you can assume it was a bug. <br />
<br />
In November the patch message says that Affliction Focus IV items will now work correctly with level 61-65 dot spells. Items continue to work with slows, roots, debuffs, etc.. Again you can either assume the items are working as intended or you can assume the items are still bugged.<br />
<br />
Either choice is still an assumption, period. SOE chose not to comment on the issue for months. To then say it should have been obvious what the intended function of the items were is ridiculous at best.<br />
<br />
(note no where in the above post do I claim: to know SOE's real intent, that this is &quot;a slap in the face&quot;, that it is the death of the Shaman class, or that anyone is an idiot or ignorant)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Kylt, you need to consider other possibilities.<br />
<br />
Some of us (myself included) were not members of the shaman community 9 months ago.  When I created my shaman, there wasn't a popup box with reams of information regarding my class.  The game didn't say, &quot;Your race/class choice is of moderate difficulty, and don't forget, we're changing Affliction focus items at some point in the future.&quot;  I read the message boards and roamed many many sites, and I never saw a single word about this &quot;Upcoming and Expected Nerf&quot; as many seem to be calling it.  I did not, however, use spoiler sites like Lucy to make sure I wasn't &quot;exploiting&quot; unfixed bugs.  That's not my responsibility, and that information is purposely hidden from us by Sony.  I can't believe anyone has the cajones to tell me that it's my fault I didn't know this was going to happen.<br />
<br />
Sony made a huge mistake and handled a situation VERY poorly, once again.  I'm not quitting, threatening to quit, or anything like that.  I'm being reasonable, and claiming that Sony should not have made this change without warning us well ahead of time (of course, it would have taken the same amount of time to simply fix it as warn us).  They made a series of errors that led to this outrage, and now they need to suck it up and deal with the consequences... and make some concessions to atone for their consistent &quot;oversights.&quot;  You can't jerk people around and then expect them to just accept it.<br />
<br />
If it happens once, it's an accident.  If it happens every patch day, it's incompetence.</div></div><hr />

Again, I think that your emotions over what has happened could be clouding your judgement.  I am coming from a relatively neutral position here.  I am just finally getting back to playing my shaman from a 6-8 month break.  I don't know many of the new faces here, but lots of the old.  I don't know Evel in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
When I read his first post, I got zero ill feelings from it.  It sounded like someone trying to put a spin on the recent arguments by giving out a different opinion on the matters.  He was simply trying to STRESS different points (like I just did) by using all caps.  <br />
<br />
I tend to believe that you are seeing what you want to in Evel's posts.  Not because he is flaming, but because he is offering up an opinion that is so opposite of your own, that it comes off that way.  Calling someone an outright idiot, and saying someone else implied you are an idiot (even though the word idiot wasn't even used in the post) is alltogether different.<br />
<br />
And the implication of his statement was that ignorance is not an excuse....but he goes on to explain what his definition of ignorance is!!  he says that is simply ignoring the facts.  He was stating that there was an initial statement by SoE telling us all that this was a bug, and that if we chose to ignore that statement, that we were ignorant to the fact it was a bug.<br />
<br />
There is a word of difference in what you are rewording, and what was actually said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Alright, I'll post over here also because I feel that the major issue at hand has not been addressed, and to clarify how I personally feel about this issue. For the record, I never got around to having ANY focus items. I'm not uber in any way shape fashion or form. I do have a jbb (thank you mature cheese!), but that is by far and away the most impressive piece of equipment that I own.<br />
<br />
Point 1 - SOE altered our world and seriously affected a sizable portion of the shaman community with this patch. Many of us are outraged, upset, confused, or anticipating what will happen next. This is due to one or more of the following points. While this will make some quit their account, cancel LOY, or just cause ranting and raving on the boards, it is safe to say that this is not kosher with the shaman community. <br />
<br />
Point 2 - SOE has let the issue hang now for 9 months without fixing or commenting on, and aside from a quick pseudo-apology from Alan, responded in no way to address our concerns. This change was also not mentioned in the patch message, something SOE did finally address. But, put simply, is totally irresponsible from their end to make such a change and then not even notify us.<br />
<br />
Point 3 - Recently, SOE announced that they were looking closely at certain areas in the game that needed addressing((http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53816)). Foci was not on the list, charm was. Many of us simply feel that we're in the way of the nerf bat as it was swung for those classes that were abusing the charm spells. This change was rather broad and sweeping for a change that was seemingly aimed at a specific class or two, and presumably affecting only one spell line.<br />
<br />
So, how do I feel about it . . . Well, as a class I feel that we have been overlooked for quite a while now. I have posted here and there about improvements I'd like to see. I do not post every day, and in fact will go months between posts. But this is a pretty interested and sever issue to me. Ultimately, the point here, I think, is not that shaman were nerfed, or that the AF/AH items were nerfed. A lot of shaman are pissed off about it, because, quite frankly, it's the only consolation at this point to playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
Our tradeskill has been FUBAR'd since day one. It's almost useless at the higher levels. With the advent of the bazaar, we make almost no money at all from it.<br />
<br />
Our high end spells are very nice, with a few exceptions, granted. BUT, every other class gets a nice bonus through foci. We get nothing but the most generic (also hardest to get, IIRC).<br />
<br />
We just want what every other class has : That added edge in the endgame. AA or foci to help us with what we do most. We are a DEBUFFING class first and foremost. We just want something to help us out. To become better. To become more efficient with our mana usage. Everyone else got their perks. Where is ours?<br />
<br />
In the end, I do believe that this was an issue that was to be corrected. It is incomprehensible that SOE has ignored it this long only to stealth nerf it as part of some &quot;balancing&quot; issue. I cannot believe that shaman are out there ruining it for everyone else.  SOE should have warned us all along that it would be removed, but I can also understand that it is not our responsibility to keep up with every minute detail of the game. <br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, my opinion is that . . . SOE needs to fix shaman, and bump our class up to the same effectiveness as every other class. We want a foci to help us land malo/slow lines quicker and cheaper and have them last longer. FIX IT PLEASE. THIS IS COSTING YOU MONEY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">The problem is this, a lot of us didn't know this was a bug.  I didn't know it was a bug.  I planned my equipment around what I thought was a very nice effect.  <br />
<br />
The fault is completely and totally SOE's for not communicating about this and fixing it in a timely manner if it was a bug.  Loot decisions, people spending oodles of plat on stuff, tradeskillers making money off it.  Communicating about it once 9 months ago is simply completely inadequate.  They should have let people know and reminded people until they could fix it.  9 months in EQ time is 9 years in real time.  Do you remember the headlines from 9 years ago?<br />
<br />
SOE handled this incredibly badly.</div></div><hr />

I guess its a POV (Point of View) judgement call.  I read every post on this thread and on the original.  I stand by my assessment of his attitude as condensending and insulting.<br />
<br />
the fact, that he felt his particular viewpoint on the issue was so much more important that he had to start another thread((while continuing to argue and post on the other)), the countless ignorant references, the general trend.<br />
<br />
Anyway, really doesnt excuse name calling, but the simple truth is that I have not seen any true fairness in his approach either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I have NO motive..other than a different perspective of where the responsibilty lies here...let me repost my position one more time and see if becomes any clearer...<br />
<br />
<br />
Barm, <br />
thats actually quite creative and I can apprciate it on that level...although is it to the tune of BTO? lol <br />
<br />
Anyway let me try to explain my position one last time...see where it leads.... <br />
<br />
My position is based on FACTS <br />
<br />
Lets take the two conflicting patch messages. <br />
<br />
One from June 02 CLEARLY states that Affliction is NOT meant to work with slow-malo....this is indisputable fact...written clearly in black and white. <br />
<br />
The second from Nov 02( this is relevant because there -was- a 6 month period people were still gambling that this bug would not change) This patch states working as intended....One could argue that these effects have ALWAYS worked as intended, since they do work with dots as well. Now, this may be extremely difficult for some to understand, but even though the facts remain that affliction -did- work with slow yet they said working as intended doesn't immediately counter their position that its SHOULDN'T work with slow. The gray area here is that indeed it -is- working as intended on the spells it was intended on, yet its STILL an interpretation by the player, that its suppose to work with slow, since Sony did not say specifically it was suppose to work with slow....ever. Do you get it? <br />
<br />
Sony did not lie to you, you lied to you. <br />
<br />
Im focusing on FACTS once again...just so were on the same page. <br />
<br />
Lets take a step back and just look at the effects themselves... <br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that a shaman with Affliction focus is balanced(meaning equal to) say, a wizard with spell haste and mana pres? I mean the numbers alone should tell you that this was not meant to be.....give me one focus(especially on par with X 3 items) that will give any caster a 33% faster cast on the majority of his spells. In relative power I fail to see how anyone thinks thee focuses are &quot;balanced&quot; with the benefits other classes get from similar focus's. <br />
<br />
SIde note to the mods...all the Evel hate should be merged...Im reposting this from another thread as Im involved on 3 atm<br />
<br />
Edit:one thing I do agree on this was not fair of Sony....but reality check....life's not fair...and if you dont take the time to become aware of your surroundings...your libel to get burn every once in awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Whether the changes were right or wrong, whether they were announced or unannounced, whether they were expected or unexpected, any game that forces its players to spend a great deal of time doing research out of game to be effective is a game that many people will not play.  <br />
<br />
Focus effects aside, Evel is arguing that players should know every detail of every patch message, every message board post, every spell on Lucy.  If Sony expects us to do this much research to play a video game, then they should expect to lose customers.  <br />
<br />
For some people, researching video game information may be fun.  It may help you be a more efficient player.  But requiring this research to be an adequate player is going too far.  Most people won't find this fun and they will simply leave for other games that they find fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Hodur,<br />
My theory is that people have free will...you dont have to research it, but if something is important to you...as this change seems VERY important to some....its a pretty good idea to familiarize yourself with the details.<br />
<br />
Im only saying there was ALOT more writing on the wall point in the direction of this being unintentional as there was to support Sony has made these changes on purpose...and furthermore -just- to aggravate a few entire classes....I fail to see why people are so convinced Sony is TRYING to make this game a bad experience for you....Id really like to hear some opinions on that question.</div></div><hr />

Once again you are harping on words.<br />
<br />
Words are louder than actions?  9 months, 1 expansion and many new items not convincing enough?<br />
<br />
What's the point of you trying to explain to us the meaning of English words?<br />
<br />
The issue is this: Verant has sent out conflicting signals to us. Which is more convincing? A few lines in the last 12 months, or the fact that thousands of players in game in the last 9 months have items that worked for malo, slow, bought 1 expansion, uncover new items that worked for malo and slow too. <br />
<br />
Which evidence is stronger? <br />
<br />
You still don't realise you are silly to waste our time by harping on 2% of what Verant did to tell us that it should not work vs 98% of what they did to convince us that affliction foci items should affect debuff spells too. <br />
<br />
It's not too late to admit it before everyone concludes worst thing about you. Time to consider all facts yourself and not harp on 2 or 3 sentences given to us by Verant. <br />
<br />
The issue here is which is more convincing to the shaman/player community.  Verant's words or their actions?<br />
<br />
By now, you still think you have a solid case to even waste our time?</div></div><hr />

Yes - every time any piece of your argument is refuted, you paste the entirety your original points - in the manner of a frustrated child who isn't sure how to convince a parent to allow you to do something that isn't allowed - instead of dealing with the refutation.  Apparently you believe that hitting people with your entire argument is going to magically change some of the individual assumptions you made from wrong to right.<br />

1. He has never *ignored* anyone's refutations.  He aknowledged them with a response.  Albeit different than what they wanted to hear, but a response none-the-less.  He was NOT ignoring arguments.<br />
<br />
2. He has *yet* to be proven wrong.  Even with the November patch message, he is not wrong from the viewpoint his argument comes from.  Look at what he is saying for christ's sake.  He is saying that when Sony came out with that November patch message, and when they said &quot;working as intended&quot;, in THEIR minds that meant &quot;working as intended on dots...although we still have a bug to iron out in regards to the slows, etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
That is what he was saying.  And that could very well be the case!  We just simply do not know.  So Evel's argument still stands...as does everyone else's claiming that this could have been avoided with some better customer-base contact throughout the whole ordeal. <br />
<br />
I'm not claiming sides here.  I'm simply saying, from what I've seen, Evel started a civil debate in this thread, and people started flaming him for it.  And time and time again people are claiming he is wrong and has been proven wrong....but I'm yet to see this *proof* everyone speaks of.  To tell you the truth, it can't be proven.  We don't know what SoE was thinking when they put out that patch.  And we probably never will.</div></div><hr />

Where is this ratio you've come up with?  Where is this 98% evidence you claim to have?   Read my post again.... I'm saying there is NO WAY for any of us to really know what SoE was actually saying in the november patch.  Evel has one viewpoint, and many others have a different viewpoint.  I challenge you to PROVE Evel wrong.  You can't.  Reason?  Because we don't know what they were thinking when they said &quot;working as intended&quot;.  That can have several meanings...and that's what the actual argument is about here.<br />
<br />
Was it bad customer service?  Yeah....probably.  But *my* argument is simply that you people are calling Evel and his argument crazy when you can't prove him absolutely wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Verant also said regularly we should discover things in the game ourselves.<br />
<br />

But I feel your Guilds position does lend to a bias, whether or not you personally have or not, is irrelivent IMO.  The perception is, you very well could be bias.<br />
<br />
You interact, either directly or indirectly, with Develpoers on as much as a daily basis.  For all I know, you could be one yourself.  So I can not take your position as one which is common among the general EQ Shaman community.  You are special, in a way, whether your gear reflects that or not.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, I respect The Pantheon and consider many of its former members EQ friends.  Some were even at one point in my old Guild.<br />
<br />
You guys are quite good at what you do with what you have.  Your Guild is highly respected on the Inny server and will most likely always be IMO.<br />
<br />
But to say your stance as un-bias requires a ton of trust in someone I dont know.  I hope you understand.</div></div><hr />

Fact of the matter is, VI constantly hides information from us. You are basing your side of this soley on ONE thing that they said, when even after that:<br />
<br />
1) their lack of a fix, or any acknowledgement that it was again broken and would at some point be fixed<br />
<br />
2) adding in an expansion and a FIX to level 4 focus and saying they were working as intended<br />
<br />
their actions led everyone to beleive that it was staying the way it was.<br />
<br />
You say that it is everyone's own fault if they did not research AF items or anything else and were disappointed. You show me an absolutely reliable place to do that, and I will. There simply is not one. VI has shown that they are completely unreliable. <br />
<br />
As for suggesting that everyone sould lobby VI for some kind of reduced focus for debuffs, what in God's name are you smoking? How can you even half heartedly ask people to consider that an option, when VI does not respond to anything unless they screwed up and owe people an appology?</div></div><hr />

Hello Wisey :)<br />
<br />
First off, thanks for keeping this civil, appreciate it.  Nothing wrong with a good debate.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with your first two points being evidence.  But where I guess I would question you is your second point, marked &quot;evidence 2&quot;.  So far the only real, true, evidence we have are actual statements that Verant made.  Everything else is pure speculation (by poor design, yes....but still speculation).  <br />
<br />
Is 9 months too long for a bug to go unfixed?  I would undoubtedly say YES!  But, with Verants past track record, we should expect that bugs don't necessarily get fixed w/in the first several months they are discovered :)<br />
<br />
Yes, thousands of players were using items, but it was still (according to verants original statement) a bug.  When they came back in Nov and said it was working as intended is where the real argument lies.  What did they really mean there?  I doubt we'll ever know..  hehe.<br />
<br />
But again, I totally agree this was handled incorrectly by Verant.  There should have been a bit more clarification when they said &quot;working as intended&quot;.  It should have read &quot;the dot portion is working as intended, and we are still addressing the associated bug&quot;.  or something...<br />
<br />
Anyway.....back to work. :)</div></div><hr />

Normally don't bother to post on flames regardless of what is right or wrong in it, but wanted to throw out one point that seems to have been mostly ignored. <br />
<br />
Numerous shaman and enchanters have STATED that they told Verant Dev in person and got replies that they knew and it was working as intended WITH the affliction items as part of that. <br />
<br />
I know one person who was told this personally. <br />
<br />
<br />
So add that point in with working as intended in november to reinforce, 9 + months of it in game, a patch where they fixed it BACK to work again after removing it, a list from Verant of things to be fixed that included charm but not this... <br />
<br />
and you can see why the player communities are upset, and rightly so. <br />
<br />
will verant bother to listen - probably not that's been their modus operandi from day one. <br />

Lets look at it this way...hopefully this will illustrate my point alittle more clearly...<br />

Lets say on that Nov patch Sony said &quot;working as intended&quot; as they -thought- they corrected the bug....Now this argument has been supported MANY times by my oppositions- That Sony may -say- they've &quot;fixed&quot; something...but it really didn't get fixed. What Im saying is there is no absolute proof to disregard this possibility...that leaves that patch as subject to debate. They NEVER stated anything specific about Aff effects working with slow...-except- on the June patch where they spelled it out in definable detail that Aff effects WERE NOT meant to work with slow...this is indisputable fact....remember my argument is of the provable facts.<br />

Im not sure if you've read my opinions on the comparative benefits of a shaman with affliction X items as compared to maybe a wizard with mana pres and spell haste. <br />
- Where are DD nuke boost items? Not to burst your little bubble but a wiz cares much more about saving mana than a shaman (hint, they have no Cannibalization).  You cast slow once every mob, twice maybe, malo once, the wizard is constantly nuking. Wizard saves mana on 95+% of the number of spells he casts compared to a much lower figure for shamans who rely only on Affliction Efficiency. If you decide to DoT in XP groups, great, have fun tanking or using inefficient disease DoTs. So what is this big uber insane broken effect of Affliction Efficiency? Nothing more than a toy. The fact that VI didn't bother fixing it for NINE goddamn months indicates that is a low priority issue and it's definitely not broken. How long did it take them to fix the insane XP from guards in SH? Right, 1 day. How about slowing Emp/Seru with Tugur? 1 week after mobs being perma killed by GMs. <br />
<br />
I think if you just look at the cold hard numbers...you'll see that Affliction for a shaman FAR outshines a Wiz with mana preservation and spell haste.<br />
- Where are these numbers you speak of? A wizard usually casts 6+ nukes per fight in PooP XP groups. While a shaman maybe, a big maybe one single slow and one single Malo. Whoopeeee Doooo!. Winner? Wizard.<br />
<br />
 If were looking at balance here....its pretty easy to see shaman are getting FAR more in return of casting their typical, most common used spells, as said wizard. <br />
- Far more in return? How many times you slow a boss mob? Once every ... pfft 4 min? How many times does a wizard nuke? I guarantee you our wizards chain cast SoS or some other badass nuke non stop. Winner? Wizard. How you think Wizards manage to do twice the DPS of any melee on raids? Good spells and insanely powerful focus items. Can you do that with Affliction Focus? Hell no.<br />
<br />
That in itself is alittle unbalancing...I mean give me and example of a focus that lets any other caster perform most of his casts at 33%haste, there isn't any bro.<br />
- My Torpor is 3.6 sec cast time with Blessing of Reverence. I have no points in quick buff. And your point was? And what's this most of his casts? I am sorry but Affliction Focii has no effect on rains, nukes, heals, Torpor line, buffs. So where is this &quot;most&quot; of his casts? Maybe we are not playing the same game but I hardly chaincast slow and Malo, and casting the DoTs 30% faster has really ZERO impact on game balance today.</div></div><hr />

You win. SoE said it was broken. They fixed it.<br />
<br />
But I can't refrain from calling you on some of the most childish behavior I've ever witnessed on these boards.<br />
<br />
You seem to have started this thread for the sheer sake of being in a winning position. That's cowardly and beneath the standards of the people who frequent this site. I find your behavior repugnant.<br />
<br />
Further, I would like to point out a few things about your position.<br />
<br />
There are two ways to get information about this game:<br />
<br />
1) do it yourself<br />
<br />
2) research it.<br />
<br />
#1 is a near perfect way to handle a situation. It's also impossible to do for every item in the game which your calss MIGHT use.<br />
<br />
this leaves only #2 which is imperfect in its result, and allows the benefit of hundreds of players with more experience than one's self to be utilized.<br />
<br />
You used the word wise. Wisdom is, almost by definition, learning from other's mistakes. But no one could be wise and properly research every item possibly used by the class by themselves. Attempting to do so is not only foolish, it's downright stupid.<br />
<br />
You found a neat little factoid and an argument that, on semantic ground, is impossible for you to lose.<br />
<br />
Congratulations. You're right. Sony said it was broken.<br />
<br />
I missed that patch message and its relevence to shaman because I hadn't created my shaman yet and that bit was, therefore, irrelevent to my game experience.<br />
<br />
Your argument then, when boiled down to its essence:<br />
<br />
Everyone has to do everything for themselves. Buy, quest and loot every item in the game and figure out for yourself what it does AND have eidetic memory memory.<br />
<br />
This is clearly ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sony has a responsibility to communicate with the player base.<br />
<br />
They don't.<br />
<br />
The player base therefore has to take up the slack by communicating amongst themselves.<br />
<br />
They do.<br />
<br />
Because it is ALWAYS second hand information, it will always be imperfect. But it's the best we can do.<br />
<br />
Here's the order of operations again.<br />
<br />
Sony says it's broken<br />
Sony &quot;fixes&quot; it<br />
Sony breaks it again<br />
Sony says &quot;working as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nowhere in my argument did I assume a reason for any of these actions. They are simply the actions that occured.<br />
<br />
Logically, we should assume (although once again gratz you cuz we can't prove it) that the situation was solved.<br />
<br />
9 months without a communication from Sony is long enough to reasonably assume &quot;working as intended&quot; means exactly that.<br />
<br />
This is Sony's fault.<br />
<br />
Period.</div></div><hr />

The june patch did not say affliction effects were never intended to work with slow, only that as of that date it the functionality was being changed to only work with dots.<br />
<br />
&quot;They NEVER stated anything specific about Aff effects working with slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a false argument, as I have stated many times, SOE does not divulge the intended effect of items in the game when they are put into the game. Asking that someone then somehow have access to SOE's intentions to disprove your assumption that this was not intended is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
To follow your logic to it's conclusion then, all items that SOE has not broken policy and affirmed the specific intended function on in detail must therefore be unintended or a bug. Every change that occurs to the game that SOE does not specifically detail in the patch message must therefore be unintended or a bug.  Every position that SOE has stated publicly and then reversed without comment must be unintended or a bug? By your logic anything not so affirmatively stated must be bugged and therefore subject to change at any time and the players must bear the responsibility for using or obtaining these items, effects or abilities prior to their being changed.</div></div><hr />

Zorlac, your zeroing in on this and that and not addressing what Im saying in full....Im saying compare what a wizard can get with X focus and what a shaman can get with affliction focus and see on what side the scale tips in terms of mana conservation, ease of casting duties, speed of getting 'his role done'..ect..<br />
<br />
Im saying over all...as in the entire picture....whos benefiting more from which focus...the wiz or the shaman....answer that question honestly please and not bring occasional situations into the mix....Im saying over all who benefits more?<br />
<br />
You may cast Slow X times in X minutes...but what is -the- most often spells you cast...cause for me its never been Topor...or a rain.<br />

<br />
Im saying that this was clearly stated as a *BUG* and -that- is the last know unquestionable fact. If someone says something in certain terms thats is what we call black and white...clear...<br />
<br />
There were people that knew this was a bug yet took the gamble it would never change...that was 6 1/2 months...granted Sony threw some for a loop with what can be an interpretable patch message in Nov. I agree FULLY that THIS was misleading and what Id call unfair...but guess what...life isnt fair....Ill say it again....If -you- chose to stay unaware of your surrounings...be prepared for some painful suprises once in awhile.<br />
<br />
 Maybe ask yourself this question....if -nothing- is provable and fact...then how can anyone have a leg to stand on in this argument....Sony said it was a bug, they fixed it, then it changed back to working with slows ( its up to you to decide if they did it on purpose or not.....) now its fixed again....My point is that Sony never told you it was suppose to work with slows anyway....they may have *helped* people who fail to see the writing on the wall believe it was'nt going to change ever and was working as inteneded for two months...but in the end alls you can really do is take their word for it....its like are you a Sony conpiracy thoerist like some...or are you ready to look into the matter, understand it...and come back to Sony with some legitamte feedback on how to make the situation better?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill state one opinion I have that I believe in fully....opinion inc....SONY IS NOT -TRYING- TO MAKE THIS GAME UNFUN FOR YOU....instead of throwing a fit about it...jump off the cheap seats...get n the hudle and make this a better game for us all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congrats on being the condescending voice of wisdom. True, you don't have a motive because you don't even have an Affliction XXXX 3/4 item and therefoe aren't REALLY INVESTED IN THE DEBATE. Thx, please drive thru.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you had raided for months and made gear sacrifices to get one, you might feel differently. But, you haven't and you don't, so kindly don't preach about how we all were wrong to trust what the player base knew to be true.<br />
<br />
This change DOESN'T AFFECT you at all at the moment. It only means that if you ever see the light of ST, ntov or whatever, you'll not be ayeing on a bracelet of the sky, boots of the dead dream, bracelet of the deep sea or broach of sere. OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. <br />
<br />
And kindly hush about the semantics of &quot;working as intended&quot; or what a 9-month old patch said. Players shouldn't have to archive patch messages, let alone one that was later weakened by statements that appear to be contradictory. It wasn't tested. It wasn't announced. It just happened one day, right around when VI is trying to nerf enc's and CoD pets.<br />
<br />
It's obvious what happened. This was a quick and dirty CoD nerf.<br />
<br />
I post again:<br />

Affliction XXX: dots/debuffs/movement debuffs - all things detrimental<br />
Domination XXX: charm/mez/lull/harmony/blur - all things mental<br />

With all due respect, I can tell you that I certainly have the opportunity to get these items....my guild raids quite a bit and I would have little trouble &quot;investing&quot; the time getting these items....my motive for playing this game however has NEVER been upgrading gear...ask anyone who knows me personally.<br />
<br />
Its not your gear that lends you any kind of weight in this argument...its what you have resting on your shoulders thats important.<br />
<br />
I've stated since post one that I seen this &quot;nerf&quot; happening in the long run...I would not have upgraded any piece based on the focus factor....I stated that Ive always know there was AT LEAST a chance that these would change...and as my gear demonstrates...Im far from a hard core player....but somehow.....ironicaly I've been aware of this issue since its begining.<br />
<br />
Instead of nit picking what gear I have on and what this must mean on any kind of reasonable opinion I have on this matter.....get back to my argument please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Evel, life is not fair, you are correct.  Bad stuff happens, and sometimes for no reason.<br />
<br />
However, we humans are social creatures.  We work together as a society to function in a manner that helps each of us perform better than we could on our own.  We communicate and utilize our resources to the greatest benefit of everyone, be it building a skyscraper or creating an online world for everyone to enjoy.<br />
<br />
We have unwritten &quot;social contracts&quot; that most people abide by, because it keeps people from offending or hurting others.  Sony broke that social contract by neglecting to fix what they call &quot;bugs&quot; until the bugs interfered with their plans... then they reversed themselves.  They decide to hide vital information from us, then blame us when we didn't figure out how to read their minds and understand their &quot;intentions.&quot;  They have been negligent and inconsiderate repeatedly, and although they haven't broken any laws, any trust I have in them has been slowly eroded over the past four years.  That is important to me, but not to them because I am just a source of income for them.<br />
<br />
That is why we are upset, if you really want to know.  You obviously have made the choice that you will have none of this &quot;social contract&quot; stuff and have decided to live by the black-and-white.  Unfortunately, that will only work in a court of law, or in this case, EQ-land where Sony is the court.  When it comes to social situations, you will find yourself standing alone on what you consider &quot;solid ground.&quot;  There is a lot more to human interaction than you seem to realize.<br />
<br />
We all see through you, and I'm sorry that you think you're such a martyr.  I'm very glad I'm not you, because you think you have a leg to stand on, and we can't point to a &quot;black-and-white&quot; to refute your semantic arguments, and that is all you accept.  Very closed-minded, and unfortunate for you, because you will always think you are right, no matter how many people tell you otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Let me step in and try to enlighten evel<br />
<br />
Ok evel let's say u and I know each other in RL.<br />
One day u are playing b-ball with dem boys outside my house and i can't sleep cause of u. So i get pissed and i say to u: <br />
If i ever see u again I am gonna beat the living Sh!t out of u.<br />
<br />
So next day u bring your boys and u ready for a fight. But when u see me all I say is &quot;sup man?&quot;<br />
Nothign happens.<br />
Next day same thing. Again nothign happens .<br />
Time passes in time u no longer bring your boys cause now u thinking i got no beef with u anymore.<br />
And still I say hi and nothign happnes.<br />
You come on my property and again nothign happnes.<br />
So u thinking soulstorm is crazy or joking or WHATEVER but the threat was in vain or maybe he is dumb or something.<br />
Well then one day I invite you to my birthday party. U come alone and have a blast (let's think about the working as intended patch here on affliction 4) u leave and nothign happens.<br />
More time passes and still I nod my head when I see u in acknowledgement. <br />
Then one day u pass by my house. And I am riding my moose and i got my beaver hat on and a chainsaw in my hand and not only do I beat but mutilate you too.<br />
&quot;I told you I was gonna beat the sh!t out of you motherf**ker.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this is what happend to shamans. Actions DO speak louder than words.<br />
This is NOT a courtroom Evel where ppl can walk free because of a technicality. So a rapist is chased by cops 10 blocks they catch up to him he resists punches some cops they finally arrest his ass shove him in the car and because the cops in the heat of the arrest forgot to read his rights the rapist walks free on the streets. Does not change the fact that he is a rapist and that his actions were wrong and illegal. It's the same idea. You are basing your entire argument on somethign that happend long ago. A lil minor technicality so to speak that has happend in this period of 9 months.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the statement in that patch was made by people who are not to be trusted anylonger by anyone. How many times have they promised things that were never delivered. Or promised stability regarding some issues (manaburn for example) only o have same things altered  patches later.<br />
If this was a courtroom you would be right. That is why we cannot &quot;prove&quot; you wrong. That is why u get dirty stares from ppl because u are like the lawyer defendign the rapist in the example above. He gets off on a minor technicality. May be legally right but everyone wants to break his legs and then hang him and the one who defended him.<br />
<br />
Now cease this ridiculous plea for attention. Because there have been enough posts that have explained to you and others asking WHY we feel this change was WRONG. This is NOT a courtroom and ONLY in a courtroom would u be right. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Xanden,<br />
If you haven't read what Ive said in this debate...please do not direct a statement my way please.....have you not seen that I AM indeed empathetic to WHY everyone is so angered....I also agree that it was VERY unfair of Sony to help the masses buy into affliction working with slows-malo-root as a feature....I agree with all that and I in fact have the capacity to see both side...which some here have shown me they do not.<br />
<br />
But know if Im going to argue about that FACTS....that is ONLY what Im going to focus on when I speak...THE FACTS.<br />
<br />
Ive let you know that I feel bad for the players that this effected....but thats still no excuse to blame the man on this one and not yourself...-in my opinion-<br />
<br />
Picture it this way...isn't this change HUGE for the shaman community? Well if it was that important to all those that are saying &quot;I didn't know&quot; then wouldn't it have been a good idea to understand what an effect dose? And WHO told you what that effect did...cause it sure wasn't Sony that told you it works with slow...they told you the opposite and while it can be argued they did send mix message...they still never said that &quot;We changed Affliction to work with slow&quot; as they did state in certain terms that it did not.<br />
<br />
To say Im insensitive is steering away from my point and bringing my personal character into question....my personal character has nothing to do with my point.<br />
<br />
And for the record...yes I feel bad for you all, because we all have experienced this level of frustration at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">SoulStorm,<br />
Im confused...where you trying to illustrate my point with your example? Look, Im not trying to seek attention and I keep replying to people who wish to actually debate a subject that is very debatable. Dose it make people nervous that I might actually raise some valid issues?<br />
<br />
Ill say it once more...Im not trying to change anyone's opinion...the ONLY person who can do that is you...what Im doing is raising some issues with the trend I see on this board about the whole Sony is killing my class attitude.<br />
<br />
This would be a great topic for any sociology majors out there....Ive found that human nature in general often times -wants- to have &quot;The Man&quot; type figure around them so they have someone to blame thier problems on....Some problems are not created by you and are totally out of your control...this is true, but I bet if you looked very closely at some troubles you've had in the past and gave it the &quot;not my fault&quot; routine...you'd see that -somewhere- down the line YOU could have prevented it. So in essence it -was- your fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">I think a point that is being missed is that someone, somewhere along the line made it work in a &quot;broken&quot; fashion.<br />
<br />
Now, you can't say it has anything to do with the &quot;detrimental&quot; flag. Ice Comet has a &quot;detrimental&quot; flag, and its not effected by these focus items.<br />
<br />
My guess is that the original &quot;Affliction &lt;insert type&gt;&quot; Focus items were first directed at &quot;anything with a detrimental effect and a duration.&quot; <br />
<br />
That would loosely define &quot;Affliction&quot; for nearly anyone. Something bad that lasts for a bit. Known afflictions that won't kill you? How about Polio, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinsons, Alzheimers... The list goes on. A DoT would be more of a terminal/fatal affliction. Cancer maybe? I think that many people would not directly link an affliction with death but more with a condition that may result in death. Hence, it working with debuffs would make sense to a reasonable person.<br />
<br />
Assuming that it should only effect damaging spells would be a huge guess. Not only was the information given by SOE contradictory, the experiences of players, on the live servers, supported the notion that &quot;affliction&quot; focus items effected detrimental spells with a duration. Easily defining slow, malo, cripple, mez, charm as well as damage over time spells.<br />
<br />
If there was a mistake, it was on the part of SOE not paying attention to what they're doing. The Dev and Live teams may not play shaman, but I'm willing to bet a kidney that they do play enchanters, druids, rangers or necros. They knew it was on live servers as well as the test servers, yet it took them 9 months to accidentally fix it.<br />
<br />
And the best answer they could come up with was &quot;last June we said it was only for DoTs...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only is does that fly in the face of logic; it directly conflicts with their actions (or lack thereof) and the experiences of the player base for the for the past 9 months.</div></div><hr />

 Zorlac, your zeroing in on this and that and not addressing what Im saying in full....Im saying compare what a wizard can get with X focus and what a shaman can get with affliction focus and see on what side the scale tips in terms of mana conservation, ease of casting duties, speed of getting 'his role done'..ect..<br />
- All right, let's do it.<br />
<br />
Fury of Solusek does 1-30% damage increase per spell (fire based). Statistically that's about 15% DPS increase long term. This is without any AA nor without innate critical spells for wizards. Strike of Solusek is about 2740 damage, boosted by 15% makes it about 3151 damage per blast.<br />
<br />
Affliction Extension IV does one tick for Blood of Saryrn and about 2 or 3 (doesn't matter for Breath of Ultor). Each spell gets about an additional 300 damage.<br />
<br />
There is one slight, little problem: You will need 51 seconds for BoS to do it's full damage. During this time, wizard can do nearly 6 strikes. During 51 seconds, wizard gets about <br />
~400 bonus damage PER NUKE. Shaman well ... sits at one extra tick for 320 damage. Even if wizard nukes only once during this 51 seconds, he/she/it is still ahead damage wise. And I am not even counting critical bonuses (both innate and AA), nor am I counting Rizlona's. Winner? Wizard of course.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency is about 25% mana save vs Conservation of Solusek wich is about 20% mana save. <br />
<br />
XP fight, shaman uses BoS, wizard uses SoS. Shaman saves about ~130 mana per cast, wizard saves about ~125 mana per cast. How many times you cast BoS per XP fight? Once max. How many times wizard can casts SoS per XP fight? 3-4? Who wins? I let you do the math. Hell even if you count in savings from Malo ~88 mana and one slow ~63 mana, you are still WAY behind the 350+ mana wizard saves. Not to mention, if you use poison DoTs you risk aggroing mobs much easier and end up tanking and wasting mana healing yourself. Even if you are ultra conservative and wizard only casts 2 nukes, he still saves the same amount of mana you save, of course you got a better focus item.<br />
<br />
There is also the fact that wizards specialize in evocation and (I hope) every sane shaman doesn't specialize in conjuration. So again, another 10% mana saved by wizards. Oh and there is also innate critical skills, more DPS, plus the insane critical AA skills, even more damage. <br />
<br />
Now apply the math above to boss encounter where you slow once ever 4-5 minutes and Malo once and compare that to a wizard chain nuking. So who comes out winner? Wizard again, and this time, you are left in the dust. Big time.<br />
<br />
Im saying over all...as in the entire picture....whos benefiting more from which focus...the wiz or the shaman....answer that question honestly please and not bring occasional situations into the mix....Im saying over all who benefits more?<br />
- Occasional? I watch a good wizard friend of my nuke every raid, every XP group, that's not occasional. In the entire picture, Affliction Focus effects working for debuffs had very minimal effects on shaman spells because: Malo is unresistable, debuffs last for long time, few resists on slow and Malosinia are irrelevant, DoTs are irrelevant because they were intended to work with Affliction Focii anyways. So comes out winner in the big picture? Wizard of course. You fail to see that our spells last long time and that is much less damage/mana saved compared to instant damage spells. And why should a shaman worry about mana? He is a mana factory.<br />
<br />
You may cast Slow X times in X minutes...but what is -the- most often spells you cast...cause for me its never been Topor...or a rain.<br />
- I gave up DoTing when yard trash in PoV kept beating on me with a dual EB wielding warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />

The raw spell data hasn't changed. The hitpoijnt restriction has been there all along.<br />
<br />
and &quot;detrimental&quot; spells is a classification of an entire group of spells...not so much a literal use of the word.<br />
<br />
Zorlac,<br />
 raids and boss mobs are not the entire picture and not what everyone who even had these effects were doing....this isn't about how the Affliction switch effect -Zorlac- and his crew, its about what its purpose was on the entire span of the player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is bringing the % down to a teen-ish % is unreasonable? especialy on say levels 1-3 focuses<br />
<br />
<br />
One last question for you...if these effects are so-so...then why this kind of heated rebuttals from you? Even discussing the comparative nature of these effects to others is a little outside my original point and argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- I just gave you an example in a group XP situation, you save some mana for your only DoT you are going to cast (unless you want to tank and waste even more mana) and wizard saves this much mana with ONE SINGLE nuke AND a lesser powered focus item. And of course, XPing is ... I think a pretty important part of EQ ... one could say big part of the &quot;picture&quot;. Then I gave you a raid example wich is another big part of the &quot;picture&quot;. So what is this big picture you are talking about? Continue to ignore facts.<br />
<br />
Oh and ... where are your numbers you talked bout a few posts ago? I am still waiting. As you would put it ... &quot;cold hard numbers&quot;. Yep, still waiting!</div></div><hr />

You can chose to add these number up any way you'd like...I could add what any given group is doing to swing the ratio in my favor. Im saying that including slow-malo-ect..-is- basically giving us 33% on all the spells we typical cast. As I said before you can add it up any way you chose...but to include affliction with most spells that are important to a shamans role is giving you a one up on the % at which you can get things done....<br />
<br />
Oh and again...One last question for you...if these effects are so-so...then why this kind of heated rebuttals from you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Evel, you are fvcking stupid. <br />
<br />
Add up your number, draw a graphic, put up a study, do whatever. Wizard will still come out as winners, whatever you like to beleive it or not. Unlike wizards, we don't cast 4 x Malo on the same XP mob. Wizards cast many nukes on XP mobs. Something you conveniently ignore. I am sure every shaman is runnign around casting 5 x Malo per fight or 7 x slow or 10 x a DoT. <br />
<br />
Oh and when I mentionned &quot;cold hard numbers&quot;, I didn't mean a copy paste from Lucy or EQ Caster Realms. I mean at least basic math ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">Zorlac,<br />
I find it troublesome to reply to insult, but for you Ill make an exception as you've always struck me as some one who LOVES to disagree and make a nice war hoop while doing so...<br />
<br />
Knowing basic math is not the point here....I mean you can break it down as simple as YOUR priority spell is SLOW...it casts at 33%<br />
<br />
A wiz is DD...it cast at 15%<br />
<br />
You can manipulate those numbers any way you chose, but it still comes to this one simple principle...ya know not everything has to be as complex as quantum physics to show a point.

<br />
I *tried* to reply to your request of me...now maybe reply to mine?<br />
<br />
If these effects are so-so...why the out rage from you? Is it unreasonable to reduce the % of these effects?<br />

Fact that can be proven are what Sony SPECIFICALLY said about Afflictions relationship with working only with DoT...which was never over turned in ANY definable statement by Sony...so as such the last PROVABLE fact( statement) Sony made was that Affliction was meant to work only with DoTs. -everything- else is open to speculation....if your never going to get my point...why keep arguing with me? Are you trying to not understand me<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read Ataraks post and think Im gonna follow his advice and quit this...maybe I stopped some people to think...maybe not...but in the end, it had to be a slightly interesting read :)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there are lots of other reasonable reasons for removing the effect on certian spells, but to say they were overpowering to the spells which they effected is just plain silly.  It just doesnt hold water no matter how you try and look at it.<br />
<br />
Evel, give it up.  You might see some obscure point to hang your whole argument on but the fact is, SOE know this was working with those spells, and they didnt feel the need to change it until now.  And now its bitting them in the ass because they let it go for too long.  It WAS wrong to do what they did...PERIOD!

Im going to reply to you on a personal level since we know who each other is....<br />
<br />
Ive said all along that it was unfair that Sony helped let the assumed notion that affliction was to effect slows-malo. Ive said all along that I can understand why this is upsetting to some.<br />
<br />
I also stated that life isn't fair...and one of the first lessons learned was its -your- responsibility to be aware of your surroundings...if -you- fail to do so your bound to get an unpleasant suprise from time to time.<br />
<br />
Being aware of your surroundings is in context of: If something is this important to you...its a great idea to find out the details...now ask yourself where you got those details and ask yourself who mislead you....There are players that are conscious of the games mechanics and were worried that this effect would change...the threat of that happening has been there since day one....who chose to ignore that danger...and did your detail trickle down from this group of players?<br />
<br />
Once again, Im sorry to all my friends who disagree with me, Im sorry to everyone who has bantered with me in civil debate...shoot I even feel bad for the haters....trust me, I KNOW what this level of frustration with something feels like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes on June for 1 day SOE stated in 1 patch message that they intended for affliction items to work only with dots. I have never disagreed with that statement. <br />
<br />
What about all the other facts? The following patch changed the function of these items again. Prior to the patch going live the Dev team was aware that the function of affliction items had returned to their previous state.<br />
<br />
The november patch once again changed the function of the item and stated the items were now working properly.<br />
<br />
The only posted list of items, abilities and effects that were currently being reviewed and were considered not working as intended made no mention of focus items.<br />
<br />
What makes the one line in a patch message in June more valid that any of these other facts? Or that the assumption the June patch message was correct and the November patch message was wrong more logical?<br />
<br />
Why is it that the other changes must have some clear statement of intent from SOE, when SOE has stated that they do not generally make this information officially available and that they prefer to have the players discover information for themselves in game.<br />
<br />
I do not claim to be able to divine the intent of anyone. I never claimed &quot;life was fair&quot;, or any of the other straw arguments you have brought up. I have merely refuted your claim that I as a player should have somehow divined the long term intent of the Dev team based entirely on 1 single line in 1 single patch message and known that for that effect only that they were never going to intentionally change the function without telling us clearly in black and white.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Hi Evel,<br />
<br />
This is not a personal attack on you.  In fact, in order to not be upset by you, I have to rationalize that you are not very familiar with the adult business world or even with the court of law.<br />
<br />
You still and have been harping on a few sentences given by Verant while keep on ignoring what they have done in the 9 months.  To you, words are more important than the actions.<br />
<br />
And on that premise, you try to build a case and anger many shamans here.<br />
<br />
My good advice for you is to stop your case before all your shaman friends turn against you.  <br />
<br />
Do you really think that you are offering a fresh perspective?  You think you have discovered something new or that we are unable to evaluate our circumstances taking into account what Verant had said about affliction foci items in the past?  <br />
<br />
Many shamans, including myself, have seen the term 'damage over time' and doubted that it should have worked for debuff spells in the beginning.  But nine months, 1 expansion and many new items have convinced me that Verant must be using the term conveniently.<br />
<br />
It's like :<br />
<br />
Idiot A killed person B.  Everyone saw it.  Everyone said Idiot A should be punished.  Suddenly, you appeared and fought for Idiot A and said, &quot;NO, Idiot A claimed he didn't kill person B, Idiot A said he didn't kill, and that should be the predominant evidence&quot;.<br />
<br />
Everyone will judge based on what actually happened while you kept on harping on what Idiot A said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Atarak, what's with this heckling?<br />
<br />
People have tried different approaches in responding to Evel, since he maintains that anyone who doesn't agree with him is &quot;blind&quot; or &quot;not objective&quot; or perhaps just dense.  I actually think he's been remarkably close-minded.<br />
<br />
The point is, what's the point of this change?  Ok, so they intended to make the change 9 months ago.  It wasn't important enough to them that they actually do it however.  Time passes, new items are introduced, things are seemingly working as intended.  Now the change comes.<br />
<br />
Why?  What is the need for the change?  <br />
<br />
Evel says the magnitude of the affliction focus items is too great.  If that's so, wouldn't the reasonable response be to simply tune down the effects?  I don't think he's right, because in his example, wizard damage and mana has scaled up much more sharply than have any abilities of our own.  <br />
<br />
I saw your post in EQLive that the change was necessary because shaman were overpowered in one group settings.  That we performed the work of too many classes, rendering them obsolete.  I don't think that was the reason for the change at all, since it effected enchanters, necros and druids as well.  If what you say is true, I think they'd nerf Cann 5 first, don't you?<br />
<br />
I think it's a product of them not thinking very deeply at all.  I think they initially &quot;decided&quot; that affliction focus items would be limited to dots - which if they are so broken that they require *3* lines of focus items to address really says something about the state of dots.  I don't think they even thought much about it impacting other lines.  The mistake happened, and it wasn't a big deal.  It didn't require servers to be hauled down, and if it was even noticed, it didn't have enough impact to require any action before the introduction of a new expansion, new items and the passage of 9 months.  <br />
<br />
Eventually a programmer noticed and because it wasn't a big deal, and without much, or any, consultation, they slapped in the correction.  Well, it obviously was a bigger deal than they thought (because they didn't think about it) - and there's no way Sony could be happy about this state of affairs.   That's what I think lead to this.  Hence, if it really wasn't a big deal, is it necessary now?  Kind of like /loc and the FV bankers, things that got into the game that weren't originally intended to be there for release.<br />
<br />
Resorting to calling everyone who disagrees with you a wanker isn't a great way to prove a point, and I'm pretty sure Sony wouldn't want that kind of support.  Sure, it's their game, and they do whatever they like.  People can respond, and Sony is happy to have this kind of passionate fanbase.  It speaks well of their game really.  If folks were apathetic, they'd have much more cause for concern.  <br />
<br />
I think they simply made an unnecessary mistake because they didn't think it through.  When you've invested 20 hours dragging folks around for an affliction haste item that's now useless for its primary purpose, it's reasonable to be frustrated by this kind of mistake.  If you can't understand that, then never express any frustration of your own and expect understanding.  If there is a large level of unreasonable frustration, then why does it exist?  That is an important question for game developers.  <br />
<br />
There's no unbalancing that needs to be corrected by this method.  There are some unbalancing game situations still I'm sure, but they can be addressed a bit more surgically, rather than using a mallet.  <br />
<br />
Gart will replace his items and move on.  In this sense you are right.  It's not a big deal, just another part of the journey.<br />

Let's say there was a law enacted that said no individual could ever personally own a diamond mine (yeah it's a dumb analogy, I can't think of a better one right now).<br />

The changes didn't negatively impact this person, so I find any real criticism of the issue to be one-sided. Since the critic suffered no loss so OF COURSE the change would be no big deal to them.<br />

Somehow I missed this section previously, I'd be VERY interested to see 'my post in EQLive' given that I haven't posted there regarding this subject, in fact I've made a point not to.<br />
<br />
The change was simple, it wasn't doing what it was intended to, sure the effect may have been significantly larger than what was expected, but that doesn't stop it from being a fix and not a nerf. They -FIXED- a broken focus, they didn't -nerf- anything, well, execpt some whiney shaman, but they needed nerfing anyway *snicker*.<br />
<br />
If they changed canni5 now, when its known to work as designed? yeah, I'd probably be reasonably annoyed, although I doubt it'd drive me to quit. <br />
<br />
See.. there's the kicker 'canni 5 works just like it says it does', focus affliction didn't, it was clear that it wasn't supposed to work on anything other than DoTs. They came right out and said as much, if some time ago. Yes, the bug slipped throughf or 9 months untouched, and yes, they should have fixed it long ago and they should have said something in the patch message. That doesn't take the responsability off the people useing them to know what in the bloody hell they do.<br />

I never said that, at all. I said that it's funny that the person most happy with the change is one who doesn't have any Affliction 3/4 XXX items. How is that not relevant? It would be far more revealing if hundreds of shaman who have the items came out and posted they like and support the change, don't you think? <br />

Gee, and note that Evel doesn't feel a loss -- because he didn't lose anything. Thanks for supporting my comments tho. Is he saying, &quot;gee guys, that must suck. Things could have been made more clear I grant you and the reason why it just happened now is a mystery, but I empathize. I still operated under the belief that a nerf was coming, but it must mean something that so many hundreds of players didn't.&quot; <br />

No, Team One Sided simply mocked those who have other interpretations, a different understanding, or people who just missed the patch message nine months ago. <br />

I didn't read all the posts following the original so if I'm repeating any points or have questions that have been already answered, then I apologize.<br />
<br />
Evel.. Just curious, do you have an Affliction Haste item?  You probably don't because if you did you would KNOW how much it affects gameplay.  This &quot;bug fix&quot; is more noticeable with the Affliction Haste focus because cast time is highly noticeable -- as noticeable as melee attack speed.  If SOE removed Melee haste items from the game, how do you think the melee classes would react?  <br />
<br />
Also, you said that we shouldn't blame SOE ... then, who ELSE are we to blame?  Who should we petition to make the change but SOE? Now, will our petitions/feedbacks be heard by the corporate gods at SOE? Probably not... but we can sure as hell try.<br />

In the real world.  SOE would have obligations to their customers, whether they say &quot;youre in our world now&quot; or not.  Make zero difference.<br />

Lets say a manufacture is placing a recall on an item.  It poses no safty hazard but still is required by their internal policy and by law, to recall the item.   They then post to the public that the item isnt working as intended.  People then ask when the recall is going to take place.  The Manufacture doesnt respond, but continues to sell and support the product.......9months go by and the manufacture decides to stop supporting and selling the product but will not refund money for the items purchased after the date in which they notified the public.  So those who bought the product ,after they stated that it wasnt working as intended, are out money?  <br />
<br />
The real world (even though some peoples believe that SOE controls the world) says that can not be the case.  In fact, the manufacture is not only responsible for all refunds but additionally, any damage cause by the product for its failure to operate correctly, which was confirmed by their own admition.   <br />

They failed, not only to act in a TIMELY MANOR (important here) but gave the impression that the product was infact working correctly by not reacting in a timely manor.

Lets analyze this shall we? Its a non-life threatening recall, say.. oh I dunno, a fuel filter that gets clogged easily. You have the option to take your vehicle in and get it replaced at any convienent time. Just because you chose to ignore it, doesn't make the manufacturer responsible for your being lazy does it? Now lets say there's some 25,000 more of those vehicles sitting on car lots somewhere, and 12,000 of them are of the 'used' category. You run off to your local rip-off arti.. err.. used car dealer, and buy one. Who's responsible for getting the fuel filter replaced? You? Them? Say you buy a new one, and the dealer hasn't fixed it, and sells it to you as is, who's fault is it? Yeah, the manufacturer should have probably forced the dealer to fix it, but having worked in that business for a period of time, I can tell you that its a lot harder to do than it would seem. So its YOUR fault, for not verifying it was resolved prior to purchase, and its the DEALER'S fault for not fixing it and/or informing you prior to purchase.<br />
<br />
You want to bitch? bitch at yourself or the guy who sold it to you, both of you should have known. SOE -TOLD- you it was broken, had you done ANY simple research, you'd -KNOW- it was broken. Yes, they should have fixed it before now, but that doesn't change the fact that you were TOLD, and should have -KNOWN- it would be fixed eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't -LIKE- the change, but I do understand it.<br />
<br />
1) the affliction focus items were greater in power than the generalized focus items (I don't have #s handy, I'm at work).<br />
<br />
2) they worked on spells they should not have.<br />
<br />
Now I won't argue whether or not it was overpowering or not, frankly, I don't think they were, and I damn sure enjoyed 30% mana savings on malo/turgurs. What I -WILL- argue, is that its such a horrible change that it completely ruins the game and golly gee wiz I should just up and cancel.<br />
<br />
This isn't the first time SOE has made .. a poor choice, and then failed to announce it. It won't be the last. If this kind of thing drives you out of the game, so be it, your 13 bucks a month, even the 13 bucks a month of you and 250 of your pals, isn't going to change that. They're human, they have a right to be human, and I will expect more screwups in the future, thats the nature of the beast. EQ is a dynamic and constantly changeing experience and considering the amount of effort thats required to keep it even working in a basic fashion, let alone all the extra stuff, I'm going to continue to expect 'crap' to happen on occasion.<br />

You have the option to take your vehicle in and get it replaced at any convienent time.  <br />
<br />
Clearly not an option in the case of SOE and the foci items now is it?<br />
<br />

<br />
If the recall has been issued, the Dealer, if it hasnt been issued yet, the manufacturer.  The issue is whether the recall been issued or not.  Notice that something isnt working right isnt a recall.  It might be a warning, but then you can expect people to follow up with question, in the case of our situation, many Shaman followed up with questions as to weather it was intended or not, AFTER the effect &quot;bug&quot; resurfaced.  After that, no totice was farmally given.  Someone mentioning something at some metting somewhere doesnt count as formal notice. .ie. Fan Fare.<br />
<br />
Say you buy a new one, and the dealer hasn't fixed it, and sells it to you as is, who's fault is it?<br />
<br />
If the recall was issued, the Dealer.  If the item was mentioned as not working correctly, its the dealers job to get the fix from the manufacturer.  If the dealer fails to make the fix then they MUST inform you of the problem.  If they dont, then the Dealer and the Manufacture can be at fault.  At no time is it the customers fault if they were never informed.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the manufacturer should have probably forced the dealer to fix it, but having worked in that business for a period of time, I can tell you that its a lot harder to do than it would seem. So its YOUR fault, for not verifying it was resolved prior to purchase, and its the DEALER'S fault for not fixing it and/or informing you prior to purchase. <br />
<br />
You could not be further from the truth and I do believe we have found the flaw in your logic with explains why you believe what you believe. <br />
<br />
So its YOUR fault, for not verifying it was resolved prior to purchase,   <br />
<br />
this is the problem in your argument.  IF the dealer knows there is a problem then THEY must inform the buyer.  The buyer has no obligation to inquire whether the new product that they are buying, has any problems.  Its ASSUMED to be problem free and that is covered under the consumers protection act.  Look it up, I am not posting it. You might learn something.</div></div><hr />

Some of the guys I worked with when I tried my hand at selling cars would have loved you. You're a pigeon waiting to be plucked, and they'd have roasted you, along with your wallet.<br />
<br />
What you say is true, yes, the are SUPPOSED to inform the buyer, whether or not they do is left up to debate, car dealers aren't the uh.. bastions of truth and honesty you appear to make them out to be. However... anyone who goes into a dealership not knowing what they need to know, is going to get fleeced, usually just enough that they might suspect it, but can't really prove it, not even to themselves.<br />
<br />
Whats all that mean? It means quite simply 'Do your homework'<br />
<br />
Not knowing is just as much YOUR fault as anyone elses, probably even more so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An even greater problem is that SOE can continue having such ****ty customer relations because SOE does not need to care very much at all for its customers. As long as they do not make flagrant mistakes that affect a major part of their clientele in a major way it is ok for them to walk on some feet and do 180 turns on their logic.<br />

This would be a fine argument my friend if on the Sony board there was a stickied post which said, &quot;Affliction is not working. It has too powerful an impact on debuffs. It will be changed February 2003.&quot; <br />
<br />
There isn't and wasn't. <br />
<br />
I suspect a person could have visited all the shaman websites and the major EQ boards -- which is all the research that could have been done -- and NOT found that nine-month old patch message PRIOR to the nerf.<br />
<br />
Plus, let's be honest. Sony/VI has said many things in the past and totally reversed their position, so after nine months and a second apparent contradictory patch message, most players assumed things were &quot;working as intending&quot;<br />
<br />
But seriously, let's get beyond all this nonsense.<br />
<br />
SOMEONE TELL ME ---&gt; WHY &lt;--- THIS WAS DONE AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE 1000S OF BUGS THAT AREN'T ADDRESSED. ABSOR, WHY NOW?<br />
<br />
If it's because you beleive a quicker malo is too powerful, say it and let the shaman community make a case. If it's because of CoD AS WE ALL KNOW IT TO BE then say it. Don't be gutless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make my point.. you 'did your homework', you learned how to deal with them, you did the research, etc.<br />
<br />
And since we're handing out cary buying tips, here's some simple ones:<br />
<br />
1) Most dealerships have last car of the weekend, and last car of the month bonuses for their salescrew. Go in late afternoon on the last weekend of the month.<br />
<br />
2) take a calculator, never trust their math, always do it yourself.<br />
<br />
3) if you can, go with cash in hand, even if you're getting a bank loan to buy the car. Being able to lay the bills down on the table will do amazing things to your ability to negotiate price:<br />
<br />
 example:  I used to work for a ford dealership in what was, primarily a dairy town in the process of growing up. We still had a huge number of farmers however, and they bought trucks, F250s and F350s especially. In this particular case the gentleman came in and looked around for a bit, and decided on a nice new F250 w/ all the bells and whistles, as I recall the marked price was $22,500.00 or thereabouts. We (I was in training at the time, so I just kind of hung about and listened and learned) sat down in the office and started negotiateing, it took ~20 minutes. He dropped 17,000 in cash there on the table and said 'I want that truck, and this is what I'll pay'. The delay in accepting his officer was mostly to find the appropriate people to handle the cash, the paperwork, and to get the vehicle cleaned and the keys handed over.<br />
<br />
But I digress.. the point is, and you made it quite clearly:<br />
<br />
DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH<br />
<br />
Reading ... is .. fundemental<br />
<br />
never assume things are working as intended, find out what it says, and if it doesn't match how its working, expect it to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I am selling my home.  I am required by law to disclose any known defects in my house.  The buyer also if they are smart will do an inspection.  They don't need to though.  <br />
<br />
If they buy the house from me and lets say the roof leaks and has obviously been leaking and I did not inform them of it guess who has to fix it?  Me.  Guess what happens if I say I won't.  I get a letter from their lawyer.<br />
<br />
Knowingly selling a defective product leaves the liability on the seller.  Sell me a car with a known defect and don't inform me of it ... well then expect a call from my lawyer.<br />
<br />
EQ players played the game and acquired items.  SOE knew the items were defected.  There is no proof the player base knew these items were defective.  An announcement in a patch message 9 months ago in no way constitutes a warning to players.  SOE has records of people starting the game after that date.  They have records of people starting the game after that date acquiring the defective items. <br />
<br />
PP and items have real world values.  Want to know the real reason for SOE's prohibition on selling items for real world cash?  Lawsuits.  If they didn't have the prohibition then everything in the game could easily be considered to have real world value in a court of law.  If they destroyed my character worth $5000 dollars I could sue them.  20000 affliction focus users at $250 each would make not a bad class action law suit.<br />
<br />
Any young lawyers out there with time on their hands?</div></div><hr />

There is already an existing focus effect, Spell haste.  Afflicition foci were intended to affect dot type spells, ones that did damage, so should theoretically work on dots and any roots that damage(VP?).<br />
<br />
It was an affect that overlapped that wasn't intended to.<br />
<br />
In short, they blew it because they didn't think enough about it.  They blew it.  Not the customers, Sony. <br />

Correct, they blew it because they said it nine months ago and didn't say anything until the bug was fixed.  Crappy communication on their part.</div></div><hr />

I got this from Graffes.  There's obviously greater focus flexibility than a generic focus item that applies to all classes.  Seems reasonable affliction would be one.  I don't really see the logic in limiting it to dots, and especially after leaving it the way it was for 9 months demonstrated it clearly wasn't unbalancing or a game-breaker.<br />
<br />
Like I said, lots of unintended things are in the game, like /loc and other stuff.</div></div><hr />

2.  Sony do not maintain a list of outstanding bugs for public scrutiny: surely they ought to if players are supposed to avoid buying items that will be nerfed on this basis.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say they were trivial, I said they were easy.  The Foci you threw up were all in Tier 2 planes, Affliction 3 items are much easier to get by comparision.  Harder Foci get better bonuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Hemdall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">Let us be honest here.  The main reason Verant changed affliction focus was to hinder charming by enchanters and druids.  Currently, there is no other power in the game that equals a charmed mob in PooP.  Add the fact that roots, very important when charming were also affected by affliction focus affects only helped the charming.  I know, I have witnessed what an enchanter and a druid can do when teamed up.  I felt like a third wheel.<br />
<br />
I would agree that affliction focus should only affect dots.  At least the name and the lucy description imply's that.  As many people have posted here, Verant should have done a better job at letting people know about the bug and what they were going to do about it.  They have a poor record with this, especially with issues that affect shaman.  &quot;Working as intended&quot; ring a bell??<br />
<br />
I think the main reason for the complaints is that affliction focus doesnt do didley anymore.  Yeah, we use dots when soloing.  But other than that, using dots, 50+, is just plain silly.  Either we are doing something else, like slowing or healing, or it is not logical to use a dot because the battle is done so fast.  The fast killem quick battles of PooP kinda makes the entire dot line worthless.<br />
<br />
Verant found a way to hinder charming so they took it.  Plain and simple.  In the process they trampled us.  Will they stop here?  Dunno about that.  That is just how I see it.<br />
<br />
Hemdall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">You're right Jaeden, I'm just pointing out that focus III items only effect up to level 60 spells, whereas the others I posted effect up to level 65 spells.  So, the focus III ones should be easier to get, and the others should be harder to get.  That's the way it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">And to get the higher percentage for slow, you have to get the harder foci, instead of a lower level foci rendering an entire focus(Spell Haste) obsolete.<br />

Your both making the same BAD point.  <br />
<br />
1) Your original point about the original patch saying it was a BUG was valid.<br />
2) Where your logic goes south is in reference to the &quot;Affliction 4 Items are now working as intended patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
Multiple times you've said &quot;In Sony's Mind.&quot; they meant.   No offense, but thats crap logic.  You can't read thier mind.  <br />
<br />
There's EQUAL validity to the viewpoint that it was a continued buf AND that the 2nd patch meant they changed thier mind.  ((which they changed a 3rd time)).<br />
<br />
Theres only 2 Absolute Answers Here:<br />
1) It was a continued Bug, that Sony MISLEAD people ((assume accidently)) to thinking was working as intended.   <br />
<br />
2) Sony flipped flopped twice.  Dot Only.   Non Dots.  Back to Dot Only.<br />
<br />
In either case, Gear Selection was made BECAUSE of Verant.<br />
And Players are upset at either a Stupid Mistake ((Publishing working as intended)) or NERF.  Either case, people want the change undone, or some sort of repayment for the WASTED TIME<br />
caused DIRECTLY BY SONY.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BECAUSE this is thier mistake, they should revisit the issue becaus</div></div><hr />
