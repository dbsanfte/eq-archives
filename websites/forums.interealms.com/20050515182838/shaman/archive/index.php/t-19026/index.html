And we can't know what we want, until we know what our class is.  Feel free to add your vision (hehe) on what our class.<br />
<br />
A major flaw of EQ, IMO, is that it was heavily influenced by AD&amp;D - Verant tried making an online RPG, and it got away from them.  So, their original idea's were fairly well worked out in some ways, and really lax in others.<br />
<br />
A quick lookup of online dictionaries returns quite a selection.<br />
<br />
sha·man<br />
(click to hear the word) (http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/pron/S0314600.wav)  (shämn, sh-)<br />
n.<br />
<br />
A member of certain tribal societies who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit world and who practices magic or sorcery for purposes of healing, divination, and control over natural events.<br />
<br />
a priest or priestess who uses magic for the purpose of curing the sick, divining the hidden, and controlling events<br />
<br />
somebody who acts as a go-between for the physical and spiritual realms, and who is said to have particular powers such as prophecy and healing<br />
<br />
The characteristics of Shamanism is the existence of certain sooth-sayers or medicine-men, who profess a special art of dealing with the mischievous spirits who are supposed to produce illness and other calamities, and who invoke these spirits and ascertain the means of appeasing them, in trance produced by fantastic ceremonies and convulsive dancings.<br />
<br />
Drug Related Street Terms/Slang Words:  Shaman - peyote<br />
<br />
There are three priest classes.<br />
Clerics are the priests of the gods, taking the traditional Cleric setup from AD&amp;D.  They have a lot of healing, can melee somewhat, and use a variety of other spells to improve combat abilities.  They are more evective against undead than most others.<br />
<br />
Druids are the priests of nature, again mostly influenced by the AD&amp;D druid.  Their spells focus on nature &amp; animals, with a mix of healing and damage, and a few buffing type spells.<br />
<br />
Shaman are...  Hmm.  Maybe part of the problem is that AD&amp;D didn't really have a Shaman class to influence EQ. ;)  The shaman's main focus is on using the spirits to effect others.  The &quot;traditional&quot; shaman is focused mainly on healing &amp; curing diseases, by driving out the bad spirits, or afflicting these spirits on enemies.  Fortune telling, &amp; prophecy are attributed to them, as well as recognizing totem animals, which mainly help by bringing out innate attributes.<br />
<br />
So, what do we focus on in game?<br />
<br />
Healing - been talked about in other threads, but we're a definate third, behind Clerics &amp; Druids.  The only thing we really excel at is curing disease.<br />
<br />
Damage - again, been talked about.  The traditional concept would be mostly damage by affliction, sending the spirits against someone - so mainly, poison &amp; disease.  The problem of disease DoT's is that they take too long to really be effective in most group or raid situations.  Debuffs would also<br />
<br />
Buffs &amp; debuffs - with the aid of the spirits, we can enhance or afflict others.  I don't think there's much wrong with the core concept of debuffing.  Buffs on the other hand, are mostly useless - I remember many threads of damage parsing, showing the minor effectiveness of stat buffs.  Even though we're the &quot;kings of buffing&quot;, most of our buffs are pretty useless.  Strength, Dex, Agility, Cha...   The only thing we really get use out of is Stamina (to increase base hp), our Talisman line, mainly for hp, and a smaller selection of hastes, if there's no one else around to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As priests of the spirits, we use the spirits (either by asking or commanding - read the epic storyline if you haven't ever seen it).  Through the intercession of the spirits, we can heal &amp; cure, afflict others with damage or disempowering curses, and likewise enhance someone's performance.<br />
<br />
My ideas for what could be changed, or enhanced:<br />
<br />
Healing - mostly good, really.  A newer, larger fast heal would be nice, since the game engine equates increased difficulty with harder hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
Curing - I honestly think we're good in this arena.  We have a variety of decent single cures, and LoY was great just for Blood of Nadox.  Add in the Radiant Cure AA, and I'd say we're pretty good.<br />
<br />
Damage - While diseases might fit the more traditional view of the shaman, they don't work well in most cases in the game.  Poisons are a lot better, and our nukes aren't horrible...  I'm mostly impartial on this side.<br />
<br />
Debuffs - Mixed feelings here.  Honestly, we're not getting more than a 75% slow.  What I would like to see are better debuffs, as far as resists are concerned.  Although, a stun would be nice - what is a stun, but a short term, 100% slow?<br />
<br />
Buffs - These suck, flat out.  We have (I believe) about 9 seperate buff lines.  Str, Dex, Agi, Sta, Cha, HP (Talisman/Focus), AC, melee (Fury/Avatar), and haste.  Of these, half are useless.  The game engine gives no real benefit for increasing Str, Dex, Agi, or Cha.  Clerics overwrite our AC buff.<br />
<br />
Buffs are, IMO, the one place we could get a major direction of focus, revamp, and a niche of our own.<br />
<br />
 They should completely cut the Str, Dex, Agi &amp; Cha lines.<br />
 Add our AC line to the Talisman/Focus line (Inner Fire was AC &amp; HP - but they never continued.  After that, we had seperate AC and HP buffs.)<br />
  Change the Sta buff to add Sta and enhance Sta regen (for the new melee changes).<br />
 Add a new line of melee enhancement buffs - single &amp; group.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I've kicked out my ideas on a new line of enhancements before - Totem buffs.  These would be something that'd add raw ATTK, as well as a variety of other proc-type effects to the individual, not their weapons - DD, Knockback, Slam, small DoT...  I'm sure there are a lot of other idea's to add.<br />
<br />
In addition, enhance the Ward idea they currently have for stamina regen - why not use a short term, summoned, auto-dropped item that puts out an ae buff effect?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to comment on Alchemy.  Wow.  This skill used to really suck big time - I remember doing combines at 15th, and people not being able to get any skillups, despite continued assurance that everything was &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
The revamp that came along was good, but not really great.  Once again, a large part of it was about stat buffs - which people didn't want.  The utility potions were nice, with a variety of wanted potions - sow, IVU, damage shields, gates...  Luclin added a few potions really only usefull for skilling up, and LoY had a few &quot;neats&quot;, but nothing really helpull.  PoP was a mixed bag as well, I think.<br />
<br />
Not sure what could be added here, but I feel it could use a serious boost.</div></div><hr />
