2)   Make sure he die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a level 60 Shaman you should have no problem with this guy. <br />
<br />
I did him with my level 60 warrior and figured he would be a piece of cake (surprise). I had no buffs on and he really did a number on me. When I was down to two bubs of health I saw I was not going to win so I ran for the zone -- huge train. I zoned and did a quick bind wound and zoned back in. Much to my surprise he was almost at the zone. He did not return to his spawn spot, so I pulled him closer to the zone and preceded to zone out again and heal some more. When I went back into the zone there he was. He does not regen fast so I was able to kill him right at the zone in. <br />
<br />
May be a way to go if you run into trouble but I think this guy would be a piece of cake to a 60 shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we did this guy just last night, had a 55 claric, 51 monk and 51 druid and myself. piece o cake =) got off slow after malo finally stuck, so his resists cant be too high...<br />
yay clickey-boots!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed him today with myself (52 shaman), 51 monk, and 53 cleric.  I was not able to slow him.  If I had been able to slow him on the first try, we probably wouldnt have need the cleric.  Bring more just to be safe, though.  Our monk is a hardass and single pulled him to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once you get him to the zone, you've won. He has no pathing, so he'll sit there as long as it takes for you to zone in, land a debuff, zone out, heal, repeat. Once you've slowed him, have your friend/friends, who were waiting inside MM at the zone, beat it up for you. I did it at 53/52 (died on the pull and lost level) with a necro who was level 53 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zukasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can also invis your way all the way to where he spawns. Clear the inkies that live in the area just before him (easy), then pull the Dire to that same spot and fight. Did him with my 60 druid and 55 warrior (in Indicolite, so no uber velious armor). First time I got pwned because I engaged while at 50m, second time I killed the Dire (druid went from FM to 20m from heals and nukes, mob wasn't slowed, warrior used defensive while it lasted). Dire didn't resist any of the spells the dr00dad cast on him (used snare, epic, winged death, wildfire)<br />
<br />
Also used the war+dru team to sneak up to the advisor to assassinate him to get the Dire to spawn.. Talk about some edge-of-seat moments :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only advice I have is do NOT have Dogdog up.  The pathing where the BD spawns is screwed, and can cause a very unintentional train... on yourself.  (Found that out the hard way, taking a mage to help a younger shaman in our guild get the fur)<br />
<br />
Beyond that, resisted e-bolt from me (52) 3 times, so might be a little more resistant than some claim.   But, in general, nothing a well balanced group of 40's can't take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rumor has it that the Black Dire is on a spawn timer as well as being a triggered spawn.  Is this true?  I was in Mistmore last night looking for him.  Both times that I went in, he was being killed or had just been killed.  Both groups said that he was just up.  They didn't kill the Advisor, he was just there.  I was also told that if you kill off the blood wolves, the Dire will eventually spawn.  Last night was the first time that I had heard that one.<br />
<br />
I have the 6 sheets and the 3 books from Ghiosk, I just need the pelt to continue on my quest.  I sure could use the boots too.  I'm hoping to call in friends quickly and not need to go through the hassle of killing off the Advisor.  I hate putting my friends / guildmates out by dragging them there for any longer than they need to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I went to do mine, had to kill advisor to get it to spawn.  The spawn was instantaneous to the death of the Advisor, who went down easy to a group of 40's.<br />
<br />
When we took him down the second time, it was up, but there was another guild inside, camping Xictl (or whatever) for the Pally Soulfire hilt, and they couldn't remember if they took out the advisor or not... My guess is, to get through the ballroom, they did.  I have never heard nor read of him being on a random spawn timer, but only forcably spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He can spawn on his own, but not sure what the time-table is on this.<br />
<br />
It is much easier just to go in and kill the advisor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>QueenGoddess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just got back from doing MM with a group of (50? sham, 45 cleric, 43 pally, 50? enc, 50? monk, and little ole me 41 sham..<br />
<br />
Kill the advisor; then go get the dire...make sure he gets tashed, and then it's pretty easy..  We get to go back for me now :)</div></div><hr />
