<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES<br />
&gt;This, from a Canadian newspaper, and is worth sharing.<br />
&gt;America: The Good Neighbor.<br />
&gt;Widespread but only partial news coverage was given<br />
&gt;recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from<br />
&gt;Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television<br />
&gt;commentator. What follows is the full text of his<br />
&gt;trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the<br />
&gt;Americans as the most generous and possibly the least<br />
&gt;appreciated people on all the earth.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and<br />
&gt;Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the<br />
&gt;Americans who poured in billions of dollars and<br />
&gt;forgave other billions in debts. None of these<br />
&gt;countries is today paying even the interest on its<br />
&gt;remaining debts to the United States.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,<br />
&gt;it was the Americans who propped it up, and their<br />
&gt;reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets<br />
&gt;of Paris. I was there. I saw it.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the<br />
&gt;United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59<br />
&gt;American communities were flattened by tornadoes.<br />
&gt;Nobody helped.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped<br />
&gt;billions of dollars! into discouraged countries. Now<br />
&gt;newspapers in those countries are writing about the<br />
&gt;decadent, warmongering Americans.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;I'd like to see just one of those countries that<br />
&gt;is gloating over the erosion of the United States<br />
&gt;dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country<br />
&gt;in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo<br />
&gt;Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10?<br />
&gt;If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the<br />
&gt;International lines except Russia fly American Planes?<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Why does no other land on earth even consider putting<br />
&gt;a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese<br />
&gt;technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German<br />
&gt;technocracy, and you get automobiles.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;You talk about American technocracy, and you find<br />
&gt;men on the moon -! not once, but several times -<br />
&gt;and safely home again.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs<br />
&gt;right in the store window for everybody to look at.<br />
&gt;Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded.<br />
&gt;They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless<br />
&gt;they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American<br />
&gt;dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;When the railways of France, Germany and India<br />
&gt;were breaking down through age, it was the Americans<br />
&gt;who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and<br />
&gt;the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an<br />
&gt;old caboose. Both are still broke.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced<br />
&gt;to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name<br />
&gt;me even one time when someone else raced to the<br />
&gt;Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside<br />
&gt;help even during the San Francisco earthquake.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one<br />
&gt;Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get<br />
&gt;kicked around. They will come out of this thing with<br />
&gt;their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled<br />
&gt;to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating<br />
&gt;over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of<br />
&gt;those.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Stand proud, America!<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;This is one of the best editorials that I have ever<br />
&gt;read regarding the United States. It is nice that<br />
&gt;one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the<br />
&gt;world would realize it. We are always blamed for<br />
&gt;everything and never even get a thank you for the<br />
&gt;things we do.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;I would hope that each of you would send this to<br />
&gt;as many people as you can and emphasize that they<br />
&gt;should send it to as many of their friends until this<br />
&gt;letter is sent to every person on the web. I am just a<br />
&gt;single American that has read this.<br />
&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/agrees  See the Canadians know whats up =) I loved this article by the way. I love all these countries saying they have to stay nutreul ... like we havent helped them at any point. Oh well. I wonder what would happen if we just took care of the USA ONLY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chad I agree with what Mr. Sinclair says for the most part. However, I feel that when it comes to Canada he misses the point completely. It is more than one Canadian that feels the rest of the world should appreciate what the USA has done. In fact I would venture to say that most Canadians feel this way. Once again though I feel that Canada has always been there shoulder to shoulder with the USA. Every war the USA has fought on foreign soil, Canada was there from WWI to Desert Storm. There have also been many instances when Canada has come to offer aid when disasters have struck the USA. Two examples leap immediately to mind. When upstate NY was buried by the worst blizzards ever, Canada sent much needed supplies, equipment and manpower to assist. When hurricane Brett (I think that was the name) hit Florida Canada again sent supplies, carpenters and money to assist in rebuilding the areas that were the most damaged.<br />
<br />
Canadians will also stand with America during these dark days shoulder to shoulder to assist in any way possible.<br />
<br />
I am very proud of my adopted home and I am thrilled to live in the USA.<br />
<br />
God Bless you all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seraphima Angelique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget Maine, they sent help here during that ice storm/blizzard, too. :)<br />
<br />
Go Canada!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a Canadian reading this, I have to confess that a lot of what Mr Sinclair is saying is right. I think we DO &quot;automatically&quot; get involved with a lot of issues South of the Border. However, we have not been immune to the International Trend of bashing the U.S.A. whenever we feel our &quot;identity&quot; is threatened, or when a politician or lobby group wants to score cheap political points. Some of this, I think is the wariness of a dwarf in bed with a giant: we don't want to be squished when the giant rolls over, thus we squawk when he moves a bit. Part of this, I feel is just based on envy. I think part of this envy is not so much in what citizens of the United States have vs. Canadians (not much difference, realistically) as much as resentment in the pride and patriotism  they exude, compared to us. Americans are more vocal in their pride of citizenship than Canadians and tend to wear it up front in a lot of cases. Some of this is just the minor differences that neighbours have.<br />
<br />
As for anyone thumbing their noses after a situation like this, my opinion is those noses deserve a smack and those thumbs should be twisted, if thats the case... (Edit: originally mis-read the thumbing noses part... I took it mean that people would be thumbing their noses at the U.S.A. over this... apology if anyone was confused/offended)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is a good article and here in Canada there are many many more just like it circulating around in our media. The local television stations (like CFRB... the one you quoted from) are full of supportive commentary like this. The newspapers are publishing articles everyday in support of the US in this horrible tragedy. The talk radio stations are bombarded with callers in total shock and outrage over the recent events. There are signs hanging from store and office windows saying 'God Bless America' and 'We are with you USA' all over the city of Toronto. The public outcry here is just as strong as what it is in the US. Many, many Canadians have family and friends that live in the US and this is taking an equal toll on us as it is with you all. This vicious barbaric attack fell on the US and the US alone, however it is not merely the US that feels the pain and is looking for the revenge that so many Americans are looking for.<br />
<br />
Canada and the US share the longest standing free border in the world. We are each others largest trading partners. We share the same beliefs, goals, opportunities, and outlook on the rest of the world. There is one border crossing which has engraved on its arches &quot;Two Brothers One Mother.&quot; And that my American friends is exactly what it is.<br />
<br />
The United States has and always will be our brother, and our friend. Make no mistake, Canada stands by the United States in this, and in every time of need. Much the same way as the US has stood by us, throughout history, in all of our times of need.<br />
<br />
God Bless you all.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killer I must say that you have an almost perfect way with words, everytime you post I am in awe.  :)  I wholeheartedly agree with everything that you said, especially the &quot;two brothers one mother&quot; quote.  It always makes one feel good when those around you show support in times of change/trial. Thank you everyone for the words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just received this email and wanted to share it with you all!<br />
<br />
<br />
This is an article by Leonard Pitts, a columnist from<br />
The Miami Herald, that I'd like to share with you.  It<br />
appeared in yesterday's edition, Wednesday,<br />
September 12, 2001:<br />
 <br />
**********************<br />
We'll go forward from this moment.  It's my job to<br />
have something to say.  They pay me to provide words<br />
that help make sense of that which troubles  the<br />
American soul. But in this moment of airless shock<br />
when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing<br />
I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit,<br />
must be addressed to the unknown author of this<br />
suffering.<br />
 <br />
You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.<br />
 <br />
What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's<br />
attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us?<br />
<br />
What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was,<br />
please know that you  failed.<br />
 <br />
Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned<br />
your cause.<br />
 <br />
Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our<br />
resolve.<br />
 <br />
Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us<br />
together.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and<br />
quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social,<br />
political and class division, but a family<br />
nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of<br />
expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural<br />
minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's<br />
misfortune, a cartoon  mouse. We're wealthy, too,<br />
spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and<br />
material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk<br />
through life with a certain sense of blithe<br />
entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though --<br />
peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know<br />
the right thing and to do it. And we are, the<br />
overwhelming majority of us, people of faith,<br />
believers in a just and loving God.<br />
<br />
Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all<br />
of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not<br />
weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be<br />
measured by arsenals.<br />
<br />
IN PAIN<br />
 <br />
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are<br />
in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of<br />
the awful thing you did, still working to make<br />
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect<br />
from some Hollywood block-buster, isn't the plot<br />
development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms of<br />
the awful scope of their ambition and the probable<br />
final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down<br />
as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the<br />
United States and, probably, the history of the world.<br />
You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied<br />
before.<br />
<br />
But there's a gulf of difference between making us<br />
bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan<br />
was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone<br />
hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such<br />
abrupt and monumental pain.  When roused, we are<br />
righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force.  When<br />
provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any<br />
suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the<br />
pursuit of justice.<br />
 <br />
I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know<br />
my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know<br />
reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread<br />
of the future.<br />
<br />
In the days to come, there will be recrimination and<br />
accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose<br />
failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to<br />
prevent it from happening again. There will be<br />
heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic<br />
freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,<br />
chastened, sad.  But determined, too.  Unimaginably<br />
determined.<br />
 <br />
THE STEEL IN US<br />
<br />
You see, the steel in us is not always readily<br />
apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom<br />
understood by people who don't know us well. On this<br />
day, the family's bickering is put on hold.<br />
<br />
As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn,<br />
and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that<br />
we cherish.<br />
 <br />
So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It<br />
occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the<br />
depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider<br />
the message received. And take this message in<br />
exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know<br />
what we're capable of. You don't know what you just<br />
started.<br />
 <br />
But you're about to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The original letter that Aneron posted was first written in response to the American Red Cross facing Bankruptcy in/around the time of the Vietnam War.  I will post the specifics that I have found on it whenever I find them.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Late night, meant I will have to sift through some docs I created that had specifics on the article and contact info regarding it's reposting.</div></div><hr />

The second article posted sent a chill down my spine.. not of fear, but of pride, when I first read it emailed to me today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A wonderful thing to read.  I remember when this note circulated before, I think it was nearly a year ago.  Was proud to see it lying printed out on the desk in my company office.<br />
<br />
Obviously we all despise terrorism.  My thoughts on a few of the regions where this has happened have gone somewhat like this in the past:<br />
<br />
1) The IRA should be beaten like a redheaded stepchild, but in the end, isn't northern ireland a conquered territory of an ancient people.  Would it kill us to let em have it back?<br />
<br />
2) Those wackos in Russia that blow stuff up for sport should be rounded up and hunted at leisure, but in the end, aren't they in sorta the same boat as the Irish?<br />
<br />
3) I've been a big fan of Isreal for a long time, but in the end that area of the world belongs to many peoples, most of whom have not had the easiest time of it through the centuries.  Isreal stands, as a homeland created in 1946 for a culture (some say race, but that is another question), that has endured timeless percecution.  There is a lot of space over there, tho.  Might things work better if the palestinians had a homeland, too?<br />
<br />
<br />
These days, after having witnessed Palestinians in droves cheering what happened on Tuesday.  You heard it, and you saw it - fucking CHEERING!!  Therefore, I have ammended my last sentiment to this:<br />
<br />
Give them a homeland of their own, these people who delight in the slaughter of innocents by the thousands.  With all due speed, tommorrow if possible.  Set up nice stereo systems for them to gather around to sing &quot;we hate america&quot;, and &quot;death to all innocent americans, men women and children&quot;.  Give em lots of money so they can move to their new homeland with all possible speed.  Then nuke the site from orbit and turn it into a giant sheet of glass.<br />
<br />
I don't even that sentiment truly expresses my rage as seeing these people CHEERING tuesday's events, but it's a start.</div></div><hr />
