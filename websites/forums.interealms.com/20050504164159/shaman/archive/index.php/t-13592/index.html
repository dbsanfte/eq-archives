<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone been to the new Hate plane yet? What's different? What's the same? <br />
<br />
What about VP? Does gating work? Any other types of porting work? ports? TL? evac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my guild went to new hate and it was mastero 3 us 1  hes a huge pain now heh the rewards wernt that bad either like 80-90 hp items we got a crown and a sword to drop.  you can coth in hate still hand of mastero is in the room before mastero  and the crappy wall aggro is still there :(  at least we arent getting the whole upper floor aggro hehe.  the names drop somewhat fair loot 45 hp / mana ring 8 sv fire / magic/ cold and some other stats rec lvl 56.   <br />
<br />
and it wasnt that bad xp with 13 people  when we started   took 33 to take mastero or more i think it was late<br />
<br />
edit :  mobs hit for 200-500 depending on where you go down mastero is unslowable some of his spawns are and some of his spawns migate slow partialy  so far everything but those mobs dont migate slow</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I checked out VP yesterday afternoon.  It still sucked.  Gate does work, and I was glad that it did when Silverwing pathed to the entrance and added to my little duo.  I gated, the monk died.  Hoshkar and Silverwing both path to the entrance area still, making it a giant pain for anyone who wanted to do an exp group there.  Ok, so a GOOD exp group of 65s has a shot at taking those dragons out, but a duo has bout no chance, considering I can't stick a slow on Hosh even with Tash on.  <br />
Anyway, you can Gate out now, but you still can't hunt there.  <br />
Also the spawns seemed a lot slower than their usual 2 minutes.  Not sure what the spawn time is now, but it's not 2 minutes!  Over 10 at least, that's all I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3 of us went to hate yesterday, myself, 61 necro and 61 wizard. Layout is completely different. Instead of zoning into a small room you're now in a large 'cubby' for lack of a better word. One roamer (ashenbone drake) was visible, but didn't agro. We spent a couple of hours exploring near the entrance. Agro (even at 57) was very small, but still happens through walls/doorways. Very few roamers (I believe 2 near the zone in spot) and the spawn time seemed to be roughly 20 minutes. Mobs (near the entrance) consisted of the same type but drops have been reduced slightly (especially on regular sellables) however equipment drops seemed to have been increased (we got one bp, one robe and several other pieces) in the couple of hours we were there. Hard to tell if pathing is really fixed since the layout is completely different. I did end up agro'ing 2 chests (which use to have almost zero agro range) through a wall maybe 20 feet away. After hearing the emote, we waited about 20 seconds before they finally showed up, from another direction no less.<br />
<br />
We'll probably go back after the novelty wears off. We started as the only one's in the zone but soon had 4 to 6 other full groups near us. Without knowing the zone very well, we didn't want to stray to far from the entrance.</div></div><hr />
