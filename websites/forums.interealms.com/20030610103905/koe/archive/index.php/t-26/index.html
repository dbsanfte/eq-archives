Best of the Best - Rangers - Event Rule Sheet<br />
Rangers level 54+ <br />
Single Elimination 1 vs. 1 competition for all rounds but final round.<br />
Final round (to determine 1st and 2nd place on both test and live) will be 2 out of 3 matches.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dates: April 16th - 26th on Live Servers, times will be posted at least 48 hours in advance.<br />
Final is on Test Server April 27th at Noon, all possible servers will be represented.<br />
<br />
Spectator and General Rulings<br />
<br />
Guides and GM's are considered judges and therefore restricted from being attacked. Anyone found attacking a GM or Guide may be banished from the Arena or death touched without warning.<br />
<br />
The Arena is off limits to unauthorized PvP 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are safe.<br />
<br />
Spectators shall remain seated and not casting during the match. Any spell casting shall be considered aimed at a participant, and either harmful or helpful to someone in the match. Anyone who casts any spells (including Bard songs) during a match can be death touched and removed from the Arena. <br />
<br />
Spectators shall not use /shout for any reason, but use /ooc instead. This is so that those involved in the match can use /shout, and the /ooc channel can be turned off to reduce distraction to the contestants involved. Use of /shout at anytime can result in a silence command being issued, rendering the player unable to use any form of communication, or banishment from the Arena.<br />
<br />
Spectators shall not interfere with this event. Severe penalties are used only when directly attacking a player involved in the match, attacking a judge during the match, or healing a player involved in a match.<br />
<br />
VI may limit the amount of people in the zone to control conditions of lag or frame rate for the participants. The event shall start open seating, but may close off at any time. The Event Staff may use any sort of decision on who stays and who leaves to ensure the event is a success. This should not be implemented until a minimum of 150 players in the zone has been reached.<br />
<br />
AoE Spells ARE allowed in game. This has the potential of killing off some of the younger spectators. If you are killed by one of these spells, please wait for a GM or Guide to give you a summons into the Arena.<br />
<br />
General Combatant Rules<br />
<br />
The top of the throne, in the throne, or behind the throne is off limits to the combatants during the matches. The four firepots are also off limits to the combatants. Use of these areas in match combat will lead to contestants being disqualified. <br />
<br />
Starting positions are allowed anywhere that is legal (meaning not on the throne or in firepots) that is on your half of the tiles.<br />
<br />
All participants will be debuffed before the match. <br />
<br />
Weapons with the following spell effects attached to them will not be allowed in Best of the Best Series; Knockback, Fear, Invisibility, and Shrink.<br />

<br />

The event staff, Due to the amount of contestants, may decide to split the combat area in half. The arena in this case will be divided making two battle areas for 2 matches to be performed at one time.<br />
<br />
In the event that the combat exceeds 15 minutes of real time, then the Event Staff may cast an AoE Snare spell on the contestants, and the contestants are to remain snared till end of match. <br />
<br />
The owner of the account must play the character, no &quot;Ringers&quot; will be allowed. Any account found with someone besides the registered and original owner of the account playing that character is breaking the EULA as set forth by Verant Interactive. <br />
<br />
Any use of exploits or bugs will result in immediate disqualification from the event, and is a break in the rules of conduct as set forth on www.everquest.com. <br />
<br />
Rallos Zek Specific rule: There shall be no looting of any item at an event, this includes spectators. Anyone that is found player killing for profit at an event may have actions taken on his or her account.<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek Specific rules: You may request to have your faction restored to the condition it was in at the last available save. This is to insure that no unnecessary faction hits are taken at an event.<br />

<br />
Those champions who go to Test are bound by additional rules: The character used for the event cannot adventure on Test for any reason. Handing off even the smallest items to a player on Test is considered duplication, resulting in a warning against the account, and loss of that item on your home server. Those found extremely abusing this rule may have further action taken against the account at the discretion of the EQ development team. <br />
<br />
The transfer of characters to Test is midnight (give or take an hour) PST the night before the main event. <br />
<br />
The Arena will be closed to the public several hours before the main event. The only characters allowed in the Arena on Test for the main event will be the champions, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who signed up with the Events Staff at least three days in advance via email at Eventmaster@station.sony.com. <br />
<br />
All other characters on Test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and bound so they cannot return. If a second character is found to enter the Arena for any reason, it could be considered disruption and subject to action taken against the account. <br />
