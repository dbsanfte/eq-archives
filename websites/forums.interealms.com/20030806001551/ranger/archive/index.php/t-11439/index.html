<br />
I know on Sol Ro Umbral just became a zone which is heavily packed. For several weeks after that one exp modifier patch, Umbral was empty.<br />
<br />
Seb, Velks, Umbral seems to be the zone of choice right now on sol ro.<br />
<br />
I've tried to get more people into Akheva, only been able to a few times. Try to get people to go to HS, but that's a pain also.<br />
<br />
SSra people go with already formed groups and so does the Guard killers in S Seru.<br />
<br />
I was in Umbral a couple of days ago and there were over 80 people in the zone and no raid or no one going to vex thal. Everyone was doing exp. It seemed. I stayed there for hours in a group.<br />
<br />
Just curious.<br />
