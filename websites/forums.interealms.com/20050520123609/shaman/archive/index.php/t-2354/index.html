I thought about a Vindi BP, but I absolutely loathe the weight on it.<br />
<br />
For rings, I was considering a Ring of Destruction and Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV<br />
<br />
Shoulders, I'm doing the 8th shawl now--just need hound fur :(<br />
<br />
Earrings, I was thinking of doing the protection of cabbage quest (my tradeskills are already pretty high), and the earring of veracity quest<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Laughter?  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, the earrings (veracity) are pretty hard to do after like the 2nd one :(...but if you can get some ppl to go to seru and get the pieces (very rare) then i'd say that's a good bet that wouldn't be too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forget the Weight, for the availability of it, the Vindi BP is perhaps the best BP you can get after Burrower Tunic.    Any 60 Shaman I know keeps Focus on at all times, hence has at least 160-170 Str at all times....  Nevermind it being heavy.. get the Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Try getting a Cloak of the Sky to replace the Lodizal (100HP-100Mana)<br />
<br />
There are some nice Shaman Wearable sleeves that Drop off Rhag2 or Creator in Ssra's as well... those are good.<br />
<br />
Belt...  White Dragon Sash off of Tormax is a great item for us too.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The weight on the vindi hp has never been a problem for me. With focus, and VoB if you keep it up you should easily be at 255 str. I currently have several very heavy peices of gear and it doesn't bother me one bit.<br />
<br />
Vindi bp, 25 pounds.<br />
Imbued granite spaulders, 19.4 pounds.<br />
Brain of cazic thule, 10 pounds.<br />
Thats 55 pounds from 3 items and I have no problems with begin encombered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry Chutoi but when it came to your question I am at a lose since I am a new Shaman but from what Wargbearjumper and Taraddar say there advice seems sound. Dont get me wrong I know alot about wt issues, since I might be new at Shamans but I am going on 3 years strong at EQ just I have nothing but pure casters on my accounts wt was always an issue for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do have a question tho to Taraddar or whoever can answer....where does that Mithril Helm come from?<br />
<br />
<br />
Kelshir<br />
Your new Shaman kick toy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mez love this kind of equipment post.<br />
<br />
I still learn a lot from the give and take over what uber item to<br />
equip and why.<br />
<br />
The ones comparing specific items for a single slot help the most.<br />
<br />
Keep em comming Chutoi.<br />
<br />
Them that don't like need not read. ;)<br />
<br />
Q:  Why don't joo equip an ivander's hoop?<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't bother with the PoTC quest - they fixed it so the earring is DRU only with the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The mithril helm drops of lady mirinela in North tov.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jraven1, there are basically 2 rewards to the quest. The earring you actually make is druid only. You can how ever hand that into an npc for another earring. You loose like 3sta 2 wis and 3 sv fire magic cold compaired to the druid earring and get FT1 instead of the gate effect.<br />
<br />
If you got tradeskills up you may consider doing the garzicar quest for the sanctum guardians earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks, Radag.  I feel the same way about equipment posts, though I know a lot of people get tired of them.  Personally, I find I learn a lot by reading between the lines on peoples choices of one piece over another.<br />
<br />
My current set up maxes my wisdom (and then some, so I can afford to lost some wisdom).  So, I've been looking around to find stuff that increases HP/AC.  I think unbuffed, I'm only at about 1850ish HP, so I need the help.  AC is currently a bit over 1100.<br />
<br />
I chose the wolf-callers BP over the Vindi originally mostly on weight.  Buffs can wear off at bad times, or, more likely, be dispelled when you have to run.  I don't like, nor have ever liked being encumbered without buffs.  I just think it's a bad idea.  I die more than enough at raids to make unnecessary deaths welcome.  :)<br />
<br />
Comparing Wolf-callers vs. Vindi, the resists on the Vindi are MUCH nicer.  No question.  The difference in AC is negligable (2AC more on Vindi).  The weight is horrid, and made worse by the stats--WC is 9 wt and +6 strength (effectively 3 wt).  Vindi is 25 wt.  Basically, I'd be increasing my weight by 22 (ouch!).  Vindi does have 84 more HP, and a 2 HP per tic regen.  WC gives me 15 wisdom, 6 dex and agi, and 90 mana.<br />
<br />
I must admit that I'm leaning more towards the Vindi as my wisdom is past max, but I also really like my WC right click riotous health.  It is very nice when buffing, though I use talisman of the brute more now.  RH was a more important effect before they changed the group buffs.<br />
<br />
We haven't done much on them yet, shinlon, but I think we're okay to do the earrings of veracity quests.  We have a small group of pretty effective folk that are interested.  60 shaman, warrior, cleric, and enchanter--and the warrior, cleric, and enchanter are 3 of the best ones I have yet to group with.  The four of us should be able to farm the items well enough, it just takes patience.  We could add a rogue to speed the killing, but that also means farming more pieces . . .<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Sky is a good thought.  I've considered that and the Net of the Deep Sea to go in the back slot. FYI for the readers, I'll post some stats.  :)  Net of the Deep Sea has changed, and Allakhazam is not correct--it is now a back and secondary slot.<br />
Cloak of the Sky 25AC 15Agi 15Wis 100HP 100Mana <br />
Net of the Deep Sea:30AC 20Sta 7Dex 15Agi 50HP 50Mana 10SvC 10SvF Eff: Enduring Breath<br />
<br />
The Lodizal shell shield also has a bit more in the way of resists--10MR, FR, and CR than the Net.  Still with 20 stamina, I'm not sure I'll be able to get the Net (or even should be asking for it) before a tank. :)<br />
<br />
Not sure I agree with the mentioned:<br />
White Dragonscale Sash 10AC 15Wis 15vsMg 10vsFire 15vsCold 15vsPos 10vsDis 90HP 90Mana <br />
in spite of the resists.  I'd have to give up 15 raw AC for 40hp and a few more resists.  Also, the Girdle I have now has Affliction Efficiency III.  :)<br />
<br />
Brain of CT is nice.  I may choose that over the Itraer Insignia in spite of the lower FT.<br />
<br />
Brain:  10 AC 10Str 10Sta 10Wis 10Int -25Cha 10vsMg 10vsFire 10vsCold 10vsPos 10vsDis 100HP 100Mana<br />
<br />
Imbued Granite Spaulders are not iksar wearable, and I don't think I'd give up the 8th shawl for it even if it were!<br />
8th shawl:8AC 8Str 8Sta 8Agi 8Dex 8Wis 8Int 8Cha 8vsMg 8vsFire 8vsCold 8vsPos 8vsDis 50HP 50Mana effect(s): FT2 +15% buff duration<br />
IGS:20AC 10vsMg 10vsFire 10vsCold 10vsPos 10vsDis<br />
<br />
Radag, the two earrings I'm working on are:<br />
Earring of the Solstice:AC5 STA5 WIS8 INT8 HP55 mana55 5vsfire 5vscold 5svMg FT 1<br />
Earring of Veracity: 15ac, 15str, 15sta, 15wis, 15int, Truesight  (I don't think I can get the 5th earring--this is the 4th)<br />
<br />
versus<br />
<br />
Ivander's hoop:6AC 6Wis 6Int 6HP<br />
<br />
As it is, I'd rather have the HP on the Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings than the hoop.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions guys.  You've already about convinced me to break down and get a vindi BP :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Forget teh Earring of Veracity the time in gettin the reports is utterly ludicrous.  If ure smithing is high and ure +CoV do the Sanctum Guardian Earring quest its alot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can sympathise with the weight issues having spent much of my 40's and low 50's perma encumbered unbuffed but you'll probably find that your planned upgrades will give you more than enough str. The only time I get encumbered these days is when focus wears off and Im MLing in exp groups, I probably carry too much stuff around with me.<br />
<br />
Bung it all into a magelo profile, I expect you'll have quite a comfy str buffer. I know HIE clerics that can barely move in just their gear, dont worry about it!<br />
<br />
Be aware that the 10th ring effect will get overwritten by spell regens.</div></div><hr />
