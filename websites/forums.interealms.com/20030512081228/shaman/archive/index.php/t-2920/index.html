<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i &quot;think&quot; i am low amiable right now to the Scaled mystics. (somewhere between low and medium)<br />
<br />
does anyone know what the minimum faction requirement is to do all 8 quests ? <br />
<br />
I wouldnt mind if i had to stop collecting bone chips.<br />
<br />
btw if you find a lvl 60 necro that can turn meat into bone chips (class aaxp skill) you are all set just pay a pretty dime per stack and you have an unlimited supply of bone chips.<br />
<br />
meat can be bought in most cities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great tip 'bout da Necro thingy... dat wozna around wen me cashed in me chips.<br />
<br />
As fer da cudgel quests, yu be good ta go to at least start da quests.  Me still at amiable after da 5th turn-in.  Yer best bet be ta see if da quest-giver givs ya da quest details.  If so, yu shud be right.  Personally, me gonna keel a few hundred more explorers just ta be shur (must better fakshun hit dan chips btw).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How much better are the exploer knives for faction hit than bone chips? I can get about 400 to 600 bonechips in Paineel in about the same amount of time it takes me to get one stack of explorer knives in LoIO and take no negative faction hits while doing it (maybe one day I will work on those other factios, just hate burning bridges if I really dont have to).  <br />
<br />
If you can't find a necro to turn meat into chips, very easy to get em at Paineel. Couple spots in the newbie area that insta spawns decayed skele's when you kill the last skele that spawns from that spot. I just park my pet on the spot, hot key /pet attack deca, run around killing every skele till skele's respawn at my pet's location, than run back to pet spamming the pet attack hotkey. These skele's are like lvl2 so one hit from a lvl55 pet is all it takes to kill em. When last skele is killed, I back away from spot (won't respawn if a player is near spawn location) untill skele's respawn, than run back to pet spamming hotkey again. I repeat this untill I have well over 50 skele corpses (gets laggy). The hardest part is looting all those corpses, takes longer to loot the corpses than it takes to make em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am only at low amiable myself, I think. It's amiable anyway's. Kinda skipping around in the quest, still need the lore skull with an X in Kurns to continue to the next cudgel, but have gone as far as to hand in the dusty skull to spawn the Arisen Iksar. Have the completed item to hand in along with the 6th cudgel to get the 7th, just need the 6th cudgel. And I was only amiable to scaled mystics when I did it, so I guess amiable is enough all the way to the 7th cudgel and probably fine for the 8th. Like Yzzy said, if the quest giver responds to you and gives the quest to you, than you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would prolly switch from chips to knives because the hits have a higher value.  You are looking at about 600 knives to max your faction compared to 4K+ bonechips.  There are other quests in cab that give faction as well that might be worth looking into just to save your sanity if nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm just saying I can get 500 bone chips easily in the time it takes to get 20 knives, so in the time it takes to get 100 knives, I can very easily have 2500 bone chips and this is without paying for em . The explores are limited in numbers and take too long to respawn, I spend most of my time just waiting on respawn, skele's in Paineel respawn seconds after I kill them, the only down time I have are the ones I choose. If the knives came as easily as the bone chips, than I wouldnt think twice about dropping any hope of ever improving those factions and kill explores all day long. Anyway, if it really is 600 knives to 4000 bone chips, than bone chips all the way . As it is, I already got good enough faction to do quest to end I think and still getting more bone chips as a result of having to camp the crusader for that lore skull :(<br />
<br />
As far as sanity goes, I think that already flew out the window</div></div><hr />
