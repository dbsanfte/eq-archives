<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, check out my Magelo for current AAs (I have all the basics: Call of the Wild, three levels of Ancestral Aid, extra spell gem, maxxed both OoW heal AAs, Reflexive Mastery 5).<br />
<br />
I never invested a lot of points in the GoD AAs - they were way too pricey before the revamp. I have SCS 3, the first level of crit nukes, the first level of crit dots and one level of zippier RC (needed it for the damn Rathe Council event).<br />
<br />
I currently have 9 AAs banked, I can't decide between:<br />
<br />
Defensive Instincts<br />
GoD Crit Nukes (2, 3)<br />
GoD Crit Dots (2, 3)<br />
Healing Boon<br />
More buff slots<br />
<br />
I'm open to recommendations from the above list or any other suggestions.<br />
<br />
What AAs do you LOVE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, from what you listed (I didn't look at your Magelo, no time), I would go:<br />
<br />
Healing Boon if you use HoTs a lot (otherwise after Defensive Instincts)<br />
2 Extra buff slots if you raid a lot (if not then last)<br />
Crit DoT AA<br />
Defensive Instincts (if you solo a lot, otherwise after crit nukes but before extra buff slots if you put buff slots last)<br />
Crit Nuke<br />
<br />
That would be my personal order of preference from what you listed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since I know you are in a raid guild:<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
Resplendent Cure<br />
Buff Slots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id have to agree, Resplendant cure rocks, as does Healing boon and also 9th spell gem, Im also partial to Delay death!, its saved me heaps most people whinge about it, but i love it, free hp just in the opposite direction~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd get your extra spell gem first thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">extra spell gem for sure first.  i would say if you raid finish off the cureing aas.  personally i try to maximize my nuke DPS as most xp mobs don't last long enough for my dots to run full anymore (even magic dots.)  extra buffs slots are gold too!  depending on how much you dot crit dots may be better than nukeing AAs.  sadly i don't solo much anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the extra spell gem, it's listed in my intial post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say Healing Boon, just because the HoT is the staple in Shaman healing, and a crit HoT tick could give you just enough time to focus on someone else in the group for a much needed heal, if it comes down it.<br />
<br />
After that, it depends on your playstyle. Do you get aggro a lot on raids? If so, I'd go for defensive instincts. Do you raid more than you XP, and find yourself having to pick and choose buffs? Buy a slot or two. Do you contribute DPS when you can't find someone to spot heal? If so, how do you do it? I, personally, prefer Rains, so I'd go for the Nuke AA over the DoT AA ... since DOT aggro is boned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spiritual Channeling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would agree with Blazz, SC is a great ability, just biught it the other day and been playing with it. Used it constantly during Ugua the other nite and proved itself to me. Except when I used it to power a MGB Wun**** and killed my self. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spiritual Channeling is a MUST HAVE! I can't say enough about it, I've had it for a coupla weeks now, and it's just absolutely invaluable. It's right up there with Canni 5, IMO. It's that good. Save up 3 more AA and grab it, IMO.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Canni V. :)<br />
Oh bugger sorry thats the normal answer on someone asking for AA advice.<br />
As your AA's outnumber mine by a couple of hundred ill shut up now :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to agree ... Spiritual Channeling has saved raids. Two group Emp and Seru raids where a lazy Shaman or Chanter either didn't have disease slow and couldn't keep up the offtanks, or couldn't keep their MoBs locked down, groups where the Cleric bit it we had multiples in camp, and so many more instances ... I bought it because a friend recommended it, thinking it was just going to be a waste of AAS but whatever ... and I haven't regeretted it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, did you guys even check her Magelo !!!<br />
<br />
SC is already there :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, from one Raider to another, go the Buff slots !!!<br />
<br />
My priority would be:<br />
<br />
1) Buff slots<br />
2) Defensive Instinct (but I am a defense whore ....)<br />
3) GoD DD Crits<br />
4) GoD DoT Crits <br />
<br />
I couldn't live without my 20 buff slots, even at 20 I still find myself having to clik off pesky Ranger buffs .....<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Tek<br />
<br />
PS.  Make sure ya UI can handle the extra buff slots, I had to modify my Buff window to get the extra 5 slots to display properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, did you guys even check her Magelo !!! SC is already there :P<br />
<br />
Nope, I can't open Magelos from this computer. She didn't list it above, so I figured she didn't have it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For the record, your Magelo doesn't show you have Mnemonic Retention Gloriana.  :)<br />
<br />
Personally I'd go with Improved Lung Capacity.  :)</div></div><hr />
