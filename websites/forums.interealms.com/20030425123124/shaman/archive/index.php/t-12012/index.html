Im tired of all these tarded shammys in my guild trying to tell me that Shamans can solo better then necros. <br />
<br />
This should shut them up</div></div><hr />

The final SK mob is quite a bit tougher.  Lhranc in undead form is level 60.  Lhranc that's triggered for the final SK kill is a red con to level 60.<br />
<br />
The Lhranc he killed is probably pretty just a wussy level 60 Kunark style melee mob (read: easy)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, it proves what we all already knew - different classes are better at soloing different mobs in different situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Prepop no class will solo anything as powerfull as a GW cept Shaman. They Key word here is solo ie alone no help no buffs but your own. Post PoP if you can charm of course you can solo tougher stuff than any none charm class. By saying this I in no way dispise what other soloing classes can do prepop. Necro's are a very tough class. <br />
<br />
<br />
PS. BTW hits for 200s is cake to kill even with the unresistable 500 life tap. Best this mob gonna do against a skilled shm is a stale mate.<br />
PPS. Yes I do realize you prolly cant slow him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nope he's MR like the other ghosts in CoM.</div></div><hr />

Fairly sure I can tank/pet solo a 200 hitter unslowed with dogdog to bite his ass. <br />
<br />
I mean really man lol.. most of the people here wipe their asses with 200 hitting mobs.. 32k hps? pfft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haxorness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rofl you shamans really are more ignorant then i realized.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think this mob is easy go try and solo it.<br />
<br />
Also diffrent classes are not better in diffrent solo situations except for a few where a CoD pet can kill stuff a Necro cant. Necros are universally better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">(Yawn) Who really cares...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well after researching this guy ive found that once disease slowed he should be able to be pet tanked/self tanked pretty much indefinetly.<br />
<br />
 200ish a hit , 40% slowed isnt really anything really imppossible for us to do . 32k hp Would be a long fight , but i think it could be done. I would like to get him pulled from his spawn spot ( in the castle right ? ) so i could have a shot at him. <br />
<br />
#1 with Quiescence its pretty damn hard to kill a good shaman that has proper aggro balance with him and his pet. simply back off and heal self , pet is a seriously effect tank with Q laid on him and fully buffed.<br />
<br />
#2 even without KEI our mana regen is pretty damn good. 3 simple casts of can4 payback the mana used for 1 cast of Q. Its so very easy for me to just sit there and be hit forever.<br />
<br />
Ill say this , you got me wanting to try , thats for sure and i love a challange :)<br />
<br />
The question i guess is , did you and in 4 SK epic items and spawn the mean guy ? Or was this the lesser version. Cause it sounds like the the lesser version. Just making sure the circumstances are the same when i go for him.</div></div><hr />

I had to laugh at this one.  Do you always wear a sign that says &quot;I'm a Troll, feed me!&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He did it cuz of the rune necros have, and the fact that the mob paths very very poorly.  Basically you have to sorta exploit pathing to stay away from him so he can't tap you.  If he taps you, you're not winning, you're losing.  Nuff said bout this.  It was just an excercise in pathing exploits and pet kiting.  Without the rune, it wouldn't have been possible even so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a spot right near Lhranc's where mobs coming after you will path back and forth over a fairly large distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Reading this thread shows how little knowledge most people posting here have actually...<br />
<br />
The mob summons, so there was no pathing sploit.<br />
He can't be disease slowed as his -150 resist adjust disease based lifetap bounced 5/5<br />
<br />
The only thing he did was chain casting rune, since this will prevent the mob to proc the innate lifetap(most of the people who killed VS in the early Kunark days know what i mean) and tapping greens to regain the health he'd lose from the occasional hit that ate through his rune, whils his pet did all the damage.<br />
<br />
He did a good job. He would have not been able to without rune...not yet anyways.<br />
<br />
Instead of flaming Haxx(who has 3 times the clue of the average Shaman about this game), go solo him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">geez.. that troll pissed me off..<br />
I m gonna kill that wuss mob tonight with self buff and post a log on his forum just to have him **** and leave us alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A shaman can not solo this mob because of the lifetap.  You fail to grasp that the 500 hps lifetap not only has to be HEALED by the shaman, but you have to OUTDAMAGE it using nothing but the pet since he resists goddam everything.  <br />
<br />
Summoning mobs in kunark only summon once every 15 seconds.  Between then you can exploit pathing all you want to get room to cast another rune.  This is what the necro did, I am sure of it Giac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Grats on yer awesome kill. Of course Enchanters and Bards have soloed some amazing stuff too so I would hardly say that Necros are universally better. And they did it without buffs from 3 other classes. I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;solo&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Lhranc has no regen.<br />
<br />
Any class that can rune itself and do some damage can theoretically kill Lhranc.  It's just a matter of how long they want to spend doing it.  Obvoiusly since necros have rune AND fd, they can do it without dying over and over.  <br />
<br />
It's one of those quirks.  Big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rignack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">His 500 is NOT a lifetapp.  It is strait 500 damage and by all accounts that I have seen it is unresistable.  He procs this at least 75% of the time and he quads and quads fast.  Yes its true he doesn't hit hard but defensive won't stop the 500 DD.  <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt that the necro that did this killed the spawned version.  For a couple reasons:<br />
1. being that the SK epic is a pain in the arse and why would a necro complete all the SK epic to do this would be beyond me<br />
2. there is just no way cause I have seen this guys output and he even touchs the necro once he is going to toss his salad.</div></div><hr />

With a name like Haxorness, he can't be any older than 12. And I have a feeling that the Shamans in your guild aren't telling you that Necros suck, they are telling you that YOU suck. IMO.</div></div><hr />

We as shaman know we cna solo things they cant and any fool knows they can solo things we cant.<br />

Doesnt take alot to realize that we BOLTH are practicly the best soloers in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Running away from a mob between summons is hardly a bug exploit. <br />
He didn't exploit anything, he merely kited the mob and renewed his rune when he'd get summoned over and over. That's totally legit.<br />
<br />
Btw, Yaguex has soloed Guardian Wurms in VP, Lodizal and other mobs as well just fine. The difference is that we still rely on slow and can't do jack(not killing big mobs anyways), when it is resisted or mitigated, while a necro and other classes don't. So while we got the shaft because of one single spell(Slow, which was subsequently nerfed), others have kept their versatility.<br />

If you mistake this for a class envy post you are retard.</div></div><hr />

Firstly I kited him around for like 15 mins to check out the pathng in the area. His pathing is horrible, so there I was smiling thinking I was gonna be able to use l33t exploting strats to kite him.<br />
<br />
he tries a bunch of tactics that dont work... then<br />
<br />
second...<br />
<br />
I will try to LifeBurn at the start (to gain agro) and SoW kite him with the pet chasing on him, casting Rune of Death between summons. Let's see how it goes.<br />
<br />
sounds like he runes to get through summons and path sploits to kite...</div></div><hr />

Nah, it quite clearly is...  If he had posted it for informative reasons and left it at that, then fine, it wouldn't be.  When someone comes in and says, essentially, 'See, my mommy always said I was the best and you suck, and now I have proof she's right, so nyah, nyah!' - well, um, that's class envy and trolling at it's finest. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was referring to my post.<br />
<br />
Hroth: Every kiter will check the pathing, if a mob can't path to a certain point, he will just warp on you and that's pretty bad if you are planning on kiting for several minutes.<br />
He kites, period. The Rune he's refreshing between summons makes sure Lhranc doesn't proc the lifetap. No exploits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they can tap a mob they don't have to. He just had to kite Lhranc because he couldn't tap him.<br />
<br />
Care to name a mob that you think we can solo and they can't ? Just wondering if you can back up what you say with some knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Wow, seems like ol' Haxorness wants to do a little measuring, but I will bow out cause I am just average  ;) <br />
<br />
Then again we can just use this as solid proof that Necro's should be nerfed because they can solo so much more without the aid of slow OR charm. After all they have been made much more group friendly and all, they should not need to be able to solo like that. Anybody want to sponsor a petition?<br />
<br />
Hax, we don't want you to go away mad (Seeing as you are the type that NEEDS to have the last word and always be right), just go away. Then again, who cares if you are mad. There is the door, just remember to extricate my foot on the way out.</div></div><hr />
