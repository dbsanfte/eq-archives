<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of my friends and I want to have evil classes, but our guild is Qeynos based.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any direct experience of how easy it is to manage characters in opposing aligned guilds? Do you have to keep going back to your home city to get spells? How easy is it to trade? Is it as much of a pain in the backside as it looks?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And will have extreme difficulty visiting the guild hall.  I don't want to say it will be impossible, but it sure will be tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I ran to Freeport for the first time on Saturday.<br />
<br />
The guards outside amazingly enough were neutral and didn't aggro me, although when I hailed them they all said the same thing. &quot;Death to the enemies of Lucan.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I clicked on the doors to zone into Freeport I got a message that said only citizens of Freeport were allowed inside Freeport.<br />
<br />
I would wager it's impossible to get into the guildhall of an opposing city. Or buy food, or bank/broker/tradeskill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You cannot get inside the city proper, but you can get into the refugee suburbs as a member of the opposing faction.  Everybody cons as aggressive, but they won't attack you that I've seen.  You are able to hail them and get quests from some of them.  However, as soon as any guard gets near you, they'll port you to outside the gates of the city.  <br />
<br />
All the docks that I've explored have guards on them, so its difficult to get very far in the city without being detected.  A scout of high enough a level to sneak past the guards might be able to get around more of the suburbs than I was able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Goj - did you try the &quot;back door&quot;?<br />
<br />
Following is all speculation, no fact or experience to back it.<br />
<br />
If I were an evil trying to enter Qeynos, I would expect the gates to be closed to me.<br />
<br />
However, I could use the Antonica entrance to Peat Bog and go from there to Vermin's Snye.  From VS I could go to Down Below, and then take the exit to North Qeynos.<br />
<br />
Total speculation but it sure looks good on paper!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL you've got quite the mind on you hehe<br />
<br />
I'll have to check the catacombs near Freeport sometime :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It should be possible to reach the guild hall, yes, but that's all you can do in an enemy city. Sadly no way to gain or spend status points, neither for your own city nor the guilds city. Because of this I would rather recommend betrayal if you can stand being a different subclass possibly.<br />
<br />
For Freeport the entrance to the sewers for the good aligned is in The Sprawl, btw., in a corner where those Black Magic xxx mobs are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, I agree completely Shis.  It's far better to be &quot;based&quot; in the same city as your guild.  Personally, if I joined a FP guild as a Mystic I'd feel rather bad that I could do nothing to directly assist the guild in increasing their status (and thereby gaining more raid zones) and I could not benefit from the status they accrue in any way other than raid participation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks all. That pretty much confirms what I'd trawled up from the SOE boards, but it helps to have the additional feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you do the Betrayal Quest you will end up becoming a citizen of that city and you should then be able to then Contribute to the Guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, but the goal here is to play an evil class in a good guild. I was thinking of going Defiler instead of Mystic, and my friend Coercer instead of Illusionist.<br />
<br />
As this would be my main character, I don't like the idea of not being able to contribute points to the guild, so I've decided against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You should be able to get into the city by going through the aquadects or sewers of each.  Once inside, you must avoid the guards, who will &quot;banish&quot; you back out to CL or Antonica if they catch you.  Other than guards, most quest givers will remain nuetral and allow you to complete quests from other alignment quest givers.  It's not easy, but it's being done.  SK's are working on Ghoulbane's, which is a Qeynos based quest.</div></div><hr />
