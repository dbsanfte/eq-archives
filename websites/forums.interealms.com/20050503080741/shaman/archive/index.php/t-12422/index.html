<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takamori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, this is my first post, though I have been reading these boards for about a week now.  After a long hiatus, I decided to rejoin the EQ community and started up a froglok shaman on Fironia Vie.  I am now level 11, and have been hunting in Innothule Swamp trying to complete the Yun newbie armour quest.  I am stuck on the following items:<br />
<br />
Mosquito Eyes (I have 1, vendor bought)<br />
Bull Alligator Spines<br />
Undead Froglok Talisman<br />
<br />
I have killed hordes of fetid froglok ghouls as well as adult and feral bleeders, but I have yet to get a single mosquito eye or talisman to drop.  I have only killed about 25 or 30 bull gators, so I guess not getting the spines yet is understandeable.  Any hints on getting these items to drop?<br />
<br />
I know absolutelty noone on this server, all my old friends are gone, so if you play on FV, please, send me a tell, I could use some friends to group with and talk to!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep at it, some of the armor drops are just annoyingly rare, so far most of the frog quests have had very worthwhile rewards though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Takamori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will, I won't leave this dang swamp until I am completely decked out in my Yun armour.  I just was wondering if anyone can tell me the best things to hunt for the mosquito eyes are.  Also, does anyone know if the undead amulet drops off the fetid gjhouls or just the regular?<br />
<br />
Another question.  Being level 11, brand new, no twinkeage, on a single char server (I do love the FV server though) and no friends (yet) to help out, what is the best way to make money for spells?  Only level 9 spells I even have are SoW and my poison DOT.  (I don't even have all my level 1 and 5 spells yet).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aojo Gnab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well if you won't leave the swamp until completely decked out then I am the wrong person to ask.  I had to finally give up on those quests.  Can't remember which items exactly, but there were a few I never found.  Kind of reminded me of the old Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale.<br />
<br />
For spells, I think that there are a few you can skip at low levels.  Money was tight for me as well, and so I only bought the spells I knew I really needed.  Then eventually went back and bought some of the older spells although there is still a few I am missing because I just bought the more powerful version.<br />
<br />
I'm also on the FV server so feel free to send a /tell to Aojo sometime.  This is my first Shaman though, so keep comming here for the important stuff  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">keep all spiderling silks you find.  sell them in bazaar.  You'll afford your spells in no time at all. (assuming FV works like most servers).<br />
<br />
They sell for even more if you save a little, buy a sewing kit and combine them into threads yourself.<br />
<br />
They sell enormously better if you work tailoring skill a little bit and combine the right number of threads with low quality cat/bear/wolf pelts to get leather paddings.<br />
<br />
I'd just stick with selling the silks or silk threads though as you need more skill in tailoring for the padding than you can train at the trainer.<br />
<br />
I've seen many of the quest armor pieces for sale on vendor on my server for only a few silver each.  I don't have any of hte armor for my baby warrior yet though as I really haven't been playing him much.</div></div><hr />
