<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of this patch, we can now see pet buuf time remaining by holding mouse over the buff.  I don't beleive it was so before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kursan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No you definetely didnt get pet  buff timers before. Good news for lazy people like me, know i can use my pet haste as a timer rather than having to cast on myself too.<br />
 Not a big thing but a step in the right direction I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only thing is that it's not showing the time for extended buffs.  Instead of the 11:00 I expected, I was greeted with 6:30<br />
Waiting for it to fall now so I can see if it nerfed the actual duration or shows 00:00 for 4:30<br />
<br />
Edit: yep, just shows 00:00 for the remaining duration.<br />
/sigh<br />
Great idea, poor implementation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL, well I'm sure it's &quot;working as intended.&quot;  But even in its current flawed form (which they will hopefully address since it's an issue for all pet classes and not just shaman), I'm glad they made this change.  Not remembering when I last hasted the puppy and then having it drop in the middle of a fight was always an annoyance for me, and in groups this change will help me manage FA (I always do dogdog first, and by seeing how much time he has left on it I can figure out who I need to FA next).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Going to make sure Brenlo and friends are aware of this Issue . Ill be sending them a heads up on the situation within the next 5-10min .. They wont see it untill morning however .<br />
Thank you for pointing it out .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Situation has been reported .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Happen to know if they're hiring testers?  Looks like they could use a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happen to know if they're hiring testers?  Looks like they could use a few.<br />
<br />
They already hired you. Just be glad it only costs $12.95 a month to work for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slightly off-topic ... I was playing my baby rogue last night and /conned a drachnid whilst sneaking around. I got an 'Indiff' con but the message 'You suspect that this creature can see you' (or something similar). This new too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no Cronikk, thats the message you get when behind a seeinvis mob, there are virtually 0 mobs in the game that see through sneak so long as you remain in the back arc</div></div><hr />
