<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am 61 and want to stay here to do AA. Problem is my guild is pretty much all doing teir 3. Can I still do the flags to get access at 61?<br />
<br />
Tox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">why do you want to stay 61? thats by biggest question? for the better AAing is not the best of reasons imo.  especialy now that can get XP solo out of PoP zones.<br />
<br />
Just noticed you are in Ebon storm.  they have access to Plane of tactics which is great XP and shamans are highly valued for slowing.  and with some luck can solo pretty well also.  Only reason i can think of is TLC and well what would you be needingthat waiting on TLC for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I'm pretty sure you can still do the flags and get access. They removed the flag requirement, but they said nothing about removing the flags themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heya Thrall,<br />
<br />
Main reason is I have friends that are mid 50s that I still like to group with. Forgot about the new xp range though so probally wont be a problem. <br />
<br />
Tox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, you get flags, and you get your new charm updated accordingly (did it last night after getting charm, AA).<br />
But- the dwarf is no longer listening to stories after the first time, so you don't get any extra AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You still need flags, in fact even though you can enter say PoV and kill Aerin`Dar you can't get the HoH flag without the flag from the trials. And if you aren't 62 you still couldn't enter HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But- the dwarf is no longer listening to stories after the first time, so you don't get any extra AA.<br />
<br />
Untrue.<br />
<br />
Several members of my guild finally finsihed up ToSR access last night.<br />
<br />
They had already gained the 6 AAs for thier prior access, and when they said the phrase again they got their 7th AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heya Thrall,<br />

<br />
A level 65 can group with a level 46 and they still get xp,  I grouped my level 46 wizard twink with a level 65 wizard guildmate the other night and got very good xp on each kill (1% per dark blue mob).<br />
<br />
So at 65 you could group just fine with mid 50s players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But- the dwarf is no longer listening to stories after the first time, so you don't get any extra AA.<br />
<br />
Very untrue. Got charm and AA first day it was live. Went back tonight after i got CoD flag and got AA and upgraded stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From what I understand, you still need to do the flags for PoP advancement. You can get into the zones now but only for exp. If you don't do the actual flags, you will not be able to progress past them. On a side note, glad to hear others are getting aa for completed flags, I still need to finish BoT and get torment flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get 62 anyway.  It opens up a couple zones AND gives you Tnarg's mending.<br />
<br />
With TM you can act in the cleric slot in tier 2 zones if you  have someone else slowing (and I guess maybe even if not, but that's dicey and probably will have you waiting for mana).<br />
<br />
The 62 Root also kicks butt, casts fast and has a great resist check.  Focus of Soul is kind of nice too, but not earth-shattering.  Anyway... worth it, go ahead.</div></div><hr />
