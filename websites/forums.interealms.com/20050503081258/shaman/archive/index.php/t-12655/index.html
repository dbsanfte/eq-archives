<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarek Ravnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started up a shaman about a year ago on a second account but ended up leaving the game for a few months for personal reasons.  Now I'm back..and I've been playing my shaman, levelling him up to where he can group with my two characters.<br />
<br />
On my main account I have my main and my alt.. A 60 magician and 42 shadowknight.  On my second account I have my bot.. the 39 shaman.<br />
<br />
Up until now I have been playing my shaman on my main box..just levelling him up making sure I catch as many of the details of the class as I can muster before I put him in the back of my mind and consider him a bot.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I started grouping my shadowknight and shaman together and let me tell ya..  I am having a heck of a time figuring out what to do with his hotkeys.  I want to keep the hotkeys that I use when fighting down to 10 so I can just hit the 1-0 keys on the number pad.  But let me tell you the problem.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys I need:<br />
1) Assist<br />
2) Pet Attack<br />
3) Slow (stand up, cast, fizzle recast, sit)<br />
4) Pet Backoff<br />
5) Horse Bridle<br />
6) Dismount<br />
7) Canni spell icon<br />
8) Canni hotkey (stand, cani, cani, cani, sit)<br />
9) Target Main<br />
10) Direct Heal<br />
11) Heal over Time<br />
12) Poison Based DoT<br />
13) Nuke<br />
<br />
As you can see..  I'm having some problems finding where to trim.  All of these hotkeys seem like hotkeys that I will need on a regular basis so where do I trim?<br />
<br />
I know the other solution is to play the shaman full time on my main box and move my magician/sk to the other box since they can both be played more easilly...but really, I started the shaman to be a support character.  I have no intentions of ever reaching the pinnacle of shamanhood and would prefer to learn to play him as effectivelly as possible as a bot.  Yes, I know... a cleric would be better for this. But screw that..  I tried the cleric thing... In fact my cleric is level 42, same as my SK.  But omg...he is always hurting for mana and he is always forcing me to have downtime..which eliminates the point of having a bot.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use shift + 1 &amp; 2 to quickly switch between the pages of hotkeys. Works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I 2box (actually 2EQW in the same box) a lot with my Shammy/Paladin combo.  You might want to consider combining some of your information.  <br />
<br />
For instance, For my Shammy I combine my slow spell and my /pet attack.<br />
<br />
For my Pally, I combined Cease (aggro spell) with /assist.  Perhaps this will let you get under 10 hotbuttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I 2-box a 61 shaman (Shantan) and 62 shadow knight (Skanis).  My hotkeys are as follows:<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
1. loc<br />
2. black fur boots<br />
3. pet attack<br />
4. assist Skanis<br />
5. epic<br />
6. invite Skanis<br />
7. jbb<br />
8. follow Skanis<br />
9. horse bridle<br />
10. dismount<br />
<br />
I mapped my spells to NPAD1-8  on my numeric pad, that way I don't waste valuable hotkeys and don't have to bother with any awkward alt key combos.  Sit is mapped to NPAD0 and spellbook is NPAD9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the way I have it, is thus:<br />
<br />
1: sense heading (a relic, I don't know why it is still there)<br />
2: chloro<br />
3: heal<br />
4: sit<br />
5: root<br />
6: slow<br />
7: pet attack<br />
8: /assist momor<br />
9: canni<br />
0: /target momor<br />
<br />
of course, I am on two machines, and the monitors, keyboards and mice are right next to each other, so switching over is not that hard, but gets confusing at times :P<br />
<br />
I think that since you are simply going to be using your shaman as a bot for your tank and will probably not be grouping with him outside of your mini-group it would be a good idea to have a /target *name* and /assist *name*.<br />
<br />
you should have plenty of time between pulling the mob (with SK) and assisting, standing and casting slow with the shaman. I do it just fine with the warrior, and since you get a snare spell with the sk, you got loads of time.<br />
<br />
also note that my canni is set to hit 3 times (still using canni 1) and it is a lot less distracting if I can just hit the button once, and forget about and focus on the mob for about 4 seconds then look for sit on the shaman.<br />
<br />
I found that if I do this order:<br />
<br />
tank: pull<br />
shaman: assist tank<br />
tank: stop inbetween shaman and mob<br />
shaman: cast slow<br />
warrior: engage mob<br />
shaman: pet attack<br />
shaman: canni<br />
warrior: make sure all is looking OK<br />
shaman: sit<br />
<br />
end of fight..<br />
<br />
shaman: root, be ready to re-root if warrior procs a weapon<br />
<br />
depending on mobs HP, or the zone, don't worry about the root.<br />
<br />
all I worry about as far as buffs, is quick and cloro (for me and warrior) and that is about it. rarely if ever do I have to heal.<br />
<br />
with this method I can consistantly just pull with no downtime, this was the case in gunthrak, and this is as well the case in solb.<br />
<br />
probably more info than you wanted, but for most fights where you will gain good XP this is all you need to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarek Ravnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the advice!<br />
<br />
I have a few ideas to go home and get something worked out now.  Many many thanks!  And if anyone else has something to offer I'm sure I and some others could find it usefull.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If on a horse you dont need the sit/stand commands cause well u cant sit stand.  If no sit stand dont need a canni dance hotkey.  Also for casting spells alt+4 or whatever is just as easy as hitting a hotkey to cast a spell.  that will greatly reduce the number of hotkeys using, not needing any for damage spells, or heals, unless want a message with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a button on my alt Rogue something like this.<br />
<br />
/targ phinger<br />
/pause 10, /fol<br />
/assist phinger<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
Works like a charm.  I slow the mob, bring it near rogue, flip to rouge, hit #1, go back to shaman and back up til the rogue is chewing on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing you might consider is the use of special-purpose keyboards for 2-boxing purposes.  I've tried the Nostromo N50 and the Thrustmaster Tacticalboard, and use the Tacticalboard to drive my shammy daily. <br />
<br />
We were just discussing this on this thread at the bard boards: http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=9010.topic<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would setup hotkeys that efect the other character, and rely on using shortcuts for things with the other, minus a few odds and ends.<br />
<br />
Way I usually do it with my beastlord and when i had my shaman :<br />
<br />
(wont post code, just functionality)<br />
Shaman's keys<br />
1: ASSIST AND PET ATTACK  (benefit is if you dont have a pet up you still get the target) - you can also build in your /cast slow into this one.<br />
2: /sit<br />
3: TARGET SARJENT and /CAST 3 (heal)<br />
4: Canni5 and Torpor/Quint Macro<br />
5: Spell gem for torpor/quint<br />
6: Spell gem for Slow<br />
7: Epic<br />
8: JBB or free slot<br />
9: free<br />
0: TARGET SARJENT and /FOLLOW (use this when there is a problem so I can escape easily)<br />
<br />
One other thing to note, is ya really dont need to back off your pets (keep mobs back to it), your spells are able to be mapped to keys ( ie, hotkeys map to the top number keys, while spells can be mapped on the numberpad, gives you 20 choices)</div></div><hr />
