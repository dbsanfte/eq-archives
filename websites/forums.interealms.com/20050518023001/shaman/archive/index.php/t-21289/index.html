<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Over the last few days I've had a few positive rep. bumps, but there were NO comments.<br />
<br />
IMHO, if you spend the extra few seconds to give someone a positive bump, you should at least leave your name so they know you're taking time to credit them on a good post.<br />
<br />
I think a name should always be included (positive or negative), but if you're going to positively bump someone, at least leave your name so they know.<br />
<br />
Like I said, another bonehead idea.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Another Bonehead Idea&quot; - 05-07-2004 03:20 PM -	complaining about positive rep bumps. Sad!<br />
<br />
The bitch gave me a negative bump, and didn't leave a name. I LOL'd IRL.<br />
<br />
I went from at least 18 points to 1, didn't now a negative bump was so powerful.<br />
<br />
At least leave a name, you worthless troll. It's an online board, if I was -1000 points I'd throw a party for myself. Anyone who takes this stuff seriously is obviously trying to play the social game in the wrong place. It was merely a suggestion to the masses, in case you didn't notice, I don't really take much care of my reputation.<br />
<br />
Never seen more than one of those &quot;dots&quot;.<br />
<br />
Simply amazing, oh well, you all know I'm one of the residential pricks anyway =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm still in favor of getting rid of the rep crap altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, so how DO you add pos or neg reputation bumps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look on the lower right hand corner of each post for the EDIT button.  To the left of that is a small head with speaker lines coming out of it.  Click that to leave reputation.<br />
<br />
  And I think that a 18 point hit in Rep means they aren't a troll.  The more rep you HAVE, the more rep you can GIVE.  Not sure if 18 is really a large number though, was it a red box or grey?  Red means it was someone with pretty high rep.<br />
<br />
  Leaving comments is nice, but then again.. not many people even bother to look at their own rep unless they notice out of idle curiosity that they gained/lost a dot.  It's especially nice to have comments from low rep people so you know if the grey is a positive or a negative grey :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dunno, I always try to write a couple words by way of comment, and always sign my name. I rarely take trouble to give out a rep bump one way or the other (I doubt I have enough rep to affect someone) unless the poster did a great job on a post, or was a complete moron. <br />
<br />
But yeah, I always sign my name. A man's word or opinion is no good without his name behind it.<br />

Hey that was my comment to you.......<br />
<br />
Another bonehead idea :) was the exact  quote.<br />
<br />
It was a positive rep bump too not negative.And my name was alongside it too.<br />
<br />
Bah giving you another positive 1 incase i ****ed up and gave you a neg 1 by mistake.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe people giving negative bumps don't want to leave their name because you could bump them right back tit for tat. *shrug* just guessing, I've not used the reputation system much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Griz, Wulf, and Gard - thank you.<br />
<br />
We have another anon red dot folks, isn't this dandy?<br />
<br />
&quot;Another Bonehead Idea&quot; - 05-08-2004 03:04 AM - &quot;Maybe you should complain less about the good things&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe you should read the post, much? My whole rant was against completely anon bumps, whether it be negative or positive. I'm not bitching about anon negatives, and if you don't leave a name for fear of getting negatived back then you really are about as lame as it gets. But I'm sure playing the reputation game on a MB gives some people that warm fuzzy feeling, so whatever. <br />
<br />
The simple fact you (whoever that anon person was) bumped me down, without leaving a name, is what I'm getting at. I don't, focus now, CARE. I'm just suggesting it to the community for the future. It's always nice to know who agrees with you on certain points, leaving a name after a bump will show this. It takes you RIGHT to the post in the link, so you know what other people are giving you credit for.<br />
<br />
Example, cough cough, Griz, Gard, and Wulf.<br />
<br />
Some people just don't get it =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok just to prove how useless the Reputation system is.<br />
Tugela is apparently on a distinguished road although i have never seen anyone agree with one of his posts on here and her Rep is ussually bright red but not anymore :).<br />
