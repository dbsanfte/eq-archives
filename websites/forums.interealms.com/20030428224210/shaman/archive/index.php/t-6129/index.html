<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think pretty much everyone from the Shaman community up to Verant realises that Alchemy in it's current form is in dire need of a complete overhaul from the ground up.  I am posting this as my suggestions for a revamp of Alchemy.  I'm sure there are lots of ideas that can be added to it as well, just from reading the otrher posts in this forum.<br />
<br />
Skillcap<br />
--------<br />
First, Alchemy is the only Tradeskill that maxes out below 250, at 180.  There is no reason in my mind why this could not be remedied, and any overhaul of alchemy should start with this as it's first step.  Currently, Alchemy is limited by the level of the Shaman, starting with level 25.  While I do not believe that this restriction should be removed, I do think that the formula needs to be adjusted to accomodate the new Level 65 level limit, as well as allowing younger Shamans to start Alchemy at an earlier age.<br />
<br />
The current formula is as follows: (Level - 24) * 5 = Max Skill Allowed<br />
<br />
This provides for a max skill of 5 at level 25 up to a max skill of 180 at level 60.  If this formula was kept going forward into PoP, we could expect that the new max skill level would be 205, still nowhere near the 250 other tradeskills have.<br />
<br />
The formula I would propose is as follows: (Level - 14) * 5 = Max Skill Allowed<br />
<br />
This new formula would provide for a max skill of 5 starting at level 15, and go up to a max skill of 250 at level 65. This would provide us the ability to fully explore a wide variety of potential new potion possibilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prices<br />
------<br />
One of the longest running complaints from Shamans has been the prices for herbs and the buyback prices of potions.  Base herb prices has a tremendous impact on how saleable our potions are on the player market.  Buyback prices are mainly a matter of returning some portion of the amount spent on regents for potions that are not readily sellable on the open market.  Making a potion for 20pp that is not sellable to any player for that much money, yet returns only a little over 9gp from an NPC merchant, has been and is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
I don't think that anyone believes that Alchemy should make them rich.  Other than Jewelry making in the old days, or being at 250 skill with the recent PoTC quest, few tradeskillers in any skill make their fortune from their trade.  Also, just as most of the possible combinations in Jewelry and other skills have no viable PC market, not all potions should be viable to be sold to players.  The majority of them in fact would be in place primarily to build skill, not to make plat.  However, those potions for which there is absolutely no market must be sellable to a merchant for a minimum of 90% of the cost of the materials, just as manufactured Jewelry is for a jeweler.  Lost money would come from failed combines as it should be, not from successful ones.<br />
<br />
Obviously, setting prices for herbs is difficult due to the different economic conditions on the various servers.  On some servers, several potions may be more saleable than on others, based on their cost compared to the relative economic prosperity of the population.  Titan potions for example, which have little practical value, seem to sell much better for some Shamans than for others on other servers.  Whether this is purely an economic or a cultural difference is unknown, but it certainly must be accounted for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recipe Complexity<br />
-----------------<br />
Virtually all of the tradeskills in the game have in the last year received an overhaul, making them far more viable to pursue beyond the 200 skill point.  In most cases, this has involved multi-step recipes, ingredients that are foraged or found as ground spawns or looted from mobs or purchased from other tradeskillers, the use of special tools or utensils, many of those having to be constructed in some fashion as well.  Some smithing recipes seem to be 10 steps deep.  In Alchemy, 90% of our potions are &quot;combine 2 or 3 store bought herbs in the medicine bag&quot; and there you go.  Old Alchemy had more of the &quot;find the ingredients&quot; type things, but most of those recipes are no more viable than the current Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Where are the multi-step potion recipes?  Where is our complexity?  To be honest, I'm not asking for Alchemy to become like Smithing.  I know few who could go thru that sadistic process to get to 250, and it would never be worth it.  However, there are tons of things that would make good Alchemy ingredients:<br />
<br />
- Items created by other tradeskills (brewing, baking, etc.)<br />
- Enchanted items from Enchanters (vials of mana, etc.)<br />
- Various summoned items (from Mages, Necros, etc.)<br />
- Foraged items (Herbs, Zone Essences, etc.)<br />
- Herbs that need to be Imbued or Enchanted in order to form the potion - Add a spell for doing this to our book<br />
- Ground spawns <br />
- Looted items<br />
<br />
<br />
Foraging<br />
--------<br />
It always amazes me that Shamans do not have the ability to forage for things in general, but specifically for Alchemy ingredients.  It totally fits with the mythos of the Shaman that they go out to the woods to find their herbs.  I can't imagine that giving Shamans the Foraging skill starting at Level 30 or 35 would unbalance anything in the game.  Considering how underappreciated the Shaman community feels today, this is a bone that VI could throw us that would cost them nothing.  If need be, it could be capped at 100 skill up to level 50, then 150 beyond there, although I don't see why it would need to be.  Foraged herbs could be a great thing for alchemy and doesn't negatively impact anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stat Potions<br />
------------<br />
Basically, stat potions are never going to be something that the Shaman can readily sell, no matter what the price, unless they were made so good or so cheap as to be unbalancing to the game.  In my opinion, these potions exist only to raise skill.  As stated above, buyback prices must be increased to make these more than just a moneysink for the fledgling alchemist.  The same is true of resist stat potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Utility Potions<br />
---------------<br />
Here is the bread and butter of Alchemy.  Shrink, Invis to Undead, Levitate, Enduring Breath, SoW, Regen, Damage Shield, etc.  This is what the players are interested in, what they will buy if the price is right, and the area that expansion is needed in the most.  We have Invis to Undead potions but not Invis potions.  We should be capable of making Invis potions that are 10 charge, as carrying around a bunch of invis potions is a pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Buff Potions<br />
-----------------<br />
The existing collection of mind-buff potions are not only a joke but a bad joke at that.  I can't imagine anyone being willing to pay so much for so little return.  They may as well not even be in the game.  The thing that bugs me is that there are SO MANY viable mana-related potions that could be created that would be useful, saleable additions to our repetoire.  The key is in the economics.  Today, and for some time to come, almost anyone over level 20 is willing to pay their local enchanter 100pp for a shot of KEI.  The niche potions need to fill is for when there is no 60 Enchanter around, and you don't want to run back to Nexus for a KEI recharge.  These potions would be far more affordable and powerful than those already in the game, but by keeping them in their proper niche, basically meainging not quite as good as a real mind buff, but less expensive, we keep things in balance.  Here are some mana-based potions I would create if I could:<br />
<br />
Lesser Concentration - Trivial 80 - Breeze + 50 Mana - 15 Min Duration - Cost 10pp - Herb Ingredients<br />
Concentration - Trivial 130 - Clarity + 100 Mana - 25 Min Duration - Cost 20pp - Herbs, Vial of Viscious Mana<br />
Greater Concentration - Triv 180 - Clarity 2 + 150 Mana (L45 Limit) - 35 Min Dur - 40pp	- Herbs, Vial of Cloudy Mana<br />
Endless Concentration - Triv 230 - KEI - 90 Min Duration (L50 Limit) - 80pp - Herbs, Vial of Clear Mana<br />
Lesser Mana Restoration - Triv 90 - Gives 100 Mana for 80 Health /tick over 5 ticks	25pp - Herb Ingredients<br />
Mana Restoration - Triv 140 - Restores 200 Mana for 160 Health /tick over 5 ticks - 	50pp - Herbs, Vial of Viscious Mana<br />
Greater Mana Rest. - Triv 190 - 400 Mana for 200 Health /tick over 5 ticks - 100pp - Herbs, Vial of Cloudy Mana, Mod Rod<br />
Endless Mana Rest. - Triv 240 - 1000 Mana for 300 Health /tick over 5 ticks - 150pp - Herbs, Vial of Clear Mana, Mod Rod 3<br />
<br />
Gate Potions<br />
------------<br />
Everyone pretty much agrees that Gate potions take too long to cast, have very limited locations available and cost too much.  The OT gate Hammer and Thurgadin pottery potion have also lowered the demand for our potions significantly.  It is my feeling that in addition to adding a Potion of the Moor for the Vah Shir Shamans, going to Hollowshade Moor, that there should be 2 potions to each of the locations, one of which costs the current 168pp each but has a 5 or even 3 second casting time, and the second potion being the same 30 second casting time as the current potions, with a much lower price.<br />
<br />
New Potions<br />
-----------<br />
Listed below are some possible postions that could be added to fill in the skill range to 250.  The first section is Illusion Potions.  I don't know why Verant would not allow something like this, in that it is a limited use kind of thing.  It would mainly be used as a toy but could in some circumstances allow characters to do quests, etc., that they otherwise might have a hard time completing for racial reasons.<br />
<br />
Illusion: Barbarian - Triv 220 - Illusion: Barbarian, +20 Cold - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Frost Essence<br />
Illusion: Dark Elf - Triv 235 - Illusion: Dark Elf, +20 Dis - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Nektulos Essence<br />
Illusion: Dwarf - Triv 245 - Illusion: Dwarf, +20 STR - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Butcherblock Essence<br />
Illusion: Erudite - Triv 250 -  Illusion: Erudite, +20 INT - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Erud's Essence<br />
Illusion: Gnome - Triv 240 - Illusion:  Gnome, +20 Fire - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Clockwork Essence<br />
Illusion: Half Elf - Triv 250 - Illusion: Half Elf, +20 Poi - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Thunder Essence<br />
Illusion: Halfling - Triv 240 - Illusion: Halfling, +20 DEX - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Vale Essence<br />
Illusion: High Elf - Triv 235 - Illusion: High Elf, +20 CHA - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Faydark Essence<br />
Illusion: Human - Triv 220 - Illusion: Human, +20 Mag - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Marr Essence<br />
Illusion: Iksar - Triv 230 - Illusion: Iksar, +20 AC - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Cabilis Essence<br />
Illusion: Ogre - Triv 225 - Illusion: Ogre, +20 STA - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Feerott Essence<br />
Illusion: Troll - Triv 225 - Illusion: Troll, +2 HP Regen per tick - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Innothule Essence<br />
Illusion: Vah Shir - Triv 230 - Illusion: Vah Shir, +20 AGI - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Shar Val Essence<br />
Illusion: Wood Elf - Triv 245 - Illusion: Wood Elf, +20 WIS - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana,  Vital Essence<br />
Illusion: Skeleton - Triv 215 - Illusion: Skeleton, Effect: Lich - Cost 110pp - Herbs, Cloudy Mana, Essence Emerald<br />
Illusion: Spectre - Triv &gt;250 - Illusion: Spectre, Effect: Arch Lich - Cost 220pp - Herbs, Clear Mana, Essence Emerald<br />
<br />
Cursed Reviviscence - Triv &gt;250 - Effect: Reviviscence, Res Effects last 1 game day - Cost 250pp - Herbs, Clear Mana, Essence Emerald, Celestial Essence<br />
<br />
Other Ressurection type spells may be possible, although they show the most potential for being unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Upgrades to the Rejuvenation, Damage Shield, and other potions would be nice.  An enhanced EB potion that does not require a fishscale, or lev that does not require a batwing, would be great.  Perhaps make part of the recipe a mage summoned lev ring for the no regent lev potion, and similar for the EB potion, effectively turning the No Rent Mage summoned items into non-No Rent potions using Alchemy.<br />

There are lots more ideas out there....now if only VI will listen and act.<br />

<br />
This is a *great* post and pretty much sums up a lot of other ideas floating around in this forum as well as effectively tackling one of the most common complaints of the shaman community, 'Fix Alchemy.'  While I agree with the majority, I have a few points I take issue with or would expect others to.<br />
<br />
Ress potions.  While I think this would be an extremely useful addition, I just don't think it's ability shaman should have.  Some feel that clerics already lost alot of their day to day utility in the Incomplete Heals that just went in (not my opinion, see other threads).  I think this would only further that opinion.  No, clerics will NEVER be useless, but farming out their abilities to other classes is a little unfair I think.  Maybe.... just MAYBE, a revive potions of some sort that didn't prohibit an exp ress later would be in order.<br />
<br />
Shaman forage?  Erm, Iksar already have this.  Not to be petty, and I'm NOT trying to get into a debate on which race is the better shaman, but if this racial ability is handed out to the whole class, shouldn't they be compensated in some way?  <br />
<br />
Gate potions, while I think the revisions you've posted are necessary, I honestly think they should be cheaper to make.  Why?  I know a guy who 2boxes a 60 shaman and 60 warrior.  He uses Thurg potions despite a high skill in alchemy because stocking up on ingedients is cheaper/easier then supplying alchemy made ones to his warrior (and the location is more appealing) and this guy has absolutely no problems generating a lot of money when he wants it.<br />
<br />
Mana regen potions, again, I fully support your proposed revisions, but I doubt the enchanter community would go for it.  While I like them depending on chanter made ingredients, I can't help but predict those vials of mana would skyrocket in price in the bazaar.  Shaman being able to effectively 'cast' KEI just isn't right (tho I sure wish we could!).<br />
<br />
Illusion potions should be illusions only, imho.  Just seems a little too much otherwise.  No faction, no bonus, just a toy to keep it interesting.  Make em lore and/or do drop to limit usage (tho I'd love to have gnome rangers out there for sac to the loot gods).  I'd still make em with no bonus, and I know folks who would buy them at 100pp or so apiece if they were tradable.<br />
<br />
MOST importantly, which you mentioned and I fully and totally agree with, make availability the limiting factor.  Stop making alchemy depend on your bank account, there's MUCH better things to spend hard earned pp on (see high level kunark spell drop rates).  Make mob drops and ground spawn, or other tradeskill items, part of the process.<br />
<br />
I'm a shaman who would very very much like to master alchemy, simply because it's part of our class identity, but at present, there's just no motivation to spend the money.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping at least some part of our input goes in...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what about even a bind potion???  that would be very usefull imo would be good to use even if the casting time is long if ur in need of a bind and cant get a caster to bind u or your not by a soulbinder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice ideas. But please, please, please drop the vial of [xyz] mana.

We can make dies for smithing with alchemie. I would like to see potions that you use in other tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes!<br />
<br />
Many combine need crafted, foraged or even enchanted components.<br />
<br />
Why alchemy wouldn't help create some combine?<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a look at cultural recipes for barbarians for exemple.<br />
Barbs don't have any forager class, but still many cultural requires foraged stuff.<br />
why not a potion as an alternate component for some foraged items?<br />
<br />
<br />
And i really like the idea of foraging shamans too (and it would fix the problem for cultural recipes needing foraged stuff btw).<br />
(In fact, i really think every race should have its own foraging class...  lol, remember that druids ancestors were ... shamans;) ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, skill would be caped early (100/150 cap is nice), with lizards being able to have a bonus on cap, as they already can use this skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In addition, Alchemy should take a part in any new multi skill questing.    Shawl, Ring, Cabbage quests should have considered Alchemy potions within the method.   <br />
<br />
In fact, the spell rollout for Druids &quot;Protection of the Cabbage&quot; should be repeated for any new Utility (+No Drop) type spell for other classes ... including Shaman's.    Who would not have quest/skilled for VoB with a nice gear piece thrown into the mix as a bonus ... if given the chance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>pallantides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good ideas.  I'd also like it if we only needed one 10 slot bag to do all our alchemy work in instead of needing 1 for ingredient combines and a second for potion stacking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">on the foraging idea, i think they should make it forage for alchemy herbs only and be accessible via an item instead of a skill.  The item could be tinker made requiring items across the tradeskill spectrum.  It would be of course only usable only by a shaman and make the herbs no drop.  I think implemented similar to that would be balancing and useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alchemy is not the only skill limited to 180 i believe Poison and Tinkering is also limited to 180. its not really a tradeskill its a class ability, like make poison.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like these proposed changes a lot. <br />
<br />
 We all know prices are ridiculous. Above all verant has to do something to reduce the price on the herbs, or give us more return on our investment when we sell them to vendors. <br />
 I'd also love to see the trivials spread out a little better. They've done this well with pottery, baking, and other skills; they can do the same with Alchemy.<br />
 I love the idea of foraging. I think it would add a great deal to Alchemy, AND it would be a benefit to ALL shamans, including Iksar. I don't feel Iksar would need to be compensated because they would have the cap raised on their foraging. Just because they could forage some before doesn't mean they would not benefit from greater skill at it. <br />
 Another idea would be to make the herbs foragable, but NOT give shamans foraging skill. We would have to rely on the Bazaar and the player market to buy our herbs. OMG! Pay druids and rangers for our herbs? Why not? &lt;Shrug&gt; We'd be paying them for a service. It's possible (probable unfortunately) that certain individuals would try to hurt us by selling them ridiculously high in price, but I think the general market would undercut them and force the prices down. If not, make some friends who can forage and work out deals with them. <br />
 Yes in this case Iksar shaman would have a HUGE advantage. SO, I guess the rest of us would have to be asking what WE get because of that. Not to be petty of course ;)<br />
 Seriously the answer is simple, foraging alchemy herbs would probably trivial far beyond the skill level that an Iksar's inate foraging is set at. They might be able to luck into a few now and then, but would have to buy most of them like any other shaman.<br />
 If you simply can't stand the idea of relying on someone else for your herbs, than just accept the current vendor driven rubish. Can't have it both ways. I personaly would rather see a player make some money from my purchase rather than dumping it on an NPC.<br />
 I'm honestly not sure why Stat potions don't sell considering the number of people who ask me to buff them with Str or Dex or whatever. I guess it's okay to ask for someone to cast a spell for free, but heck no am I going to pay for some dumb potion. &lt;Sigh&gt; Do people not like the negative effects that come with them? Who knows?<br />
 I'm personally convinced that most of our potions won't sell on traders in the Bazaar because noone knows what they do. How many people out there know that Blood of the Wolf is a SoW potion. Of course we do, but do our buyers? Do they know what blistering flesh is? Purity? If they don't know what it is why would they buy it? One thing I'd like to see in a revamp is clearer descriptions. Example, put &quot;Dammage Shield&quot; as the effect, not &quot;Blistering Flesh&quot;.<br />
 For new utility potions, some of these ideas seem good.<br />
 First of all I agree that Illusion potions should be just that, Illusion. Adding Lich and Archlich effects would drive necro's into a frenzy and rightfully so. That's they're area, let them keep it.<br />
 I don't see the need for stat changes either. If you want stat changes use those stat potions that seem so useless. It doesn't make sense to me to add stats to another potion when we could be trying to sell the stat potions we already have.<br />
 As for the Mind potions, I'd say no to KEI. That would take too much away from enchanters. Same with Rez potions and clerics. I'd never want to see a rez potion, no matter how long the recovery time is. They very fact that people WILL run all the way back to Nexus and the Bazaar and pay Enchanters 100 plat for KEI is a wonderful thing. I personally feel it's wrong to take that away from them. Its too bad people won't pay for Focus like that :)<br />
<br />
 Still for the most part the ideas here ARE excellent and I would love to see a revamp of alchemy done sometime soon.<br />

<br />
I agree on almost everything. The KEI potions would be great as well as the rez one although I'd say 90% max on the rez potion (one you listed is 96%?). I think they'd really give us a reason to work on alchemy, however I think they should be triv &gt;255. I know chanters and clerics would both be angry at first but think about how many people would actually reliably be able to make them. Plus I think it would be in line with the good things people can make with the other tradeskills (I REALLY wish I knew a grandmaster Tribunal smith /drool Artificer's Ringmail).<br />
<br />
Only thing I disagree with are a few of the complexity thing. <br />
- Items created by other tradeskills (brewing, baking, etc.) <br />
- Enchanted items from Enchanters (vials of mana, etc.) <br />
- Various summoned items (from Mages, Necros, etc.) <br />
- Foraged items (Herbs, Zone Essences, etc.) <br />
- Herbs that need to be Imbued or Enchanted in order to form the potion - Add a spell for doing this to our book <br />
- Ground spawns <br />
- Looted items<br />
<br />
Foraged items. Unless we get foraging as a skill nuh uh. I don't mind interdependancy but foraging is really boring and I really don't want ask friends to waste their time doing it for me. And no I'm not starting over at level one as an Ikky :p<br />
<br />
Ground spawns. Eh /shrug ok as long as it's not some once a day in one spot spawn kinda thing. If all I have to do is go to a zone and spend some time running around looking for the things on the ground I'd have no problem with it and would readily go along with it. <br />
<br />
Enchanted/imbued/summoned items Good call :)<br />
<br />
Looted items. No, no no no no no no no........NO :mad: . I did Smithing.....until I had to farm greens. I thought about doing tailoring.....until I found out it involves WAY too much farming of greens. The very reason I LOVE alchemy is in almost every potion no boring mind-numbing slaughtering of poor unoffensive little green mobs involved.<br />
<br />
Only correction is there are indeed no component levitation and EB potions. I farmed enough just to see if the recipies did indeed work. For EB you need a Froglok Leg (from Guk)+Sea Spirit (sold in Shar Vahl in the shaman guild) and for the lev you need a lightstone (from willowhisps)+Figwort(again from Shar Vahl in Shaman guild). They're a pain because of the farming but they do indeed exist. Not sure on their triv but it's below 117.<br />
<br />
Anyways again great post, very well thought out :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like we are whinging to get Teleportation spells or anything like that, we would just like to see Alchemy made a bit more appealing to all classes and not just those that can't cast SOW.<br />
<br />
Good work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone besides me notice that there is a Rogue poison tradeskill trophy out there now..... But we have still nothing like this available for Alchemy yet? <br />
<br />
The rogue trophy was never announced. Rogues took it upon themselves to experiment, spend their time, and created the item with alot of luck.<br />
<br />
Not everything is handed to you on a silver platter or spelled out on a quest cheat site. There is still lots to be discovered in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>koradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I doubt we would ever see res potions, if right click ressing was supposed to be so easy they would never have changed the buy back on staff of forbiden rites to 225,000pp<br />
<br />
Increasing the buy back costs on potions would not fix alchemy, it would only help you max the skill it would not help you sell the potions. Lowering the cost to make potions would be the only really way to help fix alchemy. And adding more useful potions with no negative stats would also be good.<br />
<br />
As for KEI potions, i would have to say no way, we would be infringing on enchanters far to much. <br />
<br />
As for foraged/ground spawn items this could be a good thing yet also very bad(Iksars would really like the foraged components). But take a look in the bazaar and check the prices on some of the basic stuff like spider silks, that are going for upto 10pp on some servers. Alchemy would end up being even more expensive to raise. <br />
<br />
Enchanters already have one of the biggest strangle holds on tradeskills why give them another one? After all alchemy is practiced by shamen that belong to simplistic/tribal cultures having them run off to another city to find an enchanter just seems daft. So i would have to say that mana vials is a bad idea and should not be included. Unless illusion potions were added then having enchanters as part of proccess would be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Looks like it got handed to us after all.  Perhaps not on your proverbial silver platter, but im not gonna complain about that at this point. <br />
<br />
As for exploring, just how hard was it to hail the right NPC and then to do the same things that were done for the other tradeskill trophy combines?<br />
<br />
Looks like the Shaman community &quot;discovered&quot; it in the patch message.<br />
<br />
Anyways despite your obvious lack of enthusiasm, i was happy to see that someone woke up and decided that Alchemy was a possible tradeskill worthy of a trophy. <br />
<br />
Perhaps suggestions like these really do get read by the developers after all despite the negative posts of others.<br />
<br />
Who knows maybe Alchemy will be used in future tradeskill quests as well <br />
(i can dream anyways)<br />
<br />
I plan on attempting to make this when the servers come back up, heck why not throw a few more K worth of  platinum at alchemy at this point.<br />
<br />
At least this time i know ill get something to show for my platinum pains. A weight reduction bag and an item with a little +skill mod to alchemy with some Wis and Charisma on it, and bragging rights of course.<br />
<br />
In the end its going to be a very expensive weight reduction bag, but its a much nicer prize than the big fat hole in my bank account maxxing alchemy skill got me along with the ability to make expensive potions of limited use that hardly anyone ever wanted.<br />

<br />
It's sad enough that you need chanter stuff in almost every other tradeskill. I don't mind using summoned / imbued / transformed parts from mage / necro / wiz / druid / cleric or even the hybrids. <br />
<br />
Let the chanter make pp with selling KEI in Nexus and the high end JC items.</div></div><hr />
