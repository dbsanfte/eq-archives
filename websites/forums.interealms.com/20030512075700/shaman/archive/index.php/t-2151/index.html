Second, i'm in the process of finishing up the 4th step.  I recieved a Letter to Tain from Garadian, but did not turn it into tain.  I spawned the giants by saying &quot;i will help&quot; and killed the named, and looted the vial.  I'll come back in 5-6hrs to hand it in as he was killed.  Any clue to what this letter is for?  I'm looking through a walk-through from monkley, and there is mention of it existing.<br />
<br />
Thx for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">don't forget to trigger the quest again before you hand-in to Tain, say i will help, turn in and then get the hell outta dodge before teh giants come over, otherwise he'll ust eat your vial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what gives you that idea?  i turned my vial in over a week after getting it cuz i spent so much time getting the damned HQ Tundra Kodiak pelts.  anyways i turned the vial in w/o triggering the giants and got my new ring just fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you say &quot;I will help&quot; he does a respawn act.<br />
<br />
In game play, that respawned version of him is the only one that you can turn in the vial too. I'm suprised that you managed to get it w/out triggering the giants. Must have been a bug.</div></div><hr />

I do recall a message from VI  indicating that the 8th step of the coldian ring quest was changed, any clue as to how?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not the 8th ring war who was changed, but the last one, the 10th ring.<br />
<br />
Since 8th may patch, after someone triggered the war, all the zone was messing a lot.<br />
<br />
anymob_01 says cannot open file......<br />
<br />
Wurms, Tizmaks, Kodiaks heading from anywhere in the zone to the waterfall<br />
<br />
Dwarves walking from thurg to the nexus spires<br />
<br />
A total mess ;).<br />
<br />
I did the 8th ring today again, not a change with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah! complete brainfart.  was thinking Garadain was who Shen was saying needed to respawn for the vial, but now i remember vial goes to respawned Tain who gives a note or something.  note (or whatever) + ring to garadain gives new ring.<br />
<br />
Pardon please, it was my mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aparently thats fixed now and instead you can expect the war to take nearly 5 hours as things arent spawning as quickly as they should.<br />
<br />
I sort of recall hearing about some problems around the 8th stage but can't recall the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">War took a good 4-5 hours when I watched it recently. Very very long. But the delay would make it easier for other guilds to partake in this. For they will have more time between waves to heal and med up.<br />
<br />
As far as the shouts in the ss there. Not once did I see a single NPC shout in the zone. I did see the scout do a 'shout' when I was in /say range to him, but never anything across zone.<br />
<br />
Not shure why? Another bug? or VI keeping the spam clean?</div></div><hr />
