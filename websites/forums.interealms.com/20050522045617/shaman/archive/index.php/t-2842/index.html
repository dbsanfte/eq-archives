<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently annihilated my VS faction in OT with a few visits to Howling Stones. I finished the workers mallet quest before doing so.<br />
<br />
When I get to level 50 how dangerous is it to use the mallet's proc to gate to the Outpost? Would levitate and Spirit of Cheetah be sufficient to make it to a safe zone upon arrival?<br />
<br />
As far as the spell trade-n quest go, is the Outpost totally out of the question now? If so, can I do the spell turn-in quests in Fironia Vie with the Barbs?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spells, you can ask a friend to get or use a mule, some of us had to do that anyway due to not having certain spell vendors in our home city on Kunark /rolleyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a port idol (6 or 7K on Tunare from Xiavier) and you can <br />
forget about the outpost and VS faction. Port your own ass<br />
home (well, a zone or two away from home) whenever you<br />
want to sell and bank. Best thing they did in this game since<br />
being able to reorganize the spell book. <br />
<br />
As others have said, use a mule or a friend to do the spell<br />
exchange quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trying to trade-in would FV mite work, but it depends if you wanna faction kill forever. Gobbos in Warsliks are easy and give FV faction, but i dont know if the hand-in peeps are on that faction.<br />
<br />
Mule them otherwise :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SoW will NOT outrun the goons.  Nor will wolf form.  I died several times trying to pull rottgrime for the mage epic, they are hella fast.  I'm not sure about a horse.  I always just kill the first aggro skele, invis, and run around taking care to avoid the undead.  A safer route is levitating around the water.  But I have a chain horse and feel invincible so I don't do that :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sow is fast enough to outrun all mobs in OT, run 3 would most likely do as well. i have kited rotgrime for mage epic and all goons and general while others killed a mob already engaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was my understanding that the speed of Sow is based on level and all the goons in OT are Sowed.  Therefore the high level ones, like the General, are faster than regular sow.  I did test this out way back at level 35 and the goons are in fact faster than sow at 35.  So be careful.<br />

lev will take you across the water, away from all the danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anyone else find it wierd that the outpost is on VS faction? I don't see the point of it, cause why would DEs and the such, care about venril sathir?<br />
Can anyone answer this for me? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because Venril Sathir made a pact with Innoruuk to become an immortal lich which was interrupted by his assassination at the hands of his son, Rile.  From there the cult of the arisen tried to revive him but failed, and eventually sarnak stumbled upon his remains in Charasis and infused his soul into Rile's corpse accidentally.  He made one of them, Xalgoz, into a vampire, and began to amass power with the lycanthropes in Karnor's.  The ranger and druid epics describe the sickly green stone he posses as a &quot;conduit of power&quot; for Innoruuk.  The dark elves were created by Innoruuk, and worship him, so there ya go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ah ok, i didn't know about the pact w/ innoruuk, i knew he did all that but jst thought that he had tried to become a lich. Thanks for clearing that up, but still bugs me that they like VS cause thier god made a pact w/ him that didn't work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
From a game mechanics point of view, what does this do? <br />
Discourages &quot;evil&quot; characters from hunting in Karnor's (which is<br />
conviently located in a zone with both wizzard and druid ports)<br />
and Howling Stones. We're &quot;allowed&quot; to hunt in either Chardok <br />
or Seb. <br />
<br />
Our Jaundiced Bone stuff drops in Karnor's and Seb. This <br />
virtually forces us to hunt in Sebilus, where only half of our <br />
Kunark gear drops. This forces us to trade with people who <br />
are &quot;allowed&quot; to hunt in Karnor's. I guess this is an attempt to<br />
stimulate the economy. Fortunately for me, I was outright given<br />
the misssing jaundiced bone pieces. <br />
<br />
Since it's such a long haul to get from Seb to Chardok, Seb <br />
becomes the most desirable hunting grounds for &quot;evil&quot;. <br />
Chardok never took off on my server until they overhauled it, <br />
but I suspect the idea was that &quot;evil&quot; was supposed to be<br />
segregated into either Chardok or Seb. The non-gating &quot;evils&quot;<br />
would probably stay in Chardok, or have to spend half a night<br />
traveling to Seb. <br />
<br />
As an Ogre, I could carry enough loot until I could group with a<br />
porter who would take me back home to sell and bank. About<br />
twice a week, and I'd just gate back to my Seb bind point.  Don't <br />
know what the weak dirt elfs and non-gaters did. Still, I did make <br />
Seb my home.  If I was a warrior or sk, I probably would have<br />
quit over this. <br />
<br />
This was a thorn in our sides, however with the introduction of<br />
the port idols, it's a non-issue for us now. The new regieme at<br />
Verant isn't so spiteful. Port idols, binder NPC's, horses, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its been my dream since I first heard of KC with my long retired level 19 wood elf(hehe,  iwas a newb) now im a 36 troll shaman and this pisses me off. I can either slaughter tens of thousands of goblins, or wait till 50 and go to KC w/ a port idol. Hmm, choices, choices :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fortunately, Karnors now sucks relative to the rest of EQ, and is almost completely abandoned on test.  The only good xp spot imo is the basement, and that doesn't incur faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At around 34, I could outrun goons with SoW. There might, probably, be something I'm missing here, but the fact is, I've outrun at least 5 goons with my monk when he was there, with SoW, and they weren't even close, they just got outrun like all other mobs in OT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The VS faction hits for hunting in Karnor's are very small. You would have to hunt there for a long time before you totally messed up VS faction. Turning in Sarnak braids in OT occasionally will help preserve VS faction. One outing in Howling Stones will totally mess you up with VS.</div></div><hr />
