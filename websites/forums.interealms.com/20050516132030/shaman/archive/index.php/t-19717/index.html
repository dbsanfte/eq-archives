<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone else notice this? Today was the first time I saw canni doing random amounts of damage. Canni 4 as low as 100 and canni 5 as low as 1828 damage....never seen this before...have something to do with expansion? bug maybe? specialization working on it? i dont know.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's very odd.  I just logged for the night and I was getting the standard 148 / 1924 during my session.  Maybe someone was runing you or something?  It might be a new effect you didn't realize you had, something like bulwark of vie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have a spell shield item?<br />
Did you have a bard in group? the rune song will do this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah yes there was a bard in group...but i have never noticed it before...tho i do not group with bards very often...im waiting on a rez now im gonna do some casts to see (mental note...do not canni5 naked lol)<br />
<br />
EDIT: yea, must have been the bard....about 15 canni4's all 148....just never noticed before...so nevermind :) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Noob question and potential thread hijack inc!! :D<br />
<br />
When you've got a bard in your group runing you, you're taking less damage from Canni. Since you're taking less damage, and sucking fewer HP ... are you gaining less mana? Or is the mana regen from Canni a fixed number, regardless? <br />
<br />
Wow. I hope that made sense. :)<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or is the mana regen from Canni a fixed number, regardless? <br />
<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank ye kindly. :)  Had a younger shaman in my guild ask me that yesterday. I started to answer him, then realized I myself wasn't entirely sure of the answer, lol. <br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, bard rune song is a huge win with canni, especially canni4.<br />
<br />
With canni3 and the right bardsong I could canni once a tick virtually for free, IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xxithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With a bard in the group, playing wind of marr with his epic, and instrument mastery 3, that song adds 50HP/Tick, add iksar/troll regen, item regen of 35, replinishment, and you have a nice 134 or so regen per tick, plus you can have KEI and Marr adds 21 mana a tick too...<br />
<br />
So for almost NO HP loss, you can gain ~120 mana per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have noticed canni4 doing 122 rather than 148 damage occasionally....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have vie on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">vie stopped working on canni damage a while ago, afaik.</div></div><hr />
