<br />
I don't know why it runs so high on my server but I was lucky to get it for 50k, it can sell for around 80k on Xegony.<br />
<br />
Consider all of you 10k Torpor servers lucky as hell.</div></div><hr />

glad the economy isnt that fubar'd on my sever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">4 manaburning wizards dropped Gore last night on Brell. 2 copies of Torpor dropped from that vulgar display of power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah.  Our guild traded a group focus for a torpor.  We also traded another group focus for both of malo and avatar.  Then we bought another torpor for 5k so we have one spare in the bank for new members.<br />
<br />
I think our server informally agreed to put caps on the spell prices, and most people seem to be abiding by them.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm glad I'm on a good server.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I assure you that a price cap is not the reason you found Torpor for 5k.  Either this is an isolated incident, or the supply of Torpor is greater than the demand on your server.  On most servers, and in general, price caps would have exactly the opposite effect.  It'd create a shortage like you couldn't imagine, eventually driving the price back up to where it should be (since the caps can't actually be enforced).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats about the only way i'd pay that for that fargin spell...make cheese for 12 straight hours.<br />
<br />
/auc WTT 5000 stacks of cheese for topor/malo!</div></div><hr />

One less person in the WTB shaman spells hotkey club :).<br />
<br />
I missed out on the cheese too *sigh*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Megumi -- price caps are DIFFICULT, but not impossible to enforce. All it takes is the majority of ACTIVE shaman to agree to it, and suddenly every lucky schmuck that wins a Torpor drop and does a &quot;&lt;b&gt;PC on torpor plz thx u&lt;/b&gt;&quot; gets back &quot;5k,&quot; &quot;5kish&quot;, &quot;seen it go for 5k&quot; and so on. Price agreements by Shaman do have a REAL effect on easily manipulable EQ server prices. <br />
<br />
I have seen ONE person with three accounts push the price of certain farmed items up by 200% in a single day of auctioning. I have seen two dedicated (and greedy) guild bankers coordinate a system of alts to gouge the f'uck out of Shaman, Chanters and Clerics for their rare spells.<br />
<br />
These markets are nowhere near transparent. Your economic theory stufff, while sound in a perfect market, doesn't hold up too well in these illiquid and opaque markets.<br />
<br />
Unions exist in the real world and they DO have an impact on wages. Groups that band together are able to move numbers (whether they be wages paid to them or prices charged for raw materials). Shaman banding together in game can achieve a similar effect. Sure, there will always be &quot;scabs&quot; busting picket lines, but effective unions with energetic and talented organizers can have huge effects on numbers that would otherwise be controlled by raw supply and demand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">everquest's spell system sucks, in that spells that are essential for classes to do their job (in the shaman's case, HEAL) are so incredibly rare that not everyone who is able to cast the spell can GET the spell.<br />
<br />
dark age of camelot has the right idea:  you increase your skill to cast a certain type of spell and you get the new spells automatically.  no need to kill mobs that require 30 people (or 4 wizards, apparently), no need to shell out your life savings.<br />
<br />
i'm damn lucky for being in the right place at the right time.  i got my copy of torpor on a guild raid, from the sebilite protector i believe.  i traded 10-12k worth of stuff for a copy for a guildmate, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad Mythic hired two lame monkey's to make their content.  And too bad the other two lame monkey's couldn't make a game that didn't require you to relog nearly everytime you zone.  <br />
<br />
I found the spell mechanisms in DAoC to be decidely non-magical.<br />
<br />
Killing stuff to get rare scrolls that you magically scribe into your spell book is a hell of a lot more immersive.<br />
<br />
Even better that you have to put a lot of effort in to get a hold of those scrolls, it means something when you finally get the scroll and scribe the mofo.<br />
<br />
DAoC had a lot of ideas that looked good on paper, but in practice they took away from the sense of accomplishment that EQ gives (did I also mention ****ty content?).<br />
<br />
Leading pickup jumpy/protector runs until Malo and Torpor drops is a pretty neat experience, while I didn't get Malo or Torpor from one of those runs (one dropped on a guild run, bought the other), it was still well worth the experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not to be an ass or anything... but killing Emp can sometimes yield a Torpor. That's how I got mine -- dropped both Torpor and Bane of Nife.<br />
<br />
Just 8 more levels until I can scribe Torpor =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Chattol can drop Torpor, Malo yes but it's very rare.  I know cause I have killed Chattol about 30 times add to that another 50 placeholders.</div></div><hr />
