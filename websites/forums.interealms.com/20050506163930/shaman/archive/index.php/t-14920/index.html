<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
When you go into options, under keyboard/camera<br />
<br />
There are some new keys.<br />
<br />
2 of them are user defined hot keys for how ever you want to set up your camera angle.<br />
<br />
I have tried playing with this and they seem preset.<br />
<br />
Any way to reset them, and then how do I set up the camera angle to the way I would like and have it go to that way everytime?<br />
<br />
Thks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to switch to the camera you want, then click on one of the user-defined camera slots, then set the keystroke.<br />
<br />
For the other ones that are named, you just click on them and set the keystroke.<br />
<br />
There is a button to restore all defaults at the top of the window, but you dont really need to click that. You can just click the camera and redefine it. Also, you cannot set the camera orientation, only which camera to bind to a key. It will automatically go to it's default orientation, if that was the last part of your question.</div></div><hr />
