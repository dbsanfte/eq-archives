<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if non iksar races could do the cudgel quests. I heard somewhere that they changed greenmist so that all races could do it was i was wondering about the shaman cudgels. thnx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have heard yes and I have heard no. What I  &quot;Think&quot; will happen is that around half way throug your faction will become to low. All I can really sugjest is to max your scaled mystics faction. Then start doing the quests till you get the dreaded &quot;Sorry you will have to prove yourself&quot; Or some such message :( I know I have heard of one non iksar shm claiming to have it. But that is very unconfiremed at this time....<br />
<br />
Humm in fact I think I know just the person for the job :) Hay Ceno bro I know your a quest nut :P Why dont you give this one a shot?<br />
<br />
Personlly if other shm cant do it,kinda makes up for the no JBB. But if thats the case then VI needs to labe this item has Shm Iks. And not Shm all. I mean each race / diety has its perks and draw backs why cant this be one of the Iks. Iks Regen, Trolls have it to. Ac bonus is not THAT marginal. And has for the extra 10 base wis (if you chose to have it when you rolled) there are so meny high wis items out there now that anyone haveing a 230+ average wis is not uncommen reguardless of race. Yes I know our casted nuke has a better DPS. But the JBB is still mana free and no matter how you cut it that still leaves mana in your bar. Any way sorry for the JBB rant didnt inteand for that to happen. Be safe all.</div></div><hr />

Why get that ugly about a piece of equipment?  I'm a VahShir shaman.  I don't have a faithstone available to our people.  We don't have cultural armour (not even &quot;crappy skyiron&quot; armour).  Geez.  If someone wants to put that much effort into earning the trust of a bunch of lizards, more power to them.  Iksar wanna-bes indeed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hartmut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">how can a non iksar obtain the 1st newbie cludgel you get from your guildmaster ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I seem to recall cats, trolls of both alignments, and Iksar all being able to do this quest to the end.  I have not heard of an ogre finishing the 7th and barbies can't seem to get past the 2nd.  You apparently need high warmly+ to finish up to the 7th.<br />
<br />
Doing a quest that yeilds a nice result hardly makes you a wanna-be RaceX and you really have to thank those fine folks at VI for inserting an &quot;accidental&quot; (insert eyeroll here) fast method for factioning Cab.  To bad the goons broke the quest at the Overseer/chant rock and can't seem to solve a simple stacking issue on the 8th cudgel.<br />
<br />
Hartmut, you just need to do a simple MQ to get the first cudgel by getting the 3 skulls and then making an Iksar shaman.  Turn in note to shaman guildmaster with the Iksar to get the basic cudgel and then hand it in to Oxyn.  Log the toon out, log your main in, and hand in those skulls.  You can also do a special side quest to get the newbie cudgel, but you will need a bit of Brood of Kotiz faction first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">2 things to comment on here. First off, you can do this as any other shaman class but faction is incredibly difficult to get. Having started mine at 55, I was asked by a Vah Shir shaman who at that time was 51 if I could help and we stuck together through the whole thing up to the rockchanter part which we are stuck at now (thanks VI for the shoe in the nuts for the past 3 monthes). We also noticed a major problem which will be there for the 8th Cudgel. As we were both in FoB, we ran across the Quest Iksar right outside of Kaesora named Oracle Vauris while he conned indifferent to me he made short work of the Vah Shir.  I'm not sure if you'll need to use a chanter on the trade in or what but all other NON-Iksar races have conned KOS to him. While all reports say he is on Scalyed Mystics faction, I am ALLY to the Scaled Mystics and this guy cons Indifferent. Just an FYI.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Ceno.....thank you for the info on the Winterstorm. I had not heard of that before and have been pissed since I started this Iksar Shaman that I wouldn't be able to wear JB gear. While this weapon will make it a pain, alternating it's use with the epic....it is a free DD and I'll never gripe about mana-free damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tossen, what is your faction with the Brood of Kotiz?  I'm hoping that it's indifferent (same as Oracle Varuis).  Since that faction isn't raised when you do the bone chip/explorer knife quests, I have a feeling that's why your friend's kitty shaman was still KoS to Vauris.  I'm still KoS to the Necros in Cabilis, but this sounds like a good excuse to work on that faction.  I will report back (eventually....) after I check my faction with Vauris, and become non-KoS to the Kotiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hi there as for faction i am a iksar and my faction from begining to end never raised above amiable. Now since shaman start with amiable for the hole town it is possable that the quest guy is on necro faction. but as a Inky SK friend of mine knows from doing the greenmist quest ( anyone that camps kurns for 8 days straight to max there faction is defnely do some work to prove them selfs ) there is a very easy and FAST as in 3 hours to get from KOS to indiffrent and about another  2 hours to get to kindly. it is becouse the size of the faction hit is so much grater and here it is:<br />
<br />
In warslike woods there is a area just up the waterfalls from the giant fort that there are 2 sets of ruins. what spones in side thses ruins and around a lake farther up is about 12 to 14 fallen iksar. these reneagdes from cab when killed give you better faction with the necros and the warriors. and becouse of there lvl thay give more faction then the ones in FoB and are not as contested as the ones in LOIO since there location is in the WW zone. running a circuit of these areas he was able to keep the spawns gone and got his faction very quickly. as for shaman doing it i would say if you 2 are still pairing then go down and pair them all you need to do is both just cast flamie lick and your dogs will kill but you get all the faction. Non stop fighting for sure but much shorter then the bones to say the lest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye winterstome is a great wepon but take a look at what you have to kill to get it :(<br />
<br />
And has for the kitty shm not haveing quest gear and stuff. I belive you guy get to use Hate and PoG armor. Iks shm didnt have any quest , Plains armor for about a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its not just about the faction, its also about the religion ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yup, I am definitely NOT KOS to Vaurius, but I am ally to scaled mystics and follow the great CT.  He was nice enough to hand me the trigger for the 8th cudgel over tea and cookies.  <br />
<br />
Those agnostic kitties might be held back by religion after all, but I am betting on an especially painful, time consuming fix for religion with PoP. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Clawsor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok yes they cann they havta get faction with cab then go to um i forget his name hes not prime dude or oxeyn and do the exoneration quest to get the cudgle newbs start with then talk to oxyn and u can start em akso need enuf faction to do quests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only fact that bothers me about it is that the cudgels started as Iksar only until the results (7th and 8th) started becoming worthwhile..    then other races were allowed to do it..     that's what pisses me off about it.<br />
<br />
But oh well, I know a troll with his cudgel of ancients, and I salute him for all the faction work he had to do.  We just need to have the JBB be obtained by a hellish and constantly broken quest too  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gummox - I am apprehensive to the Brood of Kotiz. Not quite sure but I used to fight in Kaesora like it was my job so that may have hurt my faction with them. <br />
<br />
Having joined two guilds on the RATHE into the DEEP and seeing the THO I can tell you all first hand....this is the most ludicrous fight you may ever encounter. 44 people on the first raid 39 the second time. I was lowest both times at 59. The invisible bridge however (stolen right out of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) is one of the more exhilerating moments I have spent in the game. The second guild I fought with said that they saw the Winterstorm drop once in the 20+ times they have killed him. That doesn't give me a lot of joy. He is killable but 35+ level 60's needed to kill this thing is just nuts. I will have to do more research and find another item that may be a little easier to obtain. Such is the life of the Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oracle Vauris /cons warmly to this Troll, like most of the other Lizardmen in the area. (Kloks are indifferent, and I finally got Kotiz up to dubious after the Librarian in the 3rd floor of the shaman guild building tried to kill me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Barbasja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I would like to do these cudgel quests for my barbarian shaman. Cudgel 7 and 8 are both barbarian usable (all shamen races actually), so I decided to go for it, the long way of building faction. I play 2 accounts, my barbarian shaman on one account and my iksar monk on the other, both level 53 at the moment (this is a fun combination!!). <br />
<br />
First I went to the goblin fort in warsilk woods and mass murdered gobbies until i was dubious with shaman to the troopers. Then into Kurns and farm bonechips, zillions of bonechips, running back and forth to trooper mozo by gate in field of bone, handing in 4 chips at a time (stacked works). I slowly gained faction with all but necros in cabilis, and finally my faction maxed out at indifferent to them all (xept necros). Faction indifferent to shaman in particular, and more bonechips yeilds the message &quot;your faction standing with &lt;faction&gt; couldn't possibly get any better&quot;. Hmm. <br />
<br />
Ok, next step get my first cudgel. Monk hits toilmaster and runs back to shaman and FDs so shaman can talk to him (there is a necro close to him so you need him a bit aways). Hand in the book from hierophant zand (tell him&quot;yes&quot;) and get the &quot;rights of exoneration&quot;. Monk gets the bags and hammer and make the powdered bones etc and finally have one &quot;filled penance bag&quot;. Now monk hands in the filled bag and shaman the book right after, woot one cudgel of the petitioner in the hands of my shaman. <br />
<br />
But... <br />
<br />
When i go for 1st cudgel quest, collecting the 3 skulls in the sewers and hand them back to oxyn along with my new cudgel he just sais i need to prove my dedication to their cause and the items are gone. Ok, my faction is not high enough. I cannot do cursed wafer quest either, same response, need to prove my dedication. Hmm. <br />
<br />
Problem: My faction seems maxed at indifferent but i need at least amiable to start the quest with oxyn. Anyone know another way to improve faction, or if it is possible to MQ the final cudgel with Rile in HS as a barbarian? <br />
<br />
Anyway, it seems unbalanced to me that there is this faction cap hindering the initial quest. It might be intentional from Verant, I don't know, but on the other hand I have my iksar monk training in Freeport monk guild, he is &quot;kindly&quot; to them. <br />
<br />
Any help or experience would be appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As a Barbarian shaman I am curious if I will be able to do this series of quests.  I have done several of the mysticscale armor quests so that has me hopeful.  My good friend Rasanak is doing them now and has peaked my interest as I have completed the Greenmist on my main SK and this looks to be a quest of similar pain (er challenge).  I'll post what my findings are as I go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hail,<br />
<br />
Anyone thought of trying one of those illusion items with charges on it?<br />
<br />
I don't know about any Illusion:Iksar items myself personally, but maybe something like that would help raise faction.<br />
<br />
Like the Illusion:halfling item with limited charges.<br />
(Of course that wouldn't work here! :p)<br />
<br />
Just a thought,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Most quest I have seen need at least amiable to do and looks like this quest is one of em. If you maxxed out at indifferent doing bone chip quest, than you are maxxed. The waffer quest isnt gonna do anything more for you. You can get Puppet Strings in Fear and right click mezz the quest NPCs, dunno if you can on some of them becuase of level or if mezzing will even change your faction to them. I'd try having a 60 chanter or necro make pets out of the quest NPC's, that will set thier faction to amiable even if you were KoS before, but once again, I am not sure just how far you can go doing that.  Somehow I think you will hit a point where an NPC just can't be made into a pet and if not, than if you have the resources of a 60 chanter/necro, you can do this quest without any faction work, just a lot more complications. Think Oynx was lvl60? and only lvl52 and below can be made into pets? Dunno, never played a chanter/necro, but if thats the case, than you are just SoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What limited charge illusion items? post links to somewhere that I can find out what they are and where I can think about trying to get one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I gave Varius the iksar relics for the final cudgel at amiable faction with scaled mystics and he triggered the quest. So amiable is good enough as far as I know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have maxxed my Scaled Mystics faction with just an additional 204 bone chips (I was closer than I had thought) and they con indifferent to me.  I am working on my Brood of Kotiz faction atm and also waiting on Oxyn to get fixed.  Once these two things happen I will begin the quest in ernest and report my results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i am considering starting this quest with my katt shaman, but am wondering if its worth the effort, considering shes 54 and pop is 6? weeks away.   14 22 ihb could be a dropable one coming with POP.   hehhe thats lazy i know, but id spend alot of time kiling green mobs, while i could get to maybe 57 with the time used to exp.<br />
atmo i am kos to vurk. the explorer daggers are uncommon drops off 20 mins spwns (<br />
<br />
i guess the troll vendor in rm aint back yet?<br />
<br />
whats the named shamsn in chardok called?   i might hail a few now i am ally in the vain hope thers a missed quest&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feels like an optimist!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Doubt they would let those Explorer Knives loose on a vendor again, but the knives are still the best way to go for factioning Cab.  Bonechips are much easier to get, but the hits are pitiful.<br />
<br />
Fastest way to faction Brood of Kotiz is killing the Iksar Treasure Hunter camps near Old Sebilis.  I started killing these guys in EJ while a CT worshipping SK was hitting Marauders/Manslayers in FoB and I had Kotiz to dubious in about 7 hours.  The SK was still killing in FoB for 4 more days to hit dubious to Kotiz.<br />
<br />
I would not plan on Verant &quot;fixing&quot; the cudgel quests so that all the races listed can finish it anytime soon, but it might be worth picking up all the bits for the quests and storing them on a bank toon just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kailiee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Coming from someone that went the bonechip route. I have spent the past couple months (have given up for now) turning in bonechip after bonechip to Mozo and after about 7000 bonechips (give or take a couple hundred) I am dubious to Oxyn but still cant start the quest. I figure just need to get off me arse and turn in about 500 more and I should be gtg to start it. But if it wasnt for the fact that I had the skulls for the third cudgel (again from farming bonechips in Kurns) and the blackened Iksar bones from VS I probably wouldnt have gone as far as I have trying to rework the faction.<br />
<br />
Actually after the 4000th bone chip it became personal, I WILL make those Iksars like me *giggles*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There is an item called Ornate Velium Pendant that got 4 charges of Alliance on it thats usable by all. Alliance is a spell that increases your faction by 100 points for the faction NPC you click it on(and all other NPCs of that faction in the zone)<br />
<br />
Now, if you max out at indifferent, you can use this pendant to get to amiable. Since it seems amiable is enough to do this quest this should work.<br />

This item drops from the Counselors in Icewell Keep such as Counselor Julia Lockheart. Its buyable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">well you have to get your faction to:<br />
<br />
amablie ant not a inch higher.<br />
<br />
IF you work on the bone chip quests all the way up to your max faction and that turns out to be indiffrent you are not cut out. you need to find a right-click item that has a faction modifier spell ( enchanter ) on it. WITH that cast you will have the correct faction ( amiable ) to do from begining to end the who quest line. this is from a iksar shaman that faction has never made it out of amiable since the begianing of the game. and you will need to raise ALL you iksar factions which meens also killing some of the iksar outcasts for necro faction as well as doing bone chip quests.</div></div><hr />
