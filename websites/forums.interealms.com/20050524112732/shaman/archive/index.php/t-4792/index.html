<br />
WHOOOOOOOOTT!!<br />
<br />
I'm so excited!!! :)<br />
<br />
NEVER thought I'd see this spell in my guild.  E'Ci's raiding public is the best damn thing since sliced bread.  Many shaman have gotten Malo and Torpor who are in smaller guilds because of Ash's raids.<br />
<br />
Also got my LP for VP key :)<br />
<br />
What a day!!!</div></div><hr />

CONGRATS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats :)<br />
<br />
We assembled for sont on friday... we'd buffed... incomming mass group buffing of aego... and the zone drops.. :/<br />
<br />
Of course when the zone comes up.. he's made his escape... we'll have to wait for him to respawn :(<br />
<br />
So the pesky dispeller lives on borrowed time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sont seems to drop torpor quite a bit. Congrats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congratulations!<br />
<br />
Someday I hope to be one of the few, the proud, the torporous...  I never thought I'd be above level 30, then I figured level 50 was gonna be it, but I can see 60 from where I'm sitting and Torpor has dropped for my guild once, so there's hope...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry for being a noob, but who/where is Sontalak? I tried searching on Allakazams but couldnt find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sontalak is a big, dumb dragon that sits at the entrance to ToV. He sees through invis, but has about a one foot agro radius. You almost literally have to run around inside him and find his middle to get him to agro. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Getting Torpor is such a huge step for a shaman, so it's always exciting when you finally get that copy. :)<br />
<br />
For those who are still looking for a copy, Harla Dar has dropped it 3 of the last 4 times I've been there to kill her (first time was when I got my copy). She's not nearly as hard as Sontalak is, and can probably be done with smaller guilds. Plus she drops that nice Improved Damage III necklace that casters love so much.</div></div><hr />
