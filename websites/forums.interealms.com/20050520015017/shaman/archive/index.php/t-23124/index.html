Shaman-Calm and helpful, you will assist those in need.  You are very stolid, but will fight when your rights or the rights of those you love are in danger.  You are very just when making decisions, much like a paladin, but you consider both sides with even more care.  You should become a supreme court judge.</div></div><hr />

Druid-That's right, you're a treehugger.  For&lt;br&gt;whatever reason, you love nature, animals, and&lt;br&gt;the outdoors.  Do not be ashamed; you are most&lt;br&gt;likely a very helpful person, but a bit of an&lt;br&gt;outsider.  Expect to be made fun of...a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually thats really depressing, i wanted to be a monk hehehehe :)</div></div><hr />
