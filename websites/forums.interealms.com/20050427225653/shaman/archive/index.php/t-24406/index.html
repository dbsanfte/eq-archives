<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow Shamans,<br />
<br />
Ever since the Stress Test Ive been dying to play this game again. I was hoping to get invited into the closed beta, but alas now I know I won't get to play the game until the Open Beta starts.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any plans on what they will do in open beta? In stress test I managed to get my shammy to lvl 20 so I know the quests up until then (kinda), I plan on learning about the game leveling wise as much as possible in the open beta so when retail rolls around I will know what to do and where to level fast. <br />
<br />
Don't think I will bother with any tradeskills or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Also I think I will try a PvP server since they seem to be more challenging and fun, plus its better to see if I can last on a PvP server in beta state rather then waste my time in the retail. <br />
<br />
Anyone else have any plans or do I think about WoW way too much heh ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to try horde lands and different classes for open beta - probably mage and shaman.  I don't think any WoW class really parallels the EQ shaman so I'm not really driven to play a shaman in WoW even though I greatly enjoyed my EQLive shaman.<br />
<br />
The WoW shaman does looks interesting even if it's different and amazingly it seems to be the only class represented on the beta boards that isn't constantly whining for more power or crying nerf on everyone else - and at the same time there aren't cries of &quot;nerf shaman&quot; - so maybe the class is fun and reasonably balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I plan to take my time and level 3-4 classes up evenly.  this makes me &quot;groupable&quot; in several classes.

<br />
*sigh*  I miss those days.  Grief playing was a blast.<br />
<br />
I remember this one day a guy stole a bunch of ore my miner was froghopping to his house..<br />
<br />
I run to my house, log on my dexxer, and come kill the guy.  As I'm looting his body, I see a rune marked &quot;home&quot; and a house key... yay!<br />
<br />
I recall to his house, which is in the middle of BFE.  I call up my brother and then recall to his house, where he opens a gate to the theifs house.<br />
<br />
We start looting it (this is back in the day when you couldn't lock things down).<br />
<br />
After about 2 minutes, a character pops up in the house.  The character was a dexxer.  Back in the day, I was one of the few macers out there, and so gladly took up the fight.  Thinking he could win, he didn't ban me.  I won. (you couldn't ban/kick as a ghost).<br />
<br />
Three minutes later, a mage pops up.. With a vanq Warhammer and a lucky shot, he went down in 1 hit..<br />
<br />
Then came the mule, this time I ran outside.  He comes out and asks for his stuff back,  I get between him and the house, and kill him.<br />
<br />
You see where this is going.  Eventually he had 5 dead characters, I had the loot from 4 of the 5 characters (left the loot on the first body in my haste to recall to his house), as well as all the items in his house.<br />
<br />
Yay!<br />
<br />
*sigh*  I hope WoW will have a PvP system that's balanced like UO's was, and not some crummy one like EQ's.</div></div><hr />

YOU are the type of player that gives PVP a bad name. There was absolutely NO honor in your behavior in the scenario you described above.<br />
<br />
Please, go back and play b.net D2 and leave MMO's to the adults.<br />
<br />
kthxbye! ..|.,</div></div><hr />

BUT I would have to back div's actions. HE was the one that was ganked while minning, people that gank lowbys that have no chance of defending them self deseverve whatever they get.<br />

There's still no excuse for Meglo's childish behavior, and the PVP honor system in WoW will punish dip sh!ts that act like that.<br />

<br />
Saddly I dont think that the honor system will make much of a diffrents. There are a lot of people in PvP that things like that simply do not mean anything to them. In fact the lower thire honer gets the prouder they will be about. Thats the down side to PvP if there is a way to grife someone some where will find and use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ick sorry divinator I am a retard and cant read- but still while meglo might have been excessive in his reaction, the guy did steal from him. IF it was not a misunderstanding( and alot of times it is and some communication can patch things up ) being able to retaliate was kinda nice.<br />
<br />
Anyways never really meant to get this involved in this thread, personally I think one of the problems with these types of games is the lack of accountability. People think they are just another annonimous person and its ok to be a jerk cause no one knows who ya are. But on the other hand when ya do find those rare people that are good even though you dont know them it is very gratifying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Try to think about it this way, if that helps...<br />
<br />
I had around 2000 ore I was froghopping.. that equates 4,000 ingots, which sold back then for about 10gp each.. that's 40,000 gold.. in EQ terms that's about 6000p.<br />
<br />
Are you honestly telling me that if someone stole 6000p from you, you wouldn't want revenge?  More than that, it takes about 3 hours to dig up 2000 ore.  If you were camping a spawn for 3 hours, and the named popped and someone waited till you got agro then burned down the named, looted the item you were camping, and then gated out, you wouldn't want revenge?<br />
<br />
Was what I did honorable?  Possibly no.  <br />
Did he deserve what happened?  Yes.<br />
Did it teach him that he shouldn't pick on helpless characters?  Hopefully.<br />
<br />
As for people like me giving PvP a bad name, you're far FAR off the mark there, bud.  If you ever played UO, you would know what PVP was truly like.  You would have seen me as one of the few Orders around (In UO, there are two types of PVP... type 1 is divided into two teams, &quot;Order&quot; and &quot;Chaos,&quot; type 2 is player killing), and as one of the few Orders around, I'd recall to Britain to bank and have anywhere from 5 to 15 people attack me at once.  <br />
<br />
But sure, my PKing a thief is dishonorable while 15 on 1 is honorable, right?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and I love how someone gave me a bad reputation point for talking about PKing someone 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />

lol @ that though.  A:  there is simply NO means for establishing a relational value between the two!  B:  I played a tamer among other things in UO and gold in UO was so ridiculously easy to farm (also easily so with like a bard/mage) compared to EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets discuss this then, shall we?  First, I'm talking about 40k as it relates to my miner digging up ore one at a time, not monster-killing.<br />
<br />
To relate it decently, we should look at a tradeskill (like mining) in EQ, lets say brewing.<br />
<br />
Now, I can make ~500 &quot;Grobb Liquidized Meat&quot; in around an hour.  These I would sell for 10p each.  That means every hour I tradeskilled, I could bring in 5,000p.<br />
<br />
So if I spent 3 hours tradeskilling, I could theoretically bring in 15,000p worth of items.<br />
<br />
So you're right, I probably should have said 40kgp is worth 15kpp.</div></div><hr />
