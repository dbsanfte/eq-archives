<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 37 Barbarian Shaman, and I want to go solo some stuff for Good exp....I don't care about loot, just exp.  If someone knows a GREAT place for exp, and a fast spawn time, please post here or e-mail me at Ooker_Berkowitz@yahoo.com     For anyone that needs help leveling up to 37, at level 30, go camp a bard in South Karana. He has a 6 minute spawn time (Which sucks) but he's GREAT exp, i leveled up to 35 from him.  Then go to the Rathe Mountains and get in a group, kill HG's, this isn't very good exp, but it gained me two levels, and i got about 1k per day.                 That's all my info.  Please post back to me.</div></div><hr />

I have solo'd the Yeti's from level 34-40 and it was the fastest leveling I have seen since my teens.  How to kill them for the people who dont want to spend the time getting a rythme:<br />
<br />
1. Get a pet out, dont bother buffing him at all.<br />
<br />
2. I buffed regen, fury, talisman and protect on myself.  <br />
<br />
- Protect (instead of shifting shield) was used to bump me over 800ac.  Fury is a great buff.  I dont ever let regen or talisman drop.<br />
<br />
3. Pull the yeti back to your dog with Scourge.<br />
<br />
4. Channel a Tagar's.  Immediately follow up with Envenomed Breath.  If either spell is resisted cast it until it lands.<br />
<br />
- I had both Tagars and Walking Sleep up, incase I got a resist, the mob was atleast slowed a little bit.  This tactic was very useful untill about level 38-39.  At 38-39 only the higher level yeti's hurt me much.<br />
<br />
5. Melee with the dog, healing yourself if you need it.  When the yeti starts to run, sit and med while the dog chews it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Out of all the levels I got here, I only had 3-4 adds, and 3-4 close calls.  The exp flows in and the loot isnt all that bad, lots of those frosty flowers which sell for a plat to the vendor...and plenty of gems/words.<br />
<br />
These are also great for maxing that defense skill out if you have not already.  Down with the druid/shaman!  Up with AC!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are 2 caves around the wall of the dreadlands which tundra yeti's spawn.  Walk around the ice part of DL close to the zone wall and you will find them.  The yeti's agro, but they are no social.</div></div><hr />
