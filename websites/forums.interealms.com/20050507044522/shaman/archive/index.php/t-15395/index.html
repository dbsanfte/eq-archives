<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, well my guild has taken emp down 2 times now and we know we can handle VT, so we are focsuing backon our PoP advancement. RD has us stuck right now though. We cant seem to put him down yet so im wondering how you do it. I have yet to land a turg on him so is there a debuff trick? I know we tash/malos/OOS  right now and nothing, if we could slow him with a turg even mitigated, we would win.<br />
<br />
Anyway, our basic strat so far is to use 3 or more charmed pets and just keep the MA alive and try to win out with DPS. How you guys do it? We just gotta up our DPS or what here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried him multiple times with my last guild, this dude is a pain in the ass. <br />
<br />
Use grummus<br />
Control rampage<br />
Dont let clerics/warrior get feared<br />
bring lots and lots and lots and maybe lots of dps.<br />
<br />
charmed pets? Pffft :p</div></div><hr />

it is possible to turgur RD but i've never done it..better to just grummus him and pray clerics dont get feared =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to guess that &quot;RD&quot; is Rydda`Dar, the dragon in the third trial in Halls of Honor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As people have said it is possible to Turgur's RD but he's so damm resistant it isn't really worth trying. He also majorly mitigates it, you get a slightly msg if I recall. Last time we did him I don't even think we bothered trying to slow him.<br />
<br />
Couple tips.<br />
<br />
1) make sure your rangers don't get feared. Can't confirm it personally but I read that thier archery bugs and recycles slower after being feared. Supposedly majorly kills thier dps. Best way to do this is have them one on side of the room and the fight on the other or in the next room with the dragon in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
2) He seems to be somewhat range sensitive for nuking from what I've heard from our casters. So hug the beasts belly if your trying to blow him away.<br />
<br />
3) he procs a single target dot. I don't recall the name of it off hand but it was several hundred dmg a tick range and was disease based to cure so you want someone chain casting abolish disease on the MT.<br />
<br />
4) What ever you do don't push him up on one of the coffins. If you kill him up there the mobs spawns up there and you can't get up to him to hail and get your flag =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 Bard groups. Each one has 3 clerics and 2 warriors. Get MR up as high as you can on everyone in both groups. You don't want MT or clerics to get feared.<br />
<br />
Don't bother trying to land Turgur's, it's a waste of time and mana. Just land Malicous Decay and then Grummus.<br />
<br />
Other than that, kill him really fast, keep him off the walls. We've had Rydda Dar warp up to the roof of the building on us once because we pushed him into a wall. Pets then killed Rydda up on top of the roof and no one got the flags. We did get the loot though, because Rydda was nice enough to summon a mage up to the roof and kill him. We then res'd the mage up there, but the flag mob had despawned before we could CoH anyone up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm one tactic our guild uses is to chain cure the MT with Abolish disease I think. And we have chanter charmed guards from outside the room that helps decrease his hp quicker. Hes a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">very important thing that you didnt mention - abolish disease spam on MT<br />
<br />
rydda procs a 3k/tick or something dot and that can be easily negated by doing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
also, dont try to turgurs, it wont land, do malicious decay, bard debuff (if that has -disease), then have 2-3 shamans cast grummus.  always works for my guild.   <br />
<br />
and the enchanter pets are important, get as many as possible.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You need druids frantically spam healing the rampage tanks.  You need shamans spamming Abolish Disease on both the MA and the rampage tanks.  You need super tight CHs with some spam support.  You need high DPS cuz the healers can't keep up that **** forever.  You need a little bit of luck.  And you need to keep him off walls.  <br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />
