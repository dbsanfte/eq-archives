<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brayle Spellbreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of my close friends has not been able to able to play his Shaman lately due to RL issues. I've taken over the payments for his account in hopes that he will be able to come back and play eventually and I'd like to keep his gear up to date in case he should return. I'm looking for any items I can either camp, have forged or quest for with a fairly well off Warlord and an Oracle.<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated, thank you. :)<br />
