<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm a 53 Shaman fairly well equipped. I just took a long break from the game partly from frustration at all the good camps being taken. I've just come back and find its pretty much the same. Please give some suggestions as to where to go the next couple of levels. Here is where I've been hunting-<br />
Elements in Nadox, good camp but often taken and a bit boring. Also, I don't know how many more times I can bear to go down under the lava after the last 3 spawns. <br />
The Hole, now revamped but still pretty much the same from the entrance to the half pipe area. Half pipe now undesirable because the new massive golem things are not able to be wholly slowed. I still love the entrance but it is often taken and will be even more so now that all the tourist are going though to see the changes to the zone.<br />
Velks, one word for that-overcamped.<br />
Chardok, rarely taken as its used for raids most of the time. Good XP but mobs hit pretty hard and have more health than I'd like for XP grinding. Also its a long way to run to find that the zone in area is taken.<br />
City of Mist, used to have terrible pathing but was still fun to do sometimes. Good XP too. One of the recently revamped zones, so I don't imagine being able to solo there anytime soon. Be interesting to check it out though.<br />
Dulak, ships are pretty much perma camped. Never tried the tunnels solo though, may be worth a try.<br />
Thats pretty much everywhere I know to go. Not trying to be too negative, just don't want anyone posting zones I already know so well. If there are any zones out there I'm neglecting please let me know. I'm also debating whether or not to do a couple AA's before I ding (about to hit 54).</div></div><hr />
