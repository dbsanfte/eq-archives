<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">See ya.  I camped Ugz out for the last time.  I have &quot;turned over ownership&quot; of the account to another person and will be playing Everquest no longer.  There were good times and bad times but at the end of the day, I just plain didn't enjoy the game any more.  Why?  Well, there were personal changes in my life as well as game changes that didn't sit well with me.  I refused to pay for Omens and am now out all together.<br />

To those of you who are still having or have found renewed fun in the game, keep on representing the shaman community well!<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
