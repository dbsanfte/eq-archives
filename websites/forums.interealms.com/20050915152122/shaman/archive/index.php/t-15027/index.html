<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm considering upgrading my video card since it's getting a bit 'long in the tooth' as far as technology goes. I don't really want to pay the prices the GF4 Ti4x00 cards are still commanding, and the FX5200 is around the price range I'm willing to pay. So...my real question is...would it be worth the $$ to go from my old GF3 Ti500 (top of the line at the time I bought it) to the FX5200 (lowest end model of the FX series)? Will the base model FX card perform better than the Ti500, or am I better off just sticking with the older card?<br />

Really interested in hearing personal experiences with these cards.</div></div><hr />

I'd stick with what you've got. The 5200 from everything i've ready would be a down grade in every way for you. It's majorly castrated as far as performace goes so it isn't going to perform any better in current games than what you currently have. In fact it will probably be notably worse considering most tests I've seen but the 5600's on par with the 4200 or 4400 for performance and they weren't too far ahead of the geforce 3 ti500.<br />
<br />
As far as the new dx 9 stuff goes.<br />
1) There aren't really any games that use the new features yet.<br />
2) the fx 5200 is so underpowered that by the time there are actually dx9 games around you won't be able to play them very effectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as your situation goes I would recommend sticking with what you have unless your willing to drop down at least 200-300 dollars for at least an ati 9500pro or a geforce 5600 I would stick with what you've got. Really neither is going to offer a significant performace increase over what you've got. To get anything significant your looking at an ati 9700 or better or a geforce fx 5800+.</div></div><hr />

I agree that by the time DirectX9 games are out your FX5200 will be so underpowered that you'll upgrade it before you ever used the FX advantage once.<br />
If you're price concious go for a G4Ti4600/4800 right now, prices are dropping fast, and you can run through the bazaar at full resolution and clip plane.</div></div><hr />
