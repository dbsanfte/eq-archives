<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent two and a half hours last night and two hours this morning getting my various skills up. I've had my Shaman swiming for 39 minutes with now swimming skill up.<br />
<br />
I've not seen skills go up this slow with any char, my skills went up in 30 mintues last level. Very strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you put a point into it? <br />
Just step into a pool, swim into the wall, angle up, and go do something else for a couple hours.  You'll have max skill when you return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, I do skill ups every level. I have 7 other Chars including my Main. This is one of the first times I've noticed its really taking a while to raise the skill.<br />
<br />
I went shopping for the 4th this morning and surfed the net for three hours and no swim skill up. Could be some funky going on so I just logged him off. <br />
<br />
I'll try another time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like bad luck with the swimming, unless you didn't put a starting point into it (not sure ifyou have to or not though -- it's been a while). I do remember having no problem getting swimming skill-ups with my barb shaman. Every time I jumped into the pond in Halas I got a skill-up it seemed. Now, spells skill-ups did start to slow down in the 30's so that practicing them was quite tedious. If you solo quite a bit, you'll keep most spell skills up fairly comfortably with the possible exceptions of divination and evocation. Some shamans say that abjuration was hard to max out, but I never bothered with getting cleric buffs back then when I soloed, so I always kept our ac buff on, which kept my abjuration up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I stopped every 3 or 4 levels and capped my casting stats.  The minor headache it caused staved off a major headache if I had to skill up my evoc or divination from 1 to 200 at level 39 which would have taken all day for just 1 of those 2 schools.  So I blow 10 minutes every couple of levels to cap out schools and I also never have to worry about being a fizzle king on a new spell level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">best way to raise swim is kill Bloodgill for exp, I hunt there around lvl45's and max swim in few level; that is one of best exp spot up to lvl51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make sure you buff your dexterity.  I believe Dex is the basis for swimming skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hippiefrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sort of remember hearing that swimming could no longer be skilled up by parking in water. I used to go swim in Oasis and run into the dock to skill up. Last night I went to SH and did the same thing for a couple hours with no skill up. Once I acually started to swim BOOM skills.<br />
<br />
So maybe now you acually have to be swiming to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are zones where it doesn't work.  Shadowhaven is one of them.  Last time I checked, you could still do it in freeport near the pally guild and still do it inside neriak on the walls near the docks.</div></div><hr />
