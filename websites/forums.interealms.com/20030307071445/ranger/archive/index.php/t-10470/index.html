<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kayrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, i am new to the Glade and apolijize if this has been covered already.<br />
<br />
I am a 43 ranger woodelf. I use a Faydark cloudburster - 25 damage - last i looked i had a 5 damage bonus on it - but that was at level 40 i think. I use 1 damage 150 ranger arrows with a 5 damage bonus. My skill is in the high 180's - have not sen it move in 5 levels. <br />
<br />
The whole damage thing is confusing me. Recently when i made level 43 i started hitting over 100 with my weapons. With a 30 damage 2HS i hit for upto 118pts. so naturally i started wondering why i am not hitting hard witha  bow. I started a series of bow kites on high blues. I hit for anything from 1 to about 40 with most hits in the 26 to 34 range and crits in the 53 range. Sometimes i get a crit in the 70's - but its RARE. I run 169str, 103 sta, 126dex, 159agi. <br />
<br />
Whats confusing me is why i am not seeing higher numbers as i am advancing in level and WHEN do i start seeing 100+ point hits. If i am correct my skill is still below what it should be - but its hard to raise it as i have not seen it raise in a LONG time and use it everyday to pull or kite. I hear of 500+ point hits and wonder what am i doing wrong. <br />
<br />
Any break down on what i am doing wrong OR what i can do to get stronger hits?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The reason you are hitting so hard with the 2HS is because 2HS weapons carry a damage bonus based on the Delay of the weapon.  The larger the Delay, the larger the bonus.  The damage bonus you see on your Bow and Arrows has absolutely no effect when calculating Archery damage.  Your Archery damage is based on your Bow Damage, Arrow Damage, and Archery Skill.  <br />
<br />
You are getting low hits because of your level and Archery Skill.  The hits you stated are perfectly normal for your equipment, level, and skill.  You won't see a big increase in damage until you start getting Double Damage hits on stationary, unrooted mobs at level 51+.  The 500+ point hits you hear about are from Rangers using the Trueshot Discipline (lvl 55+) and/or have trained in the Archery Mastery and Endless Quiver AA abilities (lvl 59+).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maena_Bowyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, one other thing to add...<br />
Your Archery damage is based on your Bow Damage, Arrow Damage, Archery Skill, *AND DEXTERITY*<br />
<br />
If you want to see high archery damage, you'll eventually have to get that 126 dex up higher.  Not really neccesary now, but once you start doubling, quadrupling, and... uhm.. Octupling your archery damage, the damage bonus from dex starts playing a large role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dexterity doesn't effect your max damage.  Wether my Dex is 146 or 255 I can still only hit for 548 and crit for 940 max without using Trueshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MertreeSkeurto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But doesn't dex control how often you'll hit for max(higher) dmg?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colphax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's my understanding, Mertree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, ATK effects how often you'll hit for higher and max damage.  Strength and ATK buffs effect that, not Dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MertreeSkeurto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i thought atk was how often you'll hit the mob.<br />
        <br />
<br />
dex was how many hits would be for higher damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nope.  ATK doesn't effect Hit/Miss ratio.  Your Offense Skill, your Skill with that particular weapon type, and the mob's AC effect your Hit/Miss ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dex pushes up your average DPS with a bow as it affects your crit rate.  I haven't parsed sufficiently to tell if non-critical hits are also modified by substantial differences in dexterity.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some ranger mathematicians can supply logs.  I just plink things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, ATK effects how often you'll hit for higher and max damage. Strength and ATK buffs effect that, not Dex.<br />
Most people believe that dex is used for archery attack instead of str.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MertreeSkeurto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">so what's ATK for ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sheldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">isn't ATK more for the melee attacks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It was my understanding that DEX was only for how often you crit, and that Str, Atk, and offense determines how often you hit, and hit for max damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The ATK shown on your inventory screen is your melee attack.  This ATK is affected by strenght.  It is not the same as your archery ATK.  Convential wisdom says that your archery ATK is affected by dex and not str, but I haven't seen the parses to prove it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As far as I know from all the data I have seen, this is how it's broken down.<br />
<br />
ATK increases te amount of average to maximum damage hits you score.  ATK does not increase the maximum you can hit for, nor does it make you miss less often.  ATK is calculated by Offense Skill, Weapon Skill, Strength, and ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
The maximum damage you can hit for is calculated by the Dmg on the weapon, Offense skill, and Weapon skill.  Nothing else can make you hit any harder.<br />
<br />
Dexterity increases your chances of scoring a critical hit and making a weapon proc.  I have also heard that dexterity also makes you miss less often, but I've never seen anything to prove that, nor have I noticed missing less myself with 255 Dex.<br />
<br />
How often you hit or miss is determined by your Offense skill, Weapon skill, and the AC of the mob you are fighting.  As I mentioned above, I have heard rumors that Dex also effects this, but have never seen any evidence of that.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, if you'd like to know what your ATK is with your Bow, then put a Piercer in your Primary hand that has the same amount of Strength and/or ATK stats on it as the 1HS that you normally use.  Since our Piercing and Archery skill caps are identical, this should give you the actual ATK rating that your Bow has.  That's assuming that you've maxed Piercing and Archery or that your skills in both are identical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>goson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, here is what I can say, per experience not parsing. I have noticed that the higher my str, the higher my average arrow damage. The higher my dex, the more likely I am to get critical hits.<br />
<br />
To the original post, you want to increase bow damage? Stop using 1 damage arrows, even summoned arrows (3 damage) will increase your damage significantly. However, you will not see the high high damage till 55+, but once you hit 51 and get the double damage on stationary mobs, I think you will be pleased. I would also suggest looking into a better bow. The one you have now is nice for your level, but if you can afford it, move to a BFT or better. Keep plugging away with those arrows, you will see the skill increase, but you have to use your bow for more than pulling. Each time I level (currently lvl 56) I notice an increase in archery skill about every 160 arrows or so, on dark blue mobs. Anyway, keep up the good work, you will get there eventually.</div></div><hr />
