<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far I've bought the spell that unlocks objects, and the one that removes a curse trap from an object.  I haven't actually seen any curse traps yet, though, or curse locks.  Has anyone seen any yet and successfully used these spells?<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone actually had a rogue be able to unlock/disarm anything in LDON?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in beta yes .. live no .. <br />
<br />
use /inspect to see what is needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, has anyone actually had a rogue be able to unlock/disarm anything in LDON?<br />
<br />
Rogue in my group (and only adventure so far) was successful in disarming traps in the corridors.  Have no idea about the chests and stuff as we just decided to do em and face the consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My main is a rogue, maxed sense/disarm traps , maxed Picklock and picklock mod item. From 11 chests i suceeded in opening 1 with no incident the rest I either couldnt effect or the traps autofired.<br />
<br />
Believe me as a rogue it is REALLY annoying that casters (including my 65th shaman) can get a few lousy spells to do the job I spent DAYS getting skills for and to top it off ALL the casters are better at it than I am as a master thief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">our chanter was unsuccessful with her lv 34 spells in unlocking the chests... opened 1 in 4 that we attempted, destroyed the rest</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i ran into 2 boxes today sealed with cursed runes sealing the box</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been in one dungeon, we ran into a chest at about the point we were about to be kicked out. The rogue couldn't sense traps on the box, tried to unlock it and it sprung a trap, we think. It made him drunk, which was pretty amusing. At least, that's what he said, we didn't see whether he'd secretly been swigging from his hip flask.<br />
<br />
We didn't have a chance to try anything else, because we were ported out at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I ran in to a lot of chests today that had &quot;curse&quot; somewhere in the inspect info, or in the name of the effect they hit us with after our rogue botched the disarm.  Quite a few good traps.  There is one that strips all your buffs and nukes you for 1.5k (that was fun, hit me right after I canni5'd.  I had 200HP to spare).  There is another that makes everyone in your group completely and utterly drunk.  RGC will remove most of the stat penalties, but the speech incoherency and staggering remain until they have run their course.<br />
<br />
From my understanding, there are three kinds of traps:  Mechanical, Curse, and Something Else.  Rogues (and maybe bards) disarm mechanical, priests + necro disarm curse traps, and the other int casters disarm the Something Else traps.  I am a little vague on this though and I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
I am torn between getting my trap removal spells, and saving up in the hopes I stumble across Bane.  What to do?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am picking up my trap spells right off the start.<br />
They are fairly cheap at 60 a pop.<br />
Bane is going to cost something like 10x that amount from what I've heard at bare minimum, and maybe something more like 15x as much.<br />
I'd rather not miss out on all the good stuff from earlier dungeon romps because I didn't spend the points right away on the trap thingies.<br />
I can live without Bane for an extra 4 dungeon romps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bought the trap spells but they dont seem to work.<br />
<br />
When I cast them on a chest/barrell I always get this message<br />
&quot;This spell only works on the cursed.&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? I didnt /inspect the chest first is that the problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Fezik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well for the remove cursed lock line, the chest must have a cursed rune or something. Wouldn't make any sense if the trap was mechanical and a curse line removed it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok just found the answer to my own question. It was the /inspect I was missing.<br />
<br />
There are two types of locks on chests from teh /inspect.<br />
<br />
Tiny Metal locks are Bard/Rogue disarmable.<br />
<br />
Blue fog/mist are the ones we remove.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the /inspect. I didnt know about that damn command =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ran across a blue fog chest that charmed us when we clicked on it.  Really messed us up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">on a side note - anyone know how to inspect someone?  I was cruising through EFreeport and saw what appeared to be a true newbie... I tried /INSPECT ON to rclick him but no luck.  Obviously this command has been remapped for LDON.  Like everyone else Ive had 'inspect' turned off for so long I don't remember how to turn it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/toggleinspect on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if your drunk and need to tell some one something just use cross server tells, wont slur your words</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If your drunk, use emotes, they don't get slurred.<br />
<br />
And finaly a use for my 200 alcohol tolerance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Does our &quot;unlock&quot; spell work outside LDON <br />
dungeons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Since there are no chests outside of LDoN, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Safehouse has a useful post about chests: An Explanation of How Chests work and how to open in LDoN (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13563.topic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wife popped a chest open the other night and out popped a Goblin slave.  Thought we were going have to fight it till I heard my wife squeal.  She plays a warrior btw.  The darn Goblin attached its self to her and became her Chanter Type Pet/Lacky.  Was funny as heck.</div></div><hr />
