Items disappearing in the new UI<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Had this happen several times to me. Started paying closer attention every time I was looting corpse and narrowed down what was happening. Got together with GM there to reproduce and we narrowed it down to two things, both stemming from one new UI feature. It should be fixed shortly. For the time being.. here's what is happening.<br />
<br />
When looting items off your corpse in the old UI, you were only able to take one item at a time. If you right-clicked to loot two items quickly, only the first item you clicked would get looted. You had to wait until it was in to your inventory to loot the second one, this made looting in heavy lag very slow. <br />
<br />
With the new UI, you can &quot;queue&quot; up items to loot. In a lag burst you can click 10 items on your corpse and have all 10 of them be looted in order. Works fine normally, but occasionally problems happen.<br />
<br />
Occasionally items are simply dropped out of the queue order and poof, but this seems to happen more rarely, generally in heavy lag.<br />
<br />
The other problem that can cause you to lose an item every time is easier to reproduce but still has to do with queuing up items.<br />
<br />
If you queue more bags then you have space to loot, it will go to your cursor, IF your cursor is empty when you first queue the backpack. If you pick up an item and have it on your cursor when the backpack gets around to being looted, it tries to go your corpse and poofs. This doesn't happen if you don't queue the bags. If you slowly loot the 5 bags, waiting for each to finish before clicking the next, the 5th bag simply does not get looted. <br />
<br />
Example: You have 4 inventory slots open. You quickly click 5 backpacks to loot, then you pick up your sleeper's key from the inventory. Even though you have 5 inventory spots open now, when the bag was queued there were only 4 inventory spots open, so the bag tries to go to your cursor (which now is holding your key). Your bag cannot be there at the same time and poofs.<br />
<br />
Log and over-detailed answer.. but the problem in a nutshell is that queued items do not check to see if it's save to loot when they are actually looted, the check occurs when you first click the item and things can change by the time it is actually looted.<br />
<br />
Another example of this is when buying items. Say you have 8 open inventory slots, if you quickly spam the buy button 9 times, the 9th ore gets bought and goes to your cursor, picking up an item in between spamming the button and actually getting the 9th ore will cause your 9th ore to disappear. At the same time, if you slowly loot the 8 ore and fill up every spot, it will not allow you to buy the 9th ore. Instead you get the message that your inventory is full.<br />
<br />
So! Avoid queueing items for now, especially when looting your corpse. Verant is aware of the problem and it should be fixed soon. Let's just hope they decide to change the time the check is performed (when the item is actually looted, rather than when you intially click the item) instead of removing queueing all together. I have a feeling they'll probably just axe the queueing of items, which I have already grown fond of. <br />
<br />

Another one<br />
-------------------<br />
I found another bug last night, but I'm not sure if it deals with the new UI. If you hand two of the same item to any NPC that doesn't want them the NPC will say that he has given you both back, but you actually only receive one. I told my wife to hand epic stuff to the wrong mob last night and she lost one of two rebreathers. If you want to test this yourself just try giving 2 or 3 waters to an NPC, I tried that later last night and only got one back. She was in the new UI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had the same thing happen to me. GM returned the items lost and said it was a &quot;known&quot; bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually had my whole corpse bug on me. I could see it, get into loot positiion, but once clicked showed no equipment.<br />
<br />
Work around was going back to old ui, coming in looting, then re-enabling new ui.<br />
<br />
Found out the work around after hours of panic and petitions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only flaw in the &quot;new UI bug&quot; arguement is that this bug happened to me...<br />
<br />
THE NIGHT OF THE UI PATCH. As in: Before the new UI got put in, I had this bug hit me.<br />
<br />
It has now hit me 3 times, and the soonest I've gotten a GM to get me my stuff back was 26 hours later. I'm currently going on 48 hours for the items that poofed on saturday.</div></div><hr />

I have more confidence in the fix-em-up abilities of some of the people on this board than those who gave us Patchlin er Luclin.<br />
<br />
/e looks around for Zorlac's calm and objective take on this new &quot;feature.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guildmate lost a few bags. Working as intended. Took him only 4 days to get it back with the more than awesome customer support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The new UI is very bug ridden, but I still love it.<br />
<br />
So far...<br />
<br />
Died 3 times in as many days ;) just like buses you don't die for months then you eat dirt 3 days in a row.<br />
<br />
I didn't lose any bags but I did lose items out of my bags. My problem is that I'm not sure what I've lost, I just know that I've got gaps in my bags where there never used to be any. I'm still waiting for a GM to sort after the guide passed it on. I doubt I'll get anything back but that's life. <br />
<br />
I'v got bugged tells/group chat/money splits. I can send them and sometimes they dont reach their target. other times someone in the group will loot a corpse and I don't get the you recieve some copper messages but I still see the items that they loot. (unless they are all playing a joke on me and randomly turning off splits :eek: )<br />
<br />
I hope they fix it soon as it's getting a bit hairy if I get told to stop pulling and I don't see the message and then pull a mob and they don't see my inc message. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was getting someone else's cross server tells the other day which was a bit wierd!<br />
<br />
I am also absolutely positive I have lost something from one of my bags (I have a gap there I KNOW I didnt have before) after a rez.  I have absolutely no idea what tho.<br />
<br />
A guildy lost a Fungi Tunic - they have so far waited almost a week to see a GM about it but still no joy.</div></div><hr />
