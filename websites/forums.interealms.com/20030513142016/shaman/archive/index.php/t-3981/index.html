One more thing...how the hell do I get Sir hobble to spawn so I can turn in my scales and get a wurmy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jaundiced Bone Boots are &quot;gay&quot;? They're like one of the better items you have there.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the Shaman quests on this page:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=133</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree, your boots are one of your better pieces of gear. What do you need wis for?<br />
<br />
I know you have likely read this 100's of times... but here goes.<br />
<br />
My wis is about 140. That is mostly due to the fact that I simply don't need it. I can solo 3 solid blues in a row before I need to take a break, (mostly due to my JBB, granted) and quite frankly, due to my AC I take next to no damage. My life became so good once the wonderful folks here at the Crucible enlightened me to the benefits of AC. High AC + regen + pet alone will get you farther than just wis. Ask any druid how much fun it is to med =)<br />
<br />
Play how you like, I don't mean this as a flame, but honestly, once you try the AC route, you will be far more impressed with the class ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What the heck is 'gay' equipment? Do your boots try and get it on with other boots if you put them in the same bag together?<br />
<br />
AC&gt;&gt;&gt;Wisdom.  I, like many others, am desperately trying to swap out wisdom items for items with more AC and HP but everything I seem to get has more damn wisdom on it (If only I could find some peerless dragonwing mantles for sale I would be happy!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a sad fact that at the mid-high levels its very hard to get much decent stuff from questing or from drops; I've purchased almost all my recent items from selling a number of less expensive things. At level 40 I was getting stuff that drops in KC or Seb, no way I could get it myself without buying.<br />
<br />
I can't advise you on wis gear you seem to know lots about it already :) You could do worse than starting your epic and getting the black fur boots, but I only swap mine in for sow - jaundiced have much better AC.<br />
<br />
Personally I would go for:<br />
6ac 65hp rings - 700pp<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield 1k - or at least do the epic and get Shield of Falsehood if you want to quest stuff. ToV has no AC at all, that's really bad.<br />
Do what I did, save like crazy for something big, I got an iksar ceremonial bp (4k) (ikky bp) and it changed my life.<br />
Get more jaundiced. Great ac and saves mana on buffing. Sleeves and gloves give str and dex which are nice. Pay about 600pp each at the most.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp<br />
Goldark Stormwind<br />
Antonius Bayle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends what ya want..if ya want solo..wis not so important..but grouing it is..go to seb or buff a full raiding party with 140 wis..ya wont be there long<br />
..personally i got high wis and if soloing. dont tank..thanks what pets for,got epic which helps alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depends what ya want..if ya want solo..wis not so important..but grouing it is..go to seb or buff a full raiding party with 140 wis..ya wont be there long<br />
..personally i got high wis and if soloing. dont tank..thanks what pets for,got epic which helps alot.<br />
<br />
But play as ya wish..imm not uber.but the guilds ya need to be in bore me to tears..much rather play with good friends not so called uber lords</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have the help of a guild, or even just one group of friends over 50, quest the Shield of Bane warding.   Nice AC and even wis, easy to get. and the quest itself gives nice exp.<br />
<br />
  Attend Naggy raids and hope to win the Polished Mithril Mask from the named FG in the lair.<br />
<br />
Get a JB helm.  Dirt cheap, and very hard to beat that AC on helms.<br />
<br />
  Do the Coldain Military Wristguard quest.<br />
<br />
  Buy a pair of also dirt cheap JB arms.<br />
<br />
  Go sit in KC for a while if you want to be REALLY lazy and loot bodies you find for the no drop armor, pretty sure most every one of those beats your AC, the Bp sure does, and it is quite common<br />
<br />
  Go hunt sun Revenants in Scarlet Desert.   The camp on the south border near the Grey has an occasional named spawn which drops sun leggings, those beat yours.<br />
<br />
  While hunting in SD, listen to /ooc because eventually someone hunting at the Rev temple will get a LORE smiter's Girdle which is rotting away.  Go loot it.<br />
<br />
  IMMEDIATELY upon reading this, get to the bazaar, buy a Charred Guardian Shield and destroy that ToV, cost on CGS is lower than anything else I listed, and if you think 1 wis is more important than 10ac then you aren't even reading this post anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zwamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say to definately go for the Kromiff Military legs, nice quest. <br />
Kromrif Military Leggings<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: LEGS  <br />
AC: 14<br />
STR: +6  WIS: +5  SV DISEASE: +5  SV COLD: +5  <br />
WT:  4.0    Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I started to do the quest, got the control harness and gem, and then reallised that since I'd started it I'd got the Jarsath leggings from KC which are one more AC and the same Wis. Hardly seems worth it for the strength and minor resists. Jarsath is pretty easy to get as it rots so much, so why are these ones so popular?<br />
Is it worth my while to carry on with the quest?<br />
<br />
Goldark Stormwind, 52 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fyful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Easiest thing to get for leggs so far is Jaristh Scale Leggings.  Just shout and beg and normally people will be cool and let you loot the leggings off of the jailer.  Trash your Bloodstained mantle and loot the Jarsith BP too.  I used it for about 6 levels just due to being poor.<br />
<br />
What you need to realize is that AC is much more important that wisdom.  See, we shaman, can cannibalize, which bring our mana back quick.  And if your AC is 600, you're going to take a few hits, and fall like an enchanter.<br />
<br />
So screw all that wisdom gear, that's a mistake.  Go buy a Totemic Helm, if having a JB Helm gets you down, it's still a very reasonable helm for the price, and many shaman at high levels still use it.<br />
<br />
Check out my profile, most of the stuff I'm wearing costs under 1000k a piece.  Accept a few things.  OH!  and if you don't know how to Canni Dance, read up on it.  It's a life saver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">goldark:  trolls and ogres cant wear the jarsath i believe.  dunno about iksar either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yup well aware of the ac/hp things, and sorry I need to update my magelo - now have elder wolf hide, spider fur belt, and JB Helm, so AC is much improved :) Wis is below 150 but I'll try to get that up soon without sacrificing ac/hp.<br />
<br />
Was just wondering about the leggings really, but hadn't considered about what races could wear them. Well I guess I will stick with my jarsath and maybe help a friend MQ the kromriff ones.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the extra advice though. I'm going to try to get some crystal spider eyes next I think, just lost a roll on them today but my time will come!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Trolls and Ogres can't wear Jarsath Scale.  VI gave everyone else a bone for NOT being the best 2 shaman races  8 )<br />
<br />
Trolls RULE!!!  (Ogres make nice stuff for us)</div></div><hr />
