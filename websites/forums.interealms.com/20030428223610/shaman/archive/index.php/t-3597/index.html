<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">at 35 i made a couple of these just to prove to myself that i could, and i brought them with me to solo, used 1, and i was really happy with the effects.  It also stays for quite awhile longer than drood or mage 1s.  and this is the lower 1, so imagine what the higher 1 can do ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are nice for soloing, if a bit expensive.  I haven't decided if the additional dmg is worth the cost yet.  My shaman is my main char so I don't have thousands of pp to throw around, so when I spend 150pp in a couple hours that wipes out my pp for the night.<br />
<br />
I do give them to tanks when we are in a group tho.  Try to get them to get used to having it, hopefully they will ask for them on other raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, i used to supply them in exp groups to main tanks, i had about 5 at 1 point, and we used them in the group that got me 36-37.  The tank really loved them, and with shammy buffs too, he was nearly unstoppable</div></div><hr />
