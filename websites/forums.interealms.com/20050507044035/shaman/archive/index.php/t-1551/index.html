<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild went up and got a tear from fear just before the servers downed...<br />
<br />
An enchanter looted the Tear....<br />
<br />
We have a Shaman ready for the tear part....<br />
<br />
Is there away for this to happen ...<br />
<br />
Don't enchanters get Truespirit faction?<br />
<br />
Maybe con... the Turn in mob....<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me... we don't want to waste the guilds time if this cant be Multi Quested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have the chanter con any of our epic mobs to see. If they are ally, you have a chance at it working. However, unless you have ENOUGH ally faction, there is no gaurantee it will work.<br />
<br />
Also, if a chanter turns in the tear, they may or may not trigger the battle with Rak'Ashiir because they aren't a shaman.<br />
<br />
It may or may not work but it's going to be risky. You have the tear though, so you may as well try /shrug<br />
<br />
oh, and IBsomeonesaysthisischeating, I'm just offering what knowledge I do have of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1477) where a very similar question was asked.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The shaman that wants to try this has done the quest from the beggining... but wasnt present for the impromptu raid to fear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are two issues here:<br />
<br />
1)  The enchanter will need sufficient Truespirit faction for the turn in - if not enough faction, Rak will eat the Tear without respawning aggro with Scale.<br />
<br />
2)  The shaman will need to make sure they have sufficient faction to turn in the Scale - if there is a faction hit when turning in the Tear, the enchanter will get the boost instead of the shaman, which might leave the shaman without enough faction.<br />
<br />
Both of the above can theoretically be solved by doing prior steps in the quests repeatedly until max Ally faction is acquired.</div></div><hr />
