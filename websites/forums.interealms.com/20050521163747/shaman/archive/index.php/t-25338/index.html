<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello-<br />
<br />
Just curious as to how many of you have had luck finding adepts of your wards (Spectral and Ancestral so far). <br />
<br />
I have had zero luck finding an adept for Spectral Ward, but since im about to ding 25 I get the feeling I would be better off saving my money and getting the Ancestral Ward adept if I Can, but I havent seen it at all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have Adept1 or better of Ancestral Ward? Im curious to know if I should just buy the app3 if I see it.<br />
<br />
Thanks-<br />

Saw one two nights ago for 15 gold, which I don't have. App3 has always been slightly out of my range as well. I'm come to the conclusion that I'm probably going to need to wait until Ancestral Ward as well and see how things go from there.<br />

It's been awesome. I've got both my current wards at Adept 1, and I hope I can find Ancestral Adept 1 by the time I can scribe it.<br />
<br />
If anyone has gotten it as a drop, would you mind sharing what zone it dropped in?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Moshka, unfortunately I got my Ward Adept 1 drop off either Rats or Scarecrows in Antonica, which means you'll have to make a twink to farm them if you are over level 15 or so since they won't drop loot after that.<br />
<br />
My 13 year old Son has a Scout that he runs around killing rats with, and he gets an average of about 2 Adept 1 spells for every 1-ish hour session he spends out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, you traded a coral *and* 5gp for the spell?  Once you have the coral the rest of the spell is really, really cheap and easy to make - just a heads up for next time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've got my Indigo ink, and I'd pay 1 gold just to have a level 24 Scholar click COMBINE on my level 24 Conjuror pet spell, but after shouting throughout tradeskill instances and various zones for two days I'm thinking it might be easier to level my Sage to 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have not found spectral guard or spectral ward. I found Seeping Eschar in Runny Eye. I've been using App3 wards my entire life :( Can't even find them for sale.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that 'evil' 20 spells drop in TS, and 'good' 20 spells drop in Nektulos. After making this induction I went into TS auctioning for my adepts and I found most everything I needed except spectral guard/ward :( Was able to get Fuliginous sphere, degeneration putrid balm and several others though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wards are just plain rare.  However, your observations regarding good and evil spells seeming to drop in the wrong Tier 3 zones is quite interesting.</div></div><hr />

Do you think this is another conspiracy theory against shamans? hehehe<br />

<br />
I think that was intentional on the part of Sony. I guess it is supposed to promote traveling and exploration to different zones. After all, TS is adjacent to Nektulos hehe.</div></div><hr />
