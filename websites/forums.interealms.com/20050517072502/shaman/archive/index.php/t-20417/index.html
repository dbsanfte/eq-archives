Execution in Lower Guk, I think he was quadding.. may have just been doubling.. 1200 + flurry.<br />
<br />
30min respawn has ph'ers<br />

Pyzjn in Qeynos hills, seemed to spawn every few minutes during the night events. 60+ poison nuke whatever it is took her down to 35%.. she wouldn't be a problem for anyone wanting her stone as an upgrade.. it's the 50 skele's that swarm you just for being in the zone that's the problem :p<br />
<br />
Those are the only two I saw.. I was in a group helping clear guk nameds.. the only one that any gear would actually be an upgrade to (they were a high elemental guild 2 group raid, and just wanted a slower).. and didn't get anything.. soon after we started clearing, more uber guilds ran down and it was a KS fest.. so I gated out :\</div></div><hr />

When slowed he swung very rarely, but when he connected, he did 1200 damage.  Killed him with a ranger, pet, and a couple of dots.  I think he also dispelled.  He dropped this, which was an upgrade for a couple of casters in our guild:<br />

Fabled Bag of Sewn Evil Eye (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68285) - Fabled Evil Eye in LGuk.  Friend of mine got it after 4 PH's.<br />
<br />
Fabled Journeyman's Boots (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68239) - not sure where it came from exactly, but it is targetable.  Nice toy for pure casters/melees and such.<br />
<br />
If you search Lucy by using 'fabled' in the items section, you can see alot of items.   :cool: Lots of stuff there! (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=fabled) <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68286 looks really nice, no idea where it comes from.<br />

Fabled Crown of King Trannix: Better than Ornate Silk and I think it had plainsight on it. 40-50 HP, 50-60 mana IIRC.  GREAT Human Monk (cough) or Enchanter (cough) item.<br />
<br />
All were ND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Friend of mine killed Fabled Kizdean Gix last night. He dropped Fabled Thex Mallet - 11/33 1h blunt with some small stats. He said the hardest it hit for was 44. Not sure if he melee'ed it the whole time though (he's a 65 shaman also), because if I'm not mistaken, the normal Kizdean Gix hits in the 70's and 80's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resisted one Slow after Malos and then was only &quot;mostly&quot; effective.<br />
Tank said she hit 750 and she nuked hard. Seemed to have a fair chunk of HPs as I ended the fight OOM even having Canni V'ed mid fight. Had to basically chain cast Tnarg's to keep the tank up. Not entirely sure on his equipment level though.<br />

<br />
Started this camp last nite at 2am. Entered the waiting list at #13.<br />
<br />
Finally got the drop at 3pm.. Chance of spawn or PH every 30 mins or so. Fabled spawn was streaky with 5 in a row at times, and then gone for what seemed like hundreds.<br />
<br />
Unsure what he hit for as i wasnt getting smacked around...<br />
12+ hours of hell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fabled Blue Diamond drops from the lizard in OOT, The Fabled Allizeswaur or something like that.  He hits for a ton, tank said near 2k max, so you have been warned.<br />
<br />
I ganked The Fabled Quillmane in SK today, spawned 20 seconds after I zoned in, hehe.   He was not beefed up at all, think max hit was 122 pts and he died with 1 Bane and a little melee.  Dropped the junky pants and a Fabled Pegasus Feather Cloak, which I let a guild warrior run in and loot.   Supposedly Fabled nameds that have a rare drop and a common drop always drop the Fabled rare drop when they are killed, so if you see Fabled Quillmane up, you just got a nice clicky lev cloak, heh.<br />
<br />
Also, warrior said you can petition a GM to have it turned into the regular cloak if you want it for a mage epic at all.</div></div><hr />
