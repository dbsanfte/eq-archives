<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">not that bad at 60, can get pretty much 30% exp/hr with self buffs epic/pox/plague/pet.  <br />
<br />
(i have about 2400hps self buffed and don't have canna 5... so its not that bad for the lacking shaman... and its a lot more relaxing than AEing all the time :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not talking about spiders, nor am I talking about dogs... I'm talking about the castle mobs.<br />

Takes some risk splitting the spawns but ya should have an unlimited supply for soloing/duoing.  Spawn time is 28 mins, in that time, when soloing I get a 2 sent spawn,  1 solo garg spawn, another 2 sent spawn, and depending on my mood, either another solo sent spawn or solo garg spawn.  So thats 6 kills/1/2 hr... now consider each mob is around 2-3% AA exp.  You do the math :).  <br />
<br />
Torpor = highly recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you going to castle through tents or middle of spiders. I remember the sentinals being fairly MR, unless Malo'd first, haven't tried them since resist changes (used to pull castle after clearing top dogs months and months ago)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh sents... they aren't that bad on MR.  I never malo before i land slow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was slowing sents at 54 without needing malo - got the odd resist but not enough to make me want to malosi, although with malo guaranteed to stick I suppose your mileage may vary at 60. Obviously I wasn't soloing at that level, I had some serious backup. Puller was grabbing them through spiders (don't know details) we took out a few destroyers too, which were pretty tough but very nice xp at 54!</div></div><hr />
