<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Back in January, the new versions of these zones were patched to all live servers. Has anybody been through these zones, or heard anything about them by way of drops, experience, soloability, etc.? I've heard next to nothing from Karana folks.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Caught one thread from October 2004, when changes were on test. Anyone have anything more recent?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pathing sucks bad is all I can tell you. Drops are on Allas. Some pretty decent one groupable drops from named and some really crappy, on par with DoN drops from named as well. The loot ranges a great degree. Remember Splitpaw and MM pathing when you used to experience there? Well multiply that by mobs that hit for a hella lot more.</div></div><hr />
