<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shadrak was &quot;born&quot; in early 2001, to be a partner for my shadowknight.  I always intended for him to partner with a melee character, because from my first days in EQ, shamans always made excellent partners for melee characters.  Their combination of regen (back when it mattered), slows, hastes, stat buffs, AC buffs, hp buffs, resist buffs, and heals really made them excellent partners for melee types.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, one of the AAs for GoD was originally intended to be, or at least represented to be, an endurance-regen spell.  If you read the warrior or monk boards (both of which I frequent), you'll see them fairly indifferent to the adding of +endurance to old-world items.  The major problem with endurance is not the total pool, it's the regen speed.  Adding a shaman-only spell or ability to increase endurance regen would be a benefit to shamans, as it would give us another value to add to groups.<br />
<br />
We've all been kicking around ideas for how to improve FA.  The stat buff portion of FA is useless, as most everyone acknowledges.  I really like the idea of adding some advanced combat effects (like strikethrough) to FA, but I'm not sure SOE would ever consider it.  As an alternative, why not add an endurance-regen component to FA?  That would inject some usefulness back into a spell that's been completely replaced in value by the beastlord spell Ferocity.  <br />
<br />
To scale down with lower-level shamans, you could do the same with the level 60 spell Avatar, and maybe an early-50s version, each with appropriately-lower levels of endurance regen.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't make shamans indispensible.  But it would add some value to the class, without stepping on any other class's toes, and with the timers already in place over disciplines to govern their frequency of use, I honestly don't see this as overpowering.  <br />
<br />
In fact, given the timers for monk disciplines, I never use up all my endurance anyway, as the timers prevent me from doing so, even at level 58.  Nonetheless, warriors seem to be more endurance-bound, with their incite abilities and other disciplines.  Sadly, I know almost nothing about rogues, but I assume they have endurance-regen issues as well.  Making this change might help shamans reclaim some value to melee-centric groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been polling my melees, and for the most part - by the time the disc refreshes, they have their endurance back.  I've asked my guildies if they want me to spend the AA for the endurance regen ward, and each and every one tells me &quot;don't waste your time&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget that even shamans ward does NOT regen endurance.  It is identical to the druid cleric ward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They need 30% overhaste on avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please don't give melees any more reasons to ask me to tie up a spell gem with this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ideally you would want your end pool to cover all 3 of the main disc timers as well as class specific abilities such as incite. Prior to the changes in the last patch my end pool could handle a few incites, an invul disc and a defensive disc before draining. Hopefully with extra end from items I'll be able to include my offensive timer and a few more incites as well.<br />
<br />
The most important component is end regen though. As things stand if you are MTing in a high performance group your end bar slowly decreases over time if you are consistently inciting. That means you have nothing left over for your invul, offensive and defensive discs. And, of course, if you have to use them you are pooched ;). A higher regen rate would largely solve that problem. This is particularly important in fights like Xegony or RC offtanking, where end management is critical (in the case of RC offtanking, its vital ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the addition of +endurance to the items we already had yesterday, I gained an additional 2105 endurance on my rogue. He could run out of endurance previously by using Duelist followed immediately by Deadeye, his two biggest damage discs. Now, I have about half a bar of endurance left once I do that. Both discs are on a 20 min reuse timer, and I am back to full endurance before that.<br />
<br />
While I wouldnt be against adding an endurance regen component to FA, making FA either a group buff, or giving it a reasonable duration would be far more useful. 6 minute buffs just flat suck big time. Even with all AA and buff duration enhancements, it only lasts 9 mins. Thats just plain stupid. <br />
<br />
This spell is the one spell you could wave around on a billboard as proof that the spell guys at SOE have NEVER, EVER played a high end shaman for any length of time. And it would be damned nice if they did for a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">kinda off-topic but this is my interpretation of a Dev playing a high level shaman:<br />
<br />
[puller] incoming slow this fast!<br />
[dev] casts slow, resisted, splat<br />
[dev] shaman suck i'm going back to my druid!<br />
[dev] /q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is a low 50's version of FA... PE.. it's part of our Avatar line. <br />
The endurance regen idea on this line of spells sounds interesting, useful and not over powered.. although.. I'm a little despondant about making my melee's ask for FA more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will never agree to make a stupid what 7 min ? buff to include END, if we should have it n anything it should be on a buff like acumen :p <br />
just try to keep all the mellees on a raid with FA....<br />
<br />
/rs afk<br />
/q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah, if anything it should be added to acumen and group acumen... i'd actually prefer it on fos/fo7 so it doesn't take up another buff slot, just makes more sense on acumen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing I'd love to see is our resist buffs added to FA.  I'm not asking for upgraded resists, but just the our current resists lines added onto FA so it somes up with one icon.  <br />
<br />
It would have the same stackablity as our current resists, IE our MR resist would not add if their was a chanter MR buff on at the same time or druid CoS with FR/CR.  This would work much in the same way as our haste line stackability with chanters haste.<br />
<br />
This way I don't think it would overstep any  boundries of the beastlord ferocity spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh please god don't worry about &quot;overstepping&quot; the spells our HYBRID class has.  They outbuff us for attack, hp regen and mana regen - oh, and every resist but PR/DR, since fero stacks with useful raid resist buffs.  Methinks that's plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Please don't give melees any more reasons to ask me to tie up a spell gem with this spell.<br />
<br />
Either we bitch that no group wants us or we bitch about casting one of the spells that groups want us for...make up your mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">holy resurrected thread batman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I still don't understand the argument for putting endurance regen on a spell I put in the back of my spell book years ago.  If endurance regen is going to go on any spell line, it should be on Focus or FA, period.  You cast these spells all the time on melee.  Why make it harder than it has to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As 'ferine' means savage, wild and untamed, I think that if anything gets loaded onto FA (and it sure needs something to set it above Fero!) it should be directly offensive in nature - strikethrough or whatever. Save the END buff for Fo7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They need 30% overhaste on avatar.<br />
<br />
A damage modifier is better. Too much haste and riposte will kill.</div></div><hr />
