<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm working on some Graphs for Direct Damage, I might get around to doing some for DoT spells. Here's the first one: Nuke Efficiency.<br />
<br />
I simply took the most efficient nuke (not counting bolts, rains, or AE spells) from each Era, and plotted 'em using my elite copy of Excel '97. I plan on making a chart for rains as well.<br />
<br />
I'll also follow this up with one for Nuke DPS, since being efficient isn't always as good as &quot;Making **** Dead&quot;<br />
<br />
For clarification, here's the spells I used:<br />
<br />
Shaman (Cold): Blizzard Blast, Ice Strike, Velium Strike<br />
Shaman (Poison): Blast of Poison, Spear of Torment<br />
Wizard: Ice Comet, Sunstrike, Ice Spear of Solist, Ancient, Destruction of Ice, Strike of Solusek. I probably should have changed Luclin to Garrison's, which has a DPM of 3.88.<br />
Magician: Shock of Swords, Shock of Steel, Ancient: Shock of Sun, Sun Vortex<br />
Cleric: Retribution, Reckoning, Judgment, Condemnation<br />
Druid: Starfire, Wildfire, Moonfire, Ancient: Starfire of Ro, Winter's Frost<br />
Enchanter: Discordant Mind, Dementia, Dementing Visions, Ancient: Chaotic Visions, Insanity<br />
Necro Nukes: Ignite Bones, Chill Bones, Ancient: Lifebane, Neurotoxin<br />
Necro taps: Drain Soul, Touch of Night, Touch of Mujaki<br />
SK Taps: Life Leech, Drain Soul, Touch of Innoruuk<br />
SK Spear: Spear of Plague <br />
<br />
Ancients seem unreasonably high, but a lot of them are more efficient than POP equivalents, though less DPS. Ancient: Destruction of Ice remains the most efficient nuke in the game. The necro ancient nuke (Lifebane) is actually more efficient than velium strike, although it's 250 less damage than neurotoxin. In most cases though, the focus obtained on ornate/elemental gloves will counter the efficiency margin that ancient nukes have.<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
Shamans are below Druids and wizards/magicians efficiency-wise by quite a longshot, and below enchanters much more than expected. The Necro/Cleric nukes are actually less efficient than velium strike, but have lower cast times and do more damage. Efficiency isn't the problem for us really. I'd even advocate a bit of tuning to cleric/necromancer nuke ratios if they tweak the damage/cast time on Velium Strike. Our poison nukes are a joke, but handy due to the low cast time, and thus we're stuck using them (or rain spells)on raids.<br />
<br />
Rains and Bolts:<br />
<br />
Both these spell lines are innately given boosts to efficiency due to limitations. Rains are penalized by having an innate 20% resist rate, and bolts gain efficiency due to Line of Sight issues.<br />
<br />
Spells used:<br />
Shaman: Gale of Poison, Torrent of Poison, Tears of Saryrn<br />
Wizard: Energy Storm (Wizards didn't get good rains pre kunark), Tears of Prexus, Tears of Marr<br />
Druid: Avalanche, Blizzard, Winter's Storm<br />
Magician: Rain of Swords, Manastorm, Maelstrom of Electricity, Maelstrom of Thunder. Maelstrom of Electricity sucks, I have no clue why it's a higher level spell. What were the luclin people thinking?<br />
Magician Bolts: Lava Bolt, Seeking Flame of Seukor, Firebolt of Tallon<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
<br />
Since rains have an innate 20% resist rate, it removes the advantage in efficiency that they had over straight DDs. In order to make these spells useful for all classes, the resist penalty should be removed and the damage scaled down apropriately. This would make rain spells superior in grouping situations, but still limited for raiding purposes, since crowd control is an issue.<br />
<br />
Also, druids gained a huge boost in this area in efficiency as well as DPS (See Below, Later). In addition, Storm's Fury has a -50 resist mod, which doesn't matter as much when you consider the above, but every bit helps. Tears of Saryrn could use a bit of a boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is interesting, but I am not sure that just mana efficiency is the best measure of nuking power; I would suggest overall sustainable DPS as a better measurement, since thats actually what matters in the end.  You will not, for instance, see many necros using their ancient spells over focused neurotoxin, in my experience.<br />
<br />
Necro/SK taps also can't really be considered solely in terms of nuking ability either; the tap portion of the effect is more likely the reason the spell would be cast, although it is interesting that tap efficiency is so close to our basic nuke efficiency.<br />
<br />
Lastly, while its not terribly relevant here, it does seem kinda wack that druids nukes are more efficient than mages, given that druids are so versatile as it is.<br />
<br />
Regardless, thanks for compiling these bits of data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sustainable DPS is coming, It takes a while to punch all this stuff into a spreadsheet =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I take it you are just comparing the spells themselves and not any difference in specialisations?<br />
<br />
Necromancer alteration-based nukes, the Magician Evocation/Conjuration dilemma etc. might skew the graph some.<br />
<br />
Edit: Would it be possible to remove the dots on your lines where a class didn't get a new spell of that line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, it doesn't include specialization, just the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty neat graphs...I noticed a trend, wher when Verant had control, everyone stayed equal as far as their efficiency, but starting with PoP, everything goes haywire. Makes me wnder what the DPS graph will show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only problem I'm having with the DPS graph is that chanter and cleric nukes have a recast so you can't chain them. Ice Spear of Solist and Ancient: Destruction of Ice have similar limitations. I'm going to end up doing two graphs, one for &quot;overall DPS&quot; and one for &quot;Damage dealt compared to how long it takes to happen&quot;.<br />
<br />
An enchanter can chain Insanity and Ancient:Chaotic Visions and kick out some pretty slick damage.<br />
<br />
A cleric probably won't have two nukes loaded, but then again, a cleric can do ~30dps melee while waiting for the nuke to refresh.</div></div><hr />
