<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NorahMistwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what are these exactly? are they GoD only? :confused: thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you need the GoD expansion to be able to have and use them.<br />
<br />
In each starting town there is a tribute master. Handing in Items to these tribute masters, or coin will result in Tribute points. Each item has it's own set value. You have to go to your own starting city to access the tribute master.<br />
<br />
With those points you can purchase certain abilites. Like Flowing Thought or Focus effects like Spell Haste, Extended Range, Burning Affliction etc.... There's also HP and Mana boosts and many others.<br />
<br />
You can select what abilities you want, up to 5 maxmimum. Once you leave the tribute master you need to hit Alt-U to bring up your tribute window. Once you activate them you use up points and a timer begins with 10 mins counting down. Every 10 mins your points get spent again.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea, I have in my Tribute Window, Burning Affliction, Extended Range and Spell Haste 4, along with +150 HP. That eats up 100 pts for me. So when I activate my tributes I eat up 100 points right away then every 10 mins another 100pts get eaten up. I can deactivate it at anytime though. (new with the last patch, making it much more worthwhile.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">think of it, as a use for all those cheap annoying items you always end up with, but are too common to sell for any decent value. Just chuck them at the Tribute Master &amp; he'll convert them into Tribute Points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think tribute is fairly useful. Ok its a bit of a rip off in terms of how much it costs, but hey - that's the whole point. The Tribute Masters and the casino are there to soak plat out of the system. Using the Burning Affliction tribute (until I have enough points to buy the EC Burning Afliction aug) Bane crits are pretty fun. Best so far that I'm aware of was 1116. Not too shabby for something with a base damage per tick of 420 :)<br />
<br />
[Fri Jul 23 23:01:56 2004] A Trueborn exemplar has taken 1116 damage from your Bane.<br />
<br />
Sure you can live without Tribute, but its quite fun when you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm having an awful time with this forum's search ... does anybody know if there is a list somewhere (here or on the web) that will list the items a tribute master will take and how many points he will give for it ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An actual list with points? Consdiering how many items there are in the game I'm not sure if that'd be possible.<br />
<br />
However you can go to Lucy and type in Item search what item you want to find the tribute value of. <br />
<br />
Once you have the item info up, go into the raw data. (click in the top right corner) Look in the list for Tribute, near the bottom left. The value will be displayed there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually I've seen a link to a complete list of tribute points, but I can't for the life of me remember where. The bard boards maybe?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately it's outdated and pretty messy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frooaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have the Tribute master window showing the things I want to pay tribute to and 25k plus points but for some reason it never activates.<br />
Is there some command you have to do after you get done in Tribute window to make it go active?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, since the update to tribute, you now can activate and deactivate the effects via the tribute window (alt-u).  I do not believe that the effects auto start once you select from the tribute master, you have to go to your personal tribute window and activate.  Nice feature, since you don't waste effect time when traveling, farming, in bazaar, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I fished around in Bazaar ... seems like a lot of LDON dropped items and player-crafted LDON gear is good for points. Petrified Pants of Buried Sand net around 1300 points, as does a Master Wu's Trance Stick. I can't remember how many points are given for Captive Coin sandals, but it's pretty decent. A lot of the sandblasted armor is 250-300 points, and I think the greaves are 800+ points. The Ring of Hardened Ash was an amazingly high number of points. The best part is that a lot of these items are very cheap .... I haven't spent more than 400p on the Petrified Pants, and managed to get a Trance Stick for 450p. I have built up about 16k tribute points ... they're a godsend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Droga is also a goldmine for Tribute Loot.  The Light Chain arms off of Stone Crook Piklo go for about 14K in tribute points with a 3K Tribute ring as the boobie prize.  Granted the arms drop about a 1 in 10 drop off the ugly bugger with about a 1 in 5 chance that he will show instead of PH but I could think of worse places to mine tribute points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm back after 14 months since retirement.. Glad to see the Crucible still the best resource.<br />
<br />
After I log off, I'll log on my vendor &amp; do a little tribute point hunting in the bazaar before I afk. There are some amazing tribute buys to be had there. Granted, most of it is lore, but it only takes a few items to fill up the tribute resevoir you burned earlier in the day...<br />
<br />
Good buys to look out for:<br />
<br />
Torn Flesh Turban avg price 7pp trib120<br />
Smoothmetal Torque          10        120<br />
Decrep. Tael. Band            15        120<br />
Hammer of Silent Screams   75!!      1200!!<br />
<br />
just to name a few.<br />
<br />
I plop them in my shared bank &amp; pick them up with my main the next day; Click spiritstone or Magus to EF,  run to Halas, tribute, gate back to PoK.. Takes all of 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Usually will trib. FT5 &amp; either BA4 or ID4 depending on whether soloing or grouping/raiding.<br />
<br />
When I left, the guild was still in ToV, now they're Elemental.... I'm soo far behind :) Tribute is a godsend when I group &amp; raid with them... Makes the gap between their gear &amp; mine narrow up quite a bit untill I can upgrade my equipment.<br />

Ha.. I'm curious what your perspective is on the game now coming from ToV and now looking at elementals.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to go to the Raw Data to get the tribute information, its listed at the bottom of the main item info page.</div></div><hr />

I'm not elemental flagged yet, working through back-flagging &amp; lvling up to 65. BUT in the back-flagging, LDoN's, &amp; GoD groups I've done it's very scary. &quot;nothing special&quot; GoD mobs dropping me in 1 round (only 2400 unbuffed hitpoints atm)... &quot;Overkill&quot; 2 group Vindi hits, DPS class heavy LDoN's that drop the mob before a 3rd wave of ToS lands.. The maelstrom of activity on a &quot;simple&quot; tier 3 boss encounter. It's pretty overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Logged on last monday barely 63,  today I'm 64.5. Thats with 3 unrezzed deaths &amp; a pretty leisurely gaming style for the majority of my time online. The exps are are flying by.<br />
<br />
It's a lot like the game I remember, except A WHOLE LOT faster &amp; waay more violent.<br />
<br />
I like it.<br />
