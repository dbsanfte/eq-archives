<br />
What are some of the good/bad points of different races.  Are any &quot;gimped&quot;<br />
<br />
I have always played evil and will probably continue to do so.  I am not a power player, but not a strict roleplayer either.  Just wanting to know what would be fun/best suited for a casual solo and group shaman.  Figure soloing mostly 1-40(not many low lvl people on my server) and grouping when I can past that.  Was thinking Iksar(what I usually play) but afraid the low str/sta may gimp them for soloing w/o good twink gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iksar &gt; all =P<br />
<br />
Seriously though, it doesn't really matter, all races are equally good for shaman.  Here's the lineup:<br />
<br />
Iksar - Regen, AC bonus (about 40 ac at level 42, no more past that), swimming starts at 100, forage.  Downside:  20% exp penalty, kos in all old world cities (and katta / seru), can't use jbb (level 45+ to click)<br />
<br />
Troll - Regen, nice snare necklace, jbb (45+).  20% exp penalty, kos in most of the old world, but not all of it.  Not sure on katta/seru.<br />
<br />
Ogre - immune to stun from the front, jbb.  15% exp penalty, kos status same as troll, no extra regen<br />
<br />
barb - only a 5% exp penalty, good faction.  downsides are no infravision, no extra regen.<br />
<br />
vah shir - I think 0% exp penalty (not sure).  good faction, can sneak, safe fall.  No regen, and lower starting stats than the &quot;big&quot; races.<br />
<br />
froglok - hold breath longer, start with higher swimming.  good faction.  0% exp penalty (i think) no regen, stats similar to vah shir.  Probably the worst from a powergamer point of view, have less bonuses.  On the bright side you get to do that cool flip when you cast =P<br />

<br />
As far as &quot;special abilities&quot;... Ogres have hte best one - No stun from the front. Iksar and Trolls have somewhat lame regen. Vah Shir have maybe the most useful one - Sneak is perhaps one of the best abilities in the game</div></div><hr />

Aye - my current 21 a tick unbuffed standing regen sucks =P<br />
<br />
Ok it isnt earth shattering but it is still damn useful.  Given a choice I would trade it in at 65 in a raiding guild for frontal stun immunity, but the journey to get there is significantly easier with the increased regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC is crazily sought after for it prevents damage from an attacking mob.<br />
While Regen replaces the hp that mob has managed to take.  It would be stupid to shrug off regeneration as not a desired race trait.<br />
<br />
I regenerate while standing up to 81+ hp a tick in equipment and my buffs.  Without the use of potions.<br />
Your lose if you think it is lame option in the game.</div></div><hr />

Now, look back at your original reply and see if it makes more sense, without any homosexual references conjured by the phobia of a lesser educated person slinging them as insults in their own discomfort with their sexuality. Does your/you're post have anything wrong with it? If you can find Waldo, cookie for you. If no, proceed to hammer a nail into your eye for every thirty seconds you go without finding it. kthx.<br />

I know what Rorgg ment.  But you don't know the whole story.<br />
THIS is the other definition:  http://www.homophone.co.uk/<br />

Read up, a bit it helps, even if its bitter history.<br />
Otherwise, you just look sheepish writing the dictionary term.<br />

Later gents, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Special props to Cirys, s/he got to the point of what I was asking rather err...  pointedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Troll/iksar regen used to arguably be worth the racial exp. penalty, but is hardly as valuable now that PoP has trebled the rate that mobs do damage.  Personally, when I'm in PoP my troll sahaman is just another pure caster prissy footing it to avoid aggro.<br />
<br />
Whilst we are on the subject - did SOE give us an increase on our regen between levels 61 and 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Having leveled a barb shaman to 65, and now having my ogre shaman leveled to his 40s, I'ld have to say that no stun from the front is amazing.  Very noticable during a fight, since it keeps you casting when all other races would be standing there waiting for a chance to cast.  Regen is nice on the down time, but you gotta get the kill before there even IS any downtime.  No frontal stun is the single racial bonus that helps you during the fight.  I'm constantly amazed at how big of a difference not being stunned makes.  With my barb, I was dazed and confused alot more than I had realized.  To be honest, the main reason I rerolled my character and transferred my gear over was just to get this ability.<br />
<br />
I agree, regen is very nice, but every single class can come up with a way to give you a few extra hit points at any level on down time (bind wounds).  There is no spell or non AA ablility, aside from ogre's innate no stun from the front that can prevent a melee stun, end of story.<br />
<br />
To the guy with 81 regen a tick standing, congrats.  With the same gear and AA (fungi tunic + any number of aura of battle itmes + buffs), an ogre could get 76 points of regen standing, and still have no stun from the front.  So your advantage is what?  Less than 10% hps per tick more in exchange for even more of a racial xp penalty?  Not to mention that the ogre probably has an extra hundred or so hps in the first place because of his higher starting stamina.  Hardly worth it in the end game.<br />
<br />
The typical lvl 44 shaman should have about 1500+ hps, and by 65 that shaman should have 2500-3000 hps self buffed at least (or much more for the if they've been reading the crucible forums and taking the advice here to heart).  Troll/iksar regen is 5 hps per 6 seconds, so 50 hps per minute.  Any 44+ shaman with stoicism really isn't going to miss those 50hps.<br />
<br />
At lower levels for the non twink, regen is very handy.  50 hps of healing per minute to a level 10 is amazing.  To a level 20 it's noticable.  To a level 30, it's handly, but won't give you much of an advantage.  By lvl 45, you won't notice.  With the recent (last 3 months or so) game changes, only the most casual of players will stay under level 40 for too long.  As you get the the end game, you're really gonna miss that no stun ability while you're trying to get that slow off as you tank a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You've got it kinda backwards Begun.  No Stun from the front was a very nice ability pre-PoP and still is nice at lower levels.  When you're fighting xp mobs that hit for quad for roughly 1k though it really isn't a big bonus anymore.  Either the tank pulls aggro off of you quickly or you die quickly.<br />
<br />
IIRC, there's a cap on how much regen you can gain from items around 36/tick.  Regardless, I know there is a cap on regen items so similarly equipped trolls/iksars will always regen 20hp/tick more than an ogre/barb/vah.<br />
<br />
20hp/tick is like free FT10, that's how I look at it.  it's not huge, but neither is No Stun from the front nor faction.<br />
<br />
In the end, Jinheim hit it on the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Frontal stun is nice, but over-rated.  My trollie doesn't get hit that often, and when he *does* get hit, he often channels through it.  But the point is, he doesn't get hit often.  Granted he's not a soloing shaman, so that makes a difference.  Having played a multitude of classes that can solo, I will admit shamans can solo, but imo this a class built for group-action.  As a shaman, I've found duos and groups to be more efficient for xp and for bringing more to the table... being able to combat stronger things...<br />
<br />
Also, I group more often than not with guildee tanks who I can trust to keep agro... so I can land a slow 2 secs after it's pulled and chances are good I won't get agro, which I appreciate a lot.<br />
<br />
As someone above stated, frontal-stun immunity is rather moot against PoP mobs that hit for outrageous damage... what's the point of not being stunned if you're dead anyway?<br />
<br />
I've found the regen to come in real handy in a lot of situations where I don't have my horse or don't have any form of clarity/KEI and I gotta canni-down to keep my mana up.  Yes, despite FT items and horses.... shamans do still canni a lot...<br />
<br />
So, in a word, I'd say the frontal-stun is nice if you're a soloing shaman, if that's the path you choose to take.  Otherwise, I wouldn't let that be a determining factor.  Choose the class you think looks the coolest.  The troll 20% xp factor makes it tough to level him, that's one thing that detracts from him, but in the end, it feels that much better when I level him, knowing that most people don't have what it takes to put up with the penalty.  Plus, trolls are damn segsy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Buffrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If I had to do it over again, and still might.  I would create either the troll or iksar.  Probably the iksar due to the forage skill which is nice to have.  I created a barbarian which he look cool, but not having that extra regen sucks.</div></div><hr />
