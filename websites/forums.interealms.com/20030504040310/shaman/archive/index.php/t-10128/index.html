I am an Iksar Shaman of the 38th season and I am about get level 39. I have all my spells ready (except Cana II) but I am still lacking Venom of the Snake and Gale of Poison.<br />
<br />
I searched several zones including Bazaar, Shadowhaven, Cabilis and the Library but I simply can't find them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas or hints?<br />
<br />
<br />

I hate to say this, but you didn't look all that hard.<br />
<br />
Remember the vendor where you bought Scourge,Envenomed Breath, Gale of Poison, etc...? That is where you buy it.<br />
<br />
Since you are presumably an Iksar (based on the fact that you looked in Cabilis), he is in the basement of the shaman guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ja, found him just now.<br />
<br />
He was halfzoned into the wall down in the maze of Cab with some corpse lying in front of him.<br />
<br />
The other DoTs I bought in PoK.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">link Shaman Spell Vendors (http://www.nytmare.org/eq/shamanspellvendors.htm)<br />
It shows that those 2 spells for Iksars are sold on the poison and disease vendor: Cabilis - Shaman guild basement, bottom of east tower - Grazik Plaguebringer (1125, -260, -24)<br />
<br />
True, you can find most Iksar poison/disease spells on Vessel Kirtokk who stands with the other vendors, but some spells like the ones you seek are only found in the basement.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean about buying DoTs in PoK, since they aren't sold there.</div></div><hr />
