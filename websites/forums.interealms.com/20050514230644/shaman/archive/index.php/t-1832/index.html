<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if I'm the only level 60 shaman out there without my epic yet hehe. Been 60 for several months now, working on my 15th AA point and still no epic =/<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone wants to take a peek at my profile, I'm looking for some decent equipment upgrades that are reasonable to attain (no massive raiding required). Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Very nace range slot item if you are on CoV faction:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didnt get my epic till I was well into 60 either, just depends on your guild and such :)<br />
<br />
Also I gotta have been the worst dressed lvl 59 shaman by a long way, blood stained tunic the works ahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I must just be lazy. At 55 I have the tear from fear and am within a couple runs through Rathe Mountains from being able to do the mage fight.  Guild will pretty much do the final fight when I'm ready (3 60 mages).  Don't know why I'm not getting it.  Guess I enjoy logging on and doing solo/duo exp but then again logic DOES tell me that a mana free ~1k dot is a good thing :).  Maybe I'll kick myself a little bit later.<br />
<br />
The reason I didn't want to do epic was I didn't want to go on a bunch of fear raids and spend nights doing CR's from failed ones.  Guild did Fear one night and 2 broodlings spawned. Sent tells to all 50+ shamans and nobody needed it so he rotted. Didn't even have another shaman to loot it and do a MQ :I<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I finished my epic long after I hit 60.  It was just never a priority for me, but I'm glad that it's done.  I do use it quite a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mmm dunno about easily...this guy can be pretty tough and I have only been able to slow him with POI after some serious debuffing. Hits pretty hard and pretty fast. if only one cleric, gunna need some good mana regen. Doable with one group but they had better be some badasses. Bring 2 groups to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't get mine until 59, but I think I was 57 when epics were put in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I didn't get mine until 60 either.  I had everything but the tear since like level 52.  I ran in one night when I heard the big guild on Terris was going to kill CT real quick and so I asked to loot the tear.  Was epic next day when we killed Rak with one mage pet.<br />
<br />
and Krakster - the guy for Talisman of Benevolence is EASY if you have a defensive warrior.   I mean cleric + warrior duo easy, almost.   We did it last time with 60 bard, 57 warrior (me playing), 60 ranger, 59 cleric.   Any level 60 can pull the captain, I have done it myself several times.   You don't need harmony.   I pull him with cancel magic.  FYI - I have only managed to land POI on him like 1 out of 10 times, he resists lots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I mean cleric + warrior duo easy, almost<br />
<br />
Eh? Hmmm...dunno how they grow them velious giants on ya server, but this guy has always been a pain in the ass. And what does &quot;cleric. warrior duo easy almost&quot; mean anyway? Dont give the fellah any false ideas, take a full, well balanced group of 60's or 2 55+ for a certain victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*shrug* whatever you wanna do.<br />
<br />
In the dozen times I've done it, we've never needed more than 1 group of 55+ and never more than one cleric.   We first attempted the quest (with one group) when our warrior was level 55 and we were shocked how easy it was.   I did not manage to slow, nor did I have to help the level 57 cleric keep the warrior healed.<br />
<br />
I would caution that the spawn is still a bit contested at times and if you are gonna spend an hour organizing multiple groups then your Scout could very well get taken.  The melee bracer is very nice for chain classes and monks - it is also comparable or better to skyshrine for plate classes.<br />
<br />
and what I meant by qualifying my above statement with almost - is that said cleric and warrior would have to have decent gear and be level 60.   Sorry for not being more clear.<br />
<br />
Take as many people as you feel comfortable with, just sharing my experiences for reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Royganth SpiritFang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You are not alone. )<br />
<br />
60 with 4 AA points and no epic.  I wish I had it, but hate asking for help.  I guess it'll happen some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Need to have a JBB to do that giant spawn properly, prolly why yah have so many problems there Krakster.....<br />
<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i plan on getting a few of my epic pieces done pretty early.<br />
<br />
i could do up to goin to COM now, and could do COM in about 5 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And it's really starting to frustrate me.<br />
<br />
I've been on the Tear step for over a year and (on my server at least) Demis are so bottlenecked that I'd have to join an uberguild just to even have a shot at it.<br />
<br />
I used to strive to complete the epic myself as it should be completed, but at this point, I don't give a fek anymore.  If I can find someone to MQ it with me, I will jump on that opportunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dinged 60 today, and frankly I rate my changes at the epic as slim to none, mainly because of timezone and the fact that the ubers tend to clear the demis on the way to get at C-T on 7th regularly - I personally know 4 other shamans on 7th stuck at the Tear too. I'd probably be allowed a loot or a MQ if I pestered some people, but it's simply not the same as being able to do the plane with friends.<br />
<br />
I'm not yet in any hurry to get epic - hell, I have plenty to do in the way of just getting spells let alone some decent equipment - but in six months I expect I'll feel differently.</div></div><hr />
