<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hotelseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just have a few questions about a couple items I recently purchased, and hope someone can help...<br />
<br />
1. Platinum Armband - Mana Preservation I<br />
2. Polished Bone Bracelet - Affliciton Efficiency<br />
3. Kobold Hide Boots - Extended Affliction II<br />
<br />
My questions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Does this mean that because I have 2 Polished Bone Bracelets that my mana use will be 50% less (25% + 25% for each one) or just 25% total?<br />
<br />
2. Does that effect stack with the mana preservation acheived from wearing the Platinum armband (ie 25% + 10% mana cost reduction totaling 35% mana cost reduction)?  I'm assuming that the answer to my first question is that you only get a 25% reduction, NOT a 50% reduction for wearing two bracelets...So will I thus get a 35% mana cost reduction???<br />
<br />
3. With extended affliction, will I do more damage with a DOT, seeing as the spell will last longer?<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. no, they dont stack<br />
<br />
3. yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2.  No, they wont stack this way either.  The more specific focus type will take effect (affliction, summoning, reanimation or enhancement) over mana preservation, as they have a bigger benefit.<br />
<br />
BTW most of the focus effects dont give a set benefit, but a range.  Affliction efficiency for example can save you between 1% and 25% per cast.</div></div><hr />
