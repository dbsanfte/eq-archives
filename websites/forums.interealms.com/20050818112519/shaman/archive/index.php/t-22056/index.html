This one is about DoTs. I have seen your discuss the following options:<br />
<br />
- DoTs are fine, or at least not important enough to warrant attention over other shaman issues.<br />
- Shaman DoTs are fine as far as DPS is concerned but need minor resist adjustments (-40).<br />
- Shaman DoTs are fine as far as DPS is concerned but need major resist adjustments (-100).<br />
- Shaman DoTs need to do a little more damage per tick (+10%).<br />
- Shaman DoTs need to do a lot more damage per tick (+30%).<br />
<br />
and of course permutations of the above.</div></div><hr />

Oh, next to nothing could convince me to leave that one out of the final draft :) <br />
<br />
You are right though, I should have included that in the original post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are obviously a lot of interpretations here.  One I think most people will agree with is one not listed--<br />
<br />
Shorten duration, increase damage proportionately.  THEN add 30% damage and a -40 resist.  Our DoTs need to be no more than 5-6 tics with more dps than single target wiz nukes for that period of time.<br />
<br />
Oh, and much faster casting.  Since they take so long to do dps, it doens't matter if we can land it quickly.  What's the purpose of having 7 second cast times on DoTs?  It's not going to do major, fast damage.<br />

Shaman Dots need 4 things.  <br />
<br />
#1 And the biggest. They have to reduce the aggro involved. Period. Cut the counters. Lower Aggro on counters. I don't care. But make it so I can Drop 2-3 dots on something and if The tank is alive I don't get summoned and whacked on a tic/Crit tic<br />
<br />
#2 Make Dot mana cost Over the course of the ticks. Rather than all up front. Then it is worth putting them on something even if it doesnt run full course.<br />
<br />
#3  Make resist adjustments so that we do not have to malo everything before we cast. Malo is a group / raid spell. Or a Safety feature for shaman when soloing by expending more mana.<br />
<br />
#4 Damage  Increase per tick  At least 30% Across the board. Also Add a cripple effect to Disease dots. To make them attractive in thier own right. Stackable with Cripple so shaman have a debuff role on Creatures immune to Slow. <br />
<br />
My thoughts on the subject of course. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some resist adjust would be nice. I think its a lil silly to bounce BoN 3 times on a mob that has already been Malo'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shorter duration should've been there. Bane really needs to be the LONGEST lasting dot, because most mobs don't even last that long.</div></div><hr />

Good poll, Murtak.  Don't worry about asking people's opinions, we're mostly not too shy about saying what we think.<br />
<br />
Need to say something about DoT duration, though.  Shaman DoTs seem to envision a fight that is 1 to 4 minutes long.  They work well for such encounters; and they work well for fights that are longer than that, simply by being reapplied.  <br />
<br />
To be relevant in new game content, shaman DoTs need to envision fights that last 15 to 40 seconds.  That means a long-running DoT would be Bane, at 30 seconds.  Retuned DoTs would need to hit and do their damage in less time than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that the first and foremost problem is the aggro generated by a DoT.  Aggro for casters should be tied (mostly) to damage done.  That is *clearly* not what is happening with DoT's.<br />
<br />
For example, mana considerations aside, I could easily sit back and chain cast Shock of Venom for 460 / tic and never get summoned or even come close to pulling aggro from a tank.  But god forbid I drop Bane of Nife + Envenomed Bolt for 365 / tic.<br />
<br />
I also agree that future DoT's need to run faster, similar to LDoN Bane but they *must* have a resist adjust on them of -50 or more so they actually *land* most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A resist adjustment is good.<br />
<br />
Increased dps is sort of pointless since we still need to deal with the agro issues, I would preferr to see them with agro reducers rather than increased dps.<br />
<br />
Something else they could do would be to have a self buff line that would convert DoT duration into increased (or decreased, as the case may be) dps, along with a corresponding mana cost increase/decrease. That would allow DoT users to tailor the behaviour of their existing dots based on the nature of the fight, ie low dps/high efficiency or high dps/low efficiency. I dont know how hard it would be to code something like that, but it might be a relatively simple way of addressing the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just wanna stay where we are in comparison to Necros in upcoming upgrades, damage wise. Yeah, aggro should be better, could be shorter for more, etcetc, but honestly, I think there are WAY more important issues on the table than this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Remove the insane aggro from dots and I think they would be fine.  Some additional changes to increase efficiency so they are once again more efficient than direct damage would also be welcome.   I dont believe further improvements in dots is the way to increase Shaman DPS in the short term fights that are standard in modern EQ.  The entire concept of DoT's is antithetical to fights that are over in 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agro is definately an issue especially when you get something like Bane focused and critting.   biggest DoT crit I've had on Bane was just over 1K damage.  Anytime it crits near full it is INSANE agro.   I've even pulled agro from one of them zeks in tactics.   :eek:    Meanwhile you have the mana burners dropping 4-5K bombs with no agro affect?  (ok, maybe not no affect, but you understand my frustration) Agro from DoTs definately needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'd be happy with a moderate upgrade in the amount of damage done and a lil resist mod would be nice too.   I voted for a little more damage and minor resist adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reduce aggro generated and speed casting up a bit.  That would in effect increase damage because spell would take effect sooner.<br />
<br />
Bane does seem to wear off pretty quickly but at least it isn't as resisted as poison and disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Speeding up the casting won't make a whit of difference.  Even if cast times are cut in half (a ridiculous number) you still are not doing any damage until the tick hits.<br />
<br />
The mere fact that you are suggesting speeding up cast times on DoT's should further underscore how minor a part they play in today's EQ.  Trying to squeeze in one more tick on a mob (maybe what, 400 HP?) is simply not the answer to our woes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">IMO the biggest issue with dots is the agro generated by them, and unfortunately this was not an option so I had to select &quot;more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course resist modifiers would be helpful as well as damaged / duration tweaks but the biggest issue IMO is the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lets face it DoT's need a lot of work.  I would be most happy if they reduced the aggro generated by DoT's so I can at least do some damage during a fight without pretending to be a nuking class with crappy ass nukes.<br />
<br />
But since that wasn't in the poll I went ahead and voted for the second most important fixes in my opinion,  a small resist mod and increased damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I chose the &quot;more than this&quot; option as well since none of the others address the insane agro they generate.  Dots should cast faster, recast faster, run faster, have less resists and generate less agro.  But other than that, they are fine...<br />
<br />
Gert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A -30 or 40 resistadj should have been put on from the very beginning, I was so annoyed when bane wasn't given that. I like Snowws idea of a 30% increase in damage per tick. Or another idea could be a slow combined dot. Where insects engulfing the mob do the most damage at the start and with the highest slow before decreasing as the insects die off,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">other - lower agro than nukes, shorter duration (poison should be the longest dot), small negative resist check, better mana efficiency than nukes.<br />
<br />
till that happens, dots are broken.</div></div><hr />
