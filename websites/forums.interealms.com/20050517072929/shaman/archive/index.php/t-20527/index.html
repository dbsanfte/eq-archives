<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">March 25th, 2004<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Headlines<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
-Refining some DX9 functionality.<br />
<br />
-Some adjustments have been made to pets.<br />
<br />
-Some general bug fixes.<br />
<br />
-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike.  The tomes can be found in the East Commonlands and the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
DirectX 9<br />
--------------------------<br />
-The center of collision for all players &amp; NPCs has been set higher.  This resolves issues with climbing, running up hills and some other collision issues.<br />
-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some of the problems related to getting stuck in geometry. <br />
-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. <br />
-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the General tab of the options window.  This feature forces your character to duck automatically to get into small places.  If set to off, you will need to manually duck to enter those places. It is &quot;on&quot; by default.<br />
-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved.<br />
-Rain now has visible weather. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
--------------------------<br />
60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways.  Most notably, the effects of pet foci will be more dramatic as a player progresses with more powerful equipment.  There have also been a number of inconsistencies between different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed.  All of the existing foci should never show a power decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower tier foci to a higher tier foci.  The most dramatic changes in pet stats are in the following aspects:<br />
<br />
Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet.<br />
Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.<br />
Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet.  Some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.<br />
Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in their damage output, although there are certain pets that have had their max hit and offense increased.<br />
<br />
Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances where you will see no change in a specific aspect of a specific pet.  For example, the Rathe’s Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not received an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant mitigation improvement.<br />
<br />
These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells:<br />
<br />
Ward of Xegony<br />
Child of Ro<br />
Servant of Marr<br />
Rathe’s Son<br />
Legacy of Zek<br />
Saryrn’s Companion<br />
Child of Bertoxxulous<br />
Spirit of Sorsha<br />
Spirit of Arag<br />
<br />
The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in need of improvement to maintain class balance.  Beastlord and necromancer pets also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude.<br />

Interesting hanges to pets but no mention of our pet. I wonder if we have been included in these changes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yea, kinda distressing that we have no upgrades in that mess. Is it really so hard to upgrade our pets?  <br />
<br />
Frankly i think giving us a upgrade to our puppy, via summonable weapons with procs, or just over all increase, would apease alot of people. You can say we arent a pet class, but i have to disagree. From 34 to 60+ ( pop ) having your pet tank is a very viable way to handle your killing. Infact i stills ometimes let pet tank in natimbi or some higher level area's but only if i buff him to the max with AC and agi and all the goodies and keep him FA with mage gear.<br />
<br />
I wonder how interesting it would be to have a pet buff that just made puppy a beast. Like in the sense where he could tank as well as a teir 2 geared warrior with like more HP added or something. This would be done through a pet buff similar to the BST, but where as they have a offensive DPS version, would have a defensive version that would make puppy a viable duoing partner.<br />
<br />
Just thinking out loud.</div></div><hr />

And don't bother trying to cast a dot on a GoD mob, cause it'll be dead by the time the first tick goes off...but I digress.<br />

Grats to the REAL pet classes for having their dps upgraded.  Leaves us even further in the dust.<br />

Rytan told us two weeks ago that the fix was done on test and should be going in on the next scheduled patch. We shall see...<br />
Unfortunately we couldn't patch out new pet data because of the changes for Mage/Necro/Beastlord pets that are in transition at the moment. The next patch is scheduled for about 2 weeks from now I believe and it *should* be all set by then.<br />
Also, if you have a shaman on test with this ability it should be functioning correctly now, so the fix is complete, just not patched live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The wording of the patch message is typical and disapointing.  Not so much for the exclusion of shamans (when will you people learn, I see updates, not necessarly upgrades, for every other class at least four times as often, SoE doesn't test us because there is nothing to test, all our abilities are either borrowed or are 6 expansions old), but because thay so heavily understate the issues they've caused.  They completely hosed many users with ATI chipsets for almost no apparent gain (no framerate increases).  This and ATI is on their supported list ... right.  They focused on balancing mages when their client has more issues than Michael Jackson (happy for mages, but on BB play is majorly messed up due to 1017s and 1018s as well as issues with the new engine).  Expect another patch 5-8 hours after this one as well.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and and for those who are all about balance, think abouot SoE's comments on healing percentages and ask where is the bloody shaman % in relation to DD, and pet DPS.  Times like this I'm especially glad I cancelled my account and I'm not paying those monkeys to screw over my free time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you are jumping to conclusions and being overly defensive.  I'm not sorry I used that phrase to describe my feelings about how jacked up the event was.  You had to add in the insult didnt you?  Well, Ill be the better person and not.<br />
<br />
Our pet is and I feel will always be a joke.  I rarely even use him unless I have access to a Mage for gear for him.  I'm also not so sure if Necros needed yet another upgrade, their pets are mean as it is with the Focus from either LDoN/VT/GoD.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to comment on the newest patch as there really is nothing I'd see worth commenting. Contrary to the quote I would like to say though, that all shamans I know NEVER EVER have problems finding  a group anywhere. Whether Ldon, PoP, God and god knows where. Shammies are well liked and needed and contribute a lot to a group.<br />
<br />
This is just my experience from my server and my guild though.<br />
I've never waited more than 3mins for a group.<br />

And lo, the Spirit Call pets have been fixed, effortlessly taking down a (slowed) Enraged Soulstealer in Dulak. From the looks of it, they have around 2000 HPs, so on a par with our normal pet - much more suitable for holding off a mob for a bit.<br />
<br />
Thanks to developers for fixing it - I guess patching it in at the same time as the other pet changes made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1) pet upgrades<br />
<br />
Good.  I'm not sure that mages were particularly hurting, but good all the same - why shouldn't they get a nice bonus once in a while?  Same deal for beastlords and necromancers.  When you're all about the pet, it seems to me that your pet should be solid (and the existing focii were pretty weak).<br />
<br />
2) im going to argue against the idea that shaman should get any pet upgrades.  we have never really been a pet class, we've just been a class that happens to have a pet in our bag-of-tricks.  Our pet has always been weak, always will be weak, and very likely should continue to be weak.  At low levels, nothing has changed.  At high levels, our pet is utterly useless except as a rovign DoT.  And that's fine.  Its dogdogs job.<br />

 I just don't understand this reasoning.I'ts generally agreed we need a dps bump, our pet would be an easy way to help this.Keep hp low so they can't tank but would add some much needed dps in group settings to argue for a useless pet is silly.What would you suggest? 2k nuke? ain't gonna happen.Better dots?

When I was in PoV a few weeks back we had two pets on the gollums A necro pet and mine. It was shamefull seeing his pet hit 80% of the time , and mine miss 80% of the time. This is only a Tier 2 zone I can only imgaine how bad it must be for people in higher zones.<br />

<br />
Hmmm....  It may or may not be generally agreed.  I would much rather have a healing increase, as I view the shaman class as a healer more than a damage-dealer.  That is a subject that everyone is going to have their own opinion about, I guess.  I cannot say that you're wrong for wanting to be better at DPS, and you can't say that I'm wrong for wanting to be a better healer.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think that an increased nuke is not all -that- unlikely, considering that seems to be SOE's preferred method of improving DPS in caster classes (even pet classes).<br />
<br />
As far as our pet is concerned....  does it really need to be stronger to do its job?  Yes, it misses alot - I agree.  Even with the misses, though, it still does a respectable job for what it is -- a mana free DoT.  If they made our pet stronger, we'd be infringing on the whole beastlord area.  I just don't think we need to do that.   Let the beastlords have their good pets.  In fact, *upgrade* the beastlord pet.  Definitely do NOT give beastlords a better slow, any form of magic resist debuff, a disease based slow, or better heals though.  Class blurring = bad.  <br />
<br />
To be honest, though -- critical DoTs have increased our DPS somewhat.   Also, fury of magic mastery has also increased our DPS a little (though this helps every class, I guess, so some might feel its not worth counting).</div></div><hr />

Seems like it would have been easier to deal with the Shaman issues from the start.</div></div><hr />

I have won an LDON normal w/ no healer when our cleric LD'd right at the start- lifetap tanking + pet pulling rules.  That isn't the point- shaman with solid aa's/foci can heal up to tier 3 trash as both slower/main healer.  I did just fine in Tactics last night as main slower/healer on 2nd box no less.<br />
<br />
However, in LDON hards it's instant Tnargs chain even after slowed.  Maybe this is due primarily to both the tank (my sk) and my shaman being only in bazaar gear, but I'd like to know how my shaman could heal in an LDON hard w/o an insanely geared tank or a cleric.  I know, because I've swapped out my shaman for a cleric and it went from &quot;suicidal&quot; to merely &quot;difficult&quot;.  Using the cleric I was also able to keep the tank up against an unslowed mob after the chanter screwed up and got killed.  I don't see how a shaman, no matter how well geared, could do that against the beating my sk takes in LDON hards.<br />

I'm open to suggestions though- magelos in sig.</div></div><hr />

Amen. As far as I know it's the only 55+ pet that doesn't. What was the reasoning for that anyway? Even animations do for **** sakes. Down with rusty weapons!</div></div><hr />
