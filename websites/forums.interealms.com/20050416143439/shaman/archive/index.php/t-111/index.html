<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The time draws close to my jbb.  I must have it or I will not be the best I can be.  I am 42 with no idea where to make enough money and exp to get one.  I was just wondering if there were any good Duengons I could go.  Heh dont like dl or ot.  Any info would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is how I made my Fortune.<br />
<br />
Go to OOT and Solo Gornit for 5-50p and FS Weapons per kill, when you hit 48 you can start to do SF's I believe, maybe earlier and they drop Jewels that sell for 40-100p.  <br />
<br />
While killing SF's you can kill Gornit inbetween pulls, at 54 I am making 2k every 4-5 hours chain pulling with JBB, with just gornit you should pull in about 1k every 5 hours or so.  <br />
<br />
If he is camped then start a mule, give him 1kp to start off and bring him to EC (or your auction zone on your server) and start to BUY low and SELL high while you wait for the camp.  Make sure you give the person who is currently camping him your name and ask them to give you a /tell when done.<br />
<br />
You will get encumbered fast, I always destroy the copper and silver, make sur you bring some bags to carry the FS, WR if you have them.<br />
<br />
You are a good race bind in NFP so you can just bank and hop back on boat, if you are evil bind in neriak, if you have the Hammer that Teleports you to OT thats even better, bind at gornit.  I dont like to sell however in OT as they only give you alittlre more then what it is worth so if you do this, dont sell the jewels, bank them instead until you find a well paying merchant and make sure to have your charisma buff up when selling.<br />
<br />
At 54 half the SF's are Blue so I am still making nice experience off of them, my time is done when I ding 55.<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chioni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is a level 40 able to camp here also? If not where could I solo for decent plat and at least a little exp?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should be able to handle him at 40, you might have to dot and rot though, give it a try.<br />
<br />
To be safe cast levitation on yourself and have gate up and if all fails run away over the water and gate/camp when at a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello Fellow Shammy,<br />
Here is my thought on the matter....first a little info on me.  I play a 57 Shammy on Bert.  I got my JBB at 54 for 10k.  The JBB has been rather helpful and has been known to save my life a couple times.  So well worth the cash you spend.<br />
Now as far as being poor....I can relate 100% to this.  In my 40's I was a poor SOB.  I found best way to raise cash was first hunt in a group in dl.....get the level for KC.  Then get into a DC group....and pray you get to win a drop.  I did Gornit in my 50's to raise more cash but I found this spawn to always be camped.  Here is why Gornit is bad....another 50+ shammy friend of mine hunted Gornit and Geos in CC while I pursued exp.  In the short time i was able to make more cash and more exp by hunting in Velks.  I now average about 6k a week.  The cash will come in time, your JBB will also come, be patient and work hard and you shall get what you desire.....as well as some nice exp.<br />
Good luck.<br />
