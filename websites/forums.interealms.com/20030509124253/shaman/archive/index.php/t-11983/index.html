<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donosek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I installed Directx 9.0 I recieve the &quot;No 3D Devices Found&quot; error message right after clicking on Play on the patch screen.  I've read  and tried reinstalling my video/sound  drivers and install them in the correct order of Uninstall Driver/Install DirectX/Reinstall Driver however DirectX is put out clearly as not being able to uninstall it and I haven't discovered a way to do so. Anyone out there that can help? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might help if you posted your hardware. There's a chance compatibility for the device may have been nixed in dx9 if it's old. If it's not, you're probably going to need to format and reinstall windows. &quot;Upgrading&quot; directx can be a nightmare if it doesn't work right on the first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the video drivers are the latest available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Need system info before we can really help.<br />
<br />
Beyond that , try updating the drivers is the normal first step. I know alot of games have problems with dx9 so that could be the root of it all.<br />
<br />
But Sys info please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">go into dxdiag and check to make sure that direct3d acceleration says enabled. If it does say enabled click it once and see if it stays enabled or if it goes disabled. It sounds like what I had happen to me a while back and the acceleration got disabled. For some reason other games seem to compleately ignore that but eq, probably correctly, reports no 3d devices if you have it disabled.</div></div><hr />
