<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I need a lesson in pulling. I have pulled from a camp where I always get two every pull. I can handle them, but it costs more than pulling singles twice.<br />
<br />
Now I have seen others pull that exact spot, and they only get one. My conclusion (right or wrong) is that I don't know what I'm doing and they do.<br />
<br />
So, how do I maximise my chances of getting a single when I pull?<br />

PS The spot I'm refering to this time is the Laborer cave in Tenebrous Mountains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. If you're a certain level above the level of the MOBs (I think it's around 10, or perhaps there's a formula), you can single pull. An easy way to test this is to root one MOB; if the other one runs at you then you aren't high enough level. It's possible that the people you are witnessing single pulling are higher level than you.<br />
<br />
2. Root one MOB and then pull the other one far away before root breaks. Since most things outside of the old world won't pursue you once get far away, this can work sometimes, though it's pretty much limited to outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
3. Root one MOB, pull the other one and try to kill it as quickly as possible, while keeping the first one rooted. Even if this drains all your mana, now the MOBs are broken as long as you watch closely for when they repop.<br />
<br />
4. Don't pull one MOB close to the other. This is pretty obvious: you stand so that you form a line with the two MOBs, and then pull the one that is closest to you.<br />
<br />
5. Pull with a spell or ranged weapon. As a Shaman, you are probably already using a spell to pull, but I've seen melees who just run up and whack a MOB and then wonder why they're getting adds.<br />
<br />
6. Pull two MOBs to the zoneline, root one, and then zone out and back in. This only works near zonelines obviously, will kill your pet, requires a decently fast computer, and is a little cheesy.<br />
<br />
7. Sit down near one MOB or use a low aggro spell. First-hand I haven't noticed much difference with these techniques, but a Druid friend of mine swears by them. Creep closer and closer to one MOB, sitting down, until it aggroes. Or cast Cancel Magic, a very low aggro spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My paladin uses cancel magic to pull quite often.<br />
<br />
It doesn't always work but in many situations I've been able to single pull surprising everyone in my group.<br />
<br />
It only works for blues and below though.  I've never successfully single pulled a yellow or red.   It doesn't work for all mobs either.  Some just have too big of an aggro range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tgout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With you being level 45 I wager it's about your level that is causeingyou to get multiples when you pull. Faction also has something to do with how the agro as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CheezorChic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pulling with slow usually gets me singles everytime<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />
