<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I've got the numbers right, ogres have a 15% exp penalty.  That's 10% more than barbarians, and only 5% less than trolls.<br />
<br />
They get this penalty because of their immunity to frontal stuns in melee.  Obviously, Verant thinks that it's worth a fairly sizeable penalty.  But are they right?<br />
<br />
How useful is stun immunity post-50?  How useful is it while duoing?  Soloing exp mobs?  Soloing big game?<br />
<br />
The exp penalty doesn't bother me a huge amount.  Whatever the race of the shaman I start, it will be fairly well equipped(fungi staff, regen tunic, jbb, foci, smashin' stick, horse, etc), so I know I can get to 50 quickly enough.  But the thought of having to do another half bubble of exp in 54 and 59 is enough to give me a bit of a pause.<br />
<br />
So, ogre oracles, do you ever find your stun immunity to be useful?  Or is it something that comes in handy once in a blue moon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have you ever played a caster before?<br />
<br />
Think of everytime you get stunned while being hit from the front.<br />
<br />
Imagine not being stunned during all those times, heh.<br />
<br />
I'm a 60 barbarian, I would have played an ogre if I could start over.  Bear in mind their high stamina is nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">55 ogre shaman here , I spend a lot of time standing in the mobs face clicking my JBB so ya , no stuns is handy .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play a hybrid.  Which means I'm always on the front lines of a fight, getting whacked by mobs.  And personally, even post-50, mobs whacking me with bash and interrupting my spells has never really been a big problem.  It happens occasionally, but it's never really life threatening.  Of course, this is probably because I don't do a lot of heavy spell-casting in combat.  Usually quick-casting, low mana cost spells.  The outcome of the fight is very rarely determined by whether or not I get interrupted by that bash.<br />
<br />
But when I do have to use some long-casting spell in combat, it seems that quite a bit of the time, even when I'm not interrupted by bashes, my spell is interrupted by the constant melee damage I've been taking for the last ten seconds the spell was casting.<br />
<br />
So, is the experience different for shamans? Different enough to justify a 10% exp penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would reroll an ogre given the choice.<br />
<br />
It really is useful, can't tell you how many times I get bashed in the middle of a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">after playing an ogre shaman 60 levels (plus aa of course)<br />
I have no regrets.<br />
<br />
honestly....paying 20-25% exp penalty would have been worth this ability.<br />
<br />
its the only racial ability that matters at 60.<br />
<br />
regen means....nothing...less then nothing even.(especially if you have your fungi etc) at 60.<br />
<br />
i never wish i had regen....better faction.<br />
<br />
if ya like looks go barbie or leezards.......if ya want power gamer go ogre.:)<br />
<br />
Tanking its a godsend....JBB blasting while mobs hit ya.  being able to stand toe and toe with the big 500+ hitting mobs and not get stunned.(i didn't say alive....but not stunned)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given that hit point gear is very sought-after at the highest levels, I would think that an ogre's naturally high stamina is a nice bonus, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">10% means jack and shi+ compared to not being stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">humm, IMO immune to stun from  front is a little overrated.<br />
i play a very agressive soloing (always 2 or 3 mobs at me).<br />
and i don't being stunned many times,and when i am it's for a very short time.<br />
<br />
all can be interrupted (got well more interrupt than stun)like all other shaman can be interrupt.<br />
<br />
that's not stop me casting my slow or dots at the mobs,even the epic.<br />
<br />
i am often grouped whit only a wizzy or mage for ae killing,8 to 10 mobs at me,and i am able to cast torpor very easy at the ae caster, even whit 8 to 10 mobs at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont really think its that big of a deal.  If its going to be a life or death casting situation as a mob beats you down, you probably shouldnt have gotten aggro in the first place.  What im saying is, any mob thats so tough that you just have to channel now and cant live though a stun, you have no buisness tanking anyways.<br />
<br />
If its a general solo xp situation, then getting stunned is more or less annoying than anything.  Its not really critical.  And most of the interrupts you get are from being knocked around, not being stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh and about stamina, really anyone other than iksar should be able to get 255 buffed stamina at the highest levels.  And being a shaman, your always going to be buffed with rh and pe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh and about stamina, really anyone other than iksar should be able to get 255 buffed stamina at the highest levels. And being a shaman, your always going to be buffed with rh and pe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gloriana has some really nice gear, and I think she has mentioned (lamented, really) that she caps out fully buffed at 251 STA.  So I don't think it's as easy as you say.<br />
<br />
Note= The plural of ancedote is not data.<br />
<br />
re: Stuns - I personally think its a huge advantage.  Whether I'm soloing and tanking mobs for dogdog or trying to get off that root/slow/whatever in a group, it doesn't matter.  Not being stunned means I'm never not 'in control' of my char.  When I'm stunned I can't do anything....cast, poke with my spear, move around, etc.  Major annoyance to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Absolutely Snap .<br />
<br />
I notice it hugely when playing my alts , none of which are ogres .<br />
Getting stunned bugs the hell outta me now because I'm not used to it hehe.<br />
<br />
So yes , i notice it a lot .  but true , a lot of anecdotes does not = data.<br />
<br />
on a side note , I cast slow , in xp groups, as soon as I see the mob . I often get the first whacks for my efforts, one of which is often a bash . If I get resisted , I'm not stunned and can immediatly start casting Togors ( because Turgurs has not refreshed yet) . <br />
<br />
  On multi pulls , I can immediatly get the attention of an add and root park it. It just makes things a lot smoother to not have to sit there stunned for a few seconds .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im a barbarian.  My stamina totaly nakes is 117 (100 with 17 points put in at creation, and no aa points).  Primal essence (52) increases stamina by 20.  Riotous Health (54) increases it by 50.  That means, naked, I have a sta of 187 just for being a barbarian.  That means it takes 68 points of stamina from gear to get me to the cap.  It really isnt that hard to get 68 points of stamina.  Some easy sources of stamina include:<br />
<br />
Solstice Earring (5)<br />
<br />
Coldain Gloves (9)<br />
<br />
Bracer of Fort (15)<br />
<br />
Thurg Quest set (15) [gloves and bracer have no stamina, for above comparison]<br />
<br />
Epic (10)<br />
<br />
WW Talismans (6)<br />
<br />
Barbed Dragonscale boots (9) [RC boots have 3 for above comparison]<br />
<br />
Heiro Cloak (4)<br />
<br />
That set right there will give you 70 stamina.  Every single one of those items is easily attianiable at level 60, no matter what guild your in (or not in a guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In all the months my guild spent getting geared in HoT armor, I can't tell you how many times it was extremely critical that I get a slow in, and how many times things came down to a matter of mere seconds.  Whether or not I got a slow off, and when, was commonly vital to how many people died, or whether any died at all.<br />
<br />
You can be stunned for a long time.<br />
<br />
And then you can get stunned AGAIN.<br />
<br />
What with melee damage disrupting you and shoving you, and bashes, the last thing you need is to be stunned on top of it.  If you're a mage and get stunned, it probably won't matter too much to the guild.  But if people are counting on you for slows, not getting them in is BIG.<br />
<br />
I would recommend nobody ever take up playing an ogre except people who REALLY want to hit 60 and keep on playing a long time after that.  The 15% experience penalty is huge, and effectively far larger than the troll and ogre 20% ones, because regen is critical to shamans pre-torpor, and is absolutely worth any price pre-torpor.  It's merely neato afterwards, no big deal.  My 60 shaman never wears a fungi, though he's had one(have another on my monk now).<br />
<br />
The iksar/troll regen easily makes up for their experience penalty in helping them keep up a good kill rate and leveling speed; ogre non-stunnability does not.  It's beautiful in raids and not bad in regular groups, but for pure experience pre-torpor? ...it's not much.<br />
<br />
However, if you can just tweak up an ogre with a fungi to start with, then who cares.  Never take the fungi off until you get torpor.<br />
<br />
After playing a druid and an ogre shaman, I know exactly how valuable not being stunned is, and after playing a shaman and an iksar monk, both of whom I've played with and without regen pieces, I'm well aware of the virtues of regen.  <br />
<br />
They're both great in their place.  Regen is king pre-torpor and trivial after, though I would never say it has NO value.  Just minimal.  Non-stunnability from the front is king after torpor.  It matters.<br />
<br />
But for the casual player or genuine newbie who can't buy an iksar regen BP or a fungi tunic -- play inny troll.</div></div><hr />
