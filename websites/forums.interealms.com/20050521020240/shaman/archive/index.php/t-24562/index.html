Good to see a change to the AA bank pool though.  Wonder if thats cause the next expansion they are working on is going to have AA skill that cost an excess of 30 points?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you still can only bank 30 aas by exping, but you can bank more than 30 when you get aas refunded (you know, the bug that all aas over 30 vanished after a refund once you zoned/lded/died) or get them by any other ingame - event (they prolly think of something like the 5 aas you get by finishing your epic 1.5)<br />
so (at least for me) its no step to new, 40-aa/step abilities :)<br />

I don't have a problem with Grimbear's work. I feel rather sorry for the fellow, actually. He's doing his job as a two-way mouthpiece just fine. <br />

They probably didnt finish itemization for the zone until just now; after ppl got into the zone and complained about no loot dropping.  I find it hard to believe that they lost the actual database containing the items.</div></div><hr />

In retrospect this expansion has been free of major bugs.  Some epic quests were screwed up, but they fixed them pretty quickly.  The raid encounters have been working for the most part.  I can only think of one that was screwed up. The Anguish loot bug affected about 0.00001% of the EQ population, so if feel stilted by something that you didn't have have access to (assuming you're not in one of the dozen or so guilds in Anguish), then I don't know what to tell you.<br />
<br />
It does appear that SoE is taking feedback constructively and doing something about it.  If they continue this trend, I expect the next expansion to be even less buggy than this one.  Compared to GoD, OoW has been a dream so far in all aspects.</div></div><hr />

Well of course Omens is less buggy.  It was supposed to be released content as part of GoD.  They held this piece back, tried to tune it and correct bugs, and then sold it as another expansion.  We should thank them and give them more money for this wonderful half-of-an-expansion!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personaly disagree with this statement . I feel that there have indeed been improvements to the Shaman class due to the efforts of both the former corr and the community in general &quot;I.E one voice&quot;<br />
<br />
1 . In the one voice post Shamans stated we needed better direct <br />
heals  . While when useing class comparisons its true we havent &quot;gained ground&quot; on outher healers we do in fact have better direct heals now then we did pre one voice .<br />
<br />
2 . A group HoT was something that Shaman never had but many wanted . We now infact have two . Ancestral Aid and Epic effect .<br />
<br />
Now im not saying I feel these changes are enough . Im just saying I feel its wrong to dismiss them completely . There have been changes in the last six months and in my opinion both the One voice petition and Banditman's work did indeed help bring these changes about .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting theory, any evidence that this is in fact true?  I actually think this is a rather good expansion.  Much more content and actual new features than many of the past so-called expansions, such as Ykesha.  Don't get me wrong, I am certainly not defending SOE, I've ranted enough against them in the past.  However, I think your &quot;theory&quot; is just that, pure conjecture.  The fact that they pushed back the original, totally unrealistic, shipment date and actually finished and shipped a solid product is a good thing.<br />
<br />
However, now they are going to screw the pouch again with this idiotic early release of EQII.  Ah, will they never learn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Omens is still unfinished. <br />
<br />
Look to the Instanced zones. Do they seem finished or even slightly tested to you?<br />
<br />
They are a 2 day hodgepodge thrown together at the last minute to pad the zone count and to enable a check box over instanced content. <br />
<br />
Yes some of the zones are completed and polished. Yes some of the zones are even pretty fun. <br />
<br />
But we are not playing a finished product. If you belive the database info was lost on anguish you really need to buy that bridge SoE is selling. <br />
<br />
It is better than Gates of discord by far as far as playability goes. But Evne gates was more finished (Not fun and geared towards Superuber. But mostly finished yeah)<br />
<br />
As for the heal situation. Well. We have larger heals Sure. But better towards the content. Still uncertain. <br />

<br />
I'm not going to give them that, we got a standard expansion healing increase, NOT an increase in our direct healing abilities. Percentage-wise, we heal the same as before. That was a &quot;cost of living&quot; increase, not a raise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed . <br />
<br />
My point is that we have seen improvement from OOW when compared too GoD . Now from my point of view in game I notice the following major improvements .<br />
I can heal my group &quot;Thanks ancestral Aid&quot; this is a totaly new ability I never had before and I enjoy it .<br />
I can REZ people &quot;sorta :P&quot; This is also a totaly new ability i never had before and i enjoy it .<br />
The content seems to be longer lived . My DoTs run duration .              I find in many zones I can actualy be the main healer again . There were very few places that I fought in in GoD that I felt I could effectively main heal .<br />
<br />
Again Id like to stress , I do NOT feel OOW was a magic wand that fixed Shamans . I do however feel that we have &quot;gained ground&quot; as opposed to where we were in GoD .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">&quot;My point is that we have seen improvement from OOW when compared too GoD&quot;<br />
<br />
But so have clerics and druids.  Whats &quot;hard&quot; for us to heal, is trivial for for other healers.  Thats the point glori is making.  Relative to druids and clerics, we are exactly the same in terms of our healing ratio to other priests.  We gained a group hot, on a timer.  So while its useful for emergency situations, or saving mana (like mana is an issue hehe), its hardly a mainstay of our healing ability.  <br />
<br />
I still think we deserve a fast heal much closer to druids given that slow mitigation is here to stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I can heal my group &quot;Thanks ancestral Aid&quot; this is a totaly new ability I never had before and I enjoy it .<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid is every 15 minutes.  I do not see that impacting your group a whole lot.  I usually use it when my group is killing a named and melee o-disc.<br />
<br />
I can REZ people &quot;sorta :P&quot; This is also a totaly new ability i never had before and i enjoy it .<br />
<br />
New Rez is nice, but there is a 10 minute time limit on it which I feel is a tad too long.  I would rather see this reuseable every few minutes.  Zones like MPG can be a bear to cr in if you are very deep in the see invis mob areas, and your cleric gets wasted because of adds.  Kinda sucks when you have to say - sorry, but you cannot die anymore or wait for Call of the Wild to pop in 7 minutes.  :(<br />
<br />
The content seems to be longer lived . My DoTs run duration .  I find in many zones I can actualy be the main healer again . There were very few places that I fought in in GoD that I felt I could effectively main heal .<br />
<br />
As for mobs living longer, I think this is iffy because of melee in my guild getting new weapons, casters access to new spells, etc.  I think we kill lightning fast now :P  But, it is nice for me to be able to stack a dot or two.<br />
<br />
After the slow nerf in OoW, my Ranger friend and I headed to Dranik as we usually do.  We were amazed how we got handed where a day before we were owning the zone.  We were back last night.  New Gear, New Spells, New AAs, and we are owning the zone again.  <br />
<br />
You will be surprised in what zones a shaman can heal in when they have the right combination of spells, gear, and AAs.  I was healing in Riftseekers a few days back when the Cleric was medding.  It was MEGA hard, but with SS and spamming DM, it was close, but I could do it.  I have healed in KT ( granted I cannot heal when group engages a named ), in PoEarth, in PoFire...  When my guild kills Quarm, I am usually the main healer / curer in my group.  Heck, a lot of times I am the MH in my raid group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I don't think it's so much that our healing has improved as it is mobs hit for less in OoW than in GoD. Compare yard trash mobs in Kod Taz, Yxxta, Qvic to mobs in RCoD and WoS. The mobs are the same level pretty much, but in OoW zones they're hitting for around 750 max, but in GoD zones it's upwards of 1100 max. At the same time, however, the OoW mobs have more HP, which means our dots can run full duration more often. Like Gloriana said, Yoppa's Mending is a cost of living increase, not a pay raise.<br />
<br />
Granted, when you get into Muramite Proving Grounds and Riftseekers the mobs start hitting for 1100+ again, but these are also higher level yard trash mobs than in Kod Taz, Yxxta and Qvic, and we're back to square one with being unable to be main healer. However, I don't see this as a bad thing, and am not complaining about it. I like RS and MPG a lot.</div></div><hr />

There are two points that I have never seen developers talk about in any meaningful way.  If your conversation is going well with them, as it seems to be, it would be quite helpful for me, and I expect for others, if you could get us some feedback on this.<br />
<br />
1.  Maintaining shaman healing ability as a constant percentage of cleric healing ability, because of the shaman's ability to slow.  Shaman can heal for about half the total amount of hp healed as a cleric, in most situations (various math demonstrations put it at 47%).  If game developers have written any posts defending this proportion, I have never seen it; but there is a fair amount of data out there that suggests this was fairly workable, in the kunark and velious eras, on fully-slowable mobs.  In Planes then in Gates and now especially in Omens, more and more mobs mitigate slow.  So slow is no longer as much of a factor as it used to be.  <br />
<br />
Question 1:  In the developers' minds, what is the reason for continuing to use this ratio based on unmitigated slows, as the game adds in more and more mitigation?<br />
<br />
2.  Maintaining shaman healing ability as a constant percentage of cleric healing ability, instead of as a constant difference from cleric healing ability.  When raw numbers increase, maintaining a constant percentage does not maintain the status quo:  it means that the difference between the two gets larger and larger.  <br />
<br />
[a] Suppose a cleric can heal for 2000 and a shaman can heal for 1000.  Because mobs hit you for actual hp rather than for percentages, the important point is not that the shaman can heal for half as much as the cleric; instead, it is that the shaman heals for 1000 less than the cleric.  <br />
<br />
[b] If a cleric can heal for 4000 and a shaman can heal for 2000, the ratio may be the same, but the difference in healing is now 2000 hp.  There are many more situations where the damage caused by the mob will fall into that 2000 hp gap, and the tank will die.<br />
<br />
[c] If a cleric can heal for 6000 and a shaman can heal for 3000, the difference in healing has become huge:  3000 hp.  There are vastly more situations where that 3000 hp gap will mean a dead tank.<br />
<br />
A 1000 hp disparity in healing power is a real disparity:  it means that in a given situation it won't be as easy for shamans to heal -- but they will usually still be able to get the job done.  In contrast, a 3000 hp disparity is immense:  there will be lots of healing situations where they won't be able to get the job done, the tank will die and the group will be wiped.  <br />
<br />
Question 2:  In the developers' minds, what is the reason for maintaining a constant percentage instead of a constant difference between shaman healing and cleric healing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your hard work, Grim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">&quot;My point is that we have seen improvement from OOW when compared too GoD&quot;<br />
<br />
But so have clerics and druids.  Whats &quot;hard&quot; for us to heal, is trivial for for other healers.  Thats the point glori is making.  Relative to druids and clerics, we are exactly the same in terms of our healing ratio to other priests.  We gained a group hot, on a timer.  So while its useful for emergency situations, or saving mana (like mana is an issue hehe), its hardly a mainstay of our healing ability.  <br />
<br />
I still think we deserve a fast heal much closer to druids given that slow mitigation is here to stay.<br />
<br />
I'd say depends on the situation. Our HoT time not only got bigger this time but actually got more efficient too which is a first. how useful hot's is largely dependant on what your killing and your tank. If HoT's are sufficient to keep your given tank up in the area your fighting shaman can be pretty effective and efficient healers. Definitely far more than druids.<br />
<br />
Spiritual serenity starts off at 6.3 hps per mana if you take it at face value and don't assume the extra tick that almost all short duration spells seem to get.<br />
<br />
Druids ancient heal is only 4hps per mana and thier non ancient no ch spells are even less efficient. Thier 75% ch spell is actually pretty efficient base at 7.8 hps per mana but pretty much can't be improved from there.<br />
<br />
If you start looking at enhancing things Spiritual serenity can be 50% extended from aa's to push it to 6 ticks and now can be exended with almost any exend benificial focus which will add at least a 7th tick and with higher ones possibly an 8th. Net result on the high end doubling the amount healed therefore doubling the efficiency.<br />
<br />
Regular heals on the other hand can be aa enhanced to add 28% with aa's and up to 45% with a focus item (altho it's random up to that point so average is half). The average improvement to heals is about 50% with of corse none of this applying to the druid iCH. <br />
<br />
Using http://samanna.net/general/healing.shtml for reference on extending HoT's and improving heals.<br />
<br />
Running the numbers again with 7 ticks for serenity assuming SCRM and at least some sort of focus extend focus gives us 11 hps per mana for Serenity and 8 ticks with a good extension items gives us 12.6. This is a highly effecient heal.<br />
<br />
Going back to druid heals. Using thier non ancient heal and a imp healing 5 focus gives us a max efficiency of 5.7 and average of 5.3. Going with thier ancient heal and a top end heal focus give a max efficiency of 7.0 and average of 6.1.<br />
<br />
At this point the shaman HoT's are almost twice as efficient as druid heals in addition to being able to slow to reduce healing requirements. Granted this only works in easier content where our Hot's are sufficient to cover most or all of the healing requirements. How ever in those situations shaman are a very effective healer. This content also allows us ample time to cann especially with Pained memory to give us an advantage.<br />
<br />
For something like a Dranic scar instance I know I can grab a tank and any 4 other people, preferably dps, and go get descent exp and a chance at runes. It's even pretty trivial to do. A cleric or druid would have a much harder time unless they can get a slower in on of those other 4 people.<br />
<br />
OoW seems to have alot more desirable content where HoT's are viable heals. From what I've seen with a sufficent tank HoT's can be a major contributor to healing even in riftseekers.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem is that on the high end we just cap so much lower than clerics or druid in that we just absolutely can't keep a tank up because they are taking damage faster than we can heal it. The problem is with our healing being half that of a clerics in volume and a base cast time of 3.75 seconds with a 2 second recast tme for a total time of 5.75 second we've need a spell that was under 3 seconds with recast time or a cast time of under a second which would end up giving us a big advantage in the quick heal department and would still be inferior when you factored spell haste into the situation. If you assume max spell haste standard heals come down to 2.3 seconds or 4.3 seconds total. To keep us in line with that the heal would have to be half that or 2.15 seconds with recast time or virtualy instant cast. To balance our max Hps healed per second they either need to be able to reduce the recast time on some spells or increase the volume.<br />
<br />
Then again this is really a long winded way of saying we heal well in easy situations but fall flat on our face in hard situations. Just luckily OoW seems to have more &quot;easy&quot; situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Heal over Time spells are decent when you got the 'perfect' XP grinding group, hence constant single pulls which are slowed right away before they hit the camp. The moment you get an add going rampant or slow bouncing once or twice, you can kiss your mighty HoT spell goodbye.<br />
So what it mainly does is giving us shaman the possibility to maintain healing in a controlled environment. The moment you go to more complicated ground you are stuck with blast healing. I believe that's the way SoE wanted it to be. I for one can live with it, I dont have to be main healer in KT or Riftseekers.<br />
<br />
Btw, was epic 1.5 quest changed in any way with this patch?<br />
<br />
So long<br />
