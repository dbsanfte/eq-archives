<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 61 shaman on Brell, average equipment, Canni 5, VP, SC. <br />
<br />
Recently hooked on to a Grummus raid, and found out quickly I had a LOT to learn. Raid leader made me a group leader, and I got yelled at before I worked out what was wanted... /who LFG, then /target name and invite. So... got that sorted now. Still, endless questions remain.<br />
<br />
1) How do I figure out who is going to be main shaman (i.e. who decides who is slowing)<br />
2) If I am only shaman, ok, I do all that I can, with resist debuffs/slows on the highest priority after buffing.<br />
3) What is the best way to raid buff if I am the only shaman, and I don't have mgb. How can I find out who are the group leaders, for instance. (Hmmm.. I suppose its in raid window.. )<br />
4) Apart from Stam, FoS and resist buffs, and assuming chanters are there for haste, are there other normal/obvious buffs? FA don't apply to my level, and Avatar is ridiculous. <br />
5) Should I always swap to resist gear for raiding?<br />
6) What are typical roles (leaving buffing aside) if I am not slowing? Is healing/curing the obvious area?<br />
7) Do I keep pet up at all times? Have seen one guide suggetion no pet by default... didn't understand why. I don't have pet control aa points though...<br />
8) Is there ever a time to use dots? If not, and if manna is ok, should I nuke?<br />
9) Do I ever attemp root in raid context? <br />
<br />
I recognise there are many different contexts.. but was just wondering if there were general points of good advice... and thanks in advance to the Shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Man, I remember when I used to ask these same questions.  I'll post advice after I get over my nostalgia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Ive always found just shooting tells will work for who is main slower. If its a pickup raid sponsored by a guild i tend to look towards either the raid leader or one of their shaman and ask them. If the raid leader is real busy than i just get with all the shaman in attendence and figure it out. <br />
<br />
3 Again talk and tells. People will never folow this 100% on pickup raids but guild raids you can eventually get this tailored. Group leaders send tells when Their group is ready for group buffs. Especially if you are buffing alone. Be as firm as you need to be and set the rules to save your sanity. <br />
<br />
4. If i am on a raid and are plenty of shaman and someone else is MGB'ing Focus and someone is doing stam i tend to offer the odd buffs by a per tell basis. Some people love agi or diaku or whatever. If i dont have normal buff duties i'll take care of the odd ones provided i'm again not the only buffer.<br />
<br />
5 Hmm eventually you learn your raid mobs enough to know what you might need to carry with you. I never put my resist gear on because unless its a pop in and kill mob is alot of trash to wade through and resist gear wont do me any good til the mob i need it for. <br />
<br />
6 That probably varies with each shaman. I tended to nuke if i needed to do damage and was cautious when it comes to dot aggro. Just be aware if your loading dots dont sit. If your using rains make sure there arent mezzed mobs near by. For trash clearing mobs i tend to not worry so much about my mana when i wasnt slower or healing. <br />
<br />
Again most of it is just be aware of the raid and the situations. If there was alot of mezzing going on and i'm not healing or main slowing id pitch in and watch the chanters health and malo their mobs they are mezzing. If its alot of straight forward not alot of mob pulls than i'd do damage with nukes/rains when possible. There are alot of times i'll just slow adds on boss mobs if the main slower is in the middle of getting the big mob debuffed and root park if possible. <br />
<br />
It can vary alot by mob per raid. If its tight quarters be aware not to try and root a mob away from the raid and get yourself aggro from mobs in adjacent areas. <br />
<br />
Dont try and do to much but do attempt spur of the moment things if you'll think it can save a raid. Ive bitten a bullet or two buying clerics time to camp out or to save a full wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5) Should I always swap to resist gear for raiding?<br />

9) Do I ever attemp root in raid context? <br />
<br />
<br />
Using Grummis for example.<br />
<br />
5) only on Grummis.  When clearing trash, HP &gt; all in case you get slow aggro.<br />
<br />
6) if your not slowing, then assist heal.  Make a hotkey that is /assist.    Target a mob, hit the key, and spam heals on that tank.  This is a general rule but there will be occasions when you dont do this.<br />
<br />
7) Never on trash, sometimes on named.  Pet dps is very marginal so he becomes a pain in most cases.<br />
<br />
8) rarely.  Your manay is better spent healing.<br />
<br />
9) Almost Never.  Exceptions would be the adds for Inny in Time....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Talk either to the class officer or just decide amongst the other shaman.  You'll be surprised, it doesn't really make much of a difference who debuffs.<br />
2) If you are the only shaman, just focus on malos and slow.  The only debuff you need to call out loud is slow.<br />
3) You can target group leaders from the raid window.  We have people send tells for buffs, so must of the time I cast single target versions.<br />
4) First make sure Focus is put out, then have people send tells for stamina.  You can do Tribunal on groups just before the needed encounter.<br />
6) Heals and cures.  When you get more comfortable with raiding you may do a little crowd control.<br />
7) Ditch the pet.  Will just end up getting you early pet agro or something.<br />
8) DoTs are okay, but I either end up just dropping maybe one bane or like breath of ultor when I do.<br />
9) There will be times when you'll need to root, but in most every situation your CC team should be able to handle mezzes and whatnot.  <br />
<br />
Just make sure you really listen to the raid leader and class officers.    Make the raidleader's chat channel a profound color, and just pay attention.  GL's and RL's like to see people respond quickly.  Sounds like the people you were with are kinda lame, making you group leader when you are very new to raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Information is your friend.  Do your best to get info on the mob before the actual raid.  There are other things you'll need to know during the raid itself.  Find someone on the raid that you can turn to and ask questions: a senior shaman, a guild officer, preferably not the raid leader who will be pretty busy.  But:  if there is no one else you can ask, speak up and ask the raid leader.  Any good raid leader wants everyone on the team to know what to do.  If you don't know what to do, you need to ask questions.<br />
<br />
When it comes to buffing, figure out who you need to buff.  If the MA is successfully going to hold aggro on the boss mob, and the healers are successfully going to keep the MA healed, the you need to buff the MA and a few additional tanks with all your hp buffs.  And if you don't have the time / mana to buff everyone else, that's not a problem to worry about.<br />
<br />
Suppose instead that your raid is marginal for dps and that the mob has a nasty AoE that could kill a lot of people pretty quick.  Then you just need to suck it up and put all your best hp and resist buffs on everyone.  And the rogue and monk that are complaining that prep is taking too long just need to wait patiently.  <br />
<br />
In terms of resists:  you need to swap in the equipment you need for THIS FIGHT.  If the mob has a nasty disease-based AoE spell, then you want to be wearing some nice DR stuff:  but you don't have to put on stuff that is fire or cold resist gear.<br />
<br />
If you are the only shaman and need to buff everyone, speak up in /raidsay to tell people what you are doing.  Tell everyone to be in a tight group with their group leader.   Then use the raid window and click on group leaders to target and cast your buffs.  You'll go oom before you're done:  you'll need some necro twitches.<br />
<br />
If the raid is marginal for dps, and if you can buff Avatar, do so.  You probably can't unless there are a couple other shamans on the raid.  It could mean that the raid leader needs to buy you a couple stacks of emeralds.  Buff the rogues first, then monks and rangers.  Depending on your aa, you can maybe keep a buff rotation running on 7 to 9 high dps melees.  <br />
<br />
I almost never use a pet on raids.  The problems with pet aggro, pet push, and pet control make the risk of causing problems too high.  Yes, you can spam /pet back off to keep a tight leash on Gobaner.  But most of the time I am too busy to want to do that.  <br />
<br />
As for root:  it does have a place, for rudimentary crowd control on adds, in some rare situations.  If you are skilled at ghetto crowd control you will frequently save your groups from a wipe:  in a critical raid situation root may be the edge that can bring three chaotic adds back into control.  But:  that would be a very rare situation.  Most of the time if it goes that bad, it's going to be a wipe and there won't be anything you can do about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, first off congratz on having attended your first raid.  Some of the posts here are pretty good telling you what to expect and what to do, but here are a few other pointers as well as my experiences.<br />
<br />
First off, it doesn't matter who you are with, people are going to want their buffs even if you may think that they don't need them.  Personally, I'll give almost everyone whatever they want, since I'm here to buff and debuff things, if they want said agility, then I'll give them that.<br />
<br />
Second, if you are the only shaman around, then I suggest you doing a few things.  First off, make sure that you are in the raid, and tell everyone that you are buffing people as soon as you can and hold off tells until then you ask for them.  Since you are doing said pre-elementals raiding, I'm assuming that most of the people that you are raiding with do not have max stamina.  So, what I would suggest is be sure to have at least the group version of Khura's Focusing and Talisman of Brute until you can get the better group versions of stamina and focus.  Then hit every group with both of those spells using canni4 as often as you can (and even better canni5 if you have it).  After that, I would personally go in the raid and hit the tanks only with your best focus and stamina (if you indeed do have single target better version of it, if not, then don't worry).  Then in the raid after that, ask for any tells for any other buffs that someone may want.<br />
<br />
Pay attention to what mobs you are doing and ask questions like has been said other posts.  If you are doing mobs in PoDisease or CoDecay, then give everyone your best group poison/disease buff.  Ask ahead if you need to.  We have the best disease/poison resist buffs, chanters have the best magic one, and druids have the best cold/fire one (note: necros can also buff PR really good as well if you need the extra PR with DMF as well as rangers have a decently nice cold resist buff that stacks with druid buffs).<br />
<br />
Now, as for actual raiding, I personally tend to keep up focus and sometimes stamina buffs.  I don't normally do any real damaging of mobs during raids, until the named and that is depending on what my role in each fight is.  I do a lot of debuffing (with malos if needed) and slowing during all trash clearing.  Some guilds handle it different, but I've tended to use any shaman available to slow anything that they see (use a debuff channel for best results.  We have a malos casting on this mob message, and then a slow on this mob message that goes in there, and helps everyone know who and what is debuffed).  I don't usually let the raid know what is slowed unless it's the first time that we are doing a certain named and if it's someone where slow makes a huge difference on cleric rotation (solro and Quarm are good examples of that).  I am not a fan of using someone to malos all mobs, and then someone else to slow them, mostly because I'm very quick at targeting something and I think most people I'm around are very slow in doing that, so if I'm slowing, I hate waiting on someone else to get their ass in gear and malos it.<br />
<br />
As far as damaging mobs, trash mobs tend to die pretty quickly.  Using cold nukes are normally too slow, sometimes I'll stick in a poison one, or use rains depending on location and also depending on if mobs are getting mezzed or just tank mezzed.  On named, once I'm done debuffing, I'll usually go into dps role, unless it's a fight where we have massive AEs on us and I may need to cure, or if I have to heal some people for whatever reason.  We can be very quick on agro so sometimes if there are adds and my tanks are slow at picking them up, I'll use my quick agro spells (meaning, balance of nihil and turgors) and agro them usually getting it off of the clerics.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't honestly use a pet ever on a raid, unless it's against a named that you know he will last through an AE or six, and you know that his push won't be something that ends up messing up the raid somehow.  We use spirit pets sometimes to help push a mob in the direction that we want him in.  That's fine, but can't use it all the time.  Our pet just isn't something that's going to be a life saver in a raid and it's typically something that does more harm than good.<br />
<br />
As far as maxing out your dps in a named fight in a raid, I'd say the best thing to do is use one of your magic dots, and then use your rains after that.  All depends on the mobs that you are killing of course and if there are adds, but typically sticking a magic dot and then rains seem to be my best dps parses.  As long as the mob isn't that PR.  <br />
<br />
Dont' even bother giving out any form of Avatar until you Feral Avatar.  It's not worth it.  Do use that once you get it, but make sure that whoever you are raiding with knows that you are only going to cast it on the people that would benefit the most from it (meaning:  rogues, rangers, monks, maybe beastlords).  You can keep it on warr/pal/sk if you want, but basically their dps is low for the most part compared to the above classes that they wouldn't get the best out of it.<br />
<br />
Oh, in raids, typically we use the shaman doing most of the debuffing (malos and slowing).  The beastlords are also in that channel and will help slow if needed, but we rarely use the chanters to do that.  Chanters and shaman both have the same cripple type spells, so it doesn't really matter who does it, so I tend to do it so that I know that it at least gets done.  We use our mages to do malosinia.<br />
<br />
It's been mentioned before about resist gear, but honestly if you have to swap in resist gear (and I'm talking about the stuff like the old player made JC stuff) then you might as well keep your real gear on and use it.  With buffs on, you shouldn't be that bad off, and if you really need the resists, some bard should be playing AE resists anyways.  I have some resist gear that I swap in and out sometimes, but most of that gear that isn't that much of a downgrade from what i'm wearing.<br />
<br />
Last thing I'd say is that.. I think that in my few years of raiding, I've honestly used root maybe a handful of times in a raid, and all of those times were because I ran ahead and pulled a mob and just rooted it in front of raid, or i used it cause slacker tanks wouldn't get the mob off of me so I rooted it and backed off hoping someone didn't break it automatically.  You will almost never use it, and you shouldn't honestly ever have to.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you or anyone else just a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Long and posted for a Pvp server.<br />
<br />
 Do Not Think, Just Do.<br />
<br />
let me stress this point.<br />
<br />
DO NOT THINK, JUST DO.<br />
this means that when the raid leader tells you to move from point A to point B you move from point A to point B, you dont stop and hail some mob, you dont stop and ask what we are doing where we are going why are we going there and killing that, shut your pie hole and move your ass when and where the raid leader says. <br />
<br />
the leader has a clue and is Very Very busy. every time one person screws up/screws around/goes afk/isnt paying attention the entire raid suffers.<br />
<br />
let me put this in perspective, 1 person does something wrong, it delays the raid by 15 minutes, there are 20 people on the raid...Congratulations you have just wasted a total of 5 man hours (20 x 15 /60=5hours) if this were a company that kind of thing would get you fired if you did it often enough.<br />
<br />
if you screw up, fess up. it is CRITICAL THAT WE KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG SO WE CAN AVOID IT IN THE FUTURE when the raid leader/puller/whoever gets pissed and chews you out, DONT take it personally, I cant convey this clearly enough. if you have lead 500 raids on a target and at 90% of them somone does something stupid causeing a wipe/delays your patence is GONE, its very easy to get pissed when you are leading something you percieve as simple and the newbie raiders percieve as difficult. if I chew your ass its not because I hate you or think your an idiot, its simply because I have seen the mistakes so many times it is beyond old for me. so please be patient with your leaders because odds are they are pretty short on patience themselves.<br />
<br />
Pay Attention, <br />
Do Not AFK unannounced, I will be pushing for dkp penalties on people who do this, one person afk unannounced can wipe the whole damn raid, delay it indefinitly, and its never the ranger_123 thats afk, its the only shaman/chanter/rogue/whatever class is 100% essetial to the raid. if you need to afk ANNOUNCE IT WITH AN ESTIMATED TIME YOU WILL BE GONE. <br />
Pay attention,<br />
Pay attention,<br />
Show up at the prep point when we call it, if you know a raid is happening soon DONT START AN LDON, if for some reason you ignore this advice LEAVE THE LDON, your ldon and your reputation with the peeps in the group doesnt mean jack or **** to your guildies when you are holding up an entire raid.<br />
if you log in late reasonable (thats REASONABLE) measures will be taken to get you to us. Dont expect us to come get a nonessential raid class and bring you to the raid if we are someplace deep as hell and hard to bring you in, dont get pissed if we tell you you cant come, once again you and your time are not worth wasting the time of 15+ people, there will be other raids with other loots at other times. thats how it is.<br />
<br />
At the Prep Point<br />
Do Not Duel each other, <br />
Do not run around, sit your ass down near the group leader.<br />
TAKE YOUR INVITE <br />
Click off old buffs,<br />
CLICK OFF OLD BUFFS. nothing like Blowing 1k+ mana on some important buff that doesnt land on somone because they have a higher version that then wears off 15 minutes later, I dont care if you have Focus of the 7th, Spider doesnt and if hes buffing you can bet your ass hes not interested in single focusing your dumbass. (note neither am I :)) its a matter of curtesy, dont waste my time, your time and the entire raids time. click that **** off please.<br />
<br />
Chanters<br />
Haste<br />
Crack<br />
MR (some raids you wont need mr so dont ask if you dont need it)<br />
<br />
Druids <br />
Pot9/Bot9/Cabbage<br />
Sof/Foe<br />
CoS if needed<br />
<br />
Clerics<br />
Symbol<br />
spell haste<br />
<br />
Rangers<br />
Atk buffs, <br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Focus<br />
Sta<br />
Tribunal if needed<br />
Shrink if needed<br />
<br />
Beast<br />
SD<br />
SV<br />
Shrink if needed<br />
<br />
Mages <br />
mod rods <br />
<br />
if you have followed the advice in this post<br />
you are at the prep point on time<br />
your old buffs are clicked off<br />
you are in the raid sitting near your group leader. (the reason for this is simple, buff classes open the raid window, target the group leaders and cast on them)<br />
if you are a buff class you are confirming that the group you are about to buff is all in the zone and close for buffs.<br />
if you had to pee you told the raid/yourgroup/the raid leader that you are afk2p<br />
if your cat spontainiously combusts while playing with the baby you told us you are afk because your cat spontainiously combusted while playing with the baby, you might have to miss the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
when the raid leader tells you to follow Dest when Dest tells you to, then Dest says &quot;FOLLOW&quot; you actually got off your ass and followed, even though Dest is running between the Avatar of War's legs and slapping his nutsack on the way through, even if he runs in circles around plane of hate agroing every single mob in the entire zone you are following, you are not asking why, where, what, or who,  you are a brainless bot.<br />
<br />
the reason for this is simple, its just not possible to explain in detail the entire raid strat to the entire raid, some one always misses info, somone always asks what the strat is 8 seconds after we just described the strat in short you dont need to know whats going on in detail, the tank knows, the healers know, the slower/debuffer knows, everyone else sit on your thumbs til we call &quot;ENGAGE&quot;<br />
<br />
if you can follow this advice, you will speed up our raids by a giagantic margine, if you can follow this advice you and I will be making XX look like a band of newbies trying to take down emporer crush. I know for a fact that they dont hit half the targets they could in a night due to simple ineeficency, I also know we are capable of much much higher standards, I will tell you up front that I am not the most patient person on a raid, if I am leading I know my temper is short. alot of that is because I get frustrated when the simple things go wrong. <br />
<br />
we are learning mobs, the ChardB boss we tried the other day will go down, I am 100% certain of this, we know the strat for him now, we have a much better idea of what we need to take him out and his loots are rock solid ****ing A1 loot. melees and casters, Wis casters Espcially want in on this guy.<br />
<br />
I know we need some practice, you need time to learn, so for now<br />
Dont think, just DO<br />
<br />
thanks :) <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
 The Basic Raid Strat, <br />
one person tanks, healers keep that tank alive, someone slows everyone else kills it while trying to stay off the top of the hate list<br />
<br />
Hate List, Agro list, whatever you call it, the idea here is to keep the Mt as the MT, I dont want to see casters trying to tank, if people have to switch targets on heals people start dying and raids get wiped. try not to get summoned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
 The Zerg,<br />
<br />
one person is Mt, this person does everything in their power to build agro fast and hard.<br />
everyone else goes FULL OUT DPS and prays the mt holds agro, this is a dps fest, nothing pretty about it, if the mob doesnt die fast we lose. (this is the strat for the ChardB boss) <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
 some strats we will use with the strats<br />
<br />
Cleric casts Group Ethereal Elixer/Bst casts PoS/Druid casts SotW as we engage also good with MGB, this strat is for mobs with nasty ae's and is a basic but important one to learn, timing is key here, when that buff lands you need to engage soon to get the most out of the buff but you still need to allow for the mt building some agro and debuffers to get in there and do their thing...not the simplest strat but not to hard either.<br />
<br />
preslow<br />
some mobs are notoriously hard to slow, there are many many strats for preslowing a mob before engage to many to list. but just so you are clear on the term it ususally involves a shaman/chanter combo to fully debuff and slow a mob PRIOR to engage. at wich point the shaman/chanter zone out to shake agro then the raid can start. this one takes patience on the part of the raid, it can take some time and you need to stay aware of whats going on so you dont miss the call to engage<br />
<br />
the TRAIN out.<br />
the strat we completely failed to employ last overking raid. this one is also about timing and paying close attention. we wiped because to many people werent paying attention and sat there while some ran where they were supposed to go and others ran around lost.<br />
<br />
the strat works like this, one person agros the mobs between the raid and the place we are trying to get to, then then drag a massive train past the main raid force (who really needs to be heads up, not agro anything and move quickly when the call to move is made) once its clear the raid moves to the destination and sets up for engage. when executed properly the train out is a massive time saver, its very usefull in places where there are just to many mobs in the way to effectivly kill. we really really need to get this one down, it can save literal hours in a day and over the course of a month can mean the difference between 1-3 targets down in a day and 4-6. I realise that most days wont see that kind of raiding but thats no reason to waste time when we dont need to.<br />
<br />
Call of the Heros,<br />
we move a mage to the position and summon the entire raid one at a time, this one is KEY that you pay attention, you need to Disband your groups, when invited by the Anchor (the guy grouped with the mage who is with the main raid force before you get summoned) TAKE YOUR INVITE, when you are summoned by the Mage, DISBAND IMMEDIATLY...this will save time if its done quickly and you pay attention....yes this strat is boring as hell usually once you are summoned there is a bit of a break but not always, sometimes you get summoned and have to fight right away. <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
 each fight is both unique from all others and the same as all others, the exact strat for killing the mob maybe unique to that mob but all raids are a blend of strats you will come to learn as we go, <br />
<br />
if you have question about what you should be doing ask another memeber of your class, <br />
if you missed a buff and want to risk almost certain death by asking for it SEND A TELL, do NOT spam the raid channel or /gu with &quot;I need Blah&quot;<br />
if you died and need a res, SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE!!!!! you will recieve a res as soon as its safe/convienent/possible spamming &quot;I need a res&quot; is just adding noise that we dont need, <br />
When there is a wipe Key Classes are on the res me first list, Chanters for Crack, Shaman for Buffs, Res'rs for help with resing Beasts if they have PoS up...you get the picture.(need to get a couple cleric epics) in short you are probably pretty friggin far down the list of people who need a res, if its a total wipe now is the time to go afk AFTER you let us know. <br />
some things not to do<br />
Do NOT ask the shaman/chanter/cleric/whoever for buffs while the target is dying, no the Druid cant hit you with a 9 while hes in the Ch Rotation, No the shaman cant give you fucus, hes low mana from slowing the target and his 3 buddies that added and he still has to make sure to KEEP the target slowed on long fights, No the Chanter doesnt have the mana or the time to kei you while hes keeping the 3 adds mez'd and trying to make sure that we dont get a 4th add to join the party, noone cares that you have res effects on with 0 mana and 12 hp, sit down and med or gear up and fight, your lack of full raid buffs is irrelivant at this point suck it up and deal. unless you are a MT/Shaman/Chanter/Healer odds are you wont see any buffs till after the mob is downed. <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
  <br />
PETS<br />
 <br />
unless otherwise stated NO PETS.<br />
most raids pets are ok to cast AFTER engage, but unless you have the /pet hold aa no pets preengage, some mobs have ae effects that arent visible to players but affect pets (AoW is one, he has a massive AE taunt that can put the pets owner on the hate list early) so as a general standing rule do not cast pets until after engage is called.<br />
<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
  Consent when you die, DONT AFK unless you tell us, if you afk for 30 min dont come back expecting a res, if you afk/log after a wipe in some distant zone dont come back expecting a res, when you do die<br />
Consent all rogues<br />
consent those who ask for it, dont make people send you tells for consent to drag your corpse so you can be res'd<br />
/consent raid<br />
/consent guild<br />
the hotkey<br />
line 1 /pause 5, /consent (player name here)<br />
repeat for lines 2-4<br />
line 5 /consent (player name here) <br />
with one key you can consent 5 people <br />
<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
 when you see the call to camp a cleric this does not mean you (unless you are a cleric) at this point everyone who can should try for agro, get your ass to the top of the hate list if you can, we need that cleric out and we need him camped not dead and hes already got agro thanks to heals. <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
 the &quot;omg I am late to a raid where gear drops that I really really want&quot; strat<br />
<br />
this one is easy enough, Mosher used it when we tried Chardb the last time.<br />
<br />
get to the zone in, have some kind of run speed buff, train almost all the way to the raid, stop and die. get a drag from the rogue....note make sure there is a rogue BEFORE you try this.<br />
also make sure you can find the raid BEFORE you try this. if you run off and die some place where noone knows you could even get to its going to be a summon out instead of a res into the raid for you. <br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
If you dont know whats behind that door DONT OPEN IT!<br />
<br />
If you dont know whats behind that door DONT ****ING OPEN IT!<br />
Do Not go exploring, Do Not piss off a bunch of mobs and run back to the raid.<br />
if you are busy being a n00b and pissing off mobs the least you can do is STAND AND DIE, the raid can drag you, the raid can res you, but NOT IF YOU WIPE THE RAID WHILE BEING A NEWBIE OFF RUNNING AROUND PISSING OFF EVERY MOB YOU CAN FIND AND DRAGGING THEM BACK TO US.<br />
in short, if you get a bunch of agro stop and die please thanks<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
BUFF REQUESTS<br />
if you need a buff, OPEN THE RAID WINDOW (alt+r) find the person who can buff you, SEND A TELL TO THAT PERSON, ask for the buff you need and tell them WHAT GROUP YOU ARE IN (as in group 1, group 6, whatever)<br />
Dont ask in /rs, /gu, /say, and if you do dont be surprised when you dont get your buff, 90% of what goes on in those channels is random spam and gets ignored.<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
HEALS, if you need a heal BACK OUT of the fight, OPEN THE RAID WINDOW, (alt+r) Find a shaman or druid whos not in the CH rotation and SEND THEM A TELL, shaman virtually NEVER go oom on raids and their heals suck to bad to be in the ch rotation, once the mob is debuffed a shaman or druid should be able to shoot you a heal or 2.<br />
<br />
=======================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
Invis Potions, if you cant self invis CARRY THESE. insta cast invis pots can make you invisible on the run. 10 plat from the pumice vendor<br />
Crimson potions, CARRY THESE, I dont care what class you are, click this and make sure you have no hp regen buffs going (as in click off SD/Regen) and you are immune to rapture. (not so hot for raids but they will save your ass in pvp)<br />
Pumice, unless you have room for cancel magic in your spell line up CARRY THESE. druids who dot cry when you pumice their dots off seconds after they land, so do necros, Life Burn is a pellable dot.<br />
Shaman potions, Cure disease/poison...sow...levitate...gate...all are very nice to have in a pinch and can save your ass. at the very least carry gate potions if you cant cast it.<br />
kill the prince in the warrens and take his magic dice to the cats in stonebrunt, turn them in to the little cats for a 5 charge snare item<br />
carry pvp proccing weapons, stun/blind/snare/darkness are all very very sweet in pvp and occasionaly usful in raids and pve. yes I have been in groups with my rogue where I was the main slower and or  snare. <br />
that damn horse in lowerfay, the one who killed you on the way to MM then CC'd you for an hour, equestrial the corrupt? he drops insta cast unicorn horn fragments or a horn that have charges of cure tash (its something else but thats all its good for is stripping tash.<br />
the mushrooms and other critters in gunthak drop clickie muchrooms, one of wich is a 400+ hp GROUP HEAL, <br />
<br />
theres a million easy clickies you can get to make like easier in general, they can help raids and groups as well as pvp. so if you find yourself passing through say warrens, stop and gank the prince and get yourself a clickie that rocks for an extra minute or 2's effort.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as debuffs go the more the better. I've always believed every shaman on the raid should be on malos/slow. So what if the mob got slowed four times, at least you know it got slowed. If using multiple split tanks have each shaman assist one tank. If I'm the only shaman I usually slow the off tanks mob when doing trash first because more healers are likely to be watching the MA. If its a named I always slow it first. <br />
<br />
Know your mobs, use the slow lookup table for the zone your are raiding. If the named you're about to do can't be slowed make sure the healers know about it because they'll have to adjust. <br />
<br />
Once the mob is debuffed do what is needed for your raid. If you have enough healers dish out some damage, for named bane (or athema in your case) and rains can generally be a pretty safe bet as long as there are no lockdown mobs right next to the target. If you need to help heal HoTT is your best friend, either the raid leader or group leaders should have this ability. You might always want to keep an eye out on the rampage tank if there is one. On ae mobs you'll probably be curing as well, this is one of the things we're really damn good at so get used to it.<br />
<br />
Don't ever get your pet out on raids unless you have pet hold and more importantly remember to use it. Wiping a raid because your pet chased down a mob that ae'd isn't going to help you one bit. <br />
<br />
Root is only used in certain cituations, if your raid leader tells you that you're on CC then have it ready, otherwise don't root anything.<br />
<br />
As far as your buff question, the only thing you should be worrying about at your level is Focus, STA, and tribunal when needed. If you have IoS offer to int caster/cleric types, especially when MR is important because it stacks with their shielding line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, here's my responses based on my experience raiding with my current guild on Stromm.<br />
<br />
1) How do I figure out who is going to be main shaman (i.e. who decides who is slowing)<br />
<br />
We usually have a &quot;head&quot; shaman that determines who is responsible for what.  If she is not there, then we usually just determine amongst ourselves who does what.  Our guild uses class specific channels for each class so we can coordinate on what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) If I am only shaman, ok, I do all that I can, with resist debuffs/slows on the highest priority after buffing.<br />
<br />
This is a painful situation to be in when you have a raid of any size.  My priority is usually get the key raid members what they need first, I.E. fully buffing the main/secondary tanks.  Then start working on others as I can.  Debuffing/Slowing is more important than getting str to that druid just because he thinks he's a melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) What is the best way to raid buff if I am the only shaman, and I don't have mgb. How can I find out who are the group leaders, for instance. (Hmmm.. I suppose its in raid window.. )<br />
<br />
With our guild, when it comes time to do group buffs at the start of the raid, the raid leader calls for them to be done.  Otherwise, we have a buffs channel that group leaders use to call for all buffs.  Usually, I use the raid window to target group leaders.  This can be painful as a sole shaman and people are just going to have to be patient as you do your job.  Getting with a necro to feed you mana while you buff an entire raid can be a life saver.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Apart from Stam, FoS and resist buffs, and assuming chanters are there for haste, are there other normal/obvious buffs? FA don't apply to my level, and Avatar is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Generally we keep Focus, stam, str and agi up on all, replenishment on the necros, and any other buffs are dependant on the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Should I always swap to resist gear for raiding?<br />
<br />
As mentioned by others, resist gear usually isn't too important for trash mobs.  Main event mobs, resist gear can mean the difference between success and a wipe.  I carry mine with me on every raid in a WR bag.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) What are typical roles (leaving buffing aside) if I am not slowing? Is healing/curing the obvious area?<br />
<br />
Most often if I'm not slowing/debuffing I'm healing my group and patch healing the main tank/secondary tank/rampage tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Do I keep pet up at all times? Have seen one guide suggetion no pet by default... didn't understand why. I don't have pet control aa points though...<br />
<br />
With our guild, if you don't have pet hold, you don't have a pet summoned.  We've had easy encounters wipe because someone broke the rule and their pet aggro'd too early on an AE.  Besides, dogdog is just another thing to keep track of.<br />
<br />
<br />
8) Is there ever a time to use dots? If not, and if manna is ok, should I nuke?<br />
<br />
Depends on what I'm doing, how much mana I have, and if I have the spell slot.  I usually try to have a dot or nuke loaded just in case I get the chance to drop one.  Some mobs have to have a controlled burn on them, i.e. Terris Thule in PoNB, and a dot is not appropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
9) Do I ever attemp root in raid context? <br />
<br />
Sometimes if things have gone sideways I'll use root on trash mobs.  Usually tho, our off tanks and chanters do a pretty good job of keeping things under control.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I say, that's from my experience with my current guild on Stromm.  I've been raiding with them for about four months now.  This is the first raiding guild I've been a member of, but I had done some raiding before joining them.  It can be a bit of a learning curve getting into the groove at first and it will all depend a lot on the group you're raiding with.  Try not to get too stressed and you can have a lot of fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats on stepping up into the world of raiding.  I was happy being a non-raider for the longest time, i attended a pickup raid, and got hooked, lol.<br />
<br />
Most of the info you saw up there was very good advice, but I have just two more suggestions.<br />
<br />
The first is never be afraid to ask questions.  There's no such thing as too much knowledge about a raid, and a knowledgable shaman is a prepared shaman.<br />
<br />
The second is that for every raid, even pickup raids, critical jobs should have a chat channel set up for those people.  Shamans/slowers should have a channel, healers should have a channel, necros should have a channel, pullers should have a channel, tanks should have a channel, etc.  This lets those people who do job X have a way to talk to each other without throwing 50 tells back and forth between a bunch of different people.  Ask your raid leader what the slower channel is...and if there isn't one, then ask for permission to set one up.<br />
<br />
When I lead pickup raids on Vazaelle (though I don't do it often anymore), this is one of my rules.  I find that when people can talk to each other out of raidsay and coordinate, things go much more smoothly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get invited, go anon, and just follow the mob around.  No really, it works.  Seems like half of pick up raid members use this elite strategy.<br />
<br />
If some one you dont know ask for something, pretend you dont speak English.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks to all those who responded... lots to think about in your various posts. I had not stopped to think about managing trash on the way in... there were so many on the Grummus raid I never seemed to get close to the action. I do remember others in my group saying &quot;we are all going to die&quot; when I pointed out I did not have Radiant Cure. Got my other cures loaded, and we did ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I might add that my other raid format experiences have been positive but just with 2-3 groups with my guild... the Hole, Cazzic Thule (hope I 'member that correctly... off Feerott). With pickup groups, one BAD experience in Fear, one ok Fear raid (no tear yet) and absolute mayhem in Hate with the guy who plays the organ. Talk about run round screaming and shouting! Four groups wasted in 2 minutes flat. Thats when I first learned you DONT get manna back when newly rezzed by doing Canni 5... &quot;is there a cleric in the house?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1) How do I figure out who is going to be main shaman (i.e. who decides who is slowing)<br />
<br />
<br />
There are basically 3 ways to work this. <br />
<br />
1) Have each shaman pick a job, so 1 might be the malo/malos guy, another might be the slow guy, another might be the rebuff guy. etc. Issues with this method: shms die, ppl cry if they do the same job every raid. So rotate jobs, have shms ready to slide into the spot above if someone gets smoked.<br />
<br />
2) Work assists. One shm takes the MA, and will handle all mobs off that assist. Another shm takes the SA and will handle all the mobs off that assist. Next Sham takes the overflow assists (ie - omg the bard/monk/necro  pulled more than 2). Let each shm have 1 rebuff also. Makes most sense to give the MA shm the smallest mana rebuff (you dont want this guy casting 7th and going oom during a pull). Issues with this method: You need a core of shams. 3-4 work wonders here and you need shams that are paying attention. Again, rotate the jobs nightly/weekly to avoid burnout. And have shms ready to handle a death, the SA shm dies, the 3rd sham (cc) slides into the 2nd spot till SA shm is back on his feet and with mana.<br />
<br />
3) Chaos. Shms just do what they want. Alot of family guilds or guilds with new players end up in this method. Good luck if you are in this mess. There are so many issues with this I can't even begin to list the problems with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO: Working assists is the most efficient and the preferred method. BUT you need the right core of shms acting as a team to make this appear seemless. <br />
<br />
IF you are training alot of new shms or attendance is constantly changing each night so you can never get a flow going then you might be stuck with method 1.<br />
<br />
Heaven help you if method 3 is your only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Often, though, it doesn't take strict organization and role assignments.  The &quot;Chaos&quot; method you mention up there can work, up to a certain point, hehehe.<br />
<br />
In the guild I'm apped to, the shamans don't have specific jobs.  They roam the raid and do what needs to be done without any organized direction, and save the organization (ok, you do X, you do Y, I'll do Z) for raid bosses or dangerous parts of the raid script.<br />
<br />
This works because the shaman in this guild know each other very well, and they seem to know what each other is doing most of the time even without announcing it.  The guild is &quot;family&quot; in orientation, but I'll say here and now that they're some of the most efficient and effective raiders I've ever seen, taking down targets that would be deemed virtually impossible for a guild their size (like killing Rallos Zek with 35 people, and keep in mind that the guild is NOT EP-geared.  That, my friends, is everything that needs be said about their ability).  Their close family-type structure reinforces itself into the raiding playstyle, giving them an almost frightening sense of what's going on with each other.  I'm overyjoyed beyond measure that i managed to get my app in before they closed apps for shamans.<br />
<br />
I'm working very hard to get to their level.  I'm starting to get a feel for what's going on, and hopefully I'll manage to get into their groove soon.  Every raid gets me a little bit closer to that level.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Use the raid window to see how many shaman are in the raid (I have shaman colored red int he raid window). Make a channel for the shaman (i.e. /join shamans: raid) and send tells to each shaman telling them to join. Once you have all the shaman in the channel, you can:<br />
<br />
a) Sort out tho is doing what pre-buffs<br />
b) Sort out who is doing what spells on the mob (i.e malos / slow / cripple / insid decay / disease slow etc)<br />
c) Check that everyone knows what is going on and what the strategy is, etc<br />
d) Laugh and joke with the other shaman at what a bunch of asses the non-shaman are....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You don't say whether you are doing pick-up raids or real ones.  Pick-up ones are hard to say.  Best I can say is join/create a channel and talk to each other and spread the work and info.  Also find out who is a real shammy and who is boxed.  Boxed shammies are there to be abused -- do so and make them buff till they think they will never see blue on their mana bar again. They can also be used for suicide debuffing on Boss mobs.  :-)<br />
<br />
Organized raiding with a good group of people who are used to each other is some of the most fun you will ever have.  The tips above are great and give you a flavor of styles and personalities you can come across while raiding.  You need to find a group that meets your style.  Some additional tips that came to mind while reading are:<br />
<br />
1.  Get used to dying.  You will a lot.  Partly you need to to find your timing for debuffs and how early you can do it for your tanks, healers, mezzers.  You also need a healer watching you.  You can do a lot more if you are being healed than if you have to do it yourself.<br />
<br />
2.  When you get rezzed DON'T LOOT!  Look around.  If the raid is moving drag your corpse to the raid then loot.<br />
<br />
3.  Do no damage unless you are completely certain you should.  Don't hit, nuke, or dot anything.  Malxx and slow do not break mez so debuff mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
4.  /join every raid channel you can handle.  Info and what's coming is real important.<br />
<br />
5.  Keep an eye on the pullers.  You want to target their mobs as early on incoming as possible.  But be very careful not to cast when they are still trying to split the mobs to get just 1 or 2 to the raid.  Be ready to duck out.  It's real hard for a shammy to use a mount in a raid.  You need to keep jockying for position to be near the MT and to be able to see the pullers.<br />
<br />
6.  Make people send you /tells for buffs.  Use /rt to target the person who sent the last tell.<br />
<br />
7.  Targeting -- use /assist, F8, and have Q or END keys (or any key you want) set up to &quot;cycle NPC&quot;.  Always make sure your target is one you want to cast on before you cast.  F8 and cycle NPC can target other mobs nearby.  Also set up a key that does /hidecorpse all.  It can get real hard to target with bodies around.  [do /hidecorpse none if you need to see the bodies again.]<br />
<br />
8.  Buff dead peeps as soon as rezzed.  They get focus and stam only.  Use a hotkey /1 Buffing %T to let the shammies know you are buffing.<br />
<br />
9.  Team debuffing works very well for fast slowing and spreading the agro.  Shammy_01 hotkeys /1 %T malXX in n secs.  The n is the time it takes your spell to cast.  Right click on it to see the casting time.  Shammy_02 times slow to land just after malxx lands (hopefully).<br />
<br />
10. Learn to say NO.  Poeple are going to ask you for buffs just as the raid is about to pull a Boss mob, you just got rezzed, you're oom, any number of times you just can't do it.  You have to tell them &quot;Sorry not now&quot;.<br />
<br />
11.  Keep acumen or any other see invis up.  You can't buff them if you can't see them and you need to keep an eye on the sneaky rogues and bards running to the raid with a few mobs following.<br />
<br />
12.  If you're made a group leader just invite anyone who is LFG.  Just trying to get everyone in raid at that point.  The raid leader should switch people around later to get proper groups.  If you are a group leader ask your group who has the most leader AAs and make them leader.<br />
<br />
Most of all have fun. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">we use shaman channel to share our information.<br />
