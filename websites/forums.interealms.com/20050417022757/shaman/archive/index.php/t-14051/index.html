<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chemosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all my first post here ...  Nice msg board you guys have here.<br />
<br />
Well here goes i play a lvl 40 Froggie Shaman on the Stromm server and i need some lvl'n help. Since the stromm server is so new there are no KEI enchanters and you gotta make do with with natural mana regen. So my question is for any of you old timers, are there any good xp spots that you guys remember from the days of Yore. =) I have all expansions and would appreciate any help you guys can impart ... thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MMM... try beach of Gunthak?  I think that's a good area for around that level.  Can't recall if Kaesora has good spots for that level, and you won't mind the faction hits there, being of good alignment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kaesora, down by the church (Xalgoz) is decent exp up until 45'ish. I pleveled my cleric there quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will get around 1-1.5% per kill and there is a really nice safe spot along the left wall where all the undead are.<br />
<br />
Invis doesn't help here because the undead see through it, but there is a safe way to get to the camp.<br />
<br />
If you approach the beach near the center, you will see a wrecked ship at the water's edge on your left with two mobs on the right side. To your right you will see (if memory serves) some rocks with a few live mobs (nifliks, scorpions, castaways). In between these two and inland a bit you should see a helm wheel (ship steering wheel) that is half buried. If you go to that spot passing mid-way between the mobs I described above, you will be safely on the beach. From here, you can safely weave in and around the mobs making your way to the left wall. Just give the mobs as wide a berth as possible.<br />
<br />
As you work your way to the left wall, you should see a troll standing their by himself. He is a live, static quest NPC and is non-KOS to everyone. To his right along the wall is the safe camp. You can pull mobs from all around to this spot and have a field day.<br />
<br />
Once you get a feel for the area, you can safely crawl all over the beach killing everything in sight.<br />
<br />
Most mobs drop 3-5 plat (rough estimate), you may see some named mobs spawn, and once you are comfortable and able to crawl the beach, the xp will add up fast.<br />
<br />
Also, there are two mobs I killed here that give crazy xp. They were a niflik and a scorpion, but not normal ones. The regular ones are called &quot;a Broken Skull Niflik&quot; or &quot;a Broken Skull Scorpion&quot; and they gave me normal xp. The two I am referring to have &quot;Giant&quot; added to their names.<br />
<br />
They were no tougher to kill than the normal mobs, but they gave me 7% xp each when I killed them. I can't remember my level at the time (might have been 43), but if you see these guys you will definitely want to take them out before anyone else does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had great exp and loot in Great Divide pulling Frost Giant Scouts (Bezerkers are a pain without KEI, as they resist more often). Drops are pretty good, usually about 5pp in cash and an average of 7pp on weapons...<br />
<br />
The other spot which i absolutely love is Crystal Caverns. If you can get the geos camp, you will make mad cash and pretty good exp. Geos are good exp til 47, and the named geos drop gems worth up to 200pp. <br />
<br />
That's my 2cp... Hope you find a good spot!</div></div><hr />
