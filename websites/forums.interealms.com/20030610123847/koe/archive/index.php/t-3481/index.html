<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to publicly thank arborealus for last nights fun.  A while ago, i ran into arbo while in thurgadin to complete the enchanter boot quest.  He told me he had some torn enchanted silk for the coldain caster gloves if i could come up with the gems.  Last night (with a big thanks to Bruman of LOA who i doubt reads this forum)  I got my last two Crushed Topaz gems and could complete the quest.  So i ran into arbor last night in EW while working on my coldain shawl quest. (those snow griffs are a bugger to find out there, big thanks to Leaasa of LOA for helping me track down and get all 4 eggs in one short span!) so i had most everything i needed to feed the coldain for part 3.  Arbor and i went back to thurgadin and multiquested the very nice +9 int enchanter gloves.  After that he helped me complete my next shawl step and then some.  He went out of his way to fashion pieces that i needed, like amixing bowl, pot, and pie tin.  And when i discovered that i forgot to get ulthork meat, we took a trip out to the icy blue to gain some.  I can't express how gratefull i am for your help Arbor, you truly show what KoE is made of.  But the night didnt end there, He asked me whats next?  i said its the one with the thurgadin gate potion, i need to gain pottery skill.  No problem, says arbor. and shows me how to raise pottery skill in thurgadin (man that was fast :) ) went from 0 to 145 skill in ... what, an hour maybe?  At this time i finally check my watch and find that its 3 am and decide i had better get to sleep so i could make it to work in the morning before school. Anyway, thanks again :)</div></div><hr />

We have some insanely generous people here in KOE and it's great to have people recognized for it.<br />
Just like to say thanks to Falamil as well for showing Mish and I a great place for farming regular silks.  It will help in future tailoring requirements.  I've moved to crystal silks just because I don't want to go through the heady kiola stuff for cured.  Easier to just try silk caps with crystal swatches and the silver thread for me.<br />
CC is THE place for this.  I went up about 8 pts in tailoring here last night in about an hour.  Killed th queen twice and a CCS rotted since I already got one from the first kill.  I checked out a quest for the Kromriff leggings and I think I'll do that too,  the AC is fantastic (14) on those.</div></div><hr />

Arbor has helped me so many times and I dont think I can ever thank him enough for all the knowledge he has shared with me and the neverending showing me where and how to get places !<br />
LOL I dont think there is one KoE I havent followed somewhere.  I rank right up there with Bashy on getting lost.  :)  :p</div></div><hr />
