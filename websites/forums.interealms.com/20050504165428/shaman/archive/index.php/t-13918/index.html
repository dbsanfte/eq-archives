<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torlaan02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there. Over the weekend a few of us over at Lanys had a Shaman only event in LoY. We had a total of 9 Shaman ranging from 65th on down to I think 46th. We went all the way to Hates Fury until we got to where the captian spawns but, since we didn't get the drops we didn't have a chance to spawn him.  <br />
<br />
It was a lot of fun to see us Slowing, CC'ing, DD'ing and Dot'ing our bear asses off. (Pun Intended). Heck, we even had a nice GM show up and give us some Gnome sandwiches and Booze. Try this sometime on your server and get to know your Brother/Sister Shaman better. I know I had a blast getting away from the old Exp Grind and Leveling stuff. Anyway, thought I would share.</div></div><hr />
