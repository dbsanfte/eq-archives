<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok im sure you have all had someone ask this before but heres my situation..<br />
<br />
The very first character I put through the character creation process was my shaman, not really having a clue what I was doing I put all my points into strength.<br />
<br />
I could never bring myself to reroll, I am now level 56<br />
<br />
Finished laughing? ok ill go on... :D <br />
<br />
How is this gonna effect me at level 60? obviously I cant pay so much attention to hp, ac or resists as Id like to.. or can I? thats really what Im trying to find out here.<br />
<br />
Im rarely out of mana in exp groups.. always on raids due to the lack of shaman in my guild. If its relevant.. its safe to say that its unliekly ill ever be able to equip myself in ToV gear, as my warrior is more needed on raids then my shaman.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing your opinions<br />

<br />
Don't worry about it, set two big priorities:<br />
<br />
1) Beg, borrow, steal a fungi tunic<br />
2) Get 58 and Can IV<br />
<br />
It's not really the size of your mana pool that counts, but how quickly you can regen mana spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your really that worried about it just pump AA Wis up to 5 that gives you 10 of the 20 points you could have pumped in at character creation.<br />
<br />
Like Gloriana said I wouldnt worry to much about it. It's not really something worth doing 56 levels over again. :)  Concentrate on 58 and get CanIV and then get 60 and Topor and all your problems will fade away into a Toporic state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't max my wis at creation either and I haven't had any problems.  I don't know what your equipment is like but my wisdom keeps increasing as my equipment gets upgraded.  I'm actually trying to swap wisdom grear for AC gear at this point in my career (lvl 58).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gahh. Get 60 and Torpor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kanadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">eww I forgot to mention that Im a troll :( <br />
<br />
My equipment isnt too shabby I guess.. im usually around 185 wisdom but I am in need of some serious upgrades<br />
<br />
I had a fungi.. once.. /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">185wis...thats about where I was untill just last week...never had a problem with running out of mana, get a fungi again and you be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">185 Wisdom at Level 56? My Shaman will make Level 55 tonight and has a Wisdom of 121. And I did put all 20 points into Wisdom at character creation :-P<br />
<br />
Somehow I think you'll get by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, I had about ~150 wis up until level 60 and it didnt really hurt me much.<br />
<br />
With a fungi + canni4, mana is abundant (as many others have already said).<br />
<br />
And if you get to 60 and get canni5 (aa ability) mana will be even easier still.<br />
<br />
Shamans are by no means a normal priest class.  We have very few dependancies when it comes to stats.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gahh. Get 60 and Torpor. /em starts to cry... <br />
<br />
Sorry, didnt mean to make you cry =\<br />
<br />
I got really lucky and had a friend from one of the bigger guilds on the server who had Topor in their Guild Bank. I ended up purchasing it for 15k. Didnt mean to state it dropped like a Ranger who over agros the AoW... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the great advice.. you just ended an internal struggle iv been fighting for years, I was contemplating rerolling not too long ago :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heck if had had to do it all over i woulda put all my points in STA <br />
240 wis 250 Bear form ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scryris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With Alt points you can make up half of the creation points anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hehe , when i started my Iksar shaman. I too had no clue what i was doing until later on. I started with 100 wis instead of the possible 115 wisdom ... i dumped  into other stats  like agi, sta, dex, str.. i didnt know any better. Well needless to say .. im 58 now ... and i have some planes gear, a few quest pieces. To tell you the truth it doesnt really matter. its easy to raise your wisdom.  mine sits at 216 unbuffed with bearform.  so im only at 994 AC self buffed.... so ive been dumping wisdom for AC/Sta/Hp gear, looking for more HP to use with Cann4 .. i love cann4 . =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm glad I'm not the only one!  I tossed my points around towards the Tank and Don't Get Hit philosophies.  <br />
<br />
Agi 92, Dex 80, Wis 85, Cha 65.  I have no idea why I threw 5 into Charisma, I think I read somewhere that we get a couple of Charm Spells.  Only time I ever used 'em was to run mammoths into the Icy Orcs just for kicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sargurin Dammim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally, I think its neat that people put points into other areas besides wisdom.  sort of takes care of the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; shaman or what other character you play. <br />
<br />
/Necro with no str....Oh, you can carry your own mammoth!<br />
/shaman with all pts added to strength.......Thats not all I can carry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I split my staring points between str/sta/agi =)<br />
<br />
personaly i seem to like the 180-190 wis area, guess it would be nice to have more, but i never seemed to have any mana issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i put as many points as i could into wisdom, and i wish i had put it all into stamina instead of the minimum into sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was about 10 points short of maxing my wisdom, but I'm a barbarian anyway so not much harm done.  I think I put the rest into AGI.  I could have done a lot worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh, I don't think many (especially old timers) had much clue what to put in.  I put 15 points in charisma, because of Charm.  Then that was taken out, before I was even close to getting that<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I put everything into Wis as a Troll ... then into STA.   That was the current logic at the time off all the boards.   Really by the 50's ... Natural stat's should not be a issue given all the buffs we have ... it's gear that impacts things.   <br />
<br />
This is the next version of me but I'm middle of the road ... mix of HP, AC, and Wis.   I've found that while I make it fine dealing with damage ... it's nice to have a deep mana pool as well for those mega buffing rounds.    Maybe I'm lazy.<br />

<br />
Hmmmm that didn't work but this does ... guess only HTML works in here now.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I did that too at creation with my barb shaman and only had 90 wisdom and felt like the total gimp will into my 40s. Personally since we arent like druids or wizards hoping our mana pool is bug enough to burn something down I wouldn't worry about it. Need more mana? Root the critter, back off and cann a few times (cann 3 is kind of ok, can IV is soooo much better when you need mana in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I've played through all the fads, The Wisdom Shaman, The AC Shaman, The Wisdom/AC Shaman ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
Once you get Can IV I switched to trying to accumulate HP gear to have more to cannibalize in a hurry, works for me and I would just say push on to 58. With regrowth and your troll regen you should regain the hps quick enough , maybe pick up an iksar tunic cheap for a little extra regen and build up a set of HP items you can swap out. <br />
<br />
But yeah don't sweat the wisdom. I used to think it might have affected resists I think that theory has been debunked too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you were on a PvP server it may be difficult on ya because of all the resist gear you need to wear, but on a blue server you are A.O.K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If I was to start a new shaman I would put all my points into Stamina.  Mainly because with the luclin expansion you have soo many options for wisdom gear, that by the time you get near 60 you can easily hit 255 wis and be 20 points over the cap etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/cough I'm a very agile and dextorous shaman. I dumped my points into the Tanking stats to avoid getting hit. /shrug it worked through the noob levels. Now, fully buffed with Enchanter buffs I still only hit 170 wis. It's never been a problem that I noticed. Another ten points would let me do what? All the good spells are big mana, I can canni to gate or root if I'm in a jam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">For all you powergamers out there, a friend of mine encouraged me to post this. My 60 shaman on Tholuxe, was the first character I ever created, and I was clueless to the game when I started.  After reading what each stats do, I went for high stamina, hehe i thought more hitpoints would own over all.  My shamans base wis is a hurtful 95, BUT, it doesn't really matter.  I am still lead shaman for my guild and while we aren't the uberest on the server, we are taking down first brood dragons.  <br />

Well, I'll let my magelo speak for itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Personally I've got a base of 100 wis. Not bad for a barb shaman but a fair bit lower than other classes can get or a maxed out iksar can. I definitely beleive hps and resists are more important than wis and mana since regen matters more than total mana pool size yet my gear is nice enough that i've got 221 wis unbuffed and 246 on raids with c3 up and i only see it going up not down.<br />
<br />
Just keep at it and the better your gear gets the less it matters what your wis is cause your just gonna get it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">see,wisdom looked stupid to me,because i just wanted a class that could do melee,and cast :P (shoulda went paladin eh?) i have 104str and stam base..and 85wisdom :P but right now i'm sitting on 211wis 1641hp 855AC unbuffed and +490 in mana,so i'm doing ok i guess,but it takes me about 2-3 cast of cann 3 to even see movement on my mana bar :/</div></div><hr />
