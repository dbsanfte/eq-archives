<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been doing some thinking lately. I was wondering what you all would think of if they made a lesser torpor spell.  I was thinking along the lines of 100-150 mana for about a 4-4.5 healing ratio.  The level would be between 51-55(something between sup heal and chloroblast) Of course the same restrictions for torpor would be included (ie snare and slow)<br />
<br />
Would this spell be too powerful for the shaman class at those levels?  Also I was thinking it would be a boon to us shaman who have yet to get torpor.<br />
<br />
any thoughts idea or suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that would be great if they made that and kept the restrictions on it.  Then remove all the restirctions on torpor to make it worth a damn outside of casting it on yourself and int casters</div></div><hr />
