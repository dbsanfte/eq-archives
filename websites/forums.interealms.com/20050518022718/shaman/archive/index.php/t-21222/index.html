I also wanted too be a healer ... so i picked a Shaman becase as far as the Barbs go .. the Shaman is there healer .. so for me at least .. yes I want too heal . I play a PURE PRIEST class and I feel that healing is at the very core of preists .. I mean wo does the healing for the barbs if not the shamans ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's more a matter of making a difference. Any shaman created during or before Kunark knows exactly what that feeling is... knowing that you personally saved your group's collective arse, knowing that you had a solid impact on a raid. Healing, and to a major extent Canni, were the things that allowed us to test boundaries and be the rocks upon which our enemies were broken. <br />

Nowadays people don't even know you're there unless they don't have Focus before they finish looting their corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you didn't want to be a healer why did you choose a Shaman?? I guess you are one of those shaman who started playing after Yeldema was solo'd by one.<br />
<br />
When I started playing I wanted to play a healer with some other stuff at the side. Shaman appealed to me, and I have never thought of myself of anything but a priest. I wanted to be in the midst of things, crippling my opponents and enhancing my allies.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'm crippling nowadays in GoD is my allies.<br />
<br />
In your words:<br />
If you want a big **** off nuke play a wizard.<br />
If you want a double hard pet play a mage/bl/necro.<br />
<br />
Guess I have the wrong idea about a priest class, but imho a priest should be an effective healer first and foremost.</div></div><hr />

Play a necro then.Wait till people ask for Twitch etc then go on their boards and complain.<br />

Basically by the sounds of your post the only thing you like about a Shaman is slow.Id suggest Beast or Ench for you then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like having enough healing to know that myself and a cleric, or myself and a druid, can keep a group alive through most content.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm with the original poster.  I hate healing.  I do however, love debuffing and buffing, and when mana is left over, damaging the mob.<br />
<br />
I have no problem not being an effective backup healer in GoD.  The problem is, I have nothing else to offer.  I can add 540 hitpoints, and possibly land cripple and one nuke which is at best, 300 hp more than a hybrid melee nuke.  <br />
<br />
In order of preference, what I think the shaman should be able to do is as follows.<br />
<br />
1. Buffing (meaningful non stat related buffs)<br />
2. Debuffing (effective short or long term debuffs)<br />
3. Damage (not too much, but surely we should be able to do more than 1/20 of a mob's life during a short battle)<br />
4. Healing (if the druid or cleric dies, I'd like to think I can heal fast enough to keep someone up for 30 second till the battle is over and the real healers can be rezzed.  Perhaps a bigger, horribly mana inefficient fast heal is in order).<br />
<br />
I should always be able to buff and have it mean something.  With stat gear now, buffs are worthless.  FA is nice, but its so damn tedious to maintain, that I dread hearing melee in my group ask &quot;So, you got FA?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Debuffs.  Well, thats a hard one.  I can understand it being hard to tweak encounters where a mob is either hitting 100%, or hitting 25% of the time.  To make an encounter tough when its 75% slowed, would mean that at full speed, the mob would chew thru tanks like mad.  But, to be honest, thats SOE's fault for no seeing that. You can't devise an entire class around the power to slow, then take it away in GoD and on many boss mobs, and expect everyone to feel ok about that.<br />
<br />
If I were developing EQ way back at the beginning, and knew what I know now, I would have never allowed the concept of slowing a mob into the game.  Debuffs that maybe take 10-20% of a mobs power away, sure.  But 75%... The extreme to which SOE made slow such a vital part of EQ has come back to bite us all when they make mobs immune to it.  You can also say the same about battle duration.  DoTs for damage, and long cast times on Malos, in order to land slow, are not working well in GoD, as many of you know.<br />
<br />
The problem with debuffs is, there isn't an easy answer.  If you give us more damage, more healing, and more buffs to makeup for lack of slow, we take that increased power back to content not designed for it.  We'd have shaman balanced in GoD, but overpowered in any older content that is slowable and long duration.<br />
<br />
Really, the shaman class needs a complete overhaul.  Or GoD does.  We either need a completely different role that works in the old and new content, or the new content needs to keep in line with the old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you didn't want to be a healer you shouldn't have rolled a priest class.  Really.<br />
<br />
The original &quot;vision&quot; for Shaman was that we could be an effective PRIMARY healer by landing Slow on mobs and using our heals against far less incoming damage.  Like it or not, that is what a Shaman was designed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't want to be a MAIN healer but I don't mind being a backup healer. It's nice to be able to heal in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont mind being healer at all, we are a priest class after all and because of my heal (way back when Sol B and Guk were the only places to make lvl 50) all the clerics were playing in sol b, so I got many groups in Guk as main healer.  Today, if I want to do something, I can heal an LDoN or PoP. It may not be the best exp, the best gear, but it keeps me busy and I don't have to sit around with my thumb in my  (_l_) waiting for another priest.  Just wish I could be more effective in the new stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seriously, if you didn't want to heal you should have rolled an enchie, can debuff almost all the same junk and get bigger nukes/better pets.  Who rolls a priest, then decides that they don't want to keep people alive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For me healing is interesting for abou 1029 min. I mean if high damage situations, you can make a game of it and challange yourself to keep up, but in like LDoN, its a snooze fest and i understand why clerics got the name for the most cybering class in EQ. There is nothing else to do !<br />
<br />
Im like web surfing and **** when im a MH. its so boring and trivial in most normal cases that you dont even need to pay attention.<br />
<br />
However, secondary healing in intense situations is fun. Getting off the quck hea to save someone just long enoughf or the cleric to hit them is a blast, but this is ofcourse in a good group. Truly i like to slow things and then get summoned from DoT aggro and tank for a sec, but in all honestly, as much as i hate to admit it, we cant anymore. <br />
<br />
I mean my favorite thing was crawling through VT and getting summoned, tossing a Q on myself and surving.l  In GoD or high end PoP, if you get summoned and your cleric isnt a god among clerics and watching you well, your dead. Trying to channel Tnarg much less Q through a 1k+ double/quading mob is more suicidal then fun.<br />
<br />
But yea, healing, atleast beng a main healer is very boring nad i pretty much have to get suckered into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't mind healing that much. Had a normal ldon pickup after the raid, clueless druid said he'd only join to heal 'if the shammy slows' - I'm like *** else am I here for, cha buffs? <br />
<br />
Well, I tagged early a couple of times (oops), but between my haste and FA on the rogue, ranger, monk, pally and alphadog, healing, VP, dogpack and offtanking (not to mention slowing), I kept the group alive and going through some tough spots. Hardly a dull moment!<br />
<br />
Oh, the druid did die once. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One of the biggest problems with this game's direction can be demonstrated by using the Shaman class as an example. Its no longer enough to be able to do &quot;lots of things kinda decent&quot;. You have to EXCEL at one area, period, and it cant be someone trivialized by the increased pace of the game like DOTS or slow. Those utilities have been made relatively obsolete except in specialized situations (although slow argueably has value at the high end still, just not as MUCH).<br />
<br />
Now we need to &quot;pick&quot; something. Well, Shaman dont do &quot;something&quot; we do &quot;LOTS and LOTS&quot; of things. Thus, we end up with what we are seeing on these boards. Various shaman asking for more specialization in the area of our utility THEY find the most fun from the &quot;list&quot; of things we have always done &quot;halfway decent&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Low to moderate heals and cures.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The game is completely different now.  The only abilities that matter are tanking,  cc/pulling, fast damage dealing and fast healing.  They aren't going to make us tanks or reliable cc/pullers.

One of the main reasons I chose to play a shaman was to have the ability to effectively heal my group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I dont want to heal either. In fact I gave up my cleric (level 58) and druid (level 60) to play my shaman specifically because he isn't expected to be a main healer usually, and I've been loving it. <br />
<br />
And now here we have lots on the board asking for better heals. I haven't expressed my views because I didn't want the wrath of 500 forum members on me. :)  <br />
<br />
But I agree Scurvey, it's not much fun to be a main healer and that was one of the best things about the Shaman role.<br />
<br />
Faern, that sounds nice, but it doesn't work like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The thing is allot of people have rolled shamans cause they are not expected to heal. Me personaly I hate healing without a rez because i have a short attention span. If I get bored sometimes I day dream look away from the screen and bam dead tank or chanter or something. Happens alot to me I hate it :) being responsible if someone dies and not being able to rez them is a bad feeling.<br />
<br />
Telling them they should roll another class isnt the answer either. Thats like telling all the people who are currently unhappy with their shaman here to reroll. It just doest work like that.<br />
<br />
Im learning with my beastlord at 58 that the grind to 65 and trying to catch up to my guild with flags and junk is just a total pain and I can sympathise with people who dont want to change and stick it out with the class they are playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually it DOES work like that.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a damage dealer with some buffing, you should roll a BL.  You know, the melee hybrid?<br />
<br />
If you want to be a priest class, expect to heal.  Why is this hard to understand?<br />
<br />
I will happily grant that Shaman are absolutely THE most difficult of the priests to balance.  Our heals WERE formerly balanced around all the other things we did.  With our buffs, slow and debuffs the heals we had were in fact sufficient for us to be main healers.  It was a very difficult balance, and that balance is now gone.<br />
<br />
All we want is to have the ability to contribute.  Right now, we don't have that.  We have NOTHING that is needed or even meaningful in high end content.  Stat buffs are meaningless.  Debuffs are trivial.  Slow is now trivial.<br />
<br />
The most likely avenue for us to be balanced is via healing.  Sure, we'd love some buffs that people seek out actively.  Man, its an ugly scene in PoK when Temp/Virt and KEI are unavailable.  I'd like some buff that is of similar value.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a &quot;required&quot; class . . . however, when I join a group, it would sure feel good to see someone say &quot;Thank god, a Shaman.  Our job just got a lot easier&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am very happy RIGHT NOW.<br />
<br />
As a L61 Shaman I am at the height of my powers in the current environment.  I *do* get that &quot;thank god a shaman&quot; response quite often in groups.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to do is get behind the folks who are far enough ahead of me to see the problems.  No, I have not experience all of those problems.  I have BEGUN to see them.  I see where it is headed and I want to support those seeking to get them fixed BEFORE I get there and need those fixes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Your opinion is duly noted and ignored.  Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think there are other venues than healing upgrades in fixing the current shaman woes.<br />
<br />
Indirect damage prevention/mitigation via buffs, debuffs and curses is what I envisioned as shamanly duties when I signed up new to EQ. And having wodes. Can't go wrong with those.<br />
<br />
As for Priest being equivalent to healing, I disagree. To me priest has always meant a spiritual/holy person. That does not necessiate healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Once again, throughout the game, Shaman have always had the ABILITY to heal equal to, or at least nearly equal to, the damage our party was receiving.<br />
<br />
It was balanced around their buffs, debuffs and slow.  It is no longer balanced, we cannot heal anywhere NEAR the amount of damage our party is receiving.<br />
<br />
All that people want is to have that balance returned.  Buffs and debuffs probably will not return that balance.  Slow, well, we all know what's up with Slow.  That doesn't leave Shaman a lot of options now does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't see why a buff/debuff combo could not provide the same effect as healing. <br />

It's a moot point now though. The shaman community wanted healing looked at, and I'll stand by that even if it won't help me an inch in my playstyle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If the shamans that dislike healing should reroll as melee classes. Then the shamans who want to be healers should reroll as a cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is because verant already said they don't want it to. Slow already is that debuff and verant has come down and said sorry it's to powerful and we want slow mitigation and immunity. If they wanted us to be able to decrease the damage a mob does they would just let us slow the stupid things. There's no reason to add new debuffs, or buffs or dance a jig to get the same result as a spell we already have that they are intentionally decreasing the effectiveness of. It just won't happen. Especially when alot of the purposed alternatives are infact better than slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a healing class. If you don't want to heal well I'm sorry you picked the wrong class. It's like a mage saying I don't wanna nuke i just wanna play with my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">A couple of points:<br />
<br />
1. I started playing just after Kunark came out, why?  Because it was generally agreed that SHamans could kick it quite like no other class, and could pull off some pretty incredible stuff grouped or Solo.  I certainly don't remember a single person saying, &quot;Hey you should be a Shaman, they give good heals!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
DO some of you honestly mean to tell me, that you roled a shaman to heal???<br />
<br />
2. I don't want to re-roll, I want to feel the same joy playing a Shaman I used to.  I certainly don't want to justify my existence because I can be a back up healer.  I'm under absolutely no illusions, I don't think shaman will ever be looked upon with the same awe and reverence that they used to be, thanks to so called 'class balence'.  But like I said, just stating my opinion, maybe it's a selfish one, but hey, bite me.<br />
<br />
3. My main concern, is that healing seems to be one of the things most people seem to feel shaman need.  And I'm sure they do, but as a means to making them &quot;back ups&quot;.  I can remember when Shaman used to be looked upon as the priest class that could kick a$$.  I don't hate healing especially, it's just not what shamans were about when I signed up.<br />
<br />
I think in my priotiy list, healing comes about 4th in my list of things to care about for shaman.  After Debuffing, Buffing, and opening cans of whoop a$$.<br />

OK, I think I've pretty much made the same point in four different ways, but maybe that's clarified things.  Or maybe just clouded things.  Thank you to the trolls, you make any thread so much more enjoyable with your rapier like wit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A couple of points:<br />
<br />
1. I started playing just after Kunark came out, why?  Because it was generally agreed that SHamans could kick it quite like no other class, and could pull off some pretty incredible stuff grouped or Solo.  I certainly don't remember a single person saying, &quot;Hey you should be a Shaman, they give good heals!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
DO some of you honestly mean to tell me, that you roled a shaman to heal???<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you nailed that one. That's exactly the problem. People who started playing before kunark remember that shaman were supposed to be healers first and foremost.<br />
<br />
I could main-heal in any group back then. <br />
<br />
All 3 priest classes could function as primary healer.<br />
Clerics: Superior healing + Complete healing mostly<br />
Druids: Greater healing + Chloroplast (regen) + Shield of Thorns (DS)<br />
Shaman: Greater healing + Chloroplast + Incapacitate + Torgor's Insect<br />
<br />
We all had different tools, but we all could get the job done.<br />
<br />
With slow/regen/heals I was just as good a primary healer as clerics were (just lacked rez), but I guess if you didn't start with the original game you might have a different view of what a shaman is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I started shaman in the Kunark era, mid 2000 after being grouped with a troll shaman in The Overthere who was a nice guy, and a very able healer. He kept a full mid 30s group with several melees buffed and healed and was cheerful throughout. At that point, I hadn't even heard how kickass or not shamans were in the high levels.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I started a shaman to buff and heal.</div></div><hr />

No one said we arent healers, we are talking about MAIN healing. Well i am anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read this, taken from the SoE site.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now according to this quote taken directly from the game makers site, we are a Buff/Debuff class with healing added as a side note. Main healing is not in the classes design and hasnt been since day one. Anyone that didnt get PL through 30-55 or was around before PoP and SoL should know this i feel. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a quote from the healing class in EQ<br />
<br />
Clerics gain powerful healing and enhancement spells, greatly increasing the health and defenses of their group, while keeping them healed in the most dangerous battles. While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<br />
<br />
Kinda to the point as to how they are designed as a main healer.<br />
<br />
Lets take a look at druid too.<br />
<br />
Druidic magic takes many forms, allowing the druid to fill a wide variety of roles when in a group or adventuring alone. Druids possess excellent healing abilities, powerful mana and health regenerative spells, and valuable enhancements that improve the health and armor of their group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again a strong and direct description on how well they hell, not a side note a clear definition.<br />
<br />
I think you are caught up in the shaman's vast skill set. Shaman, with the right skill from the player, can be played more then 1 way and in doing that a alternative way of playing can be found and enjoyed and desired, then the way YOU like to play your shaman, which is that of a clerical replacement.<br />
<br />
I might be wrong in your eyes, but your wrong in mine as well as others on this forum when pertaining to how a shaman should be played or how someone can enjoy their shaman. Dont be so one dimensional when talking about the most versitile class in EQ.</div></div><hr />

       No way ,that just YOUR vision of shaman class. And first don't post any SoE definition ,they don't know anything about their game ,and you can also post other class definition ,you'll see if they're adapted to the reality . They are ? NO ! So why you post it for shaman ?<br />

      When do you have begining your shaman ? It's important... How do you have level him ? I really wonder , how you have be able to miss your main healer job , yeah really.<br />

This simply isnt true. While Shamans could function adequately as Main Healers through a lot of content, there were a LOT of places they couldnt. You think a SHaman was going to be MAIN healer in Fungi King rrom, or Crypt in OS during Kunark? Shaman as only healer enough to farm Ice House-Bank area in Kael during Velious?You think a Shaman could handle the powerful hits of some of the Luclin one-group camps in places like Umbral and others during Luclin?<br />
<br />
Sure, shaman could heal XP groups in OT or KC. Wee. But even WITH Torpor, a shaman would be hard pressed to be only healer in the REALLY heavy camps. As new expansions brought new spells and abilities, we got better, on the TRIVIAL OLDER CONTENT, not the newest stuff.<br />
<br />
I created my Shaman for UTILITY. Whatever the group needed, there was a good chance I could supply it. Slows, Heals, Buffs, the ability to off-tank and off-root, the list goes on. <br />
<br />
I DAMN sure didnt create my Shaman with Healing as his PRIMARY, or even 2nd best consideration. Buffs, Debuffs, then heals. Even on raids during the expansion eras pre-PoP, Shamans were rarely relied upon to be a groups main healer, unless it was the group of casters standing 50 feet from the mob. <br />
<br />
Litguv is 100% correct. Nobody has any right to tell me why I created my shaman or what his &quot;primary&quot; role should be now that slow has been so trivialized. I basicaly want the same role I have always had. Solid contributions to a group with any number of my abilities, be it buffs, debuffs, heals, damage, whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HOTs are USELESS in fast fights with mobs that do huge amounts of damage. Why are you asking for something useless? <br />
<br />
Put me in the camp of &quot;started a shaman to heal.&quot; I created a shaman and a cleric the same day, played them both to 20 and then made the decision to continue with the shaman. I had a regular group and was the only healer in my group until around level 50 when mob damage started to outstrip my ability to heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't true.<br />
<br />
Back in Kunark or Luclin the only reason to bring a Cleric for those camps were safety(Clerics were better healers of course) and resurrection, which back then was still part of a balance vision. <br />
Today, Clerics aren't balanced around the ability &quot;resurrection&quot; and people tend to forget that. <br />
Shamans were perfectly fine healers for the damage output they had to face. The risk of bringing a Shaman or Druid was the inability to resurrect any people who might have died during the session. Today, resurrection or not, Shamans can't heal the damage dealth to their tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I stated Tormac as a healer for my group of friends when the game released.<br />
<br />
I enjoy debuffing, but debuffing had nothing to do with my playing a shaman.  It used to not be an important role for the shaman at all.<br />
I like doting and root parking, or agro kiting.  One of the biggest joys in the game was watching an early “uber” shaman (back when getting your last name was a landmark) and figuring out how to kite mammoths from watching him.<br />
I like healing, keeping folks alive (although now when my heals barely make the hp bars move it has less satisfaction).<br />
I hate buffing with a passion.  It is either bot work, or the stress of hearing the dps classes shout repeatedly that haste is down, while I’m in the middle of healing the main tank because our cleric just bought it, and things are going south, and I used ToA to haste the group in the first place and its obvious that its obvious that haste is down. <br />
<br />
Those are just my opinions of what is fun and what is not.  None of it is the only way of course, but just what I enjoy and do not enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Problem is verant has said we can't have that roll. Slowing IS something sony isn't going to change thier minds on. We will not get the ability to substantially slow major mobs. We also won't get the ability to decrease the mobs dps indirectly by anything close to the same amount. Like it or not sony does have the right to tell you how you can play your shaman and if you don't like it all you can do is quit thier game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel thats incorrect Gloriana. HoT are very effective as a support heal. By laying Q/BoT on the tank while he is taking hits you are grealty reducing the mana your cleric will use to heal him. I feel your statement is only valid from the main healer point of view, which i dont think shaman are designed for. The only time in my life i was frequently the main healer was lower levels 30-40, but alot of the time either a druid would heal or a cleric, i was the slow and haster ( buff and debuff) and that was where my mana was best spent. Even in KC and DL my heals werent enough to really hold the group up and keep going, even with Can2/3. <br />
<br />
Now knowing that your a clerical shaman it sheds light on alot of view points you have and validates them. I can see why you want better healing so much now. I dont pretend to be the end all knowledge for how a shaman should be played, but i do have my belief in what a shaman should be which does not include a primary role as a main healer. <br />
<br />
The shaman i have always enjoyed, is a debuffer and buffer with good healing added to the mix. Like i said, i find main healing to be a snooze fest, but i certainly want to be effective enough to do the job for a while if the cleric falls down so we can all live.  I do not want big bomb direct heals, i want quick heals and HoT's to lay on the rest of the group. I want a group Quiescence. I want strikethrough put on focus with a +20 attack and cleave put on our Feral avatar with a extended duration of 20 min or so. Make me what i feel we were made to be and what we once were. Desired for our buffs/debuffs. <br />
<br />
This is the shaman i rolled and wanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right or wrong thats how i feel. Simply put we play 2 styles of shaman and desire 2 different paths for our class and nothing can smooth that out so we will be in disagreement. But i certainly respect your path as a more clerical shaman, infact it only shows me and everyone else why i love my shaman. We are versitile enough to allow 2 worlds in 1 class.<br />
<br />
There will never be a better class in EQ cause of this fact for me personaly. Period.</div></div><hr />

  Fact remains that those shaman who impressed you so much with their skill that you decided shaman was a powerhouse did so because they ARE HEALERS!<br />
<br />
  Do you think we could have been nearly as powerful without Torpor?  That is a HEAL, and is primarily responsible for our having once been a powerhouse.  300 a tick MEANT SOMETHING back then.  If it was upgraded to something around 1k or 1.5k a tick nowadays (and DD heal to compare with druid version) then we would again be a powerhouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
  You may think that slow is just absolutely almighty, but it is slow + healing + minor tanking that makes shaman powerful.  We ARE the holy trinity wrapped into a single package.  At least, we USED TO BE.  Nowadays being equivalent to a warrior+cleric+slow of roughly 5 levels under yourself just doesn't cut the mustard in content.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, just wanted to say.  If shaman wasn't a healer, we never could have pulled off half of what we have accomplished.  Nowadays, we are not a healer anymore, and look how little we are adding to our list of accomplishments.</div></div><hr />

I dindt have large exposure to shaman early in my EQ career. My group of friends came over and started in G Fay. Couple dorfs (WAR and ROG), couple HIEs (PAL and CLE), a gnome (WIZ) and a wood elf (BRD). I became impressed with shaman after meeting a few in Guk. Same with Enchanters, but since I am just not a pure-caster kind of guy, Shaman was it. HOWEVER, it wasnt based SOLELY on the ability to heal. On the contrary, I was FAR more impressed with the overall utility of the class. Buffs, debuffs, heals, damage. And, to be perfectly honest, the ability to solo played a large role in my decision. <br />
<br />
Nowadays, we are not a healer anymore, and look how little we are adding to our list of accomplishments.<br />
<br />
You know, the last time I checked, I still had pretty decent healing spells for ALL but the very very upper end of this game. I can heal extremely well in much of the content this game has to offer. I LIKE being the back-up healer, and primary debuffer in LDoN hard and Mid-level Gates. <br />
<br />
So stop insulting my ability to heal. Is is adequate to be primary healer in the high-end Gates trials? Not even close, and that DOES suck to a degree. Is it adequate to be back-up healer in those zones? I certainly think so, but we lack enough other utility to make us the &quot;best&quot; choice for that role. <br />
<br />
I dont want to pick ONE SINGLE THING and have that become the PRIMARY focus of my character. Sorry. If that means I wont be able to see Uqua with my Shaman then so be it. Seen quite a bit of EQ already, ya know.</div></div><hr />

I disagree man, by a LONG LONG shot. Sorry, but by the end of Kunark, I am willing to bet that LESS than 1% of shamans had Torpor. Even WITH Torpor, a Shaman would be EXTREMELY hard pressed to keep a group alive in the Crypt or Fungi King camp in OS during Kunark. It just WASNT an option. Even into Velious, with Turtle and Arena gear, Shaman were NOT anywhere near the &quot;best&quot; or even 2nd-best choice for the role of &quot;group healer&quot; in these areas.</div></div><hr />

Well put.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone will argue that we all knew we can heal when we made our shaman, but think its inaccurate to assume we all though we would be MAIN healers through out the game. <br />
<br />
The answer is simple for high end content. Keep us as a back up healer and buffer debuffer, but tweak out buffs and debuffs to be more uselfull. Hence my strike through to focus and cleave ( or something ) to FA. Tweak us out so we are effective helpers in that role for that content.</div></div><hr />

I played the main healer for those camps and I rememer wanting a cleric because there was no chance in hell a character coulda have gotten down there or stayed with the group without a rezz.<br />
<br />
Saying that a Shaman could not be main healer because Torpor was so rare is no argument. Torpor was obtainable in Kunark, so you have to account for it when considering a class. <br />
I healed against the Fungus King fine and that was one of the hardest mobs back then due to no slow(unless you were really lucky you couldn't slow him).<br />
<br />
I was &quot;uber&quot;(gear wise) already back then, but given that the gap between ubers and casual was no where as big as it is today and the fact that I can't be main healer for content today, no matter how &quot;uber&quot; I am, trivializes that point.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone recall trying to heal a group of 50's in KC before you had Sup Healing?  Greater healing to keep up with tanks was the absolute suck.  I wouldn't even join a group that didn't have a cleric because I knew I sucked at healing and didn't want to be the main healer.  And I shouldn't be the main healer.<br />
<br />
Can we do it somewhat today in low PoP, LDON, and non-GoD content?  Sure... but this shaman still doesn't WANT to, that's for sure.  I hate healing and only do it when I absolutely must.<br />
<br />
I too, never understood the big push for heals on these boards but was reluctant to say anything.  I'm certainly not united on that front.  Debuffs, useful stat buffs, and better dps is what I'd like to see.<br />

No how ... no way ... did I ever think Lori would be relegated to healer in a hard LDoN.  Did it once.  Won't do it again.  And thank the lords for aa's and crit healing or that would have been one very short adv.<br />
<br />
I am probably only one of a handful of shaman on Mith Marr that is known to not like to heal.  So be it.  It is how I choose to hunt.  And until the day Lori ceases to be,  it is the way I will continue to hunt.<br />

Sorry, but by the end of Kunark, I am willing to bet that LESS than 1% of shamans had Torpor. Even WITH Torpor, a Shaman would be EXTREMELY hard pressed to keep a group alive in the Crypt or Fungi King camp in OS during Kunark. It just WASNT an option. Even into Velious, with Turtle and Arena gear, Shaman were NOT anywhere near the &quot;best&quot; or even 2nd-best choice for the role of &quot;group healer&quot; in these areas. <br />
<br />
       And ? Every one in the group was hard pressed in those camp ! Not only the shaman ,but everyone . Same thing go for cleric and druid . they were not easy camp . <br />
<br />
Hell in fact you have mentioned just the hardest single group camp of kurnak.Can you base your arguments on a SINGLE UNIQUE camp of an expansion ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone recall trying to heal a group of 50's in KC before you had Sup Healing? Greater healing to keep up with tanks was the absolute suck. I wouldn't even join a group that didn't have a cleric because I knew I sucked at healing and didn't want to be the main healer. And I shouldn't be the main healer.<br />
<br />
 <br />
     <br />
          Yeah i recall ,i was main healer ,half of time. It was easy? No. But only because i had to slow+ heal ,when cleric only heal .With another slower ,healing was easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">You have heal spells. You have always had heal spells. At one time slow was the best heal in the game. Play another class if you don't want to use this one to it's potential. Yes, that means healing sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Saying that a Shaman could not be main healer because Torpor was so rare is no argument. Torpor was obtainable in Kunark, so you have to account for it when considering a class. <br />
I healed against the Fungus King fine and that was one of the hardest mobs back then due to no slow(unless you were really lucky you couldn't slow him).<br />
<br />
<br />
What made torpor suck for main healing wasnt that it was so rare, it was the negitive effect, the slowed attack and the snare. I think if anything the design of this spell should give a hint to how effect we are meant to be at main healing.<br />
<br />
Frankly though, i think EQ is broke to the point of never coming back, not so much that thigns cant be fixed, but the corprate machine which is SoE in this case, will never move fast enough or boldly enough and most of the population will move to WoW or something else before we as shaman get fixed or the game itself gets fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, isnt that exactly why we are whining so much about healing in Gates? Don't try to tell me the new heal spells are inadequate for pre-Gates content. Shaman can easily heal in LDoN Hard now, with both new spells. Raid heals are also more valuable. However, we are basing this WHOLE healing &quot;whine&quot; on a couple &quot;camps&quot; in Gates, namely, Vxed, Ikky and Tipt trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">One of the biggest problems with this game's direction can be demonstrated by using the Shaman class as an example. Its no longer enough to be able to do &quot;lots of things kinda decent&quot;. You have to EXCEL at one area, period, and it cant be someone trivialized by the increased pace of the game like DOTS or slow. Those utilities have been made relatively obsolete except in specialized situations (although slow argueably has value at the high end still, just not as MUCH).<br />
<br />
Now we need to &quot;pick&quot; something. Well, Shaman dont do &quot;something&quot; we do &quot;LOTS and LOTS&quot; of things. Thus, we end up with what we are seeing on these boards. Various shaman asking for more specialization in the area of our utility THEY find the most fun from the &quot;list&quot; of things we have always done &quot;halfway decent&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
I completely agree with the above.  And what I feel is, Shaman should not need to excel at healing to be considered useful.  <br />

<br />
Your looking at this in extreme measures i think Gloriana. You are thinking that some of us pretty much delete our heal spells and if someone needs a heal that a cleric cant get to, they are dead cause its more mana efficent to rez them anyway. This is not the case, it has nothing to do with no using your tools. I think its more like, which tools do you like to use the most is all. I mean if you see the ranger being a retard and taking rips and his life is going down while the cleric is franticly trying to keep the tank up, damn right im going to lay some Q and quick heals on him. Im going to support the cleric in healing... also tell the ranger to stop being stupid ;)<br />
<br />
Its not a question of not wanting to heal at all, infact i rather enjoy those moments like above, or when the cleric gets aggro im quick heal him to save him and the group, thats fun. Im talking about sitting on your horse behind everyone practicly wearing a white robe with a water sprinkler firing off heals and Q's between Can5/Can4. Main healing is what we, or atleast i am talking about.</div></div><hr />

That's hilarious.<br />
<br />
Whether Torpor had negative side effects or not doesn't matter when we are comparing &quot;healing&quot; a tank. The whole &quot;main tank&quot; idea was born in Velious and back in Kunark healing wasn't needed like it is today. In an exp group everyone was getting hit. <br />
<br />
Healers were not constantly healing like they are today. The game was a lot slower and a single mob could never kill a group. Wipes happened due to multiple mobs hitting multiple people or due to people going oom when the puller pulled too fast or too many.<br />
<br />
Saying that a Shaman was insufficient against a single mob is plain wrong and while everyone back then pretty much acknowledged Clerics as the BEST healer(resurrection is good), Shamans and Druids were viable healers without being the first choice.<br />
<br />
If Clerics had Holy Light and Shamans and Druids Supernal Light, people would still want Clerics for the Ikkinz trials today and that's how it was back then pretty much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">We used to be perfectly adequate PRIMARY healers in EQ.  At one point in the game, you didn't need but one healer to keep a group alive and you could confidently choose a cleric, a druid, OR a shaman to be your sole healer and feel confident that if they were played to equal confidence, your group would have an equal chance to stay alive.  I don't know how many days /played I had in Guk or Sebelis or Velks in which I was the only healer in the group.  Before I could get slow to stick, I was half the healer a cleric was.  After I got it to stick, I was twice the healer they were.  It was more risky depending on a shaman to heal the group than a cleric, but with the immense mana regeneration of a shaman and the relative efficiency of slows over healing, you could pull mobs more quickly than if you were depending on a cleric.  It was balanced.<br />
<br />
I hate what this game has become - that to do much of anything these days you absolutely have to have a cleric because no one else has the ability to heal the damage that the mobs (slowed or unslowed) can dish out.  Because of focus items, clarity, flowing thought, horses, etc, efficiency is no longer much of an issue and a cleric is now almost the ONLY healer in the game that means anything.  I see that as a sign of horrible class imbalance when a specific class is REQUIRED for most challenging content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Not always, ofcourse not, but many many times there was a druid or a cleric, its not difficult to find a druid or cleric to heal while you debuff and buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The main tank was born in velious? Since the begining of time much less EQ you have people that take hits and people that heal them. The person taking the hits is the &quot;main tank&quot;. Back then it was a knight, warrior, monk or ranger in most &quot;normal&quot; situations. These are the classes equiped with tools to hold aggro or the HP and defense to do it correctly. Torpor being used to heal this main person taking aggro was a issue. It slowed their DPS as well as the added DPS classes and you cant pull till its done with its healing ticks cause of the snare, unless you want to not be fully healed. Frankly i always thought Torpor was more for us as a tool for mana regen then it was for healing in battle.<br />
<br />
Was it impossible? Ofcourse it wasnt, it was very possible, but the point im trying to make is that the design of the spell alone should let you know the level of main healing we were expected to do.<br />
<br />
I understand your woes of GoD and i agree 100%. But do you think we should be the main healer in GoD i guess is my question.<br />
<br />
Personaly i feel that giving druids their healing bonus has alieviated the stress on the need to find a cleric to do anything ( outside of GoD ) if anything i would like to see druids become better healers while we take on a stronger buff debuff role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I honestly think that if you rolled a shaman to be a &quot;main healer&quot; and you started back in the Kunark days, you are seriously on dope.<br />
I did. I did not want a cleric because there were so many of them around and the shaman appealed to me. It worked fine too. I remember paladins and even rangers being healers back then (preKunark). Shaman certainly had no problem being primary healers.<br />
<br />

I did, and it worked out ok. I was casting nonstop though and cannidancing like mad. The main problem was not me being unable to heal, it was my fingers going numb after a while. It worked a lot better when I did not have to slow on top of it.<br />
<br />
Can we do it somewhat today in low PoP, LDON, and non-GoD content?  Sure... but this shaman still doesn't WANT to, that's for sure.  I hate healing and only do it when I absolutely must.<br />
And I absolutely detest casting Spirit of Wolf. I try to make people seek out nearby rangers or druids whenever possible. But I do not want this class to loose the ability to cast the spell because I do not like it.<br />
<br />
I too, never understood the big push for heals on these boards but was reluctant to say anything.  I'm certainly not united on that front.  Debuffs, useful stat buffs, and better dps is what I'd like to see.<br />
Well, there is two reasons I can see.<br />
- We have always been a healer class.<br />
- Debuffs are worthless when fights get shorter every expansion. Dots are already useless. Why get improvements in abilities that are being phased out?<br />
<br />
I disagree man, by a LONG LONG shot. Sorry, but by the end of Kunark, I am willing to bet that LESS than 1% of shamans had Torpor. Even WITH Torpor, a Shaman would be EXTREMELY hard pressed to keep a group alive in the Crypt or Fungi King camp in OS during Kunark.<br />
Yep, it would be hard - just as hard as it would be for a cleric. The shaman's problem used to be big pulls, the cleric's problem was keeping up with respawns. But in both cases the problem never was keeping up with a single MOBs damage output, not even one of the nameds.<br />
<br />
It just WASNT an option.<br />
It is good that I learn this now then. I might never have done it if I knew back then it was impossible. :D <br />
<br />
Even into Velious, with Turtle and Arena gear, Shaman were NOT anywhere near the &quot;best&quot; or even 2nd-best choice for the role of &quot;group healer&quot; in these areas.<br />
This simply not true. First spot is arguable - clerics were better for a given fight and hugely better when group heals were needed. Shaman far outdid everyone in the longterm department. But &quot;not anywhere near second best&quot; is far from it. Who else would be in the second spot? Druids, with lesser heals and lesser mana regeneration and no slow?<br />
<br />
This is hilarious.<br />
Man, the Naggy and Vox raids I was on in Dec of 1999 had Chain healing.   I still have screenshots of it.  <br />
I must have missed the single group preKunark Vox kills then. :rolleyes: What part of &quot;shaman used to be fine for being a primary healder in groups&quot; is too hard to grasp? Raids and experience groups are somewhat different.<br />
<br />
Back then without a certain amount of clerics the raid would not even happen.<br />
Which is different from today how? Oh, right - today you need even more clerics and a warrior or three.<br />
<br />
Now adays even druids are getting into chain healing.  Enchanters are sometimes chain run-ing.  The game is way better off then it was then.<br />
Again, this is different from preKunark how?<br />

Consider me impressed. It usually takes people at least half a dozen posts in a thread before they start contradicting themselves.<br />
<br />
Edit: Whoa, I only realized after posting how scattered this looks. let me sum up:<br />
PreKunark and up through Luclin shaman really did just fine being primary healer in experience groups, given a full spellbook. I was primary healer in Lower Guk in my forties, I was primary healer in Sebilis in my fifties, I was primary healer in Velketor's Lab and I was primary healer in Maiden's Eye. It worked out just fine. I did have trouble keeping up with haste and slow and regen and healing. But just being the healer was never an issue.</div></div><hr />

However, we are basing this WHOLE healing &quot;whine&quot; on a couple &quot;camps&quot; in Gates, namely, Vxed, Ikky and Tipt trials.<br />
Straight up, it's not just in Gates and it's not just for raid shaman. You can't be serious about main healing in a hard LDoN as a shaman, unless you have a PoTime+ 11k hps, 2k+ AC tank w/ maxed AA and the shaman is geared the same.  A 1550 fast heal (assuming you have it, which is a huge assumption)?  On a sub-7k tank eating double 990's + ripostes?  What if you get an add or the cc gets aggro?  Drop the &quot;l33t&quot; strats on me so I can figure out how to play my shaman better and can skip PLing my cleric.<br />
<br />
I just shook my head when my L58 cleric was dropping just shy of 2k fast heals on my sk while my L65 shaman maxes out w/ tnargs in the low 1500's (both have imp healing focus, neither has any significant healing aa's).  If you only have 1 solid role, you may as do it well.<br />

I have kept a 6.5k hp bazaar tank alive on 2 ldon hard mobs (1 slowed, 1 unslowed) by chaining supernal light using a friend's cleric.  I'd love to watch a shaman do the same.</div></div><hr />

It used to be that CH was only really used as a downtime spell before Kunark.  Frankly, before Kunark it was a rather inefficient spell.  The typical caster probably had less than 1200 hps in most experience groups and even tanks probably only 2500 hps if they were well equipped.  A little to damage to a caster was easier and faster to heal with Torpor at a fraction of the downtime.  Damage to a tank could be blast healed away and Torpor applied after the fight to heal them to full while the int casters medded up and we cannibalized to be ready for the next pull.<br />

It's only after the EQ expansions and the level increases followed by the inflation of HPs on gear that made CH an efficient spell.</div></div><hr />

I do not have either spell. However, if I had both new heals, I am quite sure I could effectively be the main healer in LDoN hard, with other people my &quot;gear/skill level&quot;, that being some EP, some VT, some LDoN geared. It would probably require a couple key slots in the group be filled by other classes, thats true (chanter debuffing and slowing, for example).<br />
<br />
I did an LDoN hard run as the only healer. It was with Time geared people. BRD MNK WIZ SHD ENC and me. It was hard. I died once, and we had to evac, drag my corpse, etc, but we still won it. Basically I dropped Q on the SK before the mob got there (all single pulls with the BRD pulling) and chain-casted Tnargs. Once the chanter got slow in, I could MAYBE drop a Bane on it, but that was about it. With the new spells, it would have been gravy, thats for sure. Even with just EP level players instead of Time.<br />
<br />
Is Marrs Gift that much bigger than IH4? My tnargs maxxes out in the 1800s, not 1500s. If your gonna be a MAIN healer, you better damn well have the healing AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I don't want to heal either, at least not any more than I did back in kunark, etc.  I really don't understand the folks that want the big or fast heals.  It doesn't make any sense.  Yes, I started playing a shaman because they can heal, but I never wanted to be a &quot;healer&quot;, so to speak.  I wanted slow, dots, cripple, heal, and buffs in that order.  All the shaman that want these new heals should be the ones rerolling.  In my opinion, ya'll are sell-outs.  If SOE is gonna do that, fine; but they had better give me a rez, too, so I can be a half-arse cleric instead of a wannabe.<br />
<br />
Because of time constraints, I won't ever see elemental planes or these Gates trials; but, I do get involved in the Hard LDoN occassionaly and feel pretty useless.<br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to slow immune/mitagating mobs either.  If I had a useful cripple spell and some buffs that actually did something, I'd be perfectly happy with those encounters as long as they didn't become status quo.<br />
<br />
As for Gates, it's pretty sad when five people become the supporting role for a chanter's pet, IMO.  As for CH, it's always been too powerful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I do not have either spell.<br />
Forgive my ignorance, but what spell other than the 1550 fast heal out of Gates are you referring to?<br />
<br />
<br />
 However, if I had both new heals, I am quite sure I could effectively be the main healer in LDoN hard, with other people my &quot;gear/skill level&quot;, that being some EP, some VT, some LDoN geared.<br />
<br />
I would humbly submit to you that their gear (particularly the tank's) would have more to do with you being able to heal than a 1550 fast heal that is the worst of the 3 priest classes by a large margin.<br />
<br />
Is Marrs Gift that much bigger than IH4?<br />
No idea what Marr's Gift is, but IH4 is 20% so it averages 10.5% which on a Tnargs (1300) is a whopping 1430ish heal.<br />
<br />
If your gonna be a MAIN healer, you better damn well have the healing AAs.<br />
Or just get a cleric.  Look at what supernal light does w/ just IH4, I can't imagine how it will be w/ healing aa's, nevermind the new Gates version.  Yikes.  I can't wait to start winning hards reliably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The HoT, which functions as form of &quot;uber regen&quot; on the tank. Supplemented by the fast heals, a shaman would have a much easier time in LDoN hards than with the current set of Tnargs and Quies.<br />
<br />
No idea what Marr's Gift is, but IH4 is 20% so it averages 10.5% which on a Tnargs (1300) is a whopping 1430ish heal.<br />
<br />
I think Marrs is 25%. Adding in the healing AAs, I probably average around 1600 for Tnargs, with potential crits reaching 3700.<br />
<br />
My whole point is that the Gates spells make a shamans life MUCH easier as a healer in one of the &quot;barometers&quot; we seem to be using, LDoN Hard. Yeah, it sure helps to have EP geared tanks and casters and DPS dealers, but even so, I bet I could keep your non EP SK alive a whole LDoN hard run, if we had another slower-debuffer. <br />
<br />
Thing is, I don't WANT that role. If I wanted to be a &quot;primary healer, sans all my other stuff&quot; most of the time, I would have MADE A CLERIC. Thats what CLERICS do. I wholeheartedly agree that the games focus has changed so much that its just not enough to be &quot;kinda good at lots of things&quot; anymore, but if I was being FORCED to pick one thing to be REALLY good at, and Slow and DOTs are off the list, then I wouldnt pick Healing. Sorry, I just wouldnt. But like Guv said, does that mean I delete my heal spells? Of course not. Does that mean I wont accept a role as &quot;only healer&quot; in LDoN Normals? Um, no, heh, I barely ever even have to cast tnargs there, Quies is enough to keep everyone alive. But I simply do not want Healing to be my class's PRIMARY function in MOST situations. Why is this a problem?</div></div><hr />

I totally understand why some shaman don't want to be main healers.  I became the de facto main healer in our crew temporarily when our cleric friend wasn't online and permanently when she quit.  Then as the game shifted to fast fights I could no longer contribute meaningful dps nor were my buffs significant despite us not being at stat caps.  To make matters worse, we always have a chanter so slow isn't really even that necessary.<br />
<br />
So what does that leave my shaman for a single group role? Healer.  Nothing else my shaman brought to the table was meaningful.  And if you have only one role, why settle for 3rd best?  Voila, cleric here I come.  Sad, really.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the Gates shaman HoT- is it better than Supernal Elixir though? I don't even know the names of the Gates spells.  <br />
<br />
I guess my question in today's game is- if you don't want to heal but you have no other role, what do you do?  Oh yeah, End Billing, my bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that the clerical/main heal shaman is any less valid, i just wanted to point out its not like 1 or 2 &quot;bad&quot; shaman. Its a valid point of view.<br />
<br />
I think that about sums up the thread nicely.  I'm sure many will think I made this thread just to cause trouble, but that's not the case.  I have healed in groups many times as a back up, but that's in no way what I join groups for.<br />
<br />
I hated the fact that on raids, it took pretty much just two shaman to forefill all the useful stuff that we had to offer.  The rest would sit there occasionally healing when required, but generally just following the raid around like bored sheep.  I wanted to make a more active role, mainly just doing significant damage, I would have probably settled for better melee.  I remember when I first started back in Kunark, we were never great melee but we did our bit which was significant.  Before I left, any time I was in a raid I felt insignificant, even expendable.  In other words, the raid would still function fine without me throwing in my heals.<br />
<br />
As for groups, I don't want people to think, &quot;hmm we could use a back up healer, let's get a shaman&quot;.  Which seems to be more and more the case now.  The worst part of it, is it seems to be what a lot of shaman want, you only have to look at the poll for that.<br />
<br />
To sum up in yet another way of saying the same thing.  I want to feel useful in a group, but not because of my heals, I don't mind doing it to help out, but I don't enjoy it, and I don't want to wake up one day and discover it's my new SOE defining skill, to be a 'Cleric Plan B'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The funny thing is, many druids don't like healing also.<br />
<br />
As for me, I can main heal in a normal LDoN. I can main heal in a hard LDoN with a decent group. I could main heal in elemental exp groups (though I haven't yet). I can keep a group alive on raids.<br />
<br />
Yet, I'm not even good enough to be considered a backup healer in Gates trials.<br />
<br />
Gates is my main concern. Where people tell me their ideal group is Warrior, cleric, cleric/druid, enchanter, FD puller, dps and that shamans don't have a role there at all. The boss mobs are usually immune, so a shaman might be fine for clearing, but are considered useless on bosses. Ikkinz trial 7 is probably the single worst example of this.<br />
<br />
That's why I want better healing, so I can take the backup healer role. People can bot a shaman for focus, and a 925 nuke which takes 7.8 seconds to cast is laughable these days. I'd also like meaningful stat buffs and better DPS too, though people could still bot a shaman for the buffs.<br />
<br />
Overall, I just want a role. A place to fit in where I can do what I do, do it well, and by so doing can make a difference. I don't want to be better than every other class, I don't want to be a &quot;must have&quot;, I just want to be a viable alternative - so that by adding me to the group, they're not sacrificing something more useful. It seems to me I have that almost anywhere except Gates content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Um, isnt that exactly why we are whining so much about healing in Gates? Don't try to tell me the new heal spells are inadequate for pre-Gates content. Shaman can easily heal in LDoN Hard now, with both new spells. Raid heals are also more valuable. However, we are basing this WHOLE healing &quot;whine&quot; on a couple &quot;camps&quot; in Gates, namely, Vxed, Ikky and Tipt trials. <br />
<br />
        No ,no ,no . You can't compare a single camp (fungi king) ,which have a dimension of........let's say a room , to a whole expasion (at lot of zone , whole zone ,not unique small room in a zone ,nope).<br />
<br />
        If you can heal in ldon hard it's just because it's trivial (with a good group) for you.We can heal when it's trivial fos us ,that all. You don't like to heal ? we like ,so what ? But forcing  every group to have a cleric ,is not a good move. really not.</div></div><hr />

thing is this is true, and because we are a diverse class rather than a focused class - by focused i mean wiz = nuke clerics = heal etc -  (ignoring slow) we lose out on things, and because of this there will be a split in views, if thats the case and we start getting looked at, why not suggest that our dogdog (spirit guide anyone?) becomes 2 different types of dogdog, one that enhances our benifical spells (effects/mana costs/speed) and another that enhances our detrimental spells so that we can cast our pet dependant on a) what role we want to play and b) what role were needed to play, and cos yu can only have one pet out at a time, yu cant be great in both aspects, allowing for 2 shaman to actually be useful in the same group!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giac, I explained perfectly fine that Clerics were just as necessary as they are now even before any expansions, EVEN in exp groups.  CH was just too powerful to pass up.<br />
This is just plain wrong. Shaman used to outheal clerics in a typical experience group. Druids were closely behind thanks to regeneration actually having an impact. Complete Heal did not always land for 5K+. PreKunark, at level 39 when clerics get Complete Heal they used to try it, find out it takes too much mana and heals not so much more then superior heal and forget until level 45 or so.<br />
<br />
Actually healing is much better now between the classes then it was before the expansions.<br />
Better? Maybe. That is a matter of personal preference. Closer to each other? No way, not one shred, not one tiny bit. Clerics are much much further ahead of the other healers then they used to be preKunark.</div></div><hr />

- 3 HP per mana (CH for 1200)<br />
- 20 mana per tick (meditation)<br />
Shaman<br />
- 1.8 HP per mana (Greater Healing)<br />

But you must also know from that period.<br />
<br />
Yes, clerics did heal best as you stated in your post.<br />
<br />
But Mana Regen was of little concern to a 50th level cleric from a good guild.  <br />
<br />
Because of a little item called manastone.<br />
<br />
So in actuality mana vs healing wasn't much a factor in many cases.<br />
<br />
The Manastone was so badly abused that many would not take a cleric on certain raids unless they had a manastone.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't Chloroplast introduced after Kunark? I am a little fuzzy on it, but I am fairly sure it wasnt available when I first started playing my shaman as my main shortly after Kunark. <br />
<br />
Net result:<br />
Shaman heals more over time, cleric heals more in the short term.<br />
<br />
And today, we can compete with clerics &quot;over time&quot;. Especially with stationary groups given our superior mana regeneration and the cheapness of Quies. <br />
<br />
However, I dont think its proper to compare Shaman to Cleric pre-Kunark by comparing hp's per mana. Superior healing is a better spell than Greater healing, period. Also, lets look at &quot;mana expended per fight&quot; and while a good cleric was also stunning mobs in addition to healing, a good shaman was doing a TON more than just healing. <br />
<br />
Shaman are, and always have been, SO SO SO SO much more than &quot;just healers&quot;. Todays druids are quickly becoming &quot;just healers&quot;. I don't wish to go even as close to the &quot;Healer&quot; role as Druids have. Sorry I am not &quot;unified&quot; in this with the rest of you who want to be clerdruids, but I am just not interested in playing a &quot;Healer&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You must be thinking of ChloroBlast. A direct heal spell that was introduced in late Velious iirc.<br />
<br />
And today, we can compete with clerics &quot;over time&quot;. Especially with stationary groups given our superior mana regeneration and the cheapness of Quies.<br />
<br />
No we can't. And even if we could, it wouldn't matter, because Healing over Time ceased to matter at all and everything is focused on burst healing and HPS. I want to add that a Cleric using their superior HoT will never go oom.<br />
<br />
However, I dont think its proper to compare Shaman to Cleric pre-Kunark by comparing hp's per mana. Superior healing is a better spell than Greater healing, period.<br />
<br />
No one is debating that Superior Healing is a better spell, however, a Shaman slowing early for 60% without any fear of dying from aggro + the superior mana regen and regen was a better healer in the long run. And the &quot;long run&quot; was actually a realistic scenario.<br />
<br />
Kunark was pretty much the same, just better because of a higher % Slow and Torpor + better mana regen.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't really matter why you joined groups, the fact is you're invited to groups because you can buff, slow and heal.

Main healing just is not our job, it's not our role, and IMHO it's not what we were designed to do. We can do it in a pinch, and that's a great comfort. I like knowing that I can SH effectively, and I like knowing that when my main healer dies I can step up and keep the group going. We ARE priests, yep ... we are battle priests. We debuff, we slow, we fight, we heal. I'd like a few healing upgrades (group Q, for example) as much as the next guy ... but main healing? Nope. I'm happy to remain a backup/pinch healer.<br />

Saying you don't want to heal when that is one of the strengths of our class is just like saying you don't want to slow. You really sound like you would have had more fun playing a different class.<br />

Unreal, no matter how many times you explain yourself, there's always someone who manages to miss the point.  I'll say again as simply as I can.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that because we're pushing healing as one of the spell lines that needs overhauling the most.  SOE are reading this as, &quot;We want to contribute to groups and raids as healers&quot;.  This is diagreeable to me as I find healing dull, as I've mentioned before, I'll heal when required, but I don't enjoy it.  I'd much rather be doing damage, debuffing with spells which actually make a difference, I want to hear the phrase I haven't heard in a long time, &quot;Cool, we've got a shammy in the group, all my stats kick ass now&quot;.  I don't want to hear, &quot;great we've got a shammy, he can heal what the cleric doesn't have time for&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And a lot of people want just that, to contribute as healers. In fact, according to the big poll that lead to the one voice post, healing is the number one concern of the visitors of this board. That does not mean they do not want or do not need improvements in other areas, just that they want to be able to be a healer, just like they have in every expansion before GoD.</div></div><hr />

Healing blows. Wanna heal play a cleric plenty of other things we can be doing. Some healing is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">To clarify I don't wish to become a super healer because then that is all we will do and what a pain...slow this..resist...slow it...resist...heal! Heal!<br />
<br />
God I can hear it now...healing should be about our 2nd or 3rd best ability but that is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">I started my shaman right as kunark came out becouse (at this point was not realy reading any boards and did not have to much exerance with the class) I wanted a person that would help the party or groups of warriors from the front ranks right up next to them, NOT sitting behind the lines all safe and sound. The shaman spell set and gear and becouse thay where lizards is what convinsted me thay could. <br />
<br />
I was one of the shaman that loved the rage line and used it often (saved my butt countless times and save my group also sevral times becouse I could off tank one or 2 and help kill them with the melee I was doing). I always just looked at the healing we did more along the lines that it was in line with pallys, not druids. we where the offences prist ... the battle pristes. we fought besides the warriors and lead the war party in to battle.<br />
<br />
duoed like that as well. the warrior an dme would pass aggro back and forth while me and fido would hit from one side and he from the other so that the damage the slowed mob was doing was going up aginst 2 regens and there by got erassed faster.<br />
<br />
But, I touch pride in the fact I could change up my play style at the drop of the hate to reoptimize my self for what the group need ( if that was more healing then would fall that way but ALWAYS tryed to lean more to the attack side ). I view that my melee was 1/4 that of a dual weilding warrior and 1/3 to 1/2 that of a 2hander warrior with roughly equal calaber weps (and for the most part it was since up to 50 in the origanal game we had the same wep skill caps as a warrior, then we stopped and thay went on. thats where I think thay broke shaman melee well that and brakeing rage).<br />
<br />
I like most about shaman was you could focus your self depending on how you WANTED to play. was realy the only class that could pull that off. if you wanted to be healing focused you could if you wanted to be focused in melee you could if you wanted to be focused in dealing damage from afar via dots and nukes you could ( we still had the biggest single dot and all ours could stack wich was specal to a shaman ).</div></div><hr />
