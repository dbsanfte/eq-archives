<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bankrupt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok well i am not a newbie, i have a 61 cleric, 53 necro and a 57 druid.  To the best of my recolection the first specialization to reach 50 goes above 50 right?  Well now my shaman is 41 and 3 of my specializations are at 50 and not one is over.  I sat in the nexus and cast the crap out of a level on spell for over an hour to get it to go above 50 after I noticed this issue.  It won't go over.  Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There have been weird bugs concerning specialization usually involving people who didn't train theirs right away.  But in your case (from what I gathered from other posts on the subject) it may be that 2 specializations reached 50 before one or the other reached 51.  My suggestion would be either have a GM help you or do the quest to get them back to 49.  Then cast what ever one you want to be the highest until you get to at least 51 in it.<br />
<br />
Another thing I've heard is that you have to train in all the specilations to get one over 50.  Have you put one point into each?<br />
<br />
Most times a GM will fix you.  Many people have had problems with this.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As I recall, you can't get your spec over 50 until you train it from 50 to 51 at the trainers.  That way, you don't accidentally cast your way to the wrong specialization (after all, not all casters want their spec to be their most cast class, they might want it to be their highest mana cost spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The same happened to me, at least almost. I just put 50 points into one specialisation and it never went up. Until I dumped one point in _all_ specialisations. Now my main specialisation goes up like crazy. <br />
From your message, I believe you put specialisation points in only 3 of the 4 specialisations. Is that correct? If so, dump a point in specialisation you left out, as well. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ladera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, the only explanation is that one of your casting skills is already above 50.  Calm down......take a deep breath.  You should go to your trainer and take a look at where your skills are or carefully go through your skills menu.  Look for one that is above 50, it's gotta be there.  You didn't want to specialize in that one?  No worries.  You can go to the temple of solusek ro to unspecialize in something.  Go there and look for a guy named Ostorm in the temple.  I'm not sure exactly what he says or wants you to do b/c i've never talked to him before.  If you have trouble finding him, just pull up a map on eq atlas.  <br />
Good luck and let me know how it goes!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also forgot that you can try to put a point into the one you want above 50 to get it to 51... sometimes that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkforest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok heres my situation i never paid much attention to my specializations til last night and had a discussion in guild chat about skills.I originaaly speciallized in conjuration that right now is at 50 when i put a point in all the others they went up to 57,so right now all my specializations look like this...<br />
conj 50<br />
alt 57<br />
div 57<br />
evo 57 and the rest are 57 can't think of them offhand though hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First off make sure you have at least 1 point in all specializations, then put another point into the one you want over 50 (alteration i'm guessing so put 1 point into it to get it to 51) this should solve your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another thing I've heard is that you have to train in all the specilations to get one over 50.  Have you put one point into each?<br />
This is correct.  You must have at least one point in every specialization before any of them will go over 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Similiar thing happened to me. Trained my specializations at 60th (completely forgot about the skill), and all were at 60. I had to do the reset quest in Temple of Ro off from Lavastorm, to fix it. Reset them all to 49th, and proceeded to canni/heal til alteration hit 51. <br />

This happened to me also.  I was updating my skills in magelo.  (I've got a few toons that have gone through the spec process fyi)  Anyway, on maglelo my specs were right, but I look at my character and all my specs were 62, with alt being 50.  Guess what? I had trained something else at 62, like alch or something like that, and for some reason it messed up my specs (I might have tossed a point into div too).  In summary: IMHO the best way to fix it, is to simply do the spec reset quest and get them all put to 49.  (Look on alla for the spec reset quest.)  Cuz we all know that if we flag down a GM its only going to piss you off more :)</div></div><hr />
