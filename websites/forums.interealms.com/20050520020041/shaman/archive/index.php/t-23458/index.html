Out of tune by whose opinion?  Just wonderin, did they say it was, or is it based on the fact that no one can beat it?</div></div><hr />

I'd say it's out of tune... unless they plan on leaving that section like it is and just make you do the Level 70 thing with spells etc... in order to beat Kretv and beyond.</div></div><hr />

I heard one guild had beaten her, I forgot the name though.  But after seeing the encounter, they either had a lot of luck, or it's a lie.  They definitely need to adjust the encounter some, tweak some recasts on certain spells, or change mob levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, from what I remember, the fake was:<br />
<br />
AC25, HP+240, Mana+240, Dmg 32, Del 25, 30 to some saves<br />
with a Discordant Engery Focus effect and a cliky Balance of Nihil ...<br />
<br />
The linker (a trade mule of an old cleric friend) claimed it just dropped for a PR shammy on Bertoxx .... oh well, it had me going (and wishing) for a while there ..... guess I just gotta keep praying for a TA .....<br />
<br />
Tek :(<br />
<br />
PS. Does anybody know how to fake a link? and if its is easy to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well.. what it could have been is the real shaman only weapon from Tacvi... but if that was the case, then it was from the Beta server.  There have been some beta raids where people were given equipment from Tacvi and that might have been it.  Either way, it's not dropped on the live servers yet.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah.. and to me having two focus' like that wouldn't make sense, because none of the other items so far have anything more than one focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">knowing the recast on the other weapons.. a slow on this weapon would just be useless, id rather have a click dot or click HoT.. atleast those are useful every few minutes, especially when we already have a click slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've never heard of anyone faking a link under the new linking system.  Most all &quot;fakes&quot; end up being real eventually.  The Discordant Dagger of Night was said to be fake when the link was first found as well.<br />
<br />
The stats and focuses you list sound like what the item should be, and similar to what other class ones should be.  Hopefully we actually get one like that, instead of the lesser crap we normally get compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

I think we tried Pixtt Kretv Krakxt for giggle the first time we beat xxeric wasn't there so I m not sure, but I know we didn't get shm weapon nor beat that pixtt), then we went other wing like everyone to clear it. Dunno what's the plan now. prolly farm stuff untill oow then clear rest of tacvi when lvl 70 will make it doable.. and watch other guilds sneak into tacvi without seein zun'muram tkarish zyk</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yeah.. that's not really a huge worry to my guild at this point, but it is something that we are keeping a close eye out for.. especially since two more guilds on my server just reached Txevu and we keep Zun cleared (well.. only killed him once I guess).</div></div><hr />

I wonder who designed the Tacvi weapon. Whoever it was didn't know about the item above. KM &gt; TM and they share the timer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yikes how lame. Time spear still the best after what..4 expansions and a new epic?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Only way they could trump clicky slow would be &quot;-1 mitigaton rank&quot; focus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Galiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">not quite sure where you are so dissatisfied.. but.. FREE CLICKY QUICK HEAL is not junk.  Sure, the recast time on it makes it less than ideal, and the won't won't personally replace the TA in my primary slot, HOWEVER... it's still a mana-less quick heal that's faster casting that you can get any other way.  <br />
<br />
I honestly don't think that we'll ever see something that will replace the clicky on TA, but that is because that item is that overpowered for us.  Right now, it is single handily the best weapon in the game for any class, with the slight possible exception of the cleric 1.0.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have it and keep it available to click if it needed, then not have it and have to use actual real mana (to which some of you say that you never run out.. well, with 9k mana..I run out on fights).  Not to mention the time saved with no recast in between using that and an actual spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">quick heal? The VP drop is a &quot;quick heal&quot; too, and it's Kragg's Mending. That is the whole point. 2 sec Kragg &gt;&gt; 2 sec Tnarg. Junk!<br />
<br />
That's why it is junk. Downgrades on focus is junk. Sure, a mana free quick heal is nice, but when a level 60 can get something better in a small raid than what is attainable in one of the hardest zones possible atm, then it's junk...<br />
<br />
Junk! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">A single target direct heal with a long recast is junk even if could heal 10000hps. 5 Seconds later the tank has lost 5000 hps, now what?<br />
As far as TA being the best class weapon...for the Enchanter theirs is better, cuts their cast time almost in half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">What Mixel and Litch said. <br />
<br />
At the very least it should have a different recast type than the Aged Hammer of Dragonborn, so that you could use both.</div></div><hr />
