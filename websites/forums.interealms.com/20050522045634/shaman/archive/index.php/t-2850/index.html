<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, the other day I was forced to sell the fungi for 50k (as 1) I didn't feel like dickering and 2) it was what I paid for it) to pay off debts (yes I'm psycho about debts) in EQ, upgrade my g/f's druid (wearing rawhide in some slots) and upgrade the rest of my gear plus have the required resists for TOV (and put a 10k stash away to max out alchemy in a few levels).  Here's a look at what I've bought so far:<br />
<br />
Orb Of Void (35ac 5 wis/int 55hp/mana)  22500<br />
Gebs (for her.. shaman shouldnt' be caught dead in these) 3k<br />
3 resist pieces (finishing my set) 3250<br />
Black Horsey (cheap one) 8300<br />
Bills 2k<br />
Leaving me with around 15k in the bank.<br />
<br />
Now, not having a magelo and not being able to get there from work, I'll just give my raw stats as 957 ac (self buffed at 54 w/o shroud) 170ish wis and solid HP's (forget exactly).  I'm looknig to go into a shoulder item better than a tattered mantle.. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess this is where I ask suggestions?  My inante resists aren't very high anymore but I&quot;m a bluebie and don't need them unless I know I need them (Seb with casters, soloing Sarny casters, etc..) so does anyone have suggestions that run around 5-8 K?<br />
<br />
Ya... I'll get off my butt and do a magelo when I get home ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
(yes, I have JBB and epic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dragonwing mantle from western wastes dragon is pretty cheap probablly or you could just go get it yourself. IGS is nice, maybe 15-18k or could try and get yourself as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are a psycho (like me, I suppose!), then I'd also urge you to take a look at the 8th shawl.  It's a horribly long and painful process, especially if you don't already have the tradeskills partially begun, but shaman are generally really low in the pecking order for Flowing Thought items.  FT2 on the shawl, good resists, decent stats, and +15% to buff duration, even if only AC8.  Between the shawl, that PoTC druid ring, and mental clarity 3, I now have permanent stackable breeze on!  It adds up!<br />

Congrats on da 8th...  that is a very impressive acomplishment.<br />

<br />
I'm wearing on Obulus Death Shroud myself.  The focus item clicks on ALL my buffs.  When you consider the amount of buffing we do at our level, this is a significant savings.  It is also AC10, which isn't a big drop from the Tattered Mantle (ac12 IIRC), and has some lousy resist stats on it as well.  (like svm1 &amp; some others)<br />
<br />
I was wearing Chokidai Spaulders, which I keep for the wisdom when tradeskilling.  The 4th Prayer shawl is gathering dust in the vault.  Completing that quest is a personal goal, otherwise I'd just destroy my shawl, as I think the ODS&gt;FT2 Shawl #8, but that's debatable.  No question that it's better than Shawl#4 though. ;D  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Luna try for these:<br />
<br />
BARBED RINGMAIL SHOULDERPADS <br />
Statistical Information<br />
Classes:  Bards, Clerics, Rangers, Rogues, Shadow Knights, Shamans, Warriors<br />
Races:  All Races<br />
Stats:  19 AC +2 SV COLD +2 SV DISEASE +2 SV FIRE +2 SV MAGIC +2 SV POISON<br />
Special Attributes:  None<br />
Slot(s):  Shoulder<br />
Weight:  0.3 Stone<br />
<br />
Since trolls can't wear the IGS, this has a decent AC with a few minor resists.  Drops in Velks off of god knows what.  19 AC is nothing to scoff at in a shoulder piece and the resists might help some.  Again, not sure what these go for, but I don't believe they are magical so it will negate your slam skill on magic only mobs.</div></div><hr />

Well those or the Death Watchers (I'm a wicked ac junky)</div></div><hr />
