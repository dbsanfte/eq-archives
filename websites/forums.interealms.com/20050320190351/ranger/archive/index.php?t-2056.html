If you have this head I will MQ the other 3 for you for the Helm of the Tracker.<br />

In exchage I would like a stack of bat wings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol I was coming here to post a very similar post Arkus.  WE clear the Arena regularly and just destroy the heads to clear the corpses.  Since I have my helm, I can pick up a new set of heads anytime.  If anyone on xegoney needs the heads from the arena and has the overseer head, send me a tell or message me here and I will pick them up on the next clearing.  I am not going to store them as I need the bank space but should be able to do them within a week or so.  And a stack of bat wings sounds about the right price  :)</div></div><hr />

We have let ALOT of heads in arena rot since Ive recieved my helm. Im the only Tunare Ranger in my guild it seems and I'd hate to see these heads go to waste. With the other Posters.. Im on Xegony as well and I would gladly trade ya for a stack of  Milk. It does a body good.</div></div><hr />

I'm on Cazic-Thule and just need ONE stinky head from the Brothers Zek.  At the moment, I can't remember which one.  LOL, it's past my bedtime.  <br />
Being guildless doesn't help.  If any of you kind souls out there happen to have Zek heads, I'd gladly pay for that.  Send me a tell in game or a PM here.<br />
