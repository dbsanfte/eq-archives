<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got bored today and decided to parse the new 67 pet and see if it is in anyway different from the 61 pet.<br />
<br />
I went to Wakening and found my old friend the Mist Panther (level 60 mob that hits for very little) and decided to use him for a little test.<br />
<br />
I summoned each dog and buffed him up with Swift like the Wind, Ferine Avatar, Focus of Soul and Spirit of Might (great buff by the way).  I also gave the dogs each 1 piercing weapon and 1 club.<br />
<br />
Well here are the results.<br />
<br />
61 weap<br />
35.71 DPS<br />
51.8% hit<br />
Average 44<br />
<br />
67 weap<br />
40.14 DPS<br />
52.8% hit<br />
Average 46<br />
<br />
<br />
Well as you can see there is a little bit of an increase in damage but it is not exactly spectacular and could easily be the result of test error as this is just one mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
For kicks I also did a 61 pet with the same buffs no weapons.<br />
<br />
61 no Weap<br />
23.87 DPS<br />
52% hit<br />
Average 45<br />
<br />
<br />
I have attached the logs to this post.<br />

Spirit of Might    <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Damage Modifier by 5% <br />
 <br />
60 x 1.05 = 63, I guess there is a truncation that keeps it from hitting 63, but I'd bet thats why he's getting 62 hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't apply the 5% to the max hit. You only apply the 5% damage modifier to the pet's Damage Interval and that's why 5% Damage Modifier doesn't equal 5% more damage(DPS).<br />
<br />
The buffs that increase Damage Modifiers don't modify the Damage Bonus.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows what the min hit of the pet is(no kick or bash), I can show you the numbers for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like to see a bigger parse than 1 mob, but nice effort.  I think in the long run, you'll see the pets are almost (if not) exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There should be some noticable difference though...  something more than barely winning 2 out of 3 duels against the lower level pet.<br />
<br />
Bigger hits, extra offensive actions, more hp... something.</div></div><hr />

Decrease mana on healing spells 10%<br />
Increase to direct healing spells by 15%  ( all stackable with focus items btw )<br />
<br />
Decrease run speed by 33% ( cause we have to be in a focused trance or something to will our healing to increase )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit of the plaguebringer.<br />
<br />

<br />
Im just pulling numbers out my arse but that would be really fun and inventive and allow us to mold to our groups. Normaly i wouldnt say this is a balanced thing to give to a class, that it would blur lines, but the shaman by definition blurs lines, its always been that way, he is the everything guy, the swiss army knife. This just seems like a logical upgrade for the next expansion or something to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cute idea, I like it, but will never happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it's superfluous, but I'd like to have something that turns me into a bazu...would love to turn into one and then clobber the heck out of something. =)</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong but that sounds to much like WOW they dont have pets but summon something to help the group. I like the idea but they will never do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unless there has been a change I'm not aware of, the pets should be essentially the same.  It's a bug, or at least it was confirmed as one (assuming no change yet).  The necros are having the same problem.<br />
<br />
It's on SoE's list for a fix 'soon', but who knows when that will actually be.  Last I heard, no date has been set for a fix.<br />

P.S. Heya, Ormak!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was spending some time in Charsis with a feelow shaman yesterday.  She was using the 61 pet I was using the 67 pet.  I buffed both of our pets with the same buffs.  FoS and SLtW was what I used.  It seemed like my pet was able to tank MUCH better then hers.  The differnce between to the 2 dogs tanking was definatly noticable, infact I asked her if she was using the 61 pet and not an earlier version by mistake.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for us to parse out its tanking capabilities instead of its offensive capabilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">sure attack your dog with a non procing weapon and then do the same to the lower one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dont know if there has been any changes or not but got new pet today its 5 levels higher (63) than old pet (58) doubles for 60.<br />
<br />
There really wasnt a noticable difference at all other than the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I could be wrong but that sounds to much like WOW they dont have pets but summon something to help the group. I like the idea but they will never do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea i guess in a way. In WoW you summon totems which can can add fire damge or damage anything in range or help heal and stuff. In a way i guess the shaman is kinda like a bard in WoW, atleast in that respect. I guess more like a shaman and bard combined in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really hope they plan on fixing this soon.  I hope they haven't decided to just leave our pet as-is.  This seems really similar to the situation we had between our 55 pets compared to our 49 pets to me.  I wouldn't have paid 5k for my 55 pet (the going price on my server), luckily I got the components to have it researched...but a pet that is 2 levels higher, hits for 2 more damage, and tanks a little better is just a joke of an upgrade.  <br />
<br />
I hope they aren't going to do that again :(</div></div><hr />
