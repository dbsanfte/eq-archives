<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, the time has come to move on, after 3+ years Everquest is just no longer fun anymore.  Not to mention I have baby incoming in a month hehe so I wont have time for the game anymore anyways.<br />
<br />
I accomplished my 2 biggest goals in EQ, 1) To get my Epic and 2)  To get to 60, so to me game is over in away.<br />
<br />
My Shaman was THE best character in the game, was alot of fun and I would not switch classes if I ever had the chance.<br />
<br />
This community has been great and it was a pleasure to be a part of it, you are all a great bunch of people.<br />
<br />
Farewell my friends. :)<br />
<br />
P.S. Might still stop by once in awhile :)</div></div><hr />

I think you've been a great contributor to these boards, Scurg, it's a shame to see you go. I hope you enjoy parenthood :)</div></div><hr />

haha, gonna be hard to lose the eqspeak.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, a child is the greatest joy on earth.  Your kid will con green and amiable at first, but will gain xp quickly.  Make sure you don't lvl him/her too fast and don't ruin your faction, it's hard to get back.  And above all, don't be afraid to twink the **** outta the kid.<br />
<br />
p.s.  keep your account, in a couple years you'll be playin video games with him/her</div></div><hr />

Good luck Scurg !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, Scurg, as a new parent don't be surprised if you find your lifestyle changing to where (a) you cant go out anymore in the evenings, and (b) a MMORPG is better than watching TV.  Maybe not EQ for ya anymore, but just don't be surprised.....<br />
<br />
Having 3 small kids, I find makes it impossible to be a hardcore EQ player, but being a casual player fits very well with the lifestyle (if you call it that) if a parent with young kids.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
