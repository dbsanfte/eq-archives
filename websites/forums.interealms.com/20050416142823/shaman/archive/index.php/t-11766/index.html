I had thought they eliminated that ability to display the designation number quite some time ago.<br />
<br />
Am I mistaken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MojoMachine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Up until Beginning of February at least I was able to sustain it after patches... recently (pretty sure it was with the LoY patch) I just couldn't get the skin to load to save my life.<br />
<br />
I have one UI for everyday XP and one for raiding, thats why I'm not totally sure when it got messed up.  Didn't raid all that much through February, but before that I'm sure it was functioning.  Comes in really handy when slowing 8 mobs all the same name ;)  If it's broken forever that would be handy info as well, I'll get some sleep at night at least.<br />
