<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, since there are some guitar players here, and some former and current D&amp;D players here, I'm going to show you how I combined them.  Well, kinda.<br />
<br />
First, IMHO it's very important to learn the fretboard of a guitar if you want to really learn guitar.  I'm a &quot;by-ear&quot; player, but I'm trying to learn to sight-read.  If you want to play (for example) jazz standards, you have to learn to read.  That means knowing quickly where to find each note on the fretboard.<br />
<br />
So, I came up with kind of a flash cards method using some stuff I had lying around from my D&amp;D gaming days.  You need one of the D12's, and one of the D6's.<br />
<br />
The D6 represents string - whatever way you want to number them.  Either low E is 1 or low E is 6, it doesn't matter as long as you're consistent.<br />
<br />
The D12 is the fret.  From the first to the 12th fret.  I assume you know that the guitar is tuned EADGBE, so you know the 0 and 12 frets already.<br />
<br />
Roll the two dice.  If it comes up with D6=5 and D12=3, you're looking for the 5th (A) string, 3rd fret.  Or C.  If D6=2 and D12=10, you're looking for the 10th fret on the 2nd (B) string, or A.<br />
<br />
So that's it in a nutshell.  It's kind of like random flashcards for learning the guitar fretboard.  It will get boring, so only do it for a few minutes a day.  Say the note when you know what it is, and I bet you'll have a better feel for the fretboard within two weeks.<br />
<br />
Anyone else with stupid guitar tricks?<br />

<br />
/em makes a mental note to never post when the little voice says &quot;That's pretty dumb&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
In my own defence, I will say that this version is much less dumb than my original &quot;Gauntlet&quot; method, where every time you changed chords you had to shout &quot;Red Warrior needs food!&quot;<br />

<br />
Pretty good though, especially if you force yourself to say the note out loud. This is exactly what you want if you want to, as you say, learn the fretboard. You don't want notes that are in the same key or general area, so that you're mentally forced to know where you're going. You'll find your ear starts to get attuned to really weird intervals too (which may or may not be a benefit :))<br />
<br />
I remember reading about an jazz guitar instructor who would duo with his students, calling out totally unrelated chords that they would have to solo over (ie. - FMaj7#9, Db9, A#Dim,etc.) in order to build up their ear. He had one student who became so good he could never catch him out no matter how weird the progression. Then one day in the middle of this he called out  CMaj7 - G, and the student lost it and said 'What the #^% was that?!' :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really want to learn how to read music, play classical. You really start learning notes once you have to change positions. There is actually a lot of classical stuff that isn't played in open position. Classical is really great too if you want to impress people. To play it well means you really have to play it well. Whereas you can float by if your technique is sloppy when you play Enter Sandman.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and also: DON'T SHOOT THE FOOD!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannuer</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that to learn to read notes, take some sort of classical training. Any that I had helped out immensely (even if it was from different instruments). <br />
<br />
But to learn the fretboard is a different thing than just knowing where the notes are...<br />
<br />
Loved that game. Did anyone buy it when it came out for the PC?</div></div><hr />

How do you figure?</div></div><hr />
