<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure most you probably already know this, but I thought I would post it anyway since I saw someone claim Extended Affliction was useless to a high level shaman.<br />
<br />
Not only DoTs are affected by Extended Affliction. My Coldain Military Wristguard 'glows' when I cast slow, root, Malo, etc. Pretty much any debuff with a duration is considered Affliction. Slows, roots, Malos are all very important. Who wouldn't want them to last 20% longer? Anyone ever wipe on a raid because Slow wore off at the wrong time and you couldn't get another to stick in time?<br />
<br />
All in all, EA3 is a boon to some of the Shaman's best skills. I would suggest that all shaman actively seek both Extended Affliction and Extended Enhancement items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait until they fix the focus effect.<br />
<br />
There have been several threads about it, but the focus is only intended to affect DoTs.  <br />
<br />
I agree that it's very useful, but I wouldn't spend a bunch of plat on an item, only to have the effect 'fixed'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Claymoore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is nice for those reasons now.. but if ya look into it, EAIII is onyl supposed to work on DoTs and once that is fixed.. its value is going to drop to soloing/equiping when ya DoT.. i wish i would stay how it is tho and yer very right about how important EAIII is atm</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiosity, how do you know this? Just because they changed it and then changed it back doesn't necesarily mean that it wasn't done on purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ea does NOT extend debuffs or dots by 20%, unless they only lasted 5 or 6 ticks to begin with (because then one tick would be 20%!)<br />
<br />
test it out with Sicken on yourself.<br />
<br />
affliction HASTE, however, is VERY nice, as are affliction efficiency, extended enhancement (which does seem to be  a much more significant duration bump than EA), and enhancement haste (if you have to invis or lev when it just wore off at the WRONG time -- note that EE2 is enough for both of these spells, i don't know any 49+ buffs that would benefit in a lifesaving manner from faster cast times but then again i'm only level 46).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It says in the spells_en.txt file that it only affects 'Hit Points (HP)' spells. Of course there's other stuff in there that's incorrect, so it's possible this effect will continue to work the way it currently does.</div></div><hr />

From the June 6th Patch message:<br />
- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably.<br />
- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.<br />
<br />
Since then, the focus effect has been broken again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also some silly shammy (not I) brought it up with the devs at Fan Fair and they said flat out that was a bug, thanks for pointing it out.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Affliction Efficiency III <br />
<br />
1: Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 25% <br />
2: Limit: Max Level(60) <br />
3: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4: Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction III <br />
<br />
1: Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2: Limit: Max Level(60) <br />
3: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4: Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)<br />
<br />
So: Yes, it increases the duration by 20% and yes, it's supposed to only work on DoT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It says 'Hitpoints allowed', not 'Hitpoints only'. So, how did you come to the conclusion that it's suppose to work only on DoTs? Root, Malo and Slow are all Detrimental.</div></div><hr />

They fixed it once, they'll probably &quot;fix&quot; it again.  I'm going to enjoy the hell out of my Affliction Efficiency boots until then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't say 'only' DoTs. It just says the Foci were designed to affect DoTs. Lucy, on the other hand, only gives parameters of Detrimental spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kytra - the patch message has been linked in this thread, and the relevant passages have been quoted by several people.  Plus you have the word of a person who *heard* the developers state it was a bug.<br />

Not much else we can do to provide you proof.</div></div><hr />
