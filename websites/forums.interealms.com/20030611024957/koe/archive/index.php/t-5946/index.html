<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not as oober as I make myself out to be in roleplay - but I had what I consider to be a very good number tonight, and would like to know how it stacks with your own personal experiences.<br />
<br />
A pickup group, led by Rysingsun, with 4 people I don't know well - tonight took a 48 mob pull in acrylia.  1 druid, 2 wizards, 2 chanter, 1 cleric -- I think I was most impressed that we did not have a pure puller (warrior, pally, sk or like that), and that we all lived (albeit VERY closely for all three pullers - twice each!)<br />
<br />
This was a new personal record for me, and very exciting. 7 crits on one cast is also a new record for me, although I know that is not close to even a server record.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Kiku for managing to keep this group of idiots alive through all that, and several other pulls that bordered on the stupid;)<br />
<br />
What are your personal bests?  Are there ways (currently post AE nerfs) to do better that I am not knowing?<br />
<br />
Wish you all well:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only been in one AE group ever, and I had an unbelievably good time.  I think our biggest pull was 34, in Acrylia Caverns.<br />
<br />
I hope to get in on more AE groups in the future.<br />
<br />
(Hey, I have a 688 AE, does that count? :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Largest pull i have had in acrylia was 67 mobs.  Was an uber group with Jordyne and a couple other old friends. Had a war and 2 wizzies out pulling.  Somehow they kept coming back with more and more....<br />
<br />
Was just plain sick...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ali</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">57 is my best.  Togashi is a god.  Average was 35.  Had 2 Wizards and a Druid pulling over and over.  O yea in Acrylia.  Its not that hard to do if you put your mind to it.  I suppose best way to do it would be 3 enchanters 1 cleric and 2 Wizards.  All have mod rods before the pull, and make sure the Wizards had a Crown from that big earth element in burning woods.  Has 4 casts of 900ae damage - instant cast.  Or something like that.  <br />
<br />
O yea and as for the record Jlove, probably all the mobs in the grey pre-nerf from stories I've heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My most is about 55ish. This was because Arcylia was empty.<br />
1 SK, 2 wiz, 2 enc, 1 cleric.<br />
<br />
You need to have good computer because after 30 mobs for me. Framerate start slowing down for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best pull in Acrylia: 63 mobs.<br />
Best pull in The Deep, pre-nerf: 34 mobs.<br />
Best pull in Fungus Grove, pre-nerf: 71 mobs (2 groups and 3 pullers).<br />
<br />
AE is fun - too bad the only place it's really worth doing it is soooooooo far away from everything.</div></div><hr />
