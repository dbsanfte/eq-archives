&quot;you say,&quot;guided meditation&quot;<br />
-The history translated for you reveals the fate of zebuxoruk.traped in the plane of time you must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />
-The cipher of the divine language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades..<br />
-You have completed all of honors trials<br />
-You have bested Aerin'dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into mithanals halls.<br />
-Mauvin is grateful to you for taking his case before the tribunal.  The information provided to you, that mithaniel marr and karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
-Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
-Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
-Saved from certain doom, milyk and adler are forever in your debt.<br />
-Now that grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the crypt of bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
-The pack of notes from vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
-The pack of notes from tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend<br />
<br />
You say.&quot;unlock my memories&quot;<br />
-Your heart beaat speeds as you recall the warlords flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you sense darker intentions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont remember much about all this stuff, but isnt there a hospital or clinic or something you need to go to as well? Also, it looks like your RZ flag may be borked, as the notes from VZ and TZ arent readable. I think RZ makes them readable. <br />
<br />
I am sure you will get answers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Something with the RZ flag is messed up. It can be either a lack  of Agnarr, Mithaniel Marr, or, I think Saryrn.<br />
<br />
I was getting all of that myself, except the Zeb part, and I had all flags for the elements minus Mith (including the flaming axe stuff).<br />
<br />
You also may need the flag for Tactics from the Manaetic Behemoth in PoI, the Diaku Tactics quest in PoStorms will not count as planar progression.<br />
<br />
ALso, now I think of it, the text is rather odd. I think you may need to visit Maelin again, and say &quot;I have new lore&quot; and &quot;I have new information&quot;.  AFter I got my Mith flag I spent an hour with the new lore, what lore, new info, what info trying to get my elemental flag all finished up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the RZ message is like that cause i dont have sol ro kill also... im just trying to find out what i am missing that is preventing me from entering sol ro/PoEarth/Water/Wind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check this thread from the safehouse. Its all broken down on what everything means. Should help you figure out what your missing. Its probably something simple as a missed hail. <br />

Tier 3 - Tactics<br />
The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />

<br />
Completed Saryrn and MM flag lines and hailed librarian (Grummus, TT, Bertoxx, KoS, Saryrn, HoH trials, MM, and all preflagging).<br />
<br />
<br />
Cliffs Notes:<br />
<br />
You have your kills but have not completed the flags. Specifically you need to hail Maelin at the top of the library and say &quot;what lore&quot; and &quot;what information&quot; then &quot;I have new lore&quot; and &quot;I have new information.&quot; Then run back to the seer and do the jig again. You should have fixed those flags now.</div></div><hr />
