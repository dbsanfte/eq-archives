<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oro</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've wanted this SUV since I saw an ad for it in some magazine 10+ years ago.  During that time I've done research etc. and basically drooled over every new model.  It's something that has struck a chord deep within my psyche and triggered the &quot;if I ever get a chance I gotta get me one no matter what&quot; reaction.<br />
<br />
Flash foward to the present - I had the opportunity to buy a used one a few days ago and I did.  Its a 1995(They stopped making U.S. spec'd ones in 1997 so you want a  new one you would have to import one and modify it to comply with EPA and DOT regulations - a very costly endeavor (at least for me))Land Rover Defender 90 with the features that I want and with what some my consider serious mileage on it (88k).  Paid cash.  It is not a financial hardship to purchase it so its not like I'll be living in it.  Still my friends who know (It's in the process of being shipped) and my girl friend all think I'm crazy.<br />
<br />
Am I?<br />
<br />
PS If you want details on the rarity of the vehicle I'll be happy to oblige.</div></div><hr />

If a car makes you happy and doesn't place an unwarranted burden on you well than you are not crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you crazy - no way.<br />
<br />
I once spent $200 on hair and nails for one night out. It wasn't even my wedding or prom or anything - it was just a night out with my (then) fiance. I felt SO beautiful that night. It was worth it, even though it was all gone by the next day.<br />
<br />
Spending your own money on something that makes you feel good isn't crazy. That's what having your own money is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in a similar situation a while back.<br />
<br />
I had the opportunity to purchase a 1977 Lotus Esprit S1.  For those who are Bond fans, it's the little white one that turns into a submarine in &quot;The Spy who Loved Me&quot;.  I had loved the looks of the car since I was a kid.<br />
<br />
So I bought it.<br />
<br />
Owning it was not the nirvanna that I had imagined, but it's an experience that I wouldn't have traded.  When it was running right, it was a BLAST to drive.  I've never owned or driven anything that handled like it.  However it was a COMPLETE pain in the ass to keep running.<br />
<br />
British + Sports Car + Old &lt;&gt; Reliable<br />
<br />
In the end I sold it.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I owned it, and like to think I sold it in better condition that I bought it in.  I'm also glad I sold it, but there are days when I still wish I could hop into it and go for a drive.<br />
<br />
Emotions are not a rational thing.  People who live only rationally and never do anything because they love it, don't really live.<br />
<br />
I hope the reality of owning is as good as the dream of owning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My next car will be a range rover, most think I'm crazy too, but dammit, it's a REAL car.<br />
<br />
Why do you need to modify it to get it imported? thought it was sold in the States?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taamar Bladesworn</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh*<br />
Someday.... out there somewhere is a BMW m3 with my name on it.... and some Callaway racing upgrades to match. As of right now, my idea of a splurge is getting an appetizer when I go out for dinner.<br />
<br />
You're not crazy, you're defining the value of an item by what it means to YOU, not what it means in a book somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meathorse</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And some day I'll get my hands on a sweet-O 1980 Honda Civic hatchback.  Not one of those run down ones either... a fresh one that still has half it's paint and under 250,000 miles!<br />
<br />
*sigh*... oh to dream....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. I've never had the urge to buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trebuchet.com/kit/fat/&quot;&gt;something completely useless that I definitely don't need.&lt;/a&gt; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So do you actually OWN a Trebuchet?</div></div><hr />

The Defender 90 (the soft top pick up version) would be the one Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie (sp?)) was driving through the jungle in the Tomb Raider movie after she and it were dropped by parachute from an cargo plane.<br />
<br />
I think the vehicle you want is the Land Rover Range Rover 4.0 SE or a variation of it.  Land Rover makes the Range Rover, Discovery II, Freelander and Defender 90.  For a bit of history see this : <br />
<br />
http://www.o-v-r-c.com/Land%20Rover%20History.htm<br />
<br />
The U.S. version of the Defender 90 was introduced here in the U.S. in 1993 and stopped in 1997 or first quarter of 1998.  They are still manufactured and sold in Great Britain and sold in other parts of the world I think.  So you would have to import it into the U.S. and in the process adjust it mechanically to meet US EPA and US DOT standards and whatever other standards the state has that your bringing it into. (California emission standards come to mind).  Not a cheap venture (at least for me).<br />
<br />
I think in the movie Rainman, the exotic car Tom Cruise was bringing into the U.S. for a customer was being held up by U.S. Custom for EPA issues thus spurring his need to get him declared guardian over Dustin Hoffman?  Importing cars not manufactured by the factory to conform to U.S. standards is definately not a cheap endeavor.<br />
<br />
The mandatory air bags regulations defeated further U.S. spec'd Defender 90s as at the time they could not be fitted.  Maybe they can now with the new types of air bags but nothing has surfaced about Land Rover making new U.S. spec'd Defenders.<br />
<br />
Probably more information than you or anyone else wanted to know. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm Have I bought something I knew I didn't need....<br />
<br />
YUP BIG TIME ALL THE TIME...<br />
<br />
Les see... how bout all these little Tyranid models half of which I won't be painting up but rather cutting them to shreds to make custom models....<br />
<br />
Posters.... I got posters I've never hung on any wall... I just like getting one from time to time so that if the mood ever stikes me I'll hang it up... but the mood NEVER strikes hehe...<br />
<br />
But the final one I'm likely never to buy but would LOVE to SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO badly.....<br />
<br />
Lamborghini Diablo... I LOVE LOVE LOVE that car...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't own one but me and a couple of my friends are having some very serious considerations. :D<br />
<br />
Maybe we'll lay siege to VI headquarters with it. Anyone up for the challenge? ;)<br />
<br />
Ever since that show Northern Exposure was on TV I've had the biting urge to own a trebuchet. Only problem is finding a place to keep it hehe. I have neighbors that I'd like to launch a couple of miles...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when they stopped importing the defender.   Just shows that yuppies completely took over the US division of Land Rover.<br />
<br />
Grats, good choice of war wagons!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey! Don't diss the trebuchet, that thing flings melons like a dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL All the time there is a reason my bank account always reads ZERO!<br />
<br />
Lately I've been trying to do better since I'm sick of having no money all the time.  On the other hand I've got no kids no house my only responsibilitys is to pay for both my wifes and my own brand new cars. (talk about flying in the face of common sense)<br />
<br />
Currently I'm on the hook for a brand new Protege 5 and comming in june my 2 year old tiburon that I've spent $5K on modifying since this chrsistmas.<br />
<br />
I'm the epitomy of impulse buying.  However as someone said my money I'll do with it as I please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aaaaah, thanks, Oro :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I've never even thought about buying anything I don't absolutely need.  That's why my home theater only cost 5 times more than my car.<br />
<br />
Next on my list of things to waste big bucks on:<br />
Shelby GT500 mustang, I really, really don't need this since most of my driving consists of rain-slickened roads or mountain pass driving in the winter.  However, they sure do look good, sound good, and go fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wwen Valimar</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, the things I could do with a trebuchet... Well, there only a couple techinally, fling stuff at other stuff and Seige castles... But if I had a space to keep one 89$ is a good price for a quality trebuchet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seriously considering getting the redwood tebuchet. It's only 5' tall, it shouldn't violate the HOA covenants to have it in the back yard, should it?</div></div><hr />
