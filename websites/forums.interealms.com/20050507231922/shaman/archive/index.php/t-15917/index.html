<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, my girlfriend just bought a kick ass notebook (damn thing cost about 3500 for God's sake...but boy is it sweet), which means I get to finally try out two boxing :). So, I'm going to purchase another account, and stay on the same server, I really like it here on FV, so I'm looking for the EASIEST race/class combo to level. Of course, they would have to be good duo partner. Personally, I love pally's and sk's for agro control, and since they can melee, my guess is that they would not be too hard to powerlevel. I don't want this to turn into a &quot;best partner for a shaman&quot; thread, while I am interested in that, I am more interested in doing it ASAP, I'm not a very patient person hehe :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

OK I feel the need to defend myself because people getting there panties in a bunch. Yes of course I did a search, got an assload of results. I'm sorry I don't have a few hours to go through every single post, but I did scan the subjects. IF you had read my post, it wasn't the &quot;best duo partner thread&quot; I was interested in the QUICKEST TO LEVEL duo partner, which of course includes race/class combo, which I did not see in ANY of the subjects I looked at. If you feel it's a waste of time, then why waste your time some more with a reply? Just leave it alone, and if people feel like helping, then they reply, simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can't we all just get along?<br />
Why do we always have to revert to shaman on shaman violence?<br />
Choose LOVE people!!<br />
<br />
BTW - Ogre Warrior + Shaman = nice combo.  But you may consider the lack of DPS a warrior puts out in general.  Monks / SK's / Pally's I hear are a very nice combo as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya gotta love the people that can only come on a thread and say,  do a search.  It's kind of like being in Tech support and your only answer to a customer was RTFM.  Leave them alone, you don't have to read it.  Sheesh!  What do you think is going to happen, we are going to run out of internet space because one more person posted a thread like this?<br />
<br />
  Personally I would Duo a warrior and a shaman, warriors are by far the easiest class to play as far as commands and such in a duel box situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dark Elf shadow knight would be my choice for the quickest to level.  No Racial xp modifer, and they still get some nice perks like Ultravision.  In the end, and SK is going to be your best bet IMO, as Feign Death becomes very important to duo boxing once you hit the 50's and 60's (dependant on your play style, true, but this sure is the case for me).  I also believe that an SK will normally out damage a pally on a non-undead mob at most levels.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I personally would choose an Ogre SK (high sta, unstunnable from the front) were I to replace my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>HaggySB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Your best bet for the quickest to level character would be a Halfling Warrior.  They have a 10% exp bonus.  <br />
<br />
Thats my final answer Regus.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it's actually a 5% bonus for Halflings... can they be Paladins nowadays?  If so, that might be a way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">halflings can be rangers not paladins.<br />
<br />
If yer gonna make a paladin make it a gnome for coolness factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haflings can be paladins.  And they are only race to get exp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Takeshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Warriors' also have a class bonus, though I thought it was 10 not 5%, but the point is that he was counting both bonuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Warriors' also have a class bonus, though I thought it was 10 not 5%, but the point is that he was counting both bonuses.<br />
<br />
Awhile back, SoE took out the CLASS based xp modifiers.  If you remember way back, Shadow Knights and Paladins (and maybe Rangers?) paid a 40% CLASS xp penalty.    At the time, a Troll Shadowknight was the slowest leveling class in the game.<br />
<br />
Warriors and Rogues actually got bonuses... I can't recall exactly, but I think Warriors got 10%, and Rogues 5%.<br />
<br />
RACE bonuses / penalties were also there.   But people knew less about these until one of those stat based spoiler sites broke it all down.   For the longest time, the popular belief was that because Humans had no racial bonus (other than having no racial weakness, which to some, is a bonus) that Humans had a RACE bonus to xp.<br />
<br />
SoE came out and said that Humans have no bonus, or penalty, aside from being &quot;average&quot; in everything.<br />
<br />
Halflings, as a RACE, actually get a  5% xp bonus.   No one knew why really, Halflings had good stats and starting location, but that's the way it is... probably because they have to put up with being called Hobbits.<br />
<br />
So, back in the day... a Halfling Warrior was the fastest leveling race/class combo that existed, and a Troll SK was the worst.<br />
<br />
I can't remember when, but it's been a long time now.. SoE took out all CLASS based xp bonus/penalties.    Once players realized the xp hits, they started to think that having a Shadowknight in your group, would take an unfair split of the xp to compensate for thier lower leveling rate  (SoE had said that xp in a group, is split, such that each member of the group would level at approx the same rate).    Paladins and SKs were actively being ignored for groups, simply because people feared they would suck xp, even if they were an amazing player.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... as far as we know right now... <br />
<br />
Trolls / Iksar : -20% to xp<br />
Ogres : -15% to xp<br />
Halflings : +5% to xp<br />
<br />
So a Halfling anything, is the fastest leveling class in terms of xp per kill.    But 5% is not enough to pick a halfling unless that's the race you enjoy... personally I like them... sneak and hide on my old cleric was awesome.</div></div><hr />

Nice post, but you forgot Barbarians.  Barbs actually have a 5% racial penalty.  They are the only &quot;good&quot; race with a penalty, which seems odd to me, considering the dwarf starting stats are very similar.  Oh well, go figure.  <br />
