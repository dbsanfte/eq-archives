<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been lurking around here for a while now looking for help in finding a good hunting ground so I can get into the upper 50's.  I just dinged 53, have JBB, horse, and have consistent access to KEI from guildies.<br />
<br />
I don't get much choice in soloing.  Given both the server I am on and the odd hours that I play, the following things are not options:<br />
<br />
HHK : perma-camped, can't get anything <br />
<br />
Seb : Empty since PoP came out, it's bring your own group or don't bother territory now and if I had my own group to bring, I'd be in the planes.<br />
<br />
PoP : Not many people in the planes at the hours I play, and those that are on b***h and moan about needing to be at least upper 50's to group in the planes when I go lfg...  I've tried at least once or twice a day since I hit 52 and have gotten 0 groups.  Gonna have to write this off till I can either solo there or at least till I hit 55.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert : tried doing the bloodtribe shamans over by the grey zone, and they were easy enough, but they're aren't many of them and as a result xp was spotty at best.  Tried to do the revenants/reavers on the plateau but they are heavily camped as people are trying to get the burning priest for the shield of bane warding.<br />
<br />
Karnor's Castle : Got a group in there at 51, spent 7 hours pulling and keeping clear both the right and left courtyards and part of the tower.  Got all of 2 blues in 7 hours.  XP just doesn't seem to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
CoM : did this off and on from 49-52.  XP here may have been good once, but it's pretty pathetic now.  I can clear the goo house in no time and then spend half an hour waiting on spawns.  Most of it seemed to be going light blue or low dark blue as of 52 and I left and haven't been back except to kill Reavers with my guild.<br />
<br />
At any rate I eventually ended up doing the Hole zone in for most of 52 and dinged 53 there.  XP is still tolerable there, I can get a full blue in about 23 minutes (approximate respawn time on the mobs).  I can probly ride it out to 54, but have been told that the mobs will start going light blue around 54.  <br />
<br />
Anybody have any suggestions for alternatives? I've thought about trying Nathyn's guards, but not sure if I should even attempt it before I hit 55, let alone at 53..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well I made my 53 quickly in sebilis but now with PoP I don t know if you will get a group there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CoM: Go to the gazeebos near the castle, they are all dark blue there, I flew through 53 on those mobs.  I've been on a few reaver raids lately and noticed some of those same mobs were dark blue to me at 58 and 59.<br />
<br />
The Hole: I made a blue an hour at 58 just doing the 5 mobs past entrance while camping for an IGS. You should be getting damn good xp there even at 54 I'd imagine.<br />
<br />
Seb: I've rarely had a problem finding pickup groups but on Karana there's usually a steady amount of people there even with PoP out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 53 go to the hole. The truth is a lot of mobs in com turn light blue at 53 no matter how far you go in. Wherears in hole entrance they just about 90% dark blue and exp is great. I was able to do about a yellow an hour in there but then I was pulling a lot more because I had a cleric healing me while stoning. <br />
<br />
However I'm sure you could make half a yellow an hour in hole entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 48 I was able to get groups in poi/pod/pon when my slow as only 50%.. that was a week ago and now my slow is 75% at 52 and I was in Trakanon's trying to get seb keys when I was sent a tell because a lvl 65 Sk and a 55monk (dual boxing a cleric outside the group) wanted a slower and had been with me before.. I'm not sure if you use the /lfg on or not, but whenever I solo I leave it on and I usually get good pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I'll ride out the hole entrance as long as I can, because I can still get roughly 3 blues in just over an hour at the moment.   <br />
<br />
I do keep LFG on while soloing.  Unfortunately, alot of my grouping woes revolve around playing during off-peak hours.  I spend most of my time playing between 8am and 4:30pm eastern time and on the Rathe server it's not exactly busy during those hours.  I probly wouldn't have any trouble getting planes groups during the evening hours, but I am rarely on during those times so I wouldn't know for sure so I've gotten into a habit of just going and soloing rather than wasting time looking for groups that may or may not develop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hat was a week ago and now my slow is 75% at 52 <br />
<br />
I hate to nitpick but I see a lot of shaman that aren't aware of how our slow percentage works. Turgurs is LVL+15%. Meaning at 52 it's a 67% slow and at 60 it's a 75% slow.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I just see a lot of shaman on my server who aren't aware of this so it's a reflex reaction to correct it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The gnoll caves in Jgged Pine Forest should also be good exp and most are warriors, drop about 3pp per kill and occasionally weapons that sell for about 5pp.  And the best part is there is almost never anyone there but me!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I recall doing alot of Burning Woods around this level.  No, there is no Exp bonus but the fact that you have a JBB and Horse means endless mana.  In BW there is an endless supply of blue mobs at 53.  I did some of 53, alot of 54 and 55 here.<br />
<br />
Set up camp around the giant fort.  If no one is there pull the giants non stop.  Ancients and Verdants will be blue, Arbors Light Blue.   You will be making good exp and fantastic loot.<br />
<br />
If Giant Fort has alot of activity just wander around outside and pick off blues at random.  At 53 you should be able to kill, loot, do a 360deg circle while standing in place and pick from 3 mobs at least to get next.<br />
<br />
I imagine the exp would only be so so with no JBB and Horse, maybe even poor, but with both it is great.  Just slow, sic pet and JBB.  Heck, IF I ever wanted to go below 4 bubs of mana I would drop and EB on the mob, unless  I had a mass rebuff to do on myself and pet at same time, I was altmost always just below FM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Funny that you should mention Burning Woods seeing as I started doing exactly what you just mentioned and was able to pick up a nice steady flow of xp.  It takes 3-4 dblue mobs per 1% xp gain, but that is pretty tolerable since even the sarnak casters are pretty easy to take out.  <br />
<br />
Also it seems that the big thing I was missing for getting groups in the planes was realizing that other people in my level range were having the same difficulty I was.   Got picked up for a PoI group yesterday and even with me as primary healer and primary slower we were tearing up the zone in.  I picked up a full yellow of xp in about 2 hours in a full group (had some downtime as people began switching out about halfway through).  Guess from now on if I can't find a group, I'll just have to start my own..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 54, I started doing Coterie Vamps in TM (mostly for faction, xp was crap) but since I was KoS to all of Katta, I had no choice. I sat in TM for all of 54 soloing vamps, collecting blood, ash, and fangs. I also had an alt getting mushrooms from kaladim...more on that later.<br />
<br />
At 55, I had just become dubious to regular katta guards. <br />
<br />
I went in, and camped Nathyn's guards...good xp, and not bad loot (swords sell for about 4-5 plat each) and my faction with regular guards got better fast.<br />
<br />
I turned in all my fangs, and I brewed stacks and stacks alcohol for one of the dwarf guards, which raised all my katta factions (except nathyn's guards, but they were already made at me for killing them so easily). Then I as able to turn in ash and blood.<br />
<br />
Now all my factions in katta are at least indifferent. They really don't mind this iksar running around.<br />
<br />
I sat in Katta from 55-58, where the guards started to go light blue. Not bad xp, and I plan to come back here when I can't get PoP groups for AA xp at 60.<br />
