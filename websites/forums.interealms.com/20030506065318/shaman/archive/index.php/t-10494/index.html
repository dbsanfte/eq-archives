Long time reader, small time poster here. Just recently dinged 56 and decided that Chardok was getting old. A friend of mine pointed me to Charasis (or Howling Stones) so I'd like to try there but I would really like to just get some general input on other places I can go to solo incase its taken.<br />

Any help and info would be appreciated !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happened 6 times in a row, while I was there, I finally gave up and never went back.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal to some, maybe, but when you're rotting 2 mobs, or tanking one in the face, and a lvl 53ish undertaker skele comes in, HT's ya for 750 and proceeds to summon you....<br />
