<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i believe i have uncovered their evil plan.<br />
<br />
while i have not seen it IRL, i had a vision that has to explain the weekly post on this board.<br />
<br />
in my dream i was reading the druid boards (i do stupid stuff in my sleep too), and i came across a thread they had on how to torture shaman.<br />
<br />
as they admitted they were over powered, and had no skill, realized quad kiting was for wimps, they had to have Cheal to be invited to groups, and were in general far inferior to shaman in all respects; they developed a thread to get back at us as a collective.<br />
<br />
basically, the gest of the thread was that every week one of them would come over to this board and ask what race made the best shaman.<br />
<br />
whenever that thread went off the first page, the next one in line was up and it was time to ask it again.<br />
<br />
i think this makes sense.  it is the only logical explaination.</div></div><hr />
