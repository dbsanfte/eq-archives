<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at 996 AC with my normal gear atm. I use my Wolfcallers gaunts to get to 1k but i loose a bit too many HP doing that! Any Ideas what i could buy to get over 1k? I have 15k atm but will get another 15 or so soon...<br />
<br />
Also ill buy a Hiero Cloak if i get one cheap then i will miss even more AC but the HPs and Mana are worth it imho!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Medallion of life instead of yeldemas<br />
Ivandrys hoop instead of earring of purity.<br />
Could try a lodi instead of a seahorse hide cloak too.<br />
Um they're all on my magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">chitlous belt im wearing on my magelo has 15 ac maybe quest upto the 9th coldain ring thats 9ac and 50hp's CC guants otherwise im drooling ~(o)-(o)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Divine inspiration from ME is very easy to get.<br />
<br />
15ac, 15wis, 15int, 35 mana, Range Slot.  Loose a few hp from Talisman of Benevolance but would get you easily over the 1kac mark.</div></div><hr />

There aren't any really easy answers i can see. <br />
<br />
Any number of the CT earrings would be a nice upgrade from you current one and would be a good exp camp while trying to get it.<br />
<br />
Could upgrade your necklace to a 6/5 douing with a tank or 2.<br />
<br />
Obviously upgrading your spiritweavers/rune crafters to wolf callers would add some ac. Even better for the bp would be a vindi bp.<br />
<br />
Another option for an earring if you can stand the smithing is the spirit of garzicor quest which results in the sanctum guardians earring.<br />
<br />
A CT belt or even a cultural belt would net you some ac with out loosing the hps you've got from your current belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1000 ac self-buffed really isn't too bad. One group can easily handle encounters to get you to 1000-1100 AC, like HoT, Lodi, etc.<br />
<br />
It's 1200 that vexes me (and I'm not talking Thal). Without several peices of ntov+ level gear -- with the rest solid -- it can't happen. <br />
<br />
I'm sitting at 1130 AC self-buffed (which includes every trick in the book - agi, sheild, VoB and JBBP effect) and my upgrades are few with my guild just now entering ntov. I already have full skyshrine, OOIV, ToB, ntov shoulders, wtov circlet, EoP and decent dropable filler gear like Lodi sheild, barbed rubi belt, tracking wolf collar etc. To get those last 70 AC we're talking some big league drops or I get a sprinkler of the spirits and bag my epic. Either that, or I drop down from my appx 2800 self-buffed HP, which I refuse to.<br />
<br />
Bleh. I need to play more~</div></div><hr />
