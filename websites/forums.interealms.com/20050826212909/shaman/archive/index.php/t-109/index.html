<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not my first character, in fact its my 4th shaman ;)...<br />
<br />
I really never worried about keeping skills maxed before. With the exception of defense.  With Lorec I am partnered full time witha  monk (my girlfriends character)  and this is mighty close to powerleveling ourselves.  As such I have to actively work on skills.  I solo a bit every level to keep defense/offense/piercing maxed and I also have had to work on abjuration, conjuration, evocation, and divination to keep them capped for most levels since 25 or so.<br />
<br />
In 35 I spent about 25 minutes casting various low level spells to get things topped off.  In 36 I have already spent about 90 minutes using those same spells and have raised 25% of the points i need to....<br />
<br />
I vaguely remember a post, with tests from more than a year ago that recommended using lots of low levels spells rather than fewer higher level one for training, but this was taken from the point of view of catching up seriously behind skills like divination.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have advice on this issue?  Maybe I am just having bad luck this time around... I have 7 more levels of keeping spell skills caught up, but only 4 more for defence!<br />
<br />
Currently I am using:<br />
<br />
Burst of Flame (lvl 1 nuke) on myself for evocation<br />
Sense animals (lvl 9) for divination<br />
summon food (lvl 9 for conjuration)<br />
inner fire (lvl 1 and still in my useable spell list) for abjuration</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I posted something about this, a long time ago.<br />
<br />
I was trying to catch up Abjuration.   Heh, it's still only 212.<br />
My conclusion was to use the low level fast casting spells.<br />
<br />
You can get far more casts total, both due to shorter casting time and lower mana cost, in the same time period using lower level fast casting spells of the class you wish to raise.<br />
<br />
In my test, which was limited by a small sample size, I recall that I noticed no significant difference in speed of increases by using a higher level spell.<br />
<br />
I just find it easy to chain cast fleeting fury on yourself, or nuke yourself with burst of flame.  You can do this in downtime in groups and stay at FM.<br />
<br />
My trouble spots were, and still are, Abjuration and Evocation.<br />
Divination, Conjuration and of course, our staple, Alteration I never had any problem with... well Divination until after level 29!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone once made the excellent suggestion of alternating Sense Animals and True North, since they have such a long recast delay. Has worked great for me.<br />
<br />
Also, unless you're using the Inner Fire trick of casting between ticks so that you can heal while medding, I would suggest using our Level 5 strength burst spell (can't remember its name, possibly Fleeting Fury) for raising Abjuration, as it casts much faster and is higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually maxxed abjuration while casting Inner Fire over and over again while waiting for the Rotting Skelly to spawn.  I need to work on evocation, still not maxxed!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kroak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For defense raises, get a firend with a light blue pet, duel them, and have the pet beat on you.  Pets are mobs and you can raise your combat skills with them.  If either you or the pet gets low on health just have the owner back the pet off and heal as needed.<br />
<br />
Another good option is the damage trap in ToFS.  It doesn't do alot of damage but will give defense gains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tagnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is this damage trap in ToFS please enlighten me hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe that defence raises by dueling pets has now been prevented.<br />
<br />
However, a level 43 Cleric friend has been raising his defence by fighting a Barracuda in LOIO.  He fights till down to his last two red bubs and then steps out of the lake.  The fish fairly quickly remembers that its an aquatic animal and returns to the lake so my friend can heal up.<br />
<br />
Then, once he's ready, he steps back in: and the Barracuda is there just waiting for another round.  He doesnt even have to pull it.<br />
<br />
It should be easy for anyone around level 43 - and with EB of some sort - to do this.</div></div><hr />

You might want to tell your Cleric friend to beware the Holy Mackerel. He's a KINGFISH. :)<br />
