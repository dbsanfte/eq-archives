<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We took out AL a few weeks back, and he was reasonably easy for us.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to tonight, and he smoked us. He did as much damage to our main tank in 10 mins tonight as he did in 20 mins two weeks ago.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, BTW, tubes are MUCH easier to get out of now, thank goodness.</div></div><hr />
