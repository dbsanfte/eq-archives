<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What UI tweaks would you like to see added?<br />
<br />
Two that come to mind for me are:<br />
<br />
-- There needs to be a way for guild leaders to group members on the in-game guild tool roster into sets of characters to clear up the common confusion as to who is who, when you have guilds where people have many alts each guilded. Being able to group a person's main and alts into one set would help a lot. I really hope they add this in OoW.<br />
<br />
-- It would be nice, for shamans especially, if on the group list of names in the group, a player's name pulsed when he had a Heal over Time on him. It would give no more information than you would normally see from thet spell effects, it is just that most people usually have the effects turned off. It would be nice to see that the wounded enchanter has a HoT on him from the cleric, so no sense you wasting your time putting quiesence on him. :)<br />
<br />
I'm sure you guys have other ideas you'd like to see added, what are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some visible representation of who the group leader is.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey ranger is back&quot;<br />
&quot;so invite him&quot;<br />
&quot;you're leader&quot;<br />
&quot;no I'm not&quot;<br />
&quot;who is?&quot;<br />
&quot;dunno&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some way to very cruelly punish those who go AFK and cause you to fail important raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MQ already does some interesting stuff which in no way could be could be considered &quot;cheating&quot; that should be in game already. as I posted in another thread, it's funny how many changes to the game came from both SEQ/MQ... Like numeric mana, cartography, memspellsets, etc. <br />
<br />
For instance, NPC names matching con colors, group leaders having * in front of thier names, or guild leader officers having &lt;Leader of _____&gt; in thier guild tag. None of this crap would be detrimental to gameplay. As usual people who play the game are better at coming up with ideas than the people paid to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can always put an alts main itn the public notes section of the guild tool. My guild does it so you know if they are a Main, Alt or a probie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would like to see a column added to the guild manager window that puts LFG for those who wear the tag. I think it'd make it easier for guildys to group with one another on a day-to-day basis. Just pop open guild manager, check who's LFG, and you're good to go. A note: I am a raid leader in my guild, and do use /who guild LFG (or whatever it is) ... but an LFG column would still be nice.<br />
<br />
On the group window, I would like to see the group leader marked in some way ... by color of the name, an asterisk ... something. Anything.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the tradeskill window modified to show a person's skill with and without a geerlok ... like 200/188 or something. Just for reference. <br />
<br />
I'm also an officer in my guild ... and I think some manner of marking officers and leader would be great. I don't know if I'd like an asterisk near my name, but perhaps officer's and guild leader's names should be a different color, or perhaps their guild tag a different color, or SOMEthing. I also would like a /who guild officer command added so people could pull a list of us up, like the /who all friends.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It might already be in the game, but I would like to be able to press a button and go directly to first person camera view instead of having to cycle through all the views until I return to first person.<br />
<br />
It would be fine to add this the the number pad &quot;5&quot; key that centers the camera anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I want my pet buffs window to have timers like my window does now.  <br />
<br />
I dont know if its a UI bug neccesarily, but if I try and select someone in the Raid window, I sometimes get the &quot;too far away&quot; or &quot;I dont see anyone like that around here&quot; even though they are standing within melee range of me.  Since on FA rotations (bane of my existance) and buffing I cant always get right on top of the people I need to buff, its a serious PITA that the RAid window wont target them correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if pet buffs had timers, enchanters could see how much time malosinia/ensnare had on charmpets! hah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/guildstatus<br />
<br />
Will return Guild name even if anon and I belive officer status.<br />
<br />
Great for those anon jerks who come sliding in to KS or take a camp.<br />
<br />
Snoww</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This isn't so much a UI feature (although something like it was working very briefly when the UI was first introduced) but would be more like an AA or maybe an leadership AA.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to flag mobs much like the delegate main assist, but with spell effect messages.  There doesn't need to be a targeting circle for the effect, but maybe a very small symbol or word with the mob name.<br />
<br />
For example, for X amount of class AA's, a Shaman can flag mobs as &quot;slowed&quot;.  For more AA's, a Shaman can flag mobs as &quot;malos'd&quot; and for more AA's, a Shaman can flag a player as &quot;HoT'd&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nothing too game changing but it sure would be convenient.  If it would be considered to too good for raid encounters, then make it an obscene AA count (like the pet affinity aa).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You guys have some good ideas.  Though I'd prefer not having asterixes and stuff like that by names, that would be annoying to look at, there should be some way to tell who is group leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I want a /targ 1, /targ 2, /targ 3 for group leadership marked mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A bar timer(like the exp bar) undearneath the buffs.<br />
Also a group or raid player buff window, you target the player the window shows what buffs they have with time left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the 'bar timer' idea, be a good implementation of the idea I had posted on the eqlive boards ... <br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=27356</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I certainly agree that identifying group leader is a no-brainer. An asterisk in the name might be distracting but perhaps if it appeared only in the group window it wouldn't put folks off.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the change I'd most like to see would be a way to save equipment sets the way you can spell sets. With my shaman and my ranger in particular i run into situations where i want to swap in certain gear quickly. Honestly outside of that I'm very happy with the general state of the ui.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would love to be able to tell who the group leader is.  It's just silly that it's not possible to tell.<br />
<br />
I would like the raid leader to be able to appoint raid assistants who could modify the NOTES columns.  This would allow a leading buffer to keep the buff lists up to date without bothering the raid leader.<br />
<br />
I want a mode in which assist works similar to the way it does in City of Heroes.  In COH, when you target a player and then hit any attack function, your attack will land on that player's target.  This would not be all THAT useful for shaman (debuffers, buffers, and spot healers that we are) but it would be golden for melee classes and would make raids a lot more organized.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see HoTTT (health of target's target's target) as a leadership AA, so when I target a player to spot heal I can tell when the mob has changed targets.<br />
<br />
I'd like the ability to filter SOME spell messages while allowing others through.  I want to see &quot;the mob yawns&quot; no matter WHO cast it, in or out of group, but &quot;the mob's earlobes turn to jello&quot; or whatever is not relevant and I don't need to see it.<br />
<br />
It would be really cool if the Leadership AA &quot;inspect buffs&quot; had a visual representation, like a popup buff window.  It would be double cool if these buffs had times associated with them like your own do.<br />
<br />
Also, it would be nice if you could inspect someone for a particular buff or buffs.  Like /inspectbuff Focus Wrulan Diaku would return all buffs on that person that have Focus, Wrulan, or Diaku in the name.  <br />
<br />
/inspectbuff detrimental could return only detrimentals.  Or just add an &quot;inspect counters&quot; AA that shows the number of poison/disease/curse counters on a player at the moment.<br />
<br />
I would like searchable database where you could go and see the highest prices that NPCs have offered to buy specific items from you, either in plat or tribute points.  If they make this a local file, obviously everyone will have the complete database, but they could do it the way they do the tradeskill recipes and it would simply record your price discoveries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's funny... we actually lost the ability to tell who the group leader is.  On the old UI, the very first one, the leader's name was yellow in the group listing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Some way to very cruelly punish those who go AFK and cause you to fail important raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
something like say...instakill quintuple the exploss unresable death maybe?<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah afk's who wipe raids really piss me off, nothing like one jackass wasting 50+ peoples time because they are to lazy or stupid to pay attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is about time that Sony added custom filters/gags and triggers to the default UI.  The triggers could simply be limited to sending custom text to a specific window so that advanced macroing wouldn't be possible using the UI.  I bet there are hundreds of different lines of text that I just don't want to see, ever :)  Ah, the ZMud coding fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like both of these ideas. Sometimes you need to drop a really quick heal and this would speed things up. And a way to cut down on spam is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haledin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Two things. I'd like the raid leader to be able to make only certain speakers for the raid channel, like IRC. And I'd like to be able to select multiple items at once to sell to vendors by holding the shift key or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am pretty sure someone could write a little program to be run once you have the game past the patcher to modify the spell text file. Just make it so that it rewrites the whole file so that only the spell affects that you want to see aren't just a period. You would have to run it each time you logged in but it should work if you do it after the patcher oks everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I second the idea that the Raid leader should be able to limit who says what in the raid channel.<br />
<br />
Also second the idea that there should be some way to see who the group leader is in the group window.<br />
<br />
Maybe this has already been implemented, but I also want a way to lock down bags that I open up.<br />
<br />
I want LFG to be seperate for those LFGroup and those LFRaid.  Too many people have lfg up but are really just waiting to be assigned to raid groups.  Make two seperate commands to clear up the confusion.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to flag a mob.  Not with a stupid ring around his toes, but with a giant pink exclamation mark above his head.  And I want to be able to do this with more than one mob, using different colors which appear in sequential order.  Only people in my group or raid should be able to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i'd like to see the ability to set different ui folders, window placements, etc.. for each resolution.. i like having my stuff set up for 1280x1024, so when i multi box with eqwindows everything gets ****ed up, and you cant take time to screw around with window placements when there are people always trying to PK you ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This may not be a UI thing, but how about extending the /ignore function, so that your EQ client does not event paint the ignored peeps who are standing infront of you? <br />
<br />
One UI feature I would like is to &quot;lock&quot; the spell gems in place and even to disable right-click-off buffs.  I use right-mouse-look, and sometimes I accidently click off memmed spells and even buffs.  It is aggrivating to accidently click on a corpse... and then proceed to click off some buffs or spells when the loot window comes up... /sigh<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I just thought of something and I had wanted throw it out here before I forgot. It may or may not be a ui thing, but make a easier way to target someones pet like /targ username pet or something like that. I know you can hit f(x) twice to get there pet just a way to do it out of group.<br />
Finn's suggestion made me think of something else too just know, some sort of hide feature while on raid's. Maybe like hide all but these people cut back on the lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Being able to view ungeared stats without having to bag everything or die. See at what rate you regen/regen mana at per tick without having to watch your HP and mana bars going up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That's a pretty good idea, Bigbadbowlindude.  I can just imagine in the raid, you could just select who you want to see, like just where the MA/SA/healers are, and instead of seeing 72 peeps and their pets, we'd just be seeing the &quot;important&quot; peeps in a raid, and cut down alot of the lag.<br />
<br />
1 up for cutting down the &quot;requirement&quot; for us to keep upgrading our video cards.<br />

Well, not with the Raid Leader's ability to change groups, it might be possible...  Does a necro's sacrifice have a consent box? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I would like the 'Lock' option for the windows (the one that makes windows immovable) to also disable the button that closes the window.

<br />
i use the borderless window mods to prevent this.. not only does it cut down a few milimeters from the default UI's chat windows, it also takes away the X button.. a bit of a hassle to move (you cant just drag them.. you have to drag one corner to where you want it.. then drag the other) but i dont find it that big of a deal, and you can always right click to close it, add filters, etc</div></div><hr />
