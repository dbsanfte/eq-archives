<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQPL.net</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mods - please read through before deleting.<br />
<br />
I'm starting this topic because I am currently looking for information on how Shamans either powerlevel or receive powerleveling for my website (http://www.eqpl.net).<br />
<br />
Before I receive flames, let me first tell you about the site - a quick glance at eqpl.net should satisfy the view that it has no means of obtaining revenue, period.  There are no banners, no donation buttons, and no membership charges.  The site is 100% free, as they should all be.  When I first launched the site I was accused of running some kind of scam - since then we've added quite a lot of content and  continued to live by our unwavering standard of offering an entirely free service to the powerleveling community, something no one has done before in the same capacity, or for no charge at all.  However, in the past few months we have not been updating the site with the same flow of content that we did at the start.  Although there are currently over 35 informative guides on the site, we want to see everything you could conceive of on there when it comes to powerleveling (except exploits and bugs, which we do not support).  Because of this, I hope that you will feel that you are contributing to a good cause, not something that will become a lucrative business for someone else.  <br />
<br />
I will be looking on several different forums for tips on how people powerlevel or receive powerleveling as Shamans.  I'm sure there have been similar topics on this forum in the past, but as I'm trying to assemble the information for the community at large, therefore I hope people won't mind the fact that I've started a new topic.<br />
Also, please don't flame powerleveling - there are places to do that, and this isn't one of them.  If you feel that it is wrong, then don't go to the site and don't submit anything.<br />
<br />
Once again, I'm looking for any and all information about how Shamans perform or receive powerleveling to increase efficiency.  Full guides and chunks of text will be given full credit on the website.<br />
<br />
If you would like more information on all of this, or if you are curious about the site I'm talking about you can visit:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buff PLed person.<br />
Pull with slow, not necessarily your best.<br />
PLed beats on mob.<br />
Repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Id add a cripple into that line up Gwain.  It takes about 30AC, 58dex, 68 agi and 68 Str.<br />
<br />
That means the mob is easier to hit and will hit you with less of a punch.<br />
<br />
My PL route has always been <br />
<br />
Buff <br />
regen<br />
Pull with slow<br />
Cripple<br />
heal as necessary<br />
Root when required<br />
<br />
I dont always use Turgurs to pull as I want the PL'ees defense to go up as well.  I usually use a slow that I recieved at about the same level as the mob that is targeted.  Ive found that to be most effective in helping gain skill ups in defense and dodge.<br />
<br />
Also, deep reds are not always the way to go with PLing.  I tend to try and find places with mixtures of yellows and reds to kill, as kill times are usually shorter and you can fit more mobs into the same time frame.  As soon as there are more evens than yellows its time to find a new spot.  Blues arent effective PL devices untill 50ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a 65 rogue with 55 AA and 15 days played. This is how you do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It can be done from lvl 1, and easy as ****. At low lvls, you pull a mob, root it near you, it aggro's on you... use a DS potion (33 ds at 65 approx) and your PLee only has to hit it once to gain full xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
After your PLee is 50 or so, you can just slow the mob and use a dot to keep agro, you don't need a Ds potion altho it makes things faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
You train defensive skills by dueling the PLee with your shaman, as pets raise (and i confirm it works).<br />
<br />
<br />
1-24 = paludal<br />
24 - 35 = OT<br />
35 - 46 = HK<br />
46 - 60 = PON<br />
60-65 = POV<br />
<br />
<br />
He dinged 65 a month irl after i started with 3-4 hours of playtime a day, and with about 7 days total play time (and had epic and above average gear too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also forgot to add with KEI on your shaman you can PL your rogue an AA every hour no problem in any south wing camp in BOT... xp is about the same if you chain pull in POV wastelands but a little harder. You can also PL an AA every hour approximately in pota arena, although adds and no horse make it not as desirable. Never tried HOH yet, but I can 3box a bard also so I should since single pulling isn't an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One good PL method that's hard to pull off efficiently, but might be worth mentioning:<br />
<br />
Drink DS potion.  (can't have twink drink since it will only be like 5 pts)<br />
pull lots of mobs.  They must be mobs that flee on low HP's.  When the mob's kill themselves enough and start to flee, twink kills them.<br />
<br />
<br />
This process works alot better with a druid casting the DS on the twink with mobs that don't flee, but you gotta work with what you got :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Another great way to plvl a group of ppl in there 30's is go to the fort in FM.   Sit there and chain pull infront of a semi-self sufficient group.   Hit all the giants twice with the JBB and have group finish.   More than 2 blasts will cause you to KS, you can get away with 3 blasts on the brae's, but....    This technique can be adapted to any zone with a little tuning but doesn't work too well past 40 I'd bet.    I usually do this when a few guildies are having an alt party :P   It's a blast too !<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues and other high DPS classes are easy to &quot;plvl&quot; although it's not too much of a plvl....    Go to PoI and tank for them, drop 1 bane on the mob (maybe blood too, didn't have it at the time).  Rogue should easily and quickly out damage you.   <br />
<br />
<br />
As for getting plvl'd, the best way I've found was with a monk.   Slow, let monk kill, monk FD's at 10%, you nuke a few times and he finishes.    Got through 59 this way :P   This method works well at high levels which is nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the lvl of mobs to plvl with, I'd agree with Thor on the con, although with mele's, killing can be *slow* vs a red con.<br />
<br />
Best way to plvl a high 50's person though, is to just invite them into your groups.   Nothing can compare to the high kill rate of a full powered group, as long as they don't mind carrying a low lvl person =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've currently started PLing a mage.  For the low levels I have a lvl46 Druid to use to PL him.  Right now its Summon/Arm pet, DS it, give it HP buff and sick it on the mobs.  The DS on the pet does most the work.  I figure this will work til about 20 or so then I will need to move over to my shaman and duo from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah no way do you pull with slow.  Let the thing beat on your Powerlevelee and heal as needed.  That way they get half decent Defense skillups.<br />
<br />
Keep Chloro/HoS/Alacrity on at all times, really no other buffs needed except possibly Spirit of Bih'Li for the extra ATK.<br />
<br />
One trick: pull 3-4 mobs, root them all, epic them all, and zone or camp.  PLee whacks all the mobs, doing at least a few points of damage to each.  Epic dot kills the mob, PLee gets the credit.  Works best for casters in the mid-20's and up, when melee can take a long time.  I do use slow on these mobs since the PLee has to tank them solo for a while while I zone.</div></div><hr />

Def skills are just a matter of sticking a pet on the twink and healing them every 5 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sure, you can do that, but it isn't any better than letting the mobs do it.  Unless the mob is stunning him a lot, it doesn't slow down the PLee any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1) Buff low level character up with Sta, AC, HP buff, Regen,haste.<br />
<br />
Have the person you are PLing pull.<br />
<br />
Heal heal<br />
<br />
once the mob is at around 45 percent, send in Doggie to finish the mob off.<br />
<br />
Its faster this way.<br />
<br />
Dont slow cause defense skill wont go up as fast.<br />
<br />
As for PLing a Shaman, a Monk is the best PLer in the game.  <br />
<br />
I PLd my shaman in velks with my monk out of group.  <br />
<br />
Monk Pulls<br />
<br />
Shaman slows<br />
<br />
Once mob is at 50 percent, cast DOT<br />
<br />
Once mob is at 3 % (you will get the timing down) Monk will FD.<br />
<br />
Spider bites Shaman<br />
<br />
Doggie gets pissed and attacks Spider.<br />
<br />
Mob dies<br />
<br />
Shaman gets full exp.<br />
<br />
Note:  Its important you dont send the pet in at the beginning as  you dont want the pet outdamaging the Shaman. For some reason, I seem to get less exp if doggie outdamages me.<br />
<br />
Spiders in Velks are awesome as they dont run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">will a necro FD work like the Monk FD if so you can burn it down witha necro and FD at 10% as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used to power level my lowbie guildies being the cool Guild Leader that I was. ;-)<br />
<br />
Nagafen's Lair:  Zone in through Sol A though.  Pull Dogs to the zone line with a slow.  I had lvl 16s to 35s down here and they were able to kill the dogs as they hit so slow with Turgur's on them.  They get easy to hit with Cripple on them as well.  Even the caster dogs died quick and the Xp was awesome.  This is also a good spot to solo if you are 45-50.<br />
<br />
Dawshroud Peaks:  Lvls 16-35.  The Tribals Camp outside the Maiden's Eye zone Entrance.  This Camp is a great place to power Level.  These guys are little higher then the dogs above in level, but they also drop Acrylia and Polished Steel Ulaks.  The spawn rate keeps the pulls coming.  Slow/Cripple is a must for these boys.<br />
<br />
Infected Paw:  Lvls 16-35. This is a hole in the ground in the center of South Karana.  These Gnolls are big and hit pretty hard.  Usually people dou them around lvls 30-35.  But bring your teenager down here and Soak up the 20% XP bonus in this zone.  Cripple/Slow is a must here as well. Magic Resistance is a good Idea too because you might pull an Enchanter that could enchanter your teenager and get him to smack on you!.<br />
<br />
Paldula Caverns:  To level 25... no place better..<br />
<br />
BUFFING:<br />
If I'm only Power Leveling 1 person I will Buffing them with every buff I have that will stick on them.  IF it's a group I buff the MT with everything I have and HoS/Haste the rest of the Group.  I also buff Myself to the Max because I take most of the hits.<br />
<br />
PULLING:  Slow to pull.  Then Cripple.  If the Plved can't take hits then you Simply root them to hold the argo and stab them till they are down to a little more then 1/2 alive.  I don't use a pet when Plvling because it tends to do way to much damage and controlling can be an issue.  If you insist on using a pet it's better to let the Pet be the one that kills the creature and let the plvled take it past 1/2 dead.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of! Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i did my rogue by pulling a huge train and letting them beat on me while rogue melee on them , when rogue was getting aggro i would root and stand close so mob would be on me. This worked will in SolA.<br />
<br />
But it boils down to, if you wanna really powerlevel, get a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, deep reds are not always the way to go with PLing.

<br />
It may just be me, but it also seems there is a cap on how much XP the PLee is going to get, regardless of how much higher the mob is.<br />
<br />
When I PL'd my dual box Cleric, I did pretty much the same as is being said most often here:<br />
<br />
Buff the hell out of the PLee (I toss every combat buff the Shammy has. He isn't going to use much mana aside from that, so why not?)<br />
<br />
Have PLee run out and grab as many mobs as he can find (I was pulling 12 to 16 in the Warrens when I PL'd 2 clerics at one)<br />
<br />
If you feel like it (i.e., if the PLee is having trouble killing the mob off quickly) send in dogdog at around 40%.<br />
<br />
Heal as needed.<br />
<br />
Until the Cleric hit 35 and started actually grouping with my Shammy, I hardly ever slowed, because I wanted the defensive skillups. I'd only slow if the mob was one that hit really fast and hard.<br />
<br />
Now that the Cleric is able to group with my Shammy for XP, they just stay grouped and go after whatever is handy in Dulak. Shammy gets minor XP at 52, Cleric is starting to slow down. Time to leave the SW corner, I guess.<br />
<br />
My Cleric is now 40 and my Shammy just dinged 52 last night (and is going on an all AA diet when he gets to 20%...he has a Mage to PL next)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Post 44 CoM is great because you can actually group with the person to help kill. Since mobs will be green to past 60 folks you dont take any of the xp. I got a 47 cleric half of 48 in about 2 hours. That was with lots of afk breaks. One scourge of nife would kill most mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Speaking of pets and powerleveling, has anyone tried suspend minion?   If the damage done by your pet was linked to your pet and not to you, maybe when the pet was suspended, it would be like zoning in terms of who gets the XP.<br />
<br />
That would be sweet depending on the refresh of suspend minion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">can't suspend pet if he's on a mobs hate list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Since mobs will be green to past 60 folks you dont take any of the xp.<br />
<br />
I don't think that's true. Seems to me (from doing the above suggested thing in CoM) that the high level takes xp but it just gets tossed away.<br />
<br />
When mobs were green to me but blue to Amorae, she got less xp grouped with me (something like 1% every 2 kills) than when she killed them solo (1-1.5% per kill). It's the main reason I've only targeted mobs that I can tear through quickly (and assassinate) rather than slightly higher level ones that take me a bit to beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm, wonder if thats true Trena. Even if it is I bet you still get more xp grouped since you can kill a lot faster.<br />
<br />
Tox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Definately best places are PC til 25, Gunthak beach is good til 35, CoM til you cant stand it anymore and then HK nobles/bards. And have the shaman out of group because you will notice a reduction in XP even when the mobs are green to the shaman.</div></div><hr />
