<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A RL friend suggested that I post my current UI settings, so here goes. If you want me to post the XML sheets I used let me know. I did not create any of the XML myself, just gathered them from various web sites.<br />
<br />
My screen in set to a resolution of 1024x768 with a /viewport of 800x600. The additional screen space  contains all of my main boxes. I get a full 800x600 screen with no clutter. <br />
Entire Screen (http://www.drachan.com/images/ui/m.gif)<br />
<br />
On the top right, you can see the Player Info, Target, Group, Actions (stays minimized), and Melee message windows.<br />

<br />
On the bottom right, you can see the Text Buff window, and the Main Chat Screen.<br />

<br />
The Text Buffs display Blue for benificial buffs and Red for negative buffs.<br />

There are 4 Chat windows on my setup, but normally only 2 are visable.<br />

The two hidden windows are minimized right above the other two as shown here.<br />

The two hidden windows fade to clear, as shown here.<br />

Are you/can you filtering types of hits in the melee window? I want to have like the old /hitsmode was and have 3 windows or less as needed, one for each type of hit that FADE away after a time along with the text.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can some spell effects be filtered? or can you change color on important spell effects such as target_01 yawns. or target_02 glances nervously about. or target_03 looks very unconfortable.<br />
<br />
Would really like to change color on those important messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">chat text color is still controlled in the same way it has been for a long time. Meaning that all spell text is the same color, all &quot;soandso hits you&quot; is the same color, etc. You can change the text colors now in the options menu though, instead of typing the rgb values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I now feel very stupid...<br />
<br />
I had only thought about /viewport once and it never occurred to me to use it again.  Sadly enough, weeks later, this is the first mod that made me realize the greatness of viewport :(<br />
<br />
Time to turn up the screen resolution hehe.</div></div><hr />
