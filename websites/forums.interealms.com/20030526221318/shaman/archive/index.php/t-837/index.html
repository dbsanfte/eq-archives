<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had never seen Malo or Torpor for sale before.  The last few days, I've been handing out trading and I've seen three copies for sale at prices of 8k, 10k and 15k.  Am I an idiot for not buying it now (I'm only 54, will be awhile to scribe) or is this thing going to drop down even more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, what server is this?<br />
<br />
To me, it seems rarer than ever.  2 60 shaman in my guild don't have it, and I know of several others who are hunting for it as well.  I was offered 50k on the spot when I won my copy, and I've heard for it going for 70k.<br />
<br />
So, if I were you and I had the plat, I would go ahead and buy a copy.   Oh, and just be sure the seller doesn't try to pass Mala off on you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's on Povar... I know it can't be all the lvl 60 spells that are common, because I've seen people trying to trade a fungi and 20k for torpor and having no luck...  Thanks for the heads up, I'll try and snag a copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dunno how you define recently,but in last few weeks or last month,my guild got 2  torpor,1malo.Also 1pox.<br />
<br />
Ex-guild got 3 torpor 0 malo.<br />
<br />
I guess it was lucky days to balance all the bad luck during last months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Torpor has gotten more common since they upped the drop rate (or maybe upped it again without saying so) a couple months back.  I say that 1) because I got a copy which I thought would never happen and 2) I've seen 2 or 3 copies for sale/trade since then having NEVER seen one auctioned before then.  I think I've seen one Malo auctioned since then (trading for c3/blessing of Aego), also NEVER having seen it before.  <br />
<br />
If you saw a copy for less than 50k, I'd buy it (all of them actually).  Save them for guild shammies or friends as this spell is invaluable at 60 and still hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On the Rathe Malo doesn't seem to be dropping any faster than normal. Going price is still 50k. <br />
<br />
I got mine 2 days ago by having a friend get me a deal for 25k from a guy that was gonna charge me 50k :P Lucky me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still dont have Malo. <br />
<br />
Have Torpor, but it was given to me by a guildmate (still dont know where he got it, but damn glad he did). <br />
<br />
Bought Focus for 500 plats when I was 59th. <br />
<br />
Was given Avatar months and months ago, by a friend who used to lead Sev raids often. But, at least I've seen this drop once or twice on raids. <br />
<br />
So, for level 60 spells on my part, never actually found a single one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bumbek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure but i saw someone doing PC on malo for 100k(!) on MT.<br />
I think thats a bit overpriced tho considered that i got it as cheap as only typing /ran 420 :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mez c it 2 times in da last week on Vaz....<br />
<br />
Both times da spell sadist wanted 20 30k for da malo.<br />
<br />
Mez have dat much but mez need a jbb and got a long<br />
way to go before 60.<br />
<br />
The second copy was being sold buy a monk in a guild I was <br />
once in.  Mez know most of da shamans in that guild stay<br />
in touch with a couple of them.   Only one of dem have Malo,  kind of made me want to barf up dat gnome I had for dinna.<br />
<br />
Guud Bashing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Radag, that would make me sick also.  I can't imagine to many guilds would allow that.  Malo is almost a guild benifit only spell, if anyone in my guild tried to sell that spell, they would be booted immediatly unless it was some extremely weird circumstance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/shrug...who knows where the monk got malo from.  Doesn't necessarily mean he swiped it from the guild bank.<br />
<br />
If I got malo from say the Emp in the crypt, you bet your ass that's not going to guild funds.</div></div><hr />
