<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skeezzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all this is my first post on this bored. I currently play a warrior on the Xev server. I'm looking to start an alt to play when i just cant take my warrior anymore. I really had no clue about shamans until the other day when i was grouped with an excellent one (just didnt sit and heal). This lead me to go check out this class a little more and I was pleasently supprised at what you can do with that spell line up. I would like to start playing a shaman just for when i get bored with the warrior. I really like Iksar and I'm not a huge fan of any other shammy races. Now is the no plate thing going to really hurt me? Also what type of armor should i look to start out with if I play an iksar. I have some money to help this char out with but my warrior is still my main and get most of the cash. I could probably spend 2k to get this char going with some ok items. Any suggestion from you guys would help me out alot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the lizzy quests for their culture armor or whatever they call it. They are a lot of fun and pretty good for just starting out.<br />
<br />
Major item I am sure you will read about is the JBB which is free nuking at L45, 236dmg blah blah. Well anyway being a lizard you won't be able to use this item, if that does not bother ya then keep going.<br />
<br />
As for no plate.. na does not matter really. Some high end shaman with AC's in the 1300-1400 range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iksar is a good choice for a Shaman (hey I'm bias) anyway, one thing to know about Iksars..HUGE exp penalty and we can't use the most sought after Shaman toy available the JBB (jaundiced bone bracer). Regen and AC bonus is killer though, most Iksar shaman have more AC than some shaman higher level with better gear.<br />
Don't let the no-plate thing bug you....granted iksars do not get alot of choices as far as mid-level armor goes but we can wear most of the high end armors ex:Thurg, Kael, PoG armor. <br />
Rygorr armor is a good choice you can wear that until 50's. Shoudn't cost you that much. Good piercer and a shield should get you started without costing alot.<br />
Spine chill spear - not sure how much those run<br />
Clay Guardian or Charred Guardian (I prefer Clay myself)<br />
Slime Coated Harpoon - will run you a bit less than Spine Chill Spear.</div></div><hr />
