I am probably going to start working on this tonight to find where things are and what not, but for some of the kills I'll need a lil help (some of the mobs I have to kill are unsnarable/unrootable).  So, if anyone has some pointers on this, or can help me out a bit with the killins on Friday lemme know please :).  Thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">K, uhh. Paying 50PP for help in getting to PoM to complete this quest.  Hehe, reading through the quest I found out I won't be doing this one soon, have to go to PoM and kill a dirgy unicorn for his horn.  Soo, nm on dis. <br />
<br />
That does bring up another question, anyone been to PoM? It would be interesting, though a @#$@$ to get to. (Curiosity here hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alot of us started the quest but have droped it because<br />
<br />
1:  One of the kills is named in CS....and being on Dragon Faction this was bad....Not that big of a deal at this point easy to fix that faction hit.<br />
<br />
2: And the real reson I droped an most of us did....You have to kill the Tainted Unicorn in PoM.  Only know why into PoM is through Forbidden Hall refer to first part of #1.<br />
<br />
But you are right this is a very nice ring...and to this point no one on Veeshan has completed it.  The guilds that can or do go to PoM have pretty much blowen their PoG Faction and can not complete it.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has KoE ever gone to the Plane of Mischief?  If so what factions are hit there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KoE has not been to PoM....only way to get there is to kill in Forbidden Hall in ToV.  KoE is at this time on Dragon Faction so we can not kill in Forbidden Hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">other way to do itis an insanely long flipflop drag a mage corpse to the portal by a monky and rezz the mage with one of those goo things from DN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ring has been completed.  I finished mine with a jaunt into PoM a couple months ago.  Very nice ring btw :)<br />
<br />
This quest was a pita just because some of the mobs that you have to turn items in to are needed dead for Kael quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did a little more looking, and I rememered that I completed all but the PoM portion of this quest while on CoV faction.  The hit from the mob in CS appeared to be very small, and I think it was completed with a couple of the spiderleg quests in Skyshrine.  Also, you will be killing a couple giants to work on the quest as well, which will get you more of the CoV faction back.<br />
<br />
As for PoM, getting to Lithiniath is very easy when you get to the plane.  She was a pita chanter mob that did a lot of blinding and fearing, but no charming.  I think we killed her with 1 group plus a couple people.  I don't think we even had a cleric with us at the time.  I would just recommend keeping your eyes open for any non-CoV guild killing through NToV and see if they can CoH some of your mages once they get the area around the zone to the plane cleared.  Then call a group or two in to kill her.  The plane itself is VERY odd, and I recommend as many people as possible read up on it before going there.</div></div><hr />
