<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 2 accounts and 2 computers.  I just bought 2 new computers online today to replace my current ones.  EQ Tech said by email that I just load the basic game and expansions without the key then logon and everything will be ok.  I have the discs except for LoY which was downloaded at the time.  Will the system know to download LoY?<br />
<br />
Also, will I have to set up all my hot keys again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hichar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might be able to get away with pulling it all off the old hard drives.   You'll have to tell it to DL LoY again by going into advanced.  If you don't want to reset your hotkeys, UI, etc., grab ALL .ini files out of your EQ directory and put them in the new directory.  Hope that helps.<br />
