The simple answer is this: We are going to continue to support EverQuest. As a matter of fact, we have two new expansions in the works. The first one's coming this Fall, and its focus is on dungeons! <br />
<br />
Thank God.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I'll go ahead and start the list of people that won't be buying this one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea that package deal really does look good. Planetside, Everquest and EQ2 are worth it alone if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You guys really have enough time to be uber at EQ, EQ2, and planetside. Did you just win the lotto and have time to just play games? I mean, when I played EQ it was a minimum 4 hour session to get anything done. Planetside takes at least a hour anymore to take a base. How on earth would you have time for this?</div></div><hr />

Try this link. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right. I didn't even think about it before but it IS a very good deal. I did the math for just PS, EQ1 and EQ2.<br />
<br />
Say they were $12.95 for each per month. $12.95 x 3 = $38.85. $38.85 - $21.99 = a total of $16.86 savings, just for those three games. I think if I upgrade my computer I may get Planetside and *maybe* EQ2. Dunno yet though, still waiting for WoW.</div></div><hr />

Woot!  2nd in line! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hate those red letters that say &quot;Not all expansions enabled.&quot;  I seriously just hate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just read the full article.............if you can call it that.  Straight up ad mixed with their next gimmik to get people to pay more and buy more of their games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yer all right about SOE. They are the evil empire trying to suck our money away from us. We shouldn't just stop at not buying the next stupid expansion, we should all quit playing their suxor game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess I'm the odd one, excited about more dungeons coming out. With all the Honors-LOIO crowd wanting to head to PoP, that will leave the dungeons for those of us who always enjoyed a good crawl with our friends. Not to mention dungeons generally come with an EXP modifier, so hopefully it will net you the same experience as a PoV/PoS group, if not BoT quality depending on the dungeon's difficulty and MoB population. Killing your way in and out without a Graveyard to wait at for your corpses was some of the most fun I ever had. I still remember my first trips to LGuk, Charisis and Sebilis clearly, and most of those happened years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">EQ doesnt take 4 hours to get anything done. There is no law saying you have to play them all in one night or even one week. You can mix them up quite easily, atleast thats what i like , variety. Frankly if EQ2 is good and EQ remains on its improving course and PS turns out ok , i can see myself not getting bored for a long time to come with my GF, good books and these 3 games :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;From this point on you will see a constantly updated Web page that shows what we're working on for the next patch, and what's down the road a little further&quot;<br />
<br />
If this actually becomes a practice, instead of the past half-assed VI communication jobs, I think it's easily as interesting as the dungeon thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I bought LoY for only stoicism, no other reason.  I was in the LoY zones long enough to do the quest (haha I got my bottle on the first pirate I killed).<br />
<br />
If the next expansion is centered around dungeons you better believe I will be buying this one.  There is nothing more fun than getting some friends together and doing a dungeon.<br />
<br />
As long as EQ is fun for me, I dont mind spending 20-30 bucks each expansion.  Are you people really that poor?  I make sh!t, I mean literally, I make almost no money at all (i.e. 16k-17k a year) and can afford to buy a game each month.<br />
<br />
Oh well, sony's evil plan to make money is working on me. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was really excited about PoP when they first started talking about it: it was going to be 'group orientated'.  Odd then that access to most of the expansion was dependent on whether your guild was good enough to get you there.  Or am I missing something here: should my group be discussing tactics on how we get flagged for Plane of Time?<br />
<br />
Even if I believe the new expansion is genuinely going to be dungeon orientated, what does this mean?<br />
<br />
Are they going to be the multi-instanced dungeons that EQ needs so that you don't simply enter it and find everywhere camped out, or you get trained by idiot noob_999 after 10minutes?  I'd bet no, there's an obvious need for it, but I don't think the current dev. team is capable of an expansion in anything but the most limited sense of the word.<br />
<br />
The number one thing I'd like from the next expansion is an honest description from SOE of what it will contain.<br />
<br />
I'd bet money that, knowing they don't have anything really new to offer, they'll bribe us to buy the expansion by some means.  Lets remember:<br />
<br />
PoP - Easy travel via PoK<br />
<br />
LoY - Extra bank slots<br />
<br />
I'd guess 2 extra spell slots for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely no way I'll have time to play yet another MMoRPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you're the right sort of level (50-60) LoY has some good dungeon like zones. Torigan Mines, Crypt of Nadox, Hates Fury - all indoor zones with lots of mobs, and some good loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally I won't be doing this. I've been in the Planetside beta for about 2 and a half months now, and frankly it isn't living up to its hype. The big fights accomplish nothing, like they are sorta fun, but when you sit on a bridge for 3 hours and nothing really changes you begin to wonder why you are doing it. There is no real reason to capture bases, it doesn't effect the world as a whole. The only thing that happens when you capture a continent is you can broadcast (shout) over the whole area. Whoopty freakin do.<br />
<br />
Adding cities, and bonuses for captures, and contient lock would have been cool, but it's for not. They could do this, wait another couple of months for release, but this is SoE. Oh add the fact that once you hit about BR9 (level 9) you can do just about any ability in the game, with the ability to unlearn certs.<br />
<br />
I was a huge proponent of the game at first, but I have been in error. (Oh and yes, you really do need an hour or so to accomplish anything in Planetside now, base captures exp is based on time spent in the Sphere of Influence IE if you spend the full 25 minutes in the base regardless of whether its defended you get more exp)<br />
<br />
As for everquest and everquest 2. I haven't see anything from SoE indicating that EQ2 is anywhere near done, or within 6 months of being done. Where was the beta testing? You'd think with so many people playing EQ, with years of experience, it would make sense to tap that resource and spend a year with your players developing the game. No, that would be to easy, and be out character for SoE.<br />
<br />
Then lastly, the time restraints. First problem is with EQ/EQ2 you cannot be in an uber guild in both. So any potential uber players won't be playing both. Secondly, unlike Shamans (for the most part), non soloing classes do require 4+ hours to get anything done. Most people don't get groups right away. I dunno, these are just my not very well thought out reasons rip em apart if ya like.<br />
<br />
Oh one kudos to SoE. Good job not screwing over Legends people by making them pay more for this deal, you've already dicked them over so much as it is.</div></div><hr />

Read it again. Legends subscribers get this at &quot;no extra cost&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nice gesture, but kinda hollow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, that's what i said, they don't have to pay more to get this deal. Guess i should've been a bit more clear. Anyway, I agree hollow for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">DOH! My bad. Missed the &quot;not&quot; part. LOL<br />
<br />
Way too much drama going on this morning. Was distracted. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know that Sony bought VI or whatever happened where VI is not making EQ anymore, but when was this?  I have been playing for less than a year, so I guess it was before that.  SOE seems to be making a lot of progress lately in making the game experience better.  Fixing old problems, better player base communication, better expansions (hopefully), etc.  I know that everything is not perfect, but it seems things are certainly headed in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">better expansions?<br />
<br />
The problem with soe is they have no pride in their work.  They have no problems spending 6 months on an expansion and calling it finished.  Velious and Kunark took well over a year to develope, and that was just the time that it was made public.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Anyone else notice that every 6 months or so Smedley or someone else comes out with a new way to communicate with the players?<br />
<br />
So.....why aren't they communicating with us though the 4 or so other ways they promised they would?  This was an announcement to be spread to those who have left to give them false hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think that the pricing structure that they have in place is actually a good deal.  Granted I may not play all of those games, but at the same time if I were going to play EQ2 or get EQOA for my PS2, I think that it would be well worth it.  I for one am greatly excited about the upcoming dungeon based expansion.  I for one can't stand POP for all of the outdoor zones.  It trivializes the game a ton.</div></div><hr />
