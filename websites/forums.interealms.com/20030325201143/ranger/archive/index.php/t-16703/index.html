<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kessca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 60 shaman that I 2-box with now...but really all he does is stand around and buff/haste/slow for me. (He's rather gimped at them moment since I traded his gear to my now 52 ranger). Is there another class that I could make that will complement this arrangement? Not looking to do 2-box  fighting, but one that I can log onto after the I have my shammy buffs...any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope a 60 Shaman is what all rangers dream of having, slows, haste and Topor.<br />
<br />
IT IS THE BEST YOU WILL GET :p<br />
<br />
sorry for the caps but I am envious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also remember that your lvl 60 shamen has a nice pet and DoTs for additional Damage, even when going ungrouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>daktarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Erlanthir.  You're not likely to find a better bot.  Slow/haste/buff/cheal...  can't really ask for much more.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye, putting that pet in might only do 40-50dmg, but think of it like, thats having a high lvl warrior there aswell /grin....plus slows, DoTs they can be a very effective dmg dealer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">erm thats 40-50dmg per hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're good, the best exp in the game can be a duo with a charming enchanter.  Both chars require a lot of work though and it may not be doable two-boxing.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shammy is a real good choice.  I went with a druid, however, for the simple reason that I was tired of running around all the time.  Sure, haste and slows are nice, not to mention the pet, but with my somewhat limited playtime I find it easier to have a porter on tap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman ownz. Only person I would take in place of one would be a cleric and its a far shot to be honest.<br />
And FYI with Project Alpha and Celrity a shaman pet can do some pretty respectable damage.....quadding for 53 (the max hit the level 55 pet can do) and kicking and bashing...not a bad combo when combined with your work as a ranger....<br />
FYI I have a shaman main :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vindikael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At the lower levels, a high end druid is far better than a shaman to have because of the damage sheild. This however changes in the early 40s. After that ... forget it .. Shaman all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I beg to differ. For the poster a shaman is still a pretty decent 2box, but once you level up some you're not going to be wanting to tank anything. And if you're powerlevel-2boxing levelling up isnt going to take all that long.<br />
<br />
65 enchanter, Command of Druzzil, halls of honour. Go to one of the trial room areas with plenty of room for autorun, etc. Harmony + Snare to split door guards, autorun into a wall while the snared one slowly chugs after you and switch to your enchanter, charm snared guard, set on harmonied guard, root harmonied guard, slow rooted guard,  switch to ranger, archery plink, watching pet health bar in group to see when it breaks.<br />
<br />
Once you're comfortable, start hasting the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So shaman rock eh? Hmmmm....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hunters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ill chime in since I 2box a cleric.  The rez and buffs are nice but Id probably trade the rez for a slow.  If I don't have a slower, I have to grind on lvl 53 and down mobs in PoD.  The exp is ok, 1% aa for each toon each kill.  But when I have a slower, I can move up to lvl 57-58 mobs and exp comes in better.<br />
<br />
I think you have your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Uh, to all the people saying the shammy is the best partner, I'd choose an enchanter at those high lvls any day of the week if they knew anything about charm kiting.  Charm duo exp is superior to anything else you might find in the game atm, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you can pull it off, enchanter charm + ranger snare/bow = really nice exp.  Have the ranger snare a mob then the enchanter charm it as a pet.  Pull another of the same mob, snare it, sic the pet on it, but don't slow it.  Have ranger bow attack the mob.  Mob should die very quickly, and its enrage should do sizable damage to the pet.  Have enchanter break charm, root former pet, and finish it off with bow.  Two mobs dead faster than most six-person exp groups can kill one mob.  Just make sure you have plenty of free room to run and choose mobs can't summon, otherwise a premature break of charm could kill both ranger and enchanter.  Another tactic is to slow the mob and keep the pet for 2-3 battles before finishing it off, either way works fine.</div></div><hr />
