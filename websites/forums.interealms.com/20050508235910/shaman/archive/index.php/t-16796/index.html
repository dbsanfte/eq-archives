<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what would u rather group with a ranger or a nec<br />
when u are a lev 33 ik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on the situation.  Necros are GREAT dps, but they can't take a beating if you get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is this a duo?  Or a group of 5 that is looking for one more and has to chooose between the 2?<br />
<br />
Either class can put out good DPS.  I think ranger edges out Necro if certain AA's are aquired (EQ and AM)  Necro can keep going almost non stop because uf insane mana regen, which the shaman only helps with heals and regens.  <br />
<br />
Ranger can also go almost non stop, as long as he/she is not tanking and plinking with arrows from a distance.<br />
<br />
Either would make a good duo partner or addition to a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what would u rather group with a ranger or a nec<br />
<br />
A exp duo - necro<br />
A farming duo - ranger<br />
<br />
A full group - ranger (especially AA rangers)<br />
<br />
duo'ing with a necro is much more effective then with a ranger, IMHO<br />
<br />
necro = dots and pet damage while kitting<br />
shaman = slow and dot, pet damage and the RARE heal<br />
<br />
VS<br />
<br />
ranger = dps, snare, baby dots<br />
shaman = slow, pet damage, &amp; heal heal heal heal heal heal heal etc...<br />
<br />
Less damage output with ranger/shaman pair, longer fights, which amounts to less exp over the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
The only way this is different is if the ranger is fear kiting, which isn't possible *that I know of* over level 56 (soloing in JP). Then the ranger might as well just solo, he doesn't need a partner, just like most necros don't need a partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Necro.<br />
<br />
Nasty spells, nasty pets, can FD on wipe, can res you in, can feed you mana, can snare, and they have a healthy understanding of the God O' Fear.<br />
<br />
I still have much &lt;3 for the ranjahs, but I have definitely pushed my gaming more with necs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">he's LVL 33...<br />
<br />
necro's better all the way till a ranger can get EQ/AM3<br />
<br />
but at that point you won't be melee'n as a duo much so necro with snare and eleventybillion (sorry my 6 year old sons favorite word stuck on me) dots that stack,</div></div><hr />
