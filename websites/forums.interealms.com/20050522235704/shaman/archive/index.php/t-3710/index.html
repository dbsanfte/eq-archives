<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if you can change what graphics are used for the spell icons?<br />
I'm sure I'll get used to the new Icons, but I'd rather not have to.<br />
Personally, what I'd like to see is something simple and easy to recognize.<br />
I'd to basicly take the symbols that were being used before, and just have a small word written across the buff icon to say what it is.<br />
For example, put &quot;RH&quot; overtop of that blue fist for Righteous Health, and &quot;FoS&quot; overtop of the yellow shield for Focus of Spirit, &quot;GFoS&quot; for Khura's Focusing (group fos), &quot;Aeg&quot; for Aegolism, etc...<br />
Is this possible to do with the current UI, and if so, can anyone give me any pointers on how I can learn how to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New UI is nice. Bazaar is great to sell / buy stuff . But new spell icon or effect icon ??<br />
Bah.. I'd rather play with old UI than spending 3 sec each time I want to cast to find what spell I want to cast..<br />
I spend ages trying to find my spell in my book now that my &quot;sort&quot; is all messed ...<br />
the spell book, I don't care, I ll sort my spell again.. but the icon..<br />
the color was usefull.. purple for group, yellow for self etc.. <br />
It's impossible to say what the icon represent when in the spell bar..<br />
Yes old icon were not &quot;nice&quot; but they were usable.. focus = shield. group focus = shield and purple icon. easy !<br />
now.. we have focus = that thingy that is the shaman class icon.. and group focus = the same with maybe 1 or 2 more pixel because it's the l33t group spell ......<br />
<br />
I want a way to get my old icon back /cry<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes you can change the icons.  They're just .tga files, which are only modified bitmaps.  Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro should be able to play around with them. I'm already working on my new spell icons.  I don't like the ones they used.  I'll probably just make mine like the old ones since I used those for 3 years :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Azmodai, please please please post them when you get done.  (Although I do really like the new CoP buff icon).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem you will have trying to change the spell icons to say the name of the spell is that certain spells share the same icons.<br />
<br />
For those that want the old icons as they dont know what the new ones are - have you tried holding down the alt key? It displays the name of the spell next to the gem.  Whist I realise it may take time to get used to the different icons I dont see how it can be any different to having a muscly arm symbol - unless you have just memmed it there was no way of telling a whole chunk of our spells apart just from looking at the icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sure thing, Gloriana. Give me a few days to do it as I was working on it at work, and about 10 minutes ago I got a stack of work handed to me :P  I'm make sure to post em tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I found what I was looking for.<br />
This is what my current icon looks like for any shaman hp buff spell.  It's not accurate for lower level buffs, but as a 60 shaman I don't care about lower level shaman buffs.  :)<br />

I'm going to recreate the old icons, with a bit of writing on them, so you can tell what buffs are up at a moment's notice.</div></div><hr />

so you can tell what buffs are up at a moment's notice. <br />
<br />
Don't forget you can hit the &quot;ALT&quot; key to get all the mouseovers to show. Works for spells you have scribed and spells you have in your buff bar.; doesnt help for the spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know you can do that Gorre.  It's annoying to have to do though.  As well, I have 2 rows of buff icons on my lower right portion of the screen display.  If you put your buff icons horizontally, it's really hard to associate which buff belongs with which icon.  If you put it at the bottom right like I did, then you actually have those labels overlapping each other.  NOT useful at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spent last 2 days with raid buffs and such. Overall the new icons work for me once you learn them. They don't double up anymore so you can actually tell what you have now when looking.<br />
<br />
The only Icons I was dissappointed with after learning the new looks is for Malo/Malosini. They are a lame wolf head with fire above them.<br />
I just changed the background around the picture back to Black and its sooo much better now. Closer to what it use to be.<br />
<br />
Also the regrows,regens,heal over times all use the same icon. (3 small blue hearts). This is rather confusing because you can't tell what you have loaded, or what effect is actually on you. <br />
Since they all use the same icon, I don't think there is any way to correct this since 1 change to the file changes them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not having probs with my own spells, but bard songs and some other class buffs are driving me nuts!  I keep looking for that KEI head and it just don't show.<br />
<br />
The new refresh fade has my timing a bit outta whack too :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not a big fan of the new spell icons, but since I almost always put the same spells in the same gem slots, it really hasn't affected me that much.  Well, once I got my spell book put back together, that is...lol...<br />

With &lt;ALT&gt; showing names, I expect to get less requests to renew Harness when what Tank01 really lost was some cleric buff.</div></div><hr />
