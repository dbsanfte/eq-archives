<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have an ikky friend who really needs an EB item. He has the three Shissar organs for the Amulet of the Grey Wastes quest in Katta but is KoS there. Instead of killing thousands of Coterie, would it be possible, with the new changes to faction adjustments for illusions, for an enchanter to make my ikky friend an elf to do the turn in for the amulet? If so, how long does and enchanter illusion spell last? Does it drop when you try to trade? Can any of the vamps or guards in Katta see through the illusion? <br />
<br />
Neither of us has any experience with illusions and the one chanter we know who would be willing to help us wasn't sure either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't answer much of your illusion questions except that the illusion stays on you for 36min (longer if the chanter has longer duration buff AAs).<br />
<br />
What I can tell you is an alternate method for KOS people.  I've done this myself for this quest, so I know it works.  You need a non KOS luller who can cast invis with you (must be a separate individual regardless if you have these spells).  Go to the room with the quest npc while you are invis'd.  The Luller/Inviser casts Lull/Harmony on the quest npc (an aggro resist would suck, but it's possible).  Now you take off invis and slowly walk up to the quest npc while clicking on it with a shissar organ in your hand.  As soon as the trade window opens, STOP, and put the other two organs in the windows.  Now have your friend cast invis on you.  Now you hit trade while invis'd.<br />
<br />
The npc won't aggro because it's aggro ranged is reduced to almost nothing by the lull/harmony as long as you open the trade window from as far away as you can.  You'll be indifferent to the npc when you are invis'd, but you can only open a trade window when not invis'd, hence the part of your friend casting invis on you AFTER you open the trade window and BEFORE you hit the trade button.<br />
<br />
Credit goes to my druid friend who informed me of this method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pre illusion change....my enchanter was dubious to katta guards in illusion.  She worships inny so I assume that was screwing her up.    I never invis'ed in to check the turn in guy though I want to :-)</div></div><hr />
