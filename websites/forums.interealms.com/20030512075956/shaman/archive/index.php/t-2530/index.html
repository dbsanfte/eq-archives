<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so far I have only one Focus effect I am really in love with, that is my recent find of the Amulet of Insight.   Quite nice, my buffs last longer. :D <br />
<br />
  It works on all my spells.<br />
  It works when I click my epic boots.<br />
  It does NOT work, with JB BP, nor Fungi Staff :( <br />
<br />
<br />
  The Haste focus items (have on my Necro only so far) do not speed up your spell casting bar, but rather remove a certain chunk of it.   SO quite simple to see how large an effect you are getting (Enhancement haste would clip off the first bubble and a half)<br />
<br />
<br />
   I have a Polished Mithril Mask.  Decent little Mask stat wise, but also Extra DD damage Focus. <br />
<br />
  Since I haven't got my finall DD yet, it works on both my poison and Cold DD (got both at 44).  Cold DD is now 500 some instead of 430.<br />
<br />
   It works on my spells so far (how nuce...  duH!) :rolleyes: <br />
   It does NOT work on JBB  :mad:    (guessing that Spell Haste won't either)<br />
   It DOES work on REIF.   That's right.  I am now procing a 96pt DD instead of 81.  Quite nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
  So, I am assuming that the focus effects work on procs, but not on clickables.    If that isn't true, then JB items and Fungi staff were left out on purpose :mad:    If it is true, then the DD enhancements will be of GREAT value to the JBB shammie. :cool:   (only thing I am worried about is that the clickable sow from boots was affected.   Could be that our JB is excluded :eek: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just to throw another wrench into trying to figure out how the hell VI coded the focus, Extended Range works with the JBB. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forgot a HUGE question.<br />
<br />
   Does Extended Affliction work on our epic?   Seeing as how it is splurt type, that would mean MUCH added damage..... (well, 180 at least)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">extend affliction DOES work with the proc on the 7th cudgel.<br />
and its also quite effective with our normal dot's.<br />
my bet it that it will work with epic, but i dont have it yet, so unable to verify =/</div></div><hr />
