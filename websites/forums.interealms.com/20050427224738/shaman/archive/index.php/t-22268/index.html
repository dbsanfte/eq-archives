<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have done a bit of grouping around the area that looks like a big stone basketball hoop in natimbi.  <br />
<br />
Now I believe we could keep doing this same area with myself(62 shaman) and him(59 monk) as a duo.  We always both get Virt and I have kei and a drog.<br />
<br />
are there any other camp spots in any of the other GoD zones that would be good exp with a chance at some of those good random drops?<br />
<br />
Now and then we can drag along a 65 paladin guildie and one of her bots(wizard/cleric/sk).  So any suggestions on something that may need real tanking would be good aswell.<br />
<br />
We have been doing some Seb/Griegs/Droga/AC even Velks lately and looking for somewhere new so suggestions even outside GoD could be very useful.  Oh he doesn't have LoY at the moment but its on his to get list.  He has all the rest of the expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm not sure what the basketball hoop area is. but you might camp the ghosts across the river and inland a bit from the port-in spot, spawn tumia lehio, (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14185) and loot a bunch of faceted gems of might. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68315)<br />
<br />
i'm sure your duo could also handle mobs in qinimi and riwwi.  possibly barindu trashl; ferubi stuff hits pretty hard though.</div></div><hr />
