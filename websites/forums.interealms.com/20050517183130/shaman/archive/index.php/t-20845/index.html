<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The bugs on test have finally become unbearable.  I've not seen the server this bad for this long before.  A month (or slightly better) of time being utterly screwed...then dx bugs that make the game unplayable for longer yet, blah blah blah.  I fail to see a reason to continue playing only to beat our collective heads against walls that are not our doing.  I'm not gonna sit and bad mouth dev though, the ones I interact with daily are all cool people...guess I'm just a bit disappointed in the way test is currently being managed.<br />
<br />
Add to that some changes IRL and a lack of time to spend infront of the computer like a guy has had in the past...well, there's no real reason to keep loggin' in.<br />

Deep.  Real deep, man.  Hooray for howjan!  (you did hit that lovely &quot;end billing&quot; button, right?)</div></div><hr />
