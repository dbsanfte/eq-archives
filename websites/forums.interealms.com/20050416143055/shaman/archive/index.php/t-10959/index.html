<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i'm 43 atm and i'm in Echo, i'm trying to get underbulks pulls from the hall/room which is directly ahead of you when you in from SH normal entrance but its always camped. Today i was about to camp and i noticed a litle necro gonme taking down these little gnome guards. (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/echocavernsmap.html number 9) He was pullnig right to where the haven defender roams ans she didn't seem to aggro either of them. I asked him what the faction hits are on etc and he said its on The Kings of above and below(something like that). I'm wondering if i should take these down as they're rarely camped, seem easier than underbulks (he was a 33 untwinked or midly twinked) but if i do will the faction only be to these gnomes in echo or will it apply to other zones too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draw1more</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faction only applies to the gnomes in Echo, I hunted them for a while. Careful of the casters though, they nuke hard.  The 4 four guards are easy, very nice exp too....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do the 4 guards and the jester and 1 other guy on the wall opposite of the kings.  Dont try and pull any of the others or you will end up with both kings and their guards.  Also the kings dont return to their spawn point so you can spread them out then zone.  wait a bit and all the guards and other mobs are back in their normal spots but the kings are still where you left them.  They drop some crappy rings but it is a fun fight.<br />
<br />
It is a good camp especially if you can do the 4spawn underulks.  The jester can be a bit trickey because sometimes he brings polly and that wizzy nukes hard.<br />
<br />
The faction hit only effects the gnomes in echo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The echo gnome guards can be single pulled at 49, including the jester and the herald up above, this just requires inching into spell range then running back to a slightly safe spot to fight.  The Jester seems to be a bit more resistant than the others and unless you have already broken the area, he will probably be damage shielded by one of the mages by the Kings.<br />
<br />
The Kings are not so hard to kill but are immune to snare.  If you want to kill them, train them to the zone, the other mobs will path back while the kings will sit where they are when you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The kings have about 10K HPs each. The little fella you saw doing them may have been using an exploit. There is a way(I won't post it here) to bug the kings in a spot where they get stuck and can't attack you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once your faction gets bad enough with these guys then you can't single pull them anymore. Pulling the kings to the zone and then running back past them is good as you can pick up the Kings gaurds single. I never bothered with the casters in the tents. Who wants a bunch of nukes upside?<br />
<br />
I can't imagine anyone pulling the guards at 33 that wasn't sploiting them. They are seriously red at 35. That side of echo is seriously bugged with exploit spots. I was killing in the taskmaster area a while back and a high level bard was running around counting the exploit spots in /ooc. I think he found 6+ before he got bored and left.<br />
<br />
They fixed some of these spots I beleive in a patch a while back so there might not be as many now. I think I was able to work the gaurds in my upper 40's with average gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for advice guys, tried today to get this cam or any, all perma camped, off tommorrow so i'll try at camp at bout 12pm, lunch time for everyone :p. Iv'e found a bug too, my pet at point jsut dissappeared so i recast another and that immdeiatley disappeared too. The little gnome guy told me to go to the hall bit cast him there then make him guard. Think this little dood must have been a 'sploit expert :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are lots of places that eat pets.  Echo has a few and really bad pathing for your pet as well ... I used to park pet lightly up the tunnel where the first 2 guards are.  I got a lot less bizaar behavior that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, the King of Above is immune to root, but the King of Below may be rooted.  My troll has hunted them for quite some time.  After clearing the guards, I tend to pull the kings out of their kingdom which allows me to single pull all the rest.<br />
<br />
Now, at 51, my shaman can take each king separately, but not together.  At 51, the court and guards are all blue, with the exception oh Harold (light blue).  I ignore the casters/vendor area.  They are nasty even at light blue.<br />
<br />
Polana, the female caster, appears to be a cleric as she will heal herself.  Her trick is to gate home, which may agro a guard.</div></div><hr />
