<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks I am determined to Play Atokal and level him. So I want to make an HS group for tonight. starting at 7:30 p.m. EST sharp. Want to spend a good 5 or 6 hours power levelling.<br />
<br />
Leave a post if you are able to attend. Proposed group below<br />
<br />
Atokal (53 Cleric)<br />
Aaeamdar (53 druid)<br />
Ludaian (52 warrior) - Leader<br />
Kilrain - (54 Pally)<br />
Grayeyes (53? Bard)<br />
Venomblood (53 Shammy)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
To those that have posted Please be on time )).<br />
Planning to go into a wing so if we need any special plans for pulling etc I will leave that up to Lud to decide. Chanter would be very nice but would leave us weak on Melee, thoughts?<br />
<br />
Ok as to strategy with no enchanter, hmmm lots of parking, mezzing by grayeyes, etc. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I can make it for 5 hrs...  <br />
Grayeyes is in DL, outside Karnors.  She'll need a guide, you know the drill... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I should be able to make this. 53 shammy ok? Not to far from 54 (One blue) and would like to make it tonight. (And perhaps put a little insurance on it. I know it will be very little, I've heard bad things about 54.)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds good to me Toke.  I'll get Lud to the drop down and be ready to go at 7:00.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Toke, get ahold of Kilrain and persuade him to come with us, I miss that dorf :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No enchanter.  Interesting.  If you are willing to go into a wing with group.  Count me in.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doing a wing with no chanter.  Most pulls are fine because they will involve only one to three mobs.<br />
<br />
Option Set 1:<br />
<br />
If you have two mobs - Greyeyes mezzes or charms (I like charm - but will leave that up to her).<br />
<br />
If you have three Mobs. - Greyeyes mezzes/charms one of them.  Kilrain shifts tanking to the other one and pulls it off a bit to root park.  Once done he anounces it, Venom and I Dot it if time/mana permits.<br />
<br />
If you have four mobs - as with three but now the tank (Ludaian) has to do some praying.  For the Mob not charmed/mezzed or rooted by Kilrain, Atokal taunts it with Stun and pulls it to the side.  I root it.  Venom and I Dot it assuming time/mana permits.<br />
<br />
In the case of root parked mobs, during the fight the person/team who rooted it has primary responsibility for making sure it stays that way.<br />
<br />
Five or more mobs - Pull yells - Crap!  We're screwed.  I push the button and we all have  ashort run back to HS from Skyfire.<br />
<br />
Option Set #2 - Muuuhhahahaha<br />
<br />
As above, except:<br />
<br />
I have my whompin stick out and have all my PB AE spells mem'ed . . .<br />
<br />
I'll let you all decide between the sets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow great job everyone. No deaths awesome mezzing by Grayeyes and great co-ordination by the whole group. Looking forward to Next Weeks effort. Was thinking about the Hole guys what do you all think. Let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers Toke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definitely!!<br />
<br />
I've been dying to go to the Hole and get some serious exp!  I got three blue bubs last night btw  :)<br />
<br />
And, casters, remember:  the faster you help me get to lvl 55, the sooner you'll have CLARITY 4!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Excellent job all.  Many groups I have been with have refused to go into the wings without an enchanter.  I was once doign the entry way witha group higher-level than we were (55+ mostly) with a Bard AND a Necro, and they refused.  I was very happy to be with one last night that had the faith we could do it.  Of course we succeded splendidly.<br />
<br />
2. Grey - wow.  You sure opened my eyes to bards.  I have been with some before and mostly they were able to keep one critter mezzed.  You had 3 at times.  Enchanters - who needs 'em.<br />
<br />
3. Hole sounds nice.  It is a fun place.  Also, until I get that purrty shield, I am interested in Chardok.  It might be fun to take this adventuresome group INTO Chardok, instead of just hunting the zone out.<br />
<br />
4. Looking forwards to getting our group together again.  Last night was a blast.  Picked up a little over 4 blues to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye it was a blast. I definately want to do this again guys. Maybe we can all plan to group every Tuesday for the next little while... and the exp was great!! 3 blues in level 54 is what I call a good night. Sign me up for next week. Either the Hole or Chardok are fine with me.<br />
