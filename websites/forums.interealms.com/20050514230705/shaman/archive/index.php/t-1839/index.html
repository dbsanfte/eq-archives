<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So looking at the list of mobs that have been verified slowable or not http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/ I noticed that both Vox and Naggy are listed with ** Possible to slow but very difficult, probably dead by the time it'll land<br />
<br />
My question is has anyone landed a slow on either of these dragons post Luclin and if so what where the events leading up to the slow landing. <br />
<br />
So far and the many runs I have been on I have seen a Tash land and afterwards I have resisted out on both Malisement and Malosi. I am beginning to think the missing ingredient is a Bard MR Decrease but even at level 50-52 that would only add up to a 5MR decrease.<br />
<br />
What other things should I be looking at to help de-bufs and a slow to stick? better or summoned Items or equipment? Equipping my entire guild with Tash sticks or orbs?<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think anyone who can cast on them - i.e. level 52 and below - can slow them.  however, they do not return a message that they are immune to changes in their attack speed, so theoretically they could be slowed.<br />
<br />
So, to test it, chain CHeals on the shaman who is casting the slow, and let the others malise until it sticks, to try malisement, to try malo ....  heck with it - just kill the dragon !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back when I was that level I tried several times on each and never slowed either one. A good test is have a necro try to land a lifetap. If they can't land it, then the mob is magic immune (but not slow immune), and thus slow will never land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just kill them, don't bother trying to slow.  :)<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the key to Vox is the mana drain.  Bring enough enchanters.  Make sure your raid is levels 50-52 to have the best chance of resisting AEs and fears.  :)<br />
<br />
I tried half a dozen times to slow both Naggy and Vox (this was about 1 year ago exactly) and I never got slow (turgurs, togors or even drowsy) or Malo line to stick, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think one time in my old guild during a Vox raid a shaman landed togors but I wasn't there for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree killing the dragon is the goal and infact gave up on the thought of ever slowing the 2. But, after a 16 person Vox Raid I attended I was once again thinking about it mostly on vox since my mana would be better used for cold based nukes vs. naggy. <br />
<br />
My guilds goal is to take these 2 with 3 groups so anything I can do to reduce some needed healing mana and change that into DPS would help greatly.<br />
<br />
Anyone with Epic pre 53 get the DoT to stick?<br />
<br />
I'll try that Jing good point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman I played with a lot that was level 55 went to a raid I was leading with one of my alts at nagafen. Went in 15 seconds after everyone else. got right under nag and slowed him with Turgur's first shot. Was immediately thrown out but it did land.  <br />
<br />
Nagafen throws you out as soon as he aggro's you.. If he's busy chewing through the 42 Paladins there for a COF, you have time to get your slow in :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pre level cap, a 55 shaman I know couldn't land slow on naggy. So I doubt it's possible, but if you really want to find out, just have a druid spawn faydedar in Td, it's a naggy clone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's exactly how its been done every time I played with the red lizard(or the white). Send in the under cap folks(plenty) then a 55+(60) shammy can usually get off a slow before banishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First weeks of Kunards... you could slow them before the 53 banishment stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ragefire is easily slowed = so are Vox and Naggy.<br />
<br />
I've also heard of high levelsrushing in and landing on either before banishment. Never tried it myself but I know a person I feel I can trust who claims to have done it.<br />
<br />
Can be slowed at 52 when the mob is three levels higher insanely mr and Malo/OoS isn't available. I doubt it's worth trying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've done vox and naggy in the last 2 weeks with my Necro...<br />
<br />
Taps don't land after Tash.... at all.<br />
Yes I was in melee range.<br />
<br />
Royally sucks that my 51 necro can't even help out on Vox/Naggy raids...<br />
<br />
Today, I twitched the wizard vs Naggy.<br />
<br />
E-bolt wouldn't land, and obviously my fire based spells weren't gonna land :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">im 60, i go to naggy/vox to buff people. i always try to malo. <br />
I get banished as soon as i did caqt my spell, so the &quot;higher lvl shaman slowing before banishment&quot; is a hoax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes and what a great hoax it is.  What reason exactly would there be to make up the information?   Just because you haven't done it doesn't mean it can't be done.<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes and what a great hoax it is. What reason exactly would there be to make up the information? Just because you haven't done it doesn't mean it can't be done. <br />

<br />
You can't land your higher level spells on them.<br />
As mentioned, you can't even get a Malo on them and that is unresistable. Your banished before your spell is allowed to take effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">NOTE: though this is a direct reponse to bakkal, it doesn't apply really to him, he just brought up a dang good issue.<br />
<br />
Bakkal,<br />
    Your  comment, &quot;What reason exactly would there be to make up the information?&quot;, sounded a point ppl should understand regarding information (msg boards are the next generation of national enquirer).  Some ppl take a  perverse pleasure in outright posting BS information they know isn't true, don't ask me why some ppl are just that way. The next category are those of us who share &quot;our&quot; experiences regarding the situation at hand, from these experiences a lot of confusion may result as the information changes as it gets passed along and some eventually take it as a truth. Finally you have those who spend a LOT of time testing theories to see what actually works. The number of ppl who actually to the last and do it correctly are pretty small.  That said, trying to decipher if the person really has a clue or just gets off on posting crap to confuse ppl.  Most the ppl here try to be truly helpful but all we can share is our experiences and how we did things.  The timing and conditions for each of our encounters will probably vary and thus skew each of our perspectives.  Don't accept most of the information as absolute fact (the slow chart is pretty damn good though).  Take the information presented and see how if fits to you and try out some of the stuff to see what works for you.</div></div><hr />

im 60, i go to naggy/vox to buff people. i always try to malo. <br />
I get banished as soon as i did caqt my spell,<br />
<br />
<br />
Same here.  Banished as soon as I cast my spell everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, jus ta let folks know, der was indead a point in time inna which ya coulds slow Naggy/Vox before ya got booted from da cave cuz ya was a 53rd+ lvl engaging.<br />
Right after dey implemented da new lvl cap fer dem, der was a bug wit how da list anda getting booted works.  If ya was past da 25th or so person on da Hate list, ya could cast/melee/heal/dance wit Naggy and Vox all day long, so long assa ya did not git to far up da hate list.  Once ya worked ya way up da Hate list, ya would git kicked.  Der was one point inna time when I was goin ta Naggy raids assa mighty 54th lvl shammy, would wait tilla folks was in anda attackin Naggy, would hussle inta the lair anda slow him.  A few later sumbudy would die or what not, den &quot;pamf&quot; I was standin inna Lava Zone.  I would den gate back, nuke, git pamfed anda repeat tilla he was dead.<br />
Da main thing was dat the spell landed before da game did a check vs lvl to boot ya, if der was enough folks on da hate list, so high lvl folks could land da spells.<br />
If mah soggy mind recalls right, dey got dat fixed abouts a month later or so.  Now it checks ya lvl before it applies da damage, effect, ect.<br />
It not a random rumor orra sumtin sumbudy made up, but a bug dat was der at one point, but since removed.</div></div><hr />
