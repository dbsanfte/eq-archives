<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I have read somewhere that you actually have to do damage to a mob to get summoned. Is this true, or will any hostile action like rooting, slowing, or dispelling get you summoned? If your pet is the only thing doing damage will you get summoned?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In fact, the mob will summon the player/pet at the top of his hate list if he is not full HP...<br />
<br />
i.e.:<br />
<br />
malo a mob and he will run after you...he will not summon you.<br />
<br />
someone casts a DD, evac...malo that mob, and you will be summoned...<br />
<br />
if your pet tank and the mob is a summoning one, you will get summoned only if you are on top of your pet in the hate list. So aggro control is important here...if your pet get killed, you will be summoned immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive had my pet do damage, die and I got summoned after. Ive been summoned in Velks by the named Sent and never touched him, saw him etc...but technically you have to do damage to get summoned /shrug. Else youd never be able to pull summoning mobs. But i think what gets you summoned has a big lvl of variance depending on who it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">good exaple of gettting summoned...typical tactic for trial of execution is for the tank to kite the exe around while the cleric gets mana back. The exe casts an AE debuff which causes pets to agro. If pet classes don't kill pet and it attacks and damages the the exe, you can no longer safely kite because the exe will start to summon<br />
If nothing damages the exe, you can kite him around without the tank ever taking damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anytime you use Bane of Nife :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not believe that you personally have to do damage to get summoned.  I have been summoned lots of times by simply casting debuffs, no damage-dealing spells at all.<br />
<br />
The mob must be damaged, and you have to be the highest one on the hate list that is currently out of melee range.  That's it.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much damage has to be done, but it's not a lot.  I was soloing summoning Optios in Sanctus Seru recently and my strategy was root - slow - cripple - apply epic - Bane of Nife.  Typically the DD at the start of BoN (150 points) was enough to get the summoning started, but the small amount of damage done by the epic dot between its cast and the BoN cast was not enough to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A mob has to have lost a percentage of his life to start summoning. So this varies by monster as to the amount of damage needed to be dealt.<br />
<br />
Once he is not at full health, he will start summoning ANYONE that is on his hate list in order. The person at the top of list gets eaten, then the 2nd, 3rd, 4th so on and so forth. Until his hate list is clear.<br />
<br />
If the monster is not engaged and is still not at full health he will continue to summon anyone that gets on his hate list until he regens his health.<br />
<br />
Any spell that does no damage or very small amounts of damage are safe to cast and the mob will never summon. This includes: debuffs, roots, dispells, slows, Shaman epic dot for the first few ticks.<br />
<br />
(this assumes a summoning mob, not all have the ability and the level rules changed with Luclin)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use an UI that shows percentages.  I can do as much as 3% damage to mobs before summoning will start.  In other words, I can root a mob then cast epic and ulthor both of which will not break root.  The mob will not summon me until it drops below 97% life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know a lot of clerics that wish that a mob would only summon you if you had damaged him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Viscerator has explained it well, at least, that's my understanding of it.<br />
<br />
It's one tactic that warriors can use to gain agro on &quot;rooted&quot; mobs (i.e. mobs that don't move, not mobs with root cast on them) - they can stand and plink arrows at the mob for a while, and typically it will take a while before it starts to summon.<br />
<br />
Rangers have to be careful pulling summoning mobs though, one arrow can do enough damage to make the mob summon. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another thing to remember is level....<br />
<br />
I frequently bring my warrior along in kael for statue/idol/aow kills to tag for faction. Mobs have been pulled into camp, I run my warrior towards them once the raid force has engauged, and just being within agro range and not doing ANY damage will get him summoned. Generally doesnt even get hit, but he does get summoned. Its sorta wierd.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb, if the mob summons and is at 97% or lower, the person at the top of his hate list is summoned. Just go by that and you should be good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got summoned by an Ice Giant in Permafrost once. Problem is, I was camping the mammoth cloak and wasn't anywhere near the king room where the Cleric/Warrior duo were killing. Now *that* may have been a fluke or a bug, but it wasn't pleasant. Luckily the Cleric was 57, so at least I got a 96% rez after getting beaten so bad I made the king room look like a big stawberry snow cone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Low health gets u summoned even if u had nothign to do with fight.<br />
Casting slow gets u summoned.<br />
Casting a dd gets u summoned.<br />
<br />
I heard that arrows don't get u summoned but we can't use bows so = /<br />
<br />
Summoning mobs suck.<br />
<br />
Btw sittign down after u aggroed it even if others are beatign on it still gets u summoned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mobs that can summon do not do so unless they are not at full health.  They start summoning at 97 or 98 or so percent of their full health.<br />
<br />
Once they start summoning, they do so to the highest person on their agro list.  The tank gets most of the summons, but it's fairly easy for casters to get summoned...overnuking wiz/druid/mages, overdotting necro/shaman, slow too early or too resisted, a tashing ench, etc.  Clerics often get summoned if they heal too early or if the MT goes down (leaving them relatively high on the agro list).  Don't over agro and you won't get summoned.<br />
<br />
Oh, and mobs can't summon every time the person they're going after is out of reach.  It has a refresh time of like 6 (I think?) seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">96% health is the start for summoning.  Easy to tell back when luclin perma-rooted mobs (itraer vius is a good example) had a gazillion hp.  We'd have enchanters chain tash to build up agro, then let a warrior go to town behind him to build up agro of his own.  At 96%, if the warrior hadn't overtaken the enchanters agro, the enc got summoned (and owned).<br />
<br />
Mobs cannot summon above that point, no matter how many stories you've heard from your grandmother's sisters boyfriend's cat's owners next door neighbor.<br />
<br />
Once past the point, they attack the person highest on their agro list.  If that person is not in melee range, they summon them.  There is a small refresh timer on summons, so if you're near a zone and get summoned, sometimes you can run to the zone before it resets and you get summoned again.  Mobs will chase the person with highest agro during this downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The damage doesn't even have to be done by a player.<br />
<br />
I was pulling the Sonic Guardians in Hollowshade Moor for a quest piece a few weeks ago.  The Sonic Defenders popped and I ignored them and pulled a Guardian anyway.  Never cast anything on the Defender at all.  As soon as the owlbears arrived and hit the Defender I got summoned.<br />
<br />
It wasn't pretty.  A 42 beastlord and I, a 41 shaman, against 3 Sonic Defenders, 2 Sonic Guardians, a couple of Sonic Wolves and the five Owlbear Invaders.  We survived but it was very close.  Not sure we would have if the Owlbears didn't do a bunch of damage to the Sonics as well as to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">sitting down during a fight will also often get you summoned.   Never slow, then sit or lay on a big dot and sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">but since we are shamans only should sit to switch spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Against mobs which summon I tend to slow from melee range and save the trouble =).  Slow often gets me summoned so there is little point in trying to run if the mob will just drag you back anyways.  Hopefully slow landed and you have a little time before you end up as a pile of bloody goo.<br />
<br />
Heh, on the summoning horror stories, I was camping those assassins in UP with a group and the puller brought a train so we ran for it.  Nothing is worse than a train of summoning mobs which also snare...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">it is simple, if you in mob's agro list then you have a chance to get summon;and you can enter agro list without cast spell on mob/player, eg if you stand/sit at front of mob or nearby you get agro in mob's agro list<br />
<br />
normally mob will summon those on highest hate, but sometime it can summon you without having top hate, like sit under mob, low hp, suddently add big agro(big nuke/slow/debuff) ; all those will get you summon but you don't need to in top hate list<br />
<br />
also, mob won't summon when full hp, so avoid do any damage to mob if you want root park; I think mob only start summon when his hp below 95% or 98 or sometime 90%, depend on mob, a good rule is don't go below 99% if not ready melee yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I *used* to believe that an undamaged mob would never summon, and my tactics have evolved accordingly.  Pull with slow or maloX, mob runs to you, job done.<br />
<br />
Was duoing in CT maze last week tho, pulled with slow, and got summoned the instant slow landed.  Confused the bejeesus out of me.  I am one hundred percent certain that neither myself nor my hunting partner had damaged the mob at this point.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it was a bug, but it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is it possible that it was a mob that another group had damaged and escaped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One key point... if a mob is rooted and it has a target in melee range, it will NOT summon those not in melee range. <br />
<br />
I use this to good effect when soloing summoning mobs. I fight it in TEH FACE for a while, then if I want to heal up, or change spells or something, I root it and let dogdog tank it for a while. While the mob is beating on the pet, it will not summon me, even if I sit or am at very low health (say from Cann5). The moment that root breaks, it will charge me or summon me and ignore the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There are exeptions to the &quot;no damage no summons&quot; rule: I noticed that fighting in CT and splitting the initial 2 guards by rooting one, you get summoned by the 2nd mob if you have to reroot more then once - despite the fact that shm root is non-damaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There are exeptions to the &quot;no damage no summons&quot; rule: I noticed that fighting in CT and splitting the initial 2 guards by rooting one, you get summoned by the 2nd mob if you have to reroot more then once - despite the fact that shm root is non-damaging. <br />
I don't buy it. I have split those 2 mobs and many others in CT and never had a problem. If it was summoning, it was damaged...by something...<br />
<br />
Everything else are not variables that change summoning, they are variables that change your position on the hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">2nd mob I root, malo and slow.... never got summoned once.<br />
<br />
I would hazard a guess that all these so-called exceptions are due to a one of 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Its a bug<br />
2) You damaged the mob in some way. Maybe your pet took a few nibbles out of the mob before you got things under control.<br />
3) Somebody else damaged the mob before you engaged, perhaps they evacced.</div></div><hr />
