<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kaelelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I know this question has probably been asked many times before, but dont flame me AHH k<br />
<br />
Is troll regen really worth it? I have a 25 froggy shaman atm and i have on problem lvling, i can get that on a troll in less than 2 weeks, I just want to know if the difference is noticeable 60+ because i plan on getting there to 2-box with my 65 necro <br />
I know regen hopes overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pre torpor or quiessence (or fungi tunic) the regen is really nice, but if you are planning on pleveling him or not spending a lot of time at lower levels then it's totally not worth it.  The experience penalty for trolls is huge and at higher levels where it sounds like you will be playing mostly, the regen doesn't nearly come close to paying for the xp penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kaelelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It won't be really &quot;Plvling&quot; it'll be &quot;Look, i got 150k of gear on me look at me plvling myself lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really.<br />
<br />
When they got the AA extra points.. yes because the difference was dramatic then, but now it is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the main benefits of having an Inny-worshipping Troll is that you get a clicky snare necklace. If you are planning to duo with your necro, the point is mostly moot. Otherwise the 20% XP penalty is fairly harsh, but then again, you can easily PL the Shaman through the 50s either with FD PLing or by simply grouping in the Planes.<br />
<br />
I don't think that Trollish Regeneration is that big a deal even pre-Torpor now that Shamans get Stoicism at 44. It's nice and all, but I doubt that, from the powergamer perspective, it's worth the 20% XP penalty if you don't have a 65 Necro to PL you. High STA is nice for Canni5, though. And, on the plus side, you will be green! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The experience comes pretty fast now with PoP, the 20% penalty isn't so bad anymore IMO. Once you get to 65, there is no experience penatly.<br />
<br />
I agree that with the new Healing spells we get the regen isn't as important as it once was, but it sure is nice to have a built in Fungi+ on at all times :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it is certainly possible to agro kite with a low level Shaman, but it's not particularly efficient. Low level dogs are pretty weak and it takes them awhile to kill the prey. If you have 150K to spend, get a Fungi and high AC/HP, and you can mow through low blues almost non-stop even with your low level slow. But hey, whatever playstyle makes you happy, it's a game, after all! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a Troll warrior. He's 55 and honestly, I forget he even has regen sometimes. It means that little. The xp penalty sucks, but between my Troll warrior and my Ogre shaman, I'm used to it. Once you get to 65 your gonna be full AA. There is no penatly on AA xp.<br />
Also, there are WAY too many Barbarian shaman running around already. The least you can do is pick something a bit different. Troll, Ogre, Iksar are all good choices and have nice starting stats.</div></div><hr />

Where does it officials state the experience penalty no longer exists at 65?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Where does it officials state the experience penalty no longer exists at 65?<br />
Well, maybe when they throw us 5 more lvls it will exist, but now, at 65 maxed everyone has a 100% xp reduction :) (no xp gain) J/K<br />
<br />
Now seriously. I dont know, but it is said that AA xp is not affected (the time needed to ding 1 AA seems to be the same on every race) so at 65 everyone goes for 100%AAxp and no racial penalties apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think where they went wrong with regen was not having it increase again at 62 and 65...  I mean it went up several times in the 50s...  If racial regen went up by +5 at 62 and 65th then maybe it would make that racial penalty easier to swallow...<br />
<br />
And if you want to see the difference -- fight without a regen buff for a while...  There IS a difference...  just isnt a 20% difference...<br />
<br />
BTW yes I am an iksar shaman ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I started my Troll shaman back before I ever dreamed I could ever own uber regen gear. Heck before Kunark even existed. I finally got a fungi this year, over three years after starting my shaman. At 57 it is still nice to have inate regen, regen3, fungi and regrowth all running at once. I hardly ever cast stoicism. <br />
<br />
But the absolute best thing is the clicky snare necklace. It totally changes where and what you can solo. I got mine around level 17-19ish iirc. It still amazes groups when the Troll shouts &quot;snared %T&quot; when we lack a snarer class. I don't use it all the time, but when its needed its a lifesaver. <br />
<br />
Still the 20% penalty is harsh. I have a harder time keeping up with my quild. It is very noticiable when leveling.</div></div><hr />

What he means is the XP penalty is not applied to AA XP. I can confirm this, I have done  tests in VERY VERY high XP areas, and checked my groups AAXP level for the duration, and it always matched up with mine. <br />
<br />
Personally, if I had to do it over again, I would not pick troll. The regen isnt worth the agony of the 50's, and once you break 60 and get Torp (or even 45for Stoi now) the regen just isnt that big a deal.</div></div><hr />

enough said</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. I like being a Troll, the exp penalty wasn't &quot;too&quot; bad, but the regen isn't worth -20%.<br />
<br />
As an Innoruuk worshiping Troll I do feel that the Snare necklace was worth it for me. I got my necklace in my eary 20's and solo'd alot, I really can't imagine soloing as much as I did without that Snare.<br />
<br />
But, to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">XP penalty isn't that terrible. Played an Iksar monk to 60 and then switched to a Troll shaman to 65.  Yes with Stoicism/Torpor/Quiescence there isn't qute the call for it any more. I'm on a horse most of the time. Like it was mentioned earlier it's like having a free Fungi compared to the other races. And yes you will notice it.<br />
<br />
With the option for the snare neck was icing, and I still break it out occasionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kaelelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">grr. im in between now, trolls are one of the original shamans, and that clicky necklace looks nice, but the flips man, the flips, i might go troll just so i can be big, but then i'd have to get 30lvls all over again, grrr i hate my indecisiveness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Kitty and frog I think = human experience<br />
Barbarian penalty is 5% =~ 1 extra level for every 20 levels of human experience<br />
Ogre Penalty is 15% =~ 1 extra level for every 6 and a half levels of human experience<br />
Troll/Iksar penalty is 20% =~ 1 extra level for every 5 levels of human experience<br />
<br />
The benefits of the evil races really don't outweigh the experience costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its been said a million times over and ill say it for the million and 1st time right now. The only thing that matters is what race looks more fun as a shaman.<br />
<br />
For me its a Barbarian cause it reminds me of a indian shaman. I dont have frontal stun immunity, i dont have high inate regen, but i also dont have a -15% exp penalty.  Its all good in the end and once you hit 44 and get Sto and can2 your going to be styling anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Troll = 1 good thing, snare necklace, but #1 you have to be a Inny troll and #2 its only a 30-45 second snare. So in the end unless you like right clicking that thing worse then a JBB, its just a toy that you wont be using heavily.<br />
<br />
And thats what way the cookies crumbles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As a troll, I must say &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;no.&quot;  I love being a troll because I love trolls.  If I had picked a troll for the regen, snare neck, or anything else I'd be really upset with the 20% penalty by now.  Hell, I think I may have posted my frustrations a couple times.  If you want an ability for your xp penalty, pick an ogre.  They've got the only really worthwhile innate class benifit.  I don't know how many times I've rather have had frontal stun immunity then clicking my slow ass snare necklace.</div></div><hr />

Exaxctly. I picked troll VERY VERY early in the game (he was my original &quot;twink&quot; for my Paladin, who became my &quot;main&quot; when Kunark came out and hosed Paladins pretty hard). We knew about the regen, and we knew there was SOME XP penalty, but not 20%. We didn't know about the quest necklace, so I went Cazic Thule (grr)<br />
<br />
I don't regret my choice, I love being a troll. But if I had to do it over again, I think Kitty Kat or Frog is the way to go. Flips are cool, and innate Safe Fall is pretty damn useful at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">at the end race is pretty much unimportant so its up to the users preference. personally with the new models OGRE all the way. if the new models had been out Hdaana would be a big handsome ogre woman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ranukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have to admit that I started up a Ogre BST and the no frontal stun advantage is MUCH better then the troll regen.  I speak from a 58 CT worshipping troll shaman ( I didn't know about the necklaces, but the fear ones are too bad )  That stun resist has saved me a number of times.</div></div><hr />
