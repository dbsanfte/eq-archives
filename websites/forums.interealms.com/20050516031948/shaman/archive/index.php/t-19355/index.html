<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Almost had him &gt;&lt;  Got to 20% and was really low on mana, ended up bouncing 2 Turgur's, my old one wore off, and he ate me.<br />
<br />
Was outside buffed (VoQ, Virtue), so not completely alone, but oh well.  Had some issues with interrupts at the beginning, he had me down to half health before I slowed him.  At about 55% health he had me down to about 15% mana (bounced 3 Ultor and 4 Blood of Saryrn, ouch).  Don't have Bane yet, so I couldn't go at it with that.  Ended up alternating epic / winterstorm for about 25% of his health until he killed me.  Forgot to use spirit call (really could have used it twice, maybe near a 3rd time), but that thing is always tough to channel.  Not sure how well the dog pack would stand up to his ae, it's pretty rough.<br />
<br />
My resists suck, I took almost full damage on all the AE's, though I did resist a rare few.  Only took 2 dragon roar hits though, so fear wasn't a problem.  I think I can get him next time, just need to talk another cleric into gathering those things and spawning him for me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You were soloing Ragefire?<br />
<br />
Jeez thats impresive lol.  I'm still waiting on my chance to solo Lodi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He really is a pain to slow, I've tried him before and I called in my backup on the 5th slow bounce.  Didn't wanna waste any more of people's time than I had to, though I could've kited him all day and gotten a slow eventually I suppose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah he's soloable but alot tougher than you'd expect simply because he's still fairly resistant at 65. When I did him I gave up on bane because it got resisted a fair bit too and couldn't recast it so didn't end up being very useful.<br />
I ended up being low on mana at the end but I could have cann v'ed again and definitely would have been better off if i had been a little better prepaired. Pet lost his haste and other buffs pretty early on. Should have junk buffed him alot. Also a damage shield potion and a FR potion (would have put me over 400) would have helped. If I went dots again I would have done well to remember to equipe my bracer of darkness for the mana pres. I think if i redid him i might just nuke him down with velium strike or at least try. Sure our nukes aren't very efficient but neither are our dots when they are resisted half the time.<br />
<br />
all in all definitely soloable but a harder fight than i expected just because of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know he's a belly-caster right?  Meaning you have to be right on top of him practically to land?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know he's a belly-caster right?  Meaning you have to be right on top of him practically to land?<br />
<br />
When your soloing him and tanking him it's rather hard to be anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah if I get another go I'm going with epic/winterstorm/velium strike (assuming cold will land - winterstorm never resisted at all).<br />
<br />
Had some issues with agro off the bat and the interrupts on slow, by the time I got him slowed I looked and my pet had already bit the dust.  Would have been cake if he'd stayed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can see it now.<br />
<br />
&quot;***, Shamans don't need fixing they can solo Ragefire!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Soloing RageFire huh?<br />
<br />
Certainly FR and MR potions would be useful.  Maybe perhaps the 5% mana saving potion as well.  If you have supended minion that might help as well to have a pet in reserve.  Some insta-click 300 hp heal potions would have helped too.<br />
<br />
Grabbed mage toys?  Might help Dog Dog out a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm really impressed you tried it, I'm WAY to scared for that kind of thing.  Hell, I can't even solo that damn undead lieutenant in Valor who keeps seeing through my invis.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I soloed the bad boy this evening for my friend's epic. In addition to my self-buffs, I had virtue. I did this because there was only myself, the 65 cleric and a 65 monk in attendance, and if my attempt went poorly I wanted there to be time for the cleric to keep me alive to help with the kill.<br />
<br />
My pet was up with two weapons and lots of crap buffs. I had lots of crap buffs, focus, regen, bramblecoat, kilva's and greater potion of cold up. A 53 mage wandered by the fight in the middle and buffed me with his damage shield, but I clicked it off.<br />
<br />
I slowed Rage first try after malos, then landed malicious decay and eventually malosinia after a few tries. I then used epic, Ultor and Saryrn throughout the fight, with one spirit call in the middle.<br />
<br />
Reslowing was never difficult, and the time between hits was so long that channeling a heal, switching spells etc. was easy.<br />
<br />
I logged the fight, and the parsing results are as follows:<br />
<br />
Damage from Epic: 5652<br />
Damage from Ultor: 8515<br />
Damage from Saryrn: 12,800<br />
Damage from Kilva's and Bramblecoat: 1617<br />
Total damage from me: 28584<br />
<br />
Damage from Gibantik: 12737<br />
Damage from Spirit Call: 2992<br />
<br />
Total damage inflicted on Ragefire: 44313<br />
<br />
Melee damage inflicted by Ragefire on me: 8828<br />
<br />
I don't have a total for his AE damage, although it was definitely the bulk of his damage output. His melee is really weak, with the max hit being 315. From looking through my chat window after the fight, I was partially resisting a lot of them. The only annoying thing is that it would often skip my SoW clicky and take out one of my other buffs.<br />
<br />
At no point did my health drop below 50%, so this guy is definitely soloable without virtue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice to see others carrying the torch now that FFXI has taken me from EQ :)   Now that you guys have done rage, work on doin Rumblecrush, I wasn't quite able to get him yet, but I swear it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also soloed Ragefire a couple nights ago, under pretty much identical conditions as Zarniwoop above me.  Cleric friend wanted epic and wanted it now!  I offered to give soloing it a try.  She brought a couple other friends as backup just in case, they stood around and watched as I defeated the beastie.  <br />
<br />
One thing I did slightly differently was using my Journeyman's Walking Stick to push Tashani on Ragefire so my Turgurs would stick better.  I still had a heck of a time landing slow, but managed it, and did most of my damage with Bane, Anathema, epic, and Velium Strike.  Finished with 40% mana and coulda gone a lot longer.  Conclusion: this fight is cake for a shaman with similar gear/AAs as me.</div></div><hr />
