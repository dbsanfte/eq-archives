Your post contained no suggestions for spell improvements, therefore it was deleted. I don't want to ban you. Please feel free to start as many posts as you like. I asked very specifically in that thread to limit your responses to spell suggestions only.</div></div><hr />

You deleted a TON of posts in other threads tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;MY UPDATE&quot; dropped a lot.<br />
<br />
If that is also not a thread you want us talking in, fine.  <br />
<br />
Someone create the &quot;place for us to be fully honest and bitch and whine thread&quot;.. I will meet you there shortly.</div></div><hr />

Someone deleted posts from my update, if not you.. I am sorry.<br />
<br />
For sure 2 of my posts are gone, and I noticed a few other peoples vanish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While I am very mad about the fact that I no longer belive we are going too see signifigant changes too our obviously roken class , I have too support Glori on some of these lockings/deleteings ... things are geting out of hand .<br />
No , they arent going too fix us .. that seems clear . We need too accept it and move on . I think that the devs hearts are in the right place . They want everything too be ok . If they give us BIG heals like we need &quot;2000pt at lv 70&quot; Clerics and Druids would get mad I guess .. why i dont know since both of those classes heal in excess of 2k at level 58 ... I guess theres no easy fix here .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My post was not out of hand nor was it flaming anyone. I will admit it was not about spells but come on. This class has gotten the shaft time and time again and now on the shaman boards if we scream it stinks. Threads get locked posts deleted ok fine at least we know where we stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It wasn't about spells. The point of the thread is to have all the spell information handy so we can make our case to Rytan.<br />

I'm sorry you feel I'm being draconion, but can you imagine if Rytan had to wade through tons of &quot;we suck we suck&quot; posts just to get to valuable contributions?<br />
<br />
Please feel free to start a new thread, flame as much as you want (barring bad language and threats, of course).</div></div><hr />

listen, i know you have watched the degradation of this class, and your fustrated, i am too, but right now, you have all 3 mods watching this thread, and im serious they will ban you, please, calm down, you have actual things to say, don't waste them by being banned, wait for this to blow over (i doubt it will) and have your say then.<br />
<br />
we need all of our class to be strong, all of the EQ players, just hold tight, im trying to work something out.<br />

<br />
If the mods feel that my post wasn't on topic and they delete it, that's their call.  In that case, I obviously misinterpreted what was asked for when they created the thread.<br />

If we want results, we need to learn a little self-discipline in posting.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to tell you but I don't think we CAN make any points to Rytan that he will listen to.  He's got it in his mind that shaman are where he feels they should be and that's that.  Short of divine intervention, I don't see that his opinion will ever change.</div></div><hr />

Good gravy...  If you can't insult Brenlo and Rytan in 100% of the threads on this board, you've been abandoned?  Give me a break.  Pick one of the other 11065 threads in this forum alone and have at it.  Leave the mods alone for wanting civility in one of them.</div></div><hr />

We may have been a little neglected for a while, and may not think the changes we've received so far are enough, but they're still here, so there's still time to express our concerns.<br />
<br />
While I don't think they will completely ignore us for being belligerent *******s, I know that if it was me, I'd sure make the hostile environments a lower priority to visit than the hospatible ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Kamidari, you're missing the point.  We can't GET any lower priority.

There is a saying, you get more flys with honey than you do with vinegar. Well, I am not really applying that here, because we HAVE been &quot;super honey nice&quot;, HOWEVER, being TOTALLY hell-bent and full of p*** and vinegar isnt gonna get you anywhere either. <br />

We are all fustrated by Ryans comments and Brenlos dismissal of our complaints. I understand where they are coming from. Totally. Honestly, the &quot;average&quot; shaman is PROBABLY one of the single most powerful members of his little &quot;gang of friends&quot;. However, as you progress, you get less and less valuable, and more and more replacable.</div></div><hr />

As I said, In old content shaman are fine but new content is coming out all the time. So if you want to play in the new zones why would you level a shaman.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry there have been issues with the Shaman class.  There are issues with several classes.  Hell, the game itself is an issue half the time.  But fighting each other will not make things better.  It will only make us be seen as a bunch of children who bicker.<br />
<br />
Be Active....not Re-Active.  If we all applied even a small percent of the effort and energy we put into whining, fighting, and venom into something constructive instead....like rational posts or number-crunching...we could get things done.</div></div><hr />

The question isnt why WOULD we, the question is why CANT we play our shaman in the new zones? Why are we so useless? Why arent we being balanced against NEW content the way other classes are?<br />
<br />
The question isnt why would a level a shaman, its what to do with my 5 year old lvl 65, 220 aa, half VT/half EP geared, all spells up to Gates shaman? Strip him out? Stick to &quot;old&quot; zones? Make a Cleric or Chanter?<br />

Those are the questions I want answers too.</div></div><hr />

i tried that, spent 6 hours with my lvl 38 war doing parses on hits, miss, damage with stat buffs (the best landable on him at his level) and posted it.<br />

it was swiftly deleted, and i also recieved a negative rep bump for the same post ! (wich is just funny)<br />

I think most of us know they have the right to delete anything they like. My problem with it was that it just makes people even more upset then they already are. If I had truely flamed someone I would not have said anything and as I said it was ture I didnt post about spells so my bad. But I still feel that locking threads and deleting posts only makes thing worse.</div></div><hr />
