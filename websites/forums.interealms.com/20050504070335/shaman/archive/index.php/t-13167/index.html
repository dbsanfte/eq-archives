<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been informed that a shaman in bear form in Dragon Necropolis either definitely or sometime will get death touched out of nowhere.  I've been safely in bear form there before, but it was quite a while ago.  Can anyone confirm or deny?  Anyone else even heard of this?<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty fishy to me, but one never knows....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you fight in the first big building, and a spider phases inside Jared Dar's (sp) building, JD assists the spider and of course, boom, DT. Happened to me before. <br />
<br />
Jared Dar's Shade shouts; URDEGISH!<br />
<br />
Splat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It only happens in a fairly limited area, but if you go into that area using a non-playable-race illusion while Jaled Dar's shade is up, he pops ya for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Everywhere I fight, I'm in Bearclothes.  <br />
<br />
I've fought in DN quite a lot.<br />
<br />
I've never gotten DT'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I had read (long time ago, on this board) was that bearform did not upset Jared Dar.  <br />
<br />
Finaljustice has the experience, so I would go with his position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For those in the know.. any illusion no matter what, will result in Jaled Dar sending off a DT.  Even bearform.  Easy to confirm, just go cruise by his building and have a cleric ready to get your exp back ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perhaps not since the changes they made to illusions and faction.  <br />
<br />
I do for a fact know that he still DTs if you run by his house with mobs on your tail.  I'm not sure if it's a certain mob he assists since I had the little beetles from a trap, maybe a dozen Chetari, and a spider or two behind me, but the Shade decided to end my little jog.  I was playing my bard at the time and had no illusion on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did my ST key in Bearclothes, he didn't seem inclined to mess with The Bear  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No faction adjustment on bear form, period. If you get DT in bearform by Jared it's because of an agro transfer of some kind, but because you were inherently KOS to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me and a guildy where there both in bear form. he got DT'd and i didnt. Maybe he was in range and i was not &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bear Form gets blamed for everything, what's up with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Jaled dar is utterly wierd, illusions used to carry the risk of getting a DT (Almost anything seemed to have the risk, even rogue illusion masks).  Its not definate, but it happens and its very random/annoying, usually its best to simply avoid illusions at all costs really.  Not sure how the faction change on illusions has affected it now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pinepath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He also assists some of the DN mobs, so if you get in range of him with aggro on you, he'll DT you for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Everywhere I fight, I'm in Bearclothes.  <br />
<br />
I've fought in DN quite a lot.<br />
<br />

<br />
Neither have I, and I've fought there fairly extensively as well, albeit not for a while.  And yes, that did include running up to him in bearform for my ST key :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">bearform doesn't include a faction adjust.  I think froggies are the only race who has ever &quot;claimed&quot; to get a faction adjust from bearform.  I would ask &quot;What's your Paebala faction like?&quot; Or possibly, &quot;where were you at the time and what was chasing you?&quot;  Or other things . . . Jaled Dar's aggro range is screwy I know that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've turned in with guise illusion and didnt get DT'ed.  Friend of mine was in his guise (opened door for me), agroed a mob and got dt'ed however.  Most likely has to do with mobs being agro within his range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If any mob in DN has you agroed and you are anywhere near jaled'dar...you are likely to get DT...bearform or not<br />
<br />
I also turned in ST key in bearform with no problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">He only DT's you if you are using an illusion that changes your faction, and is not a playable race. Like elemental illusions in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">He only DT's you if you are using an illusion that changes your faction, and is not a playable race. Like elemental illusions in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tend to agree with this as there has to be something written into the code that prompts him to DT or not to DT. I'm not saying I know 100% whether or not there is some type of random factor involved, but the illusions that had faction adjusts and the aggro transfers make sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've raided there lots and xp'd there too.  Mostly in bear form and i never got a DT.  If you get one it is due to agro transfer from yard trash imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, most typically it happens when people get agro from the swarm trap passing Jaled's tomb, but its very wierd at best, the funniest example I've seen was a rogue zoning in to check zland, clicking a mask and promptly getting DT'd for it =)<br />
<br />
I may well have been killing spiders at the zone in at the time though.</div></div><hr />
