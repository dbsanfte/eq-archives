<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zanox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the minimum number of mages and clerics needed to do the final battle with Lord Rak' Ashiir? I have heard he can be killed with as few as one mage and one cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1 of each is sufficient. Doing it that way just takes forever. More mages means more pets, which means more damage so Rak dies faster.<br />
<br />
More clerics is less usefull than more mages - clerics can /assist heal and cover multiple pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I killed him a couple weeks ago with 1 mage pet and 3 clerics and it was a piece of cake. The only problem was keeping the Melee's entertained during the battle :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had serious overkill for mine 5 mages and 3 clerics plus other healers ) Only problem I had was some one aggro'd Rak before I  turned in Tear but most of us managed to camp out and CR quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't forget my helpful Rak fighting tips (lost to message board wipe)<br />
<br />
* Rak's spawn point is where he spawns when his reaver dies, since he has a tendancy to gate back to his spawn point when nearly dead, it's a really really good idea to pull his REAVER where you want to fight the battle, gating/summoning Rak = bad<br />
* Don't fight in the temple.  The risk of adds is too great and can lead to a mess.<br />
* Don't fight near water, if Rak falls in the water, it could be very bad.<br />
* Only the mage pets should engage Rak, this includes melee that like to &quot;helpfully&quot; shoot arrows.  I personally witnessed a Rak fight that failed for this reason. (note: I'm sure a well equipped couple of groups could probably fight Rak without mage pets, but why risk it on your epic? go for what's safe).<br />
* My guild (which has never lost on Rak) always pulls Rak's reaver to the area we call the &quot;staging area.&quot;  This is a small courtyard right before you go through the arch which leads to the pathway to the moat and temple.  There are no roamers/spawns and there is a nice corner that the mage pets can push Rak into.<br />
* After you hand in the tear and Rak aggros, wait until the mage pets are engaged and Rak is on them, before you slowly step out of range.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the fight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zanox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info  Gloriana, I have a 58 mage and a 46 mage to help me as well as 3 or 4 55+ clerics so hopefully ill be all set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We got one of my friends her Ghiosk books.. I got Neh, and my friend MQ'd tear with me.. All in the same night. We had 11 people max for all this, and only 1 mage. Level 60 wood elf warrior actually tanked Rak.. We fought him in the corner of some building (he was popped when we got to him, someone must have failed before us or something) where the cleric / druid / 2 shammies could hide from the AE and the mage pet and warrior could attack him safely. CHeal often hit at half a bub of hp, went flawlessly.</div></div><hr />

You said, &quot;it's a really really good idea to pull his REAVER&quot;. Is there a specific Reaver that spawns Rak? He is not a random pop from any Reaver?<br />
<br />
Yea, 58 and just starting to work on epic again (had my tear in the bank for 7 levels now :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, Rak spawns from a specific reaver and Ghiosk as well.    I've never pulled the reaver, but Ghiosk is generally the first reaver pulled and Rak is nearly always last.<br />
<br />
And I forgot! level 49 fire pets supposedly work best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are 3 spawn points for reavers.  One pops Ghiosk, one pops Rak, and one pops Neh.  I believe the very first one in the first room of the castle pops Ghiosk.  The one in the floating tower pops Neh.  And by default . . . the last one pops Rak :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
Edit--ack, forgot to warn you, in case you haven't done reavers before.  Not only do you have to kill the reavers (100% MR), but you also may get another reaver to spawn out of the old corpse of the reaver.  Hmmm.  That wasn't clear, was it?  Let me say it this way:<br />
<br />
When you kill a reaver, I believe one of two things will immediately spawn over its corpse: (1) another reaver, or (2) the appropriate lord or lady (rak, neh, or ghiosk).  I have had up to 13 reavers pop in a row.  Rak, Neh, and Ghiosk are non-agro I think, so unless one of your party is KoS to Truespirit faction, you can then rest up before the fight!</div></div><hr />

Just curious, as i am about to go for this fight, but why the 49th and not the 52nd or 58th pet?  I have a 55 and 60 mage ready to do for me, but want to make sure i don't lose it over something as simple as the wrong pet.  Thank you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Reason is simple. The lvl 52 and 58 fire pets are wizards. They don't have the huge dmg shield that the previous pets have and they will spend all thier time casting nukes that rak will resists. Mages generally consider the post 50 fire pets useless because they cast so much instead of meleeing.<br />
<br />
As far as the reavers go. There is a specific reaver that will always spawn the specific mob. The first reaver is just inside the locked door and can be single pulled easily by anyone lvl 60. This one will always spawn ghiosk. In the hall directly behind that throne there is a wooden pannel on the floor. This is an elevator up to a room with 5 or so reavers in it. The elevator can either be picked or the key nek drops works on it. One of these 5 reavers spawns rak. Not 100% sure which one it is but I beleive it's the middle one in the back. All the way up top there is a single reaver in the last room (fake floor in the center of the room so be careful) and that one will always spawn nek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank you very much!  This will help a great deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FYI: I did Rak the other day with me playing my Monk and Shaman, someone else playing a Cleric and Rogue, and the last person playing a Druid.<br />
<br />
Cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Small correction to what Chutoi said: Neh and Rak are indeed non agro, but Ghiosk will attack you on sight regardless of faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have seen this done successfully twice. <br />
<br />
With 1 mage fire pet, the battle took almost 1 hour.<br />
<br />
With 2 mage fire pets, the battle took closer to 25 minutes.<br />
<br />
Keeping the folks from falling asleep at keyboard was essential. In one battle the melees got bored when the health of Lord Rak was down to the 'o' in Lord so they ran in, got FlameSongOfRo all over them and went down like pins in a bowling alley. You DON'T want to get that spell on you. It is 850 per tick fire spell. Don't ask me how long it lasts, no one seems to last more than a few seconds: by the time healers notice you have it on you, the time to cast CHeal &gt; your life expectancy.<br />
<br />
Lord Rak falling in water was a failed attempt: not sure what exactly happened, but after rak went swimming, everyone started getting FlameSongOfRo on them and dropping like flies. Repops in the temple area who took out the mage was another failed attempt.</div></div><hr />
