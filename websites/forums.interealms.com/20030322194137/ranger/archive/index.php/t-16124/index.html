<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hunnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All<br />
<br />
Is there any goal to shoot for in regards to AC vs. ATK?  Should they be pretty even in number or should you always have higher AC than ATK or the other way around.  And does this rule of thumb change at verious levels?  Thanks so much<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At your level, attack isn't an attribute you're easily able to change, except by increasing your strength.   Attack is a combination of your weapon skill and your offensive skill, both of which are level capped, so at each level your attack will increase only so high, and then no more until the next level.  Attack bonuses on items generally  won't be available to you without a heavy raiding guild.  There are a few +attack items which are obtainable with a group or two, but mostly those items require large raids. So basically forget about attack for a while. :)<br />
<br />
AC is a calculated as a combination of your defence score and the armor you wear, so it's different in that  you can easily change your AC with gear upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Comparing these two stats probably isn't a very good way of gauging your progress, since at your level your attack is a fairly constant score (apart from the increases you will get as your weapon skills increase), which you can't change significantly with the use of items.  It might, for example, be more useful to aim for a certain number of AC points rather than comparing it to another stat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lythe Featherblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a general rule for all stats, there are 'minimums' you want to aim for to give you some versatility, and then ideal goals to aim for that will customize you in a direction of your choice.<br />
<br />
For AC, at level 39? I'd say 850-900 unbuffed if you can, 850 should be your minimum with the availability of gear these days.  Once you hit 1K+ AC unbuffed at higher levels you can pretty much leave AC unless you somehow still want to be a main tank.<br />
<br />
As the only items that boost atk are rare, don't worry unless you can get a belt of the great turtle or your epics.  Beyond that, get a bit of AC going, then concentrate on HP while boosting general stats (str/dex/stam/wis) and saves if possible, but not at the expense of hp/ac</div></div><hr />
