<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yea these guys suck.. They litter SF everyone avoids them like a plague.I found this out while in desperation to kill something while there was a shortage of other mobs in my area. They do however drop essence of sunlight quite frequently, which I just found the other day can sell from 100-400pp each(I never knew this I've vendored them /bonk!). <br />
Tools I think you need to kills theses efficiently. Your pet, black fur boots, stoicism, and spirit quickening is nice if you have it but not necessary, and a muzzle or any other summoned goodie.<br />
Ok first finding these bad boys will never be a problem. Summon pet, really don't bother with buffs.. they will dispell(yea I know duh). Maybe give yourself a hp buff if not kragg's then tuna.. less mana. If you can get one to come near your pull spot that is the best then sick pet and back off to your spot, wait till your pet bites into him for bout 10 percent then slow, if not pull with slow run and sick pet on asap so your pet takes agro.I like to keep pet up with spirit quickening 20 haste and few other stats for 50 mana is pretty good. Maybe toss in a dot or so after your pet has good agro. When pet gets low on hp I just toss a stoicism on him, I know it slows him down.. but I got patience.  :)<br />
By doing this I can normally kill them as much as I want without being dispelled. Although I wouldn't go out and get kei. Or you can always team up with a Necro/SK and fear kite. Or you can just not kill them lol. Good luck. :)<br />

I just want to clarify a few things. Chromo's randomly dispell. THey do not dispell the first or last slot if they do it is random. Second these guys have a long dispell range.  so root rotting even from a long distance won't work(although I haven't tried it with a extended range item). That being said if anyone disagrees spend a few hours trying to fight these guys. thanks<br />
On one other note it seems they dispell there own dot the most, but I think this is coincidence.</div></div><hr />

This was my favourite camp cause nobody wanted them.  Keep your first buff slot open, the chromo's will cast &quot;heat blood&quot; or &quot;boil blood&quot; can't remember exactly, but then after that they will dispell.  So yes, they are dispelling their own dots, I got a great laugh over this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just put your horse or drogmor in slot 1, they can't dispell it and will keep on trying to. I found this out while handling some adds when hunting for spells with my druid. You can get kei this way and keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone else try that horsey in slot one trick...cause that is a good one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you had horse up in first buff slot it would just ignore it and dispell the one after it  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ahh ok then wont try that trick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Besides everytime I fought the chromo's it seemed like they dispell random slots.. I could have kei right in the middle of all my buffs (kei sandwich) and that would be dispelled.. or the one above..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All i know is if ya have horse up it continues to try and dispell it, I'm pretty sure it ignored my sow and kept trying to dispell the horse instead of dotting me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heck my tactic was to pull mob and get out range Asap.  Ussually only took the dot and no dispell.  Once you get your nice little mob back to your camp.  Root it and let the pet start eating it up.  Then you can drop one dot on it ussually at about 80% and not have to worry too much about it jumping you if your pets taunt is on.  Though I found that thier dispell is not really very high and can be resisted depending on your level and resists.  Try a few buffs on dog dog and see if its worth it.  If you do find you have thier Dot on you and you want it off just step into meele range as they tend to dispell that one sooner then the others.</div></div><hr />

This was always my tactic for Chromos.  Worked like a charm. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I took my 52 shaman along with a 52 beasty into this zone for a sepll hunt.  It took us one fight with this MOB before we figured out what to do with these.  Yes, you could leave the first spell slot open, however, it didn't seem to matter.  We also experienced the &quot;random slot&quot; dispell and was really aggravating.<br />
<br />
After we cursed and whined about losing c3 and al the other high cost buffs, we realized that we too had to slow, root and sick the doggies on him.  We stayed out of range and rarely got hit with a dot, much less a dispell.  We also decided bufifng our pets out the wazoo (sp) was useless due to the dispell (MR wasn't really helpful either). So, we just continued to play pet clerics and watch for the messages about haste/spirit quickening being taken away and recast.<br />
<br />
This was very safe, rarely got adds, decent exp at that level and several spells drops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xxithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also of note, if you use the &quot;keep first slot open, and let them dispell thier dot&quot; you DON'T want to use resist gear...in fact, I would go as far as to malaise myself to prevent any chance of resisting the dot, ensuring that it lands, so it, and not something else, gets dispelled.  Keeping FR as low as possible worked great for my bard at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wanna repeat, they dispell randomly. Keeping the first slot open does nothing, I've had my kei dispelled when it was in the middle. Anyone is free to test it out, fill yourself with buffs go and melee a chrono, if it dispells the first slot coincidence, go for a few more. If it just dispelled the first slot that would be cake with black fur boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They dispell only at melee range, if fearkited (as i do with my main) they never dispell , so i guess aggrokite would work on these, just stack up dots and run and let the pet hit them from behind (ya to out innoruuk worshipping trolls). The area closest to BW comes to mind as a passable location for that activity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agro kite won't work I tried this, there dispell has a huge range. I tried root and rot with these guys but they dispell within my cast range so that won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love Clarity buffs as much as the next caster, but I worry that people are too reliant on them.   I see a lot of people fall apart in LDoN when their clarity falls and they don't know how to cast without out.  If getting clarity dispelled is part of the encounter, then there has to be a strategy that can work with it.<br />
<br />
Question on Stoicism... wouldn't chloroblast work as well?   Cblast takes more mana, but it doesn't reduce your pets DPS so the mob would theoretically fall faster.<br />
<br />
As for duo strategies: anybody tried a bard in this situation?  Bards can give us mana regen, health regen, and use damage absorption to offset canni - all of which will be renewed continually so you don't care about dispells.<br />
<br />
They can also haste your pet and remove bad effects.   <br />
<br />
Lastly, they can add dps to the beastie if needed.<br />
<br />
I have a friend bard... and I need Kunark spell drops... so maybe he will accompany me and we can try out some strategies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, I wonder what the tradeoff between faster kill and lower mana heal.  I am sure the faster kill would be greater. I think stoicism has a lower agro factor too. But overall your right just plain healin would be best. A bard would be a great addition! Because of my crazy rl schedule I always solo so duoing and all that normally isn't a option</div></div><hr />
