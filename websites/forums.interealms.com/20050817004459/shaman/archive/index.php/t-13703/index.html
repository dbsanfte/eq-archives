<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apparently all group spells are being changed on Test so that they no longer stick on lvl 42 and lower PCs.   Bye-bye cash on demand from casting KEI for a bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do low level people excluded by this change actually donate any significant amount of cash?  I know I personally donate more for KEI now at level 60 when I bother to get it than I would have at level 30, when all I could probably have afforded was a few plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It adds up, it adds up.   Sit in the bazaar and watch someone with lines of people donating for KEI.  Besides, most of those lowbies are just twinks &amp; have plenty of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do low level people excluded by this change actually donate any significant amount of cash?<br />
<br />
Alts :) I have always stayed away from KEI on my alts, but the two times that my Shaman bought it around level 30 and then 35, I paid, um, let's see, 38pp and 107pp respectively. The 107pp donation was a bit of a fluke, but I didn't cancel the trade when I noticed it, so I guess I am as guilty as the next alt of spoiling KEI-capable chanters :)<br />
<br />
And the sad thing is that that KEI more than paid for itself, which goes to show how bad the mudflation has become...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">guess thats one way to slow the game down. I dunno , its a tough choice to decide, but maybe itll slow the game downa nd make people have to group more in turn making it more social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well as an enchanter all I gotta say is WOOT.  This is a great change.  I couldn't be more happy.  No more rude noobs who think its my job to drop what I'm doing and travel to zone x to cast KEI on them.<br />
<br />
Personally I could care less about lost cash from KEI as I don't even accept donations(but will most times gladdly cast it for free, or MGB it nex for casting KEI, VoQ, or any other buff.  I couldn't give two ****s about the enchanter buff bots who whores themselves out.  If I really want to make money I can think or FAR better ways than to sit on my ass all day and cast a stupid buff.<br />
<br />
Not to mention this will help the younger enchanters get groups now that they might actually be wanted for their mana regen. <br />
<br />
So sorry to dissapoint all of you enchanter hater shamans out there<br />
(what's up with the title of this thread?).  I think most enchanters are very happy about this change minus the 'casting KEI for donations' crowd ie: the people who don't really play enchanters except make cash off our buffs and make us look like greedy fecks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best thing, and really only good thing about this is that low level enchanters will be more desired for groups.  Not sure if that is a problem these days or not.  Otherwise its just another obstacle on what a lot of people view as a rather boring grind to 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Uhm...   I would hardly charactarize myself, of the general community here as a &quot;enchanter hating shaman&quot;.   The title of this thread is about those &quot;enchanter buff bots&quot; whoring themselves out.<br />
<br />
I've sat there casting KEI over &amp; over on my friend's chanter cause I needed some cash &amp; he let me keep the money I earned doing it as long as I freed up the account if he wanted to play.   KEI has been a license to print money.<br />
<br />
Edit - for clarity's sake (pardon the pun).   He plays a &quot;real&quot; enchanter but has funded some rather obscene tradeskills and twinks by sitting around casting KEI.  Whether you yourself participate in it is a moot point, chanters have made cash hand over fist from KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For some reason... /auc Casting Malo and Torpor for donations!<br />
<br />
Doesn't get the same response....<br />
<br />
50k Saved... have seen one copy of torpor for sale in 2 months...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">as a chanter myself, I do agree with the change. Maybe you are upset that chanters were making money with it. I don't care, I don't like chanters that are selling their soul like that.<br />
<br />
And for your info, it was a request issued on chanters board since a long time...with another change that won't happen...nerf the kei duration (why do I see you shiver now? :p ), but SoE is probably not going to do that one...most of the developpers must be wizards and druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, this isn't a chanter hating board, chill out n worry not. The cash point is pretty moot, druids/wizzies made huge amounts porting (as an example) when the game began, including me, at least relative to the games wealth at the time. This waaaay more than covered the price of the spells at the time, so I don't see why chanter's earning a bit back off KEI is anyones problem.<br />
<br />
 What might be the problem is the way it is effecting chanters groupability, I played one up to 55 before KEI was really easily available so it wasn't a problem. Having said that, KEI does wear off/peeps die etc, so a chanter is still likely to be much wanted for mana regen alone, let alone the other good bits. I can see these 4 hour super extended KEI's being a bit more of an issue, however.<br />
<br />
Tbh if someone wants a highly exciting night hearing 'Hail' and clicking 'Invite' endlessly, to earn a few thousand plat, so be it. Also, pre and post KEI I got endless tells for clarity/cII anyway, so i don't think the advent of available KEI has truly changed that hassle, it's a chanters curse, since most of the population know mana-regen = good.<br />
<br />
I say, keep KEI hassle free, it makes the game more fun for a lot of people and if you don't want endless requests for c/cII/KEI then play a shaman like me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can they make those mushrooms that drop in gunthak that are one charge clarity non-lore at the same time? :) (edit: and stackable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sometimes when I'm feeling lazy I decide to drop 100p on a KEI instead of torpor/canning at an easy camp spot with my friends.  Not that often, but once a week or so.  Hopefully it'll still be worth the enchanters' while to be available for KEI.<br />
<br />
I know this is a bigger deal for my soloing wizard friend.  With no KEI he'd be hurting even at level 57.  If chanters give up on hawking it in Nexus his kill rate is going to crash hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is a bad idea. The main reason being THERE ARE NO GROUPS at lower levels. This isn't because of KEI, though it's a part of it. With Fungi's, Iksar Regen BPs, Dual Boxxing, and other item upgrades (weapons etc etc) less and less people need groups. I just leveled up my Paladin, there are like 3 places to find something that sort of resembles a group. Paludal Caverns, one group per bandit camp, then normally one or two that may or may not do fungal fiends. This is all of course predicated on no one taking up these camps with a 60 druid powering or soloing with a fungi. Then there is Dawn Shroud Peaks, normally 1 to 4 groups. Then lastly DL where you can always find 8 or 9 groups if yer willing to deal with the ****ty exp. After that is the real pickle, because from 49 to 55 unless you are a necessary class getting a PoP group is a major bitch. I suppose that you can get KEI by then, so it's not as big a problem.<br />
<br />
This in no way shape or form will fix the lack of groups. There are way to many alts, way to many cheap good items, and not nearly enough new players to keep groups going.<br />
<br />
Also, the idea that this will help people &quot;learn&quot; their class is hard to accept. Even with KEI for multiple alts including my Shaman, I've been great at it, I can off root adds. I'm constantly canni'ing even with KEI so I'm able to do more then just slow and sit there. I know what equipment to use. Alot of it is playing EQ for as long as I have (which leads me to believe experience in the game plays more of a part then leveling slowly) and making sure to use resources like these message boards. <br />
<br />
I'm rambling now, but my point is, all this will do is keep people like me from making alts because it'll take that much longer to level them. After 4 years the lowbie part of the game doesn't excite me nearly as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Amourbien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally I think this &quot;nerf&quot; is long overdue.  I recently made a magician and something is seriously wrong when buffed with Hand of Virtue and C5 I can solo red mob after red mob nonstop with over 2,500hp at level 16.  Being able to buff lower levels with 65 spells seriously unbalances the game.  I believe this an effort to redress what should have been instituted when Luclin came out.<br />

<br />
I don't think their reasoning here is to fix grouping.  Its a bug fix, simple as that, and a long overdue one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The idea of backing this change, makes me feel like I'm using a walker, chasing after those young whipper snapper kids waving a cane at them.<br />
<br />
Actually, I could care less. I don't want to hear the constant /ooc's, I turn them off. I get tells for buffs, I sometimes will, and sometimes won't. It never really bothered me, nor effected my gameplay in any significant manner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">this is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Khatmandu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With my 65 Druid using my high level spells I am able to Powerlevel my alts and my friends alts insanely fast. Does this mean that its a good thing? Personally even though its gonna hurt my ability to get an alt to a fun playing level somewhat (now I will just have to use a lower level skin instead of Bot9/PotG), it wont seriously impact my ability to powerlevel if I choose to do so. Frankly I have only PLed a cleric, and my second Shaman (Troll Innoruuk worshipping, wanted him for the ability to snare, I miss it with my Vah Shir). I have PLed the Cleric because frankly to me clerics are boring, and the Shaman because I have already played a shaman solo from 1-46 without high buffage because frankly I DONT believe that folks with high end buffs learn the intracacy and sublety of their characters abilities and shortcomings without actually playing with the buffs that would normally be available at their level.  Frankly I am not in a rush to get these guys to 65, I have played one char to 65 and others to the upper 40s without anything other than their natural skills. This has caused me to think and learn about my characters through boards like this and Eqdruids and The druids grove. I also read Steel Warriors, Monkly Business and other class boards to see what their perspective is on how to play their characters. Personally I feel that people are in such a rush to get to the end game that they miss out on the beginning and the middle, which can be fun times to make friends with others and learn about the game. In the past the progression went something like Oasis, Hhk, SK, OT, DL, and then Velks for the rest of the XP experience for some people. In my opinion these people MISSED out on a lot of the game. I cannot believe that some people with the wonderful books in PoK still cannot find their way to CoM without a frickin Port, or for that matter cant find their way to stonebrunt without using a gate. This PL experience method leaves us players who cant find their way out of a paper bag and cant find their way to a raid without whining in guild for someone to come pick them up. I know this post was just about KEI but it KEI is just one symptom of folks who want to be &quot;Uber&quot; but dont even take the time to learn what it takes to be that way.</div></div><hr />
