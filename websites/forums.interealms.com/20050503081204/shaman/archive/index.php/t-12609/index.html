<br />
The spell casts....<br />
<br />
What the hell?? Yes, ANOTHER brown bear! :rolleyes:, so it seems I'm stuck with Mr Grizzly for the rest of my days...will they ever fix that lip?! ;)<br />
<br />
So it's only barb shammies who get the nice white polar bear is it?<br />

My guess is that frogloks will be white.  <br />

There are 2 browns, 2 blacks, and only one white.  Symmetry requires frogloks to be white.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barbarians worship The Tribunal, which is as neutral as you can be.  I always assumed they made us white because we come from Halas and the place is crawling with polar bears.  We would look out of place in our homeland as anything but white.<br />
<br />
There is no real reasoning for the other races's colors, though.  Trolls and Iksars do seem to fit as black bears - evil and sinister looking.  Ogres do, as well.  Brown - simple, yet powerful (grizzly bears are the strongest bears in the real world, I believe).  Vah Shir as brown bears?  Devs got lazy, and I expect more laziness for Frogloks.</div></div><hr />

Supremely adapted to ice floes and frozen shores, the polar bear--the largest land carnivore and most carnivorous bear--ranges widely across the Arctic wilderness, seeking seals and other prey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Polar bears are widely regarded as the most deadly bear known to man.  This is partly because of their superior average size in regards to other bear species.  And partly because about half of them show a desire to hunt and kill men for food, where ass only a tiny minority of grizzly or black bears would consider humans to be prey, the polar bear considers anything it can catch to be food.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, illusions don't stack or effect each other.  You must click off the bear to become another race or visa versa, I've tried.<br />
<br />
I always thought that in keeping with the overall stuffed-toy RP'ing that Vah Shir are prone to, their illusion should be a Panda or a Koala (neither of which are bears at all, they're VEGETARIANS!  ~yeach~).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Six of one, half dozen of another.  Both Polars and Kodiaks can reach up to 1,500 lbs, but Kodiaks get a little 'taller' (at 10 feet).  Both Kodiaks and Polars have bad reputations for aggression with people.  However, there's a smaller human population in the Kodiak Islands than in close proximity to Polar bears.  Grizzlies and Black bears live even closer to populated areas.  The biggest problem you have in any case is the tendancy of food to be where humans are.  Raiding garbage cans and getting fed are much easier than finding wild food.  Therefore, humans are associated with getting food and that leads to dual tragedy.  Bears get destroyed after incidents with people, but it's not the bear's fault.  Anywhere that humans come into contact with another member of the top tier of the food chain, we see similar stories (tigers, sharks and woves).</div></div><hr />

ummmm never...  Kodiak is a subspecies of brown bear, not Polar.  About the only things they have in common are swimming, same area of the world and they don't hibernate (all other browns do).</div></div><hr />

Who said anything about them being polar bears? To clarify if you didn't catch it, I was making a jab at you barbies in your coca cola bear form..nothing more(In case you also missed this bit, kodiaks in everquest are *black*, iksar and trolls are kodiaks with gbear form :) ). <br />

Wasn't sure what you were saying....  thought you meant that Kodiaks are either black bears or polar....   As far as Verant goes, who expects them to get anything right?  Barbed Rubicite Coif is a SHOULDER item?  A Shim is a ring?  Verant = n00b programmers</div></div><hr />
