<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started playing again recently, and I've been looking for a more convenient way to equip my pet with weapons, but without a whole lot of luck. It doesn't appear that there are any items that shamans can use that summon anything our pets can wield, so I figured that the next best thing would be some sort of tradeskill solution that would allow me to make weapons out of stackable items.<br />
<br />
Well, obviously smithing doesn't work, because you can't carry a forge around with you, and all the smithed weapons require a non-stackable mold anyhow. Also, there's nothing that can be fletched in the way of a normal weapon that a pet can weild. However, there is one weapon that can be tailored on the go, made completely of stackable components, using only 6 slots per 20 weapons, with very little weight allowance.<br />
<br />
You can make a 7/33 whip with the following items: 4 heady kiolas, a medium quality cat pelt, and a whip pattern. Its not exactly as practical a solution as I had hoped for, but each whip only costs a couple of platinum to make, and if you go about it in the right way, its not much work at all to keep a good stock of weapons on you for when you're unable or unwilling to take the time to go buy more.<br />
<br />
To make a heady kiola, you simply combine 2 kiola saps with a flask of water and an empty bottle. The trivial level is relatively low, so even if you've done no brewing, you can get the skill you need for it in a couple of hours. I made about 60 stacks of them yesterday, and put most of them in the bank so that I don't have to make any again for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Getting the medium quality cat pelts is very fast an easy. For your original stock buildup, you'll probably want to go to east karana. I went there and killed everything in sight and had myself 3 stacks in no time. Once you have a good pile built up to start with, you've pretty much got it made and won't have to do that a lot though. If you adventure a lot, you can take advantage of the ldon camp geography. Ec, north ro, south ro, and everfrost, all have cats running around that you can kill while you're waiting for a group, waiting for people to show up, or waiting for melees to run back to the camp after you gate. In fact, usually you don't even have to look for them because they attack you every time you try to memorize a spell anyway. Just taking a couple of minutes to kill that stuff when you're in the area will keep you stocked up, and you can use medium and high quality pelts if you buy yourself a skinning knife.<br />
<br />
Right now I have all of this stuff in two 10 slot backpacks that I carry on me. I have 12 stacks of kiolas, 3 stacks of whip patterns, and 3 stacks of pelts. That's enough to make 60 weapons in just 2 packs, with 2 slots leftover for a collapsable sewing kit and a skinning knife. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how practical this idea will turn out in the long run, but I always find myself running out of weapons, so I'm going to give it a chance. I don't think it will be very much of a time investment to keep stocked once I get used to it and have a good system.<br />
<br />
Anyways, hope this isn't a repost, and I hope its helpful to someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While creative, i would rather spend the time you did farming all that stuff, asking a mage to summon me some gear or going to the bazaar and paying 10pp a pop for some gear. Its vastly better equipment and for 100pp, which is not alot at any level anymore, im done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is a really good tip, and I've never heard it before.  It is, at the same time, convenient and inconvenient.  It is convenient because once you have all the supplies, you are good to go for weapons for a pretty long time, and it only takes up two bags with minimum weight usage.  It is inconvenient because you have to get all those pelts.  I could be wrong, but I don't think you will usually find a lot of them for sale.  Most people that farm them know they can make more money by turning them in to leather padding, and thus do so.  A lot of people also buy them in bulk while doing tradeskills, so it is not uncommon to find them completely unstocked.  That leaves you with farming.  I've spent plenty of time farming tradeskill components, but never these.  They shouldn't be too hard to scrape up, but I doubt you're going to get 3 stacks of them &quot;in no time.&quot;  If all the ruined pelts were MQ pelts, then it would be a breeze, but it's not =\<br />
<br />
This isn't something I would ever use, but I know there are lot of folks who are more enthusiastic about their pets that will love this.  Very original idea, kudos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking it might be a fun idea for a lower level shaman. I mean at those levels there isnt alot in the way of summoned gear and im sure you could even make a lil exp in the right spot while doing it and beyond that like you said, it might be just plain fun for someone.<br />
<br />
But at 65 , no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As of right now, all you can do is carry bags and bags of weapons.   The best to aquire EVER are ...........<br />
&quot;Forging hammers&quot;.   They cost about 1 silver each and are available at ANY town.<br />
I also carry around a pair of Serrated bone dirks, just incase snare is needed in some situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After LDoN adventures comes the money /split.  After that's done is when I restock.  On the reagents used for disarming chests (or opening them?  forget which one it is), and pet weapons.  The LDoN 1h weapons that drop during adventures can be bought from a Magus for around 5pp each.  I buy 1hs and 1hb as my pet weapons, this way I can tell for sure that he is dual wielding, and can better parse his dps if I ever wanted to do that.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if our pet just dual wielded by default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always used rusty daggers, you can get then really easily from one of the two guys fishing in the square little ponds in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to clarify a little bit, I don't intend to use these whips everwhere I go. That would just be a silly waste of effort. My only intent is for it to be used as a very space and weight efficient reserve for the times I do run out of weapons, and every shaman DOES run out of weapons, whether it be because of linkdeaths, deaths, zoning, playing for a long time where weapons aren't available, or just forgetting to buy more.<br />
<br />
I didn't mean that its a good idea to use these for adventures. All I was trying to say is that if you do adventures a lot, its easy to keep your components stocked during all those times you're inevetibly just standing around anyway. The only real wasted time is making the kiolas, but all the reagents are sold on vendors, and you can make months worth at a time and store them in your bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I make a habit of restocking from mobs when I can.  For example if I use the EF Spiritstone, along the way to the PoK book I can kill a couple weapon carrying skeletons.  If i'm on my way out of Droga I usually kill a couple of the whip carrying goblins at the entry.  I make a point to never spend more than 1pp on a pet weapon unless I'm getting a special weapon for a special reason (Gnoll Lariet, Serated Bone Dirk,etc.)  I only donate for pet weapons if I plan on soloing for awhile.  If i only plan on soloing somewhere until I get a group, I don't want to waste mage pet toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">a better spot to hunt pelts would be SBM (I think)  the cats there drop up to 4 pelts at a time.<br />
<br />
not 100% sure on that, its been a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOng time but the do drop ore than one at a time.<br />
<br />
I would still rather farm gnoll hide lariats than pelts but for a mid lvl shaman who relies on Dog Dog for soloing thats a really good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vah Shir have it a bit easier than most, if we have a spiritstone.<br />
<br />
There's a merchant in Shar Vahl that sells wooden practice weapons.  They're light, cheap, and it's a 20 second run from the spiritstone bind point.<br />
<br />
Add the fact that our spiritstone drops us right IN Shar Vahl, not in an adjacent zone, and you can see the convenience.  Our spiritstone bind is exactly where newbie shaman start, staring at our starting guildmaster.  To me, it's a lesson in humility and appreciation, reappearing in the same spot where I started so very long ago, naked, naive, and not having a clue how to play the game.  I usually reflect on the long journey I've travelled for a brief moment before setting off to buy pet weapons.  It's almost spiritual  :)<br />
<br />
When I run out of pet weapons, I bind where I am (if possible), spiritstone to Shar Vahl, restock, then gate back.<br />
<br />
Chalk up another mark in the kitty column for shaman race superiority.  ;)<br />

<br />
hrm. I hadn't even think of that, but that's a really good idea too. I'll try and find out what all weapons are like that, but with the way most filters work, you'd pretty much have to go through an enormous list of weapons to find it unless you already know. That'd be a pretty good way to go if its easily hoardable though.<br />
<br />
Some of you guys seem to sort of miss the point of all of this. Its not exactly a real tricky thing to buy weapons. Its just a matter of being more self-sustaining. That's more important to some players than others, but I'm pretty sure no one needs any hot tips on how to buy rusty weapons from Bubar or kill orc pawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think most of us got the point actually... we are just too tired to post &quot;good idea&quot;.  =P<br />
<br />
I think it's a cool idea for when I suddenly realize that I forgot to guy buy weaps.  However, I will soon run into the same problem with a twist...  I forgot to go farm some pieces to make my weaps =P.<br />
<br />
But then, I'm the kinda guy that sees &quot;you are hungry&quot; and thinks to himself....  Wow, at some point I had 2 stacks of misty's in my inventory...  How long did I let that one slip.</div></div><hr />

once you get that figured out, we'll pretty much be able to rule the land with an iron fist, unopposed, for all of eternity.</div></div><hr />
