<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of starting a froglok shaman and going to sell gear off two characters I have which should give me the amount of approximately 8-9k. <br />
<br />
First, I'd like to say please don't be mad at me and my sympathy goes out to the trolls and the fact the frogloks started in that city. I wish we had our own. But I digress.....<br />
<br />
1.What Pierce weapon? ( I have a 1hb and 2hb already)?<br />
2.What is the foci II item name which give extended buff?<br />
3.What is the foci II item name which give extended dot's?<br />
4.Is there any suggestions on armor around the foci items that would be within my budget and good on AC?<br />
5.Honestly, can a deticated casual player shaman solo with mediocore gear and no guild to 60th? I'm familiar with root/rot tactics.<br />
<br />
Please - the one subject I don't want to talk about is the price of our high level spells and rate of which they drop. I'm well aware of this grave dilema. I plan to stay at 55th lvl with all full xp into aa points. One day I should have saved up enough to purchase the spells I need to be a productive shaman. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman solo well but they are not the most efficient. If you want to play a class to solo then I wouldnt make a shaman. Necro Mage druid wizard all solo far better xp wise. Most classes can solo up to 60.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you are so worried about the high level shaman spells, the only one that makes a large difference is torpor and with the new shaman CH spell that isnt nearly as bad as it used to be.<br />
<br />
As soon as a shaman gets their pet then one of the best methods is to tank the mobs youself using your pet as a manaless dot. Root dot actually is most useful for a shaman that can makes massive amounts of mana to stack dots without using mana ie 60+ with torpor cann5 etc. (Or in dungeons where pet aggro is an issue).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is not a good game for solo play.  <br />
Dedicating a character to solo play is a losing proposition.  The shaman is a better group class than a solo class, tho at later levels the solo power is definitely there.  Shamans are also very gear dependant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any class can solo till around lvl 15 - 20 easily.  After that, is when classes start becoming defining on what their role is.  I soloed a bit until I got to 15, then grouped for the most part till around 31 I think.  I ended up starting soloing at this point because I got sick of standing there in HHK looking stupid hoping for someone to take me (by this time, most of my RL friends were around late 30s early 40s cause they played when most people were in bed).  I stopped at lvl 34 and sold SOW potions (this was just a bit before the bazaar feature came out) until I grabbed some better armor, which isn't really that hard now, considering the bazaar feature now.  At that point, I started soloing exclusively and did so until lvl 60, when I started to go to PoP places (it came out when I was lvl 58).  This has a bit to do with your gear..and although I didn't have the best stuff, I did not use the root/rot techniques.  I pet kited one lvl or so because I felt the giants in FV were smacking me a bit too hard.  From lvl 34 and up I had a KEI on constantly, but never any money in the bank because of it.  Just remember the age old shaman thing..if you are going to create a shaman...go hp/ac over wisdom.  Find your wisdom comfortable point...which is the point that you think you can survive with that much wisdom, without feeling like you don't have enough for any known fight.  I personally was happy for a while with 170 wisdom and around 200 in bear form with C3.  But...that isn't for everyone and now I tend to have more just cause the good equipment ends up having a wisdom/sta/hps on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by Landragoran Heronwing <br />
Shamans are also very gear dependant. <br />
<br />
I disagree.  As long as you've got enough HP to not get flattened and enough mana to not go oom, you're fine.  Gear helps but the skill is what defines us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i disagree at lvl60+ if you count the spells like torpor in our equipment, sometimes harder to get this kind of spell than a piece of equipment.<br />
then epic/jbb.<br />
<br />
so yes we are also very gear dependant even at low levels with decent ACs/Hps, wisdom stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bummer - I thought shammies had some soloability. The real reason I chose shaman is I really want to play the new froglok race and all the other classes are less of a solo class IMO.<br />
<br />
Ah well. <br />
<br />
As a casual player - having a class that can solo if a group or time isn't available is the only viable key.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. It's clear. Shammies are equipment based to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you can solo to 60 if you'd like. it wont be as efficient as grouping but it can be done. also at a few points in a shamans life your style will change. when you get canni 1. when you get your pet. level 49. level 58. gear will make it easier but better skills outweigh most gear.<br />
  focus items: the one i would get is the coldain military wristguard. not bad stats for a starting character and longer dots for your soloing.have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've soloed 1-50 pretty much and I think that Shaman make fine soloers as long as you realize your restrictions and you find good areas to fight in. I'm not so sure how soloing is past 50, but I'd image it gets easier, but less efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grab a kei and you can solo just fine.   Don't know what these guys are talking about to be honest.  You really don't need a group for good exp 'til ya hit 51.  I would always get better exp solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman solo very well, they also are greatly desired in groups, so no matter what mood I am in, I can do something to get exp if i feel like grouping or not, <br />
<br />
I'm however still at level 52 still saving up to get a jbb, a cheap horse (to negate sit agro in the planes), and also to start saving up for the expensive spells in my future</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whoa....slow down...then the hell did anyone say or even think that shaman are not good soloers.  Basically, it comes down to how efficient you are and how good of a player you are.  Yes, grab KEI (C3) at any opportunity because that will up your exp rate dramatically.  I am serious when I say that shaman are GREAT soloers.  Even though some may think that their exp rate is better while grouping, it all depends on where you are going at at your level.  Read the forums on where to go at your current level and it will help you decide on where the best place to go is.  I mean, HHK group exp is pretty good.  But it does no good (for me anyways) when you have a set spawn time and have to sit there and wait for it to spawn again.  I got better exp it seems around those levels to solo in Splitpaw or around the spires in SK.  I did 44-49 in about 15 hours of playing while soloing in DL, TM, and FV.  Prior to PoP, I think that the best place that I saw for exp to get to 60 was katta.  The mobs were just too easy and not enough of them to be doing this with a full group, but one person was excellent.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, it's a lot of fun to have a shaman.  I even enjoying doing it while soloing, partially because I always had the mob in my face, and partially because I had the serverwide crucible keeping me entertained.  Talk to druids and wizzies and ask them how bored they get while soloing.  <br />
<br />
Take this for example, and remember that at that time I didn't have the best equipment and I didn't have my epic.  At level 57 I was in the jaggedpine caves fighting gnolls back near the room where the head gnoll pops.  Back here is a big open area that you can set up camp and have about 20 - 30 mobs to choose from.  I could theorectically kill 10 - 12 gnolls before the first one popped back on me.  I watched a druid quad in there (it's big enough to quad in there) and watched him kill 4 then med, then grab four more after he was full mana.  By the time that the pops were coming back...he was just getting ready to start his second quad. <br />
<br />
Just remember, that you will not have to med after every kill.  With canni, kei  and especially a horse (I didn't get mine till lvl 59, although I would suggest saving for one asap), you should be able to keep your mana pretty high, and therefore be able to keep your mana up high enough to make a huge difference in soloing vs. grouping.  I suggest that you solo as much as possible, but don't forget to group a bit to make sure that you are aware of your roles in a group type environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On these boards you will see a lot of &quot;this way is the only way&quot; kinds of statements.  They're not true.  Root rot works fine, pet kiting works fine, blind kiting works fine, tanking works fine.  Find a situation and gear that suits the style that you want, and go with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When ya hit 34 do the yeti caves in DL.  When you're done with those head to lake of ill omen bloodgills.  You can get better exp with these solo than a group anywhere in the game.   BTW, you can get from level 6 to 25 in Paludal Caverns very quickly as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When ya hit 34 do the yeti caves in DL <br />
<br />
Be careful, there are some caves that are actually high 40s solo with Yetis (dont green out till 51 or 52 I think).<br />
<br />
I agree with the others, I alternated soloing and grouping throughout my career and never had any problems doing either.  Death can be very painful on xp loss in your 50s though, so its usually better to have a cleric around if you are doing something dangerous.  Just try and stock up on HP gear where you can if you are going to melee some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All the way the lvl 40.  Hehe took a year off in the middle though.<br />
<br />
I can't prove it, but the conventional wisdom this that its faster to xp in a group than solo.  As a casual player myself (a few hours a week if I'm lucky) I chose a shaman for its versatility, at least in the levels a casual player is likely to see.  I think I do ok, hey I'm having fun !<br />
<br />
As to gear I can speak to this from direct experience.<br />
For the first year I played EQ it was straight up-no twinking at all.<br />
Had Totemic and Ry'Gorr, Spine Chill and CGS into my mid 30's.  Quit for over a year and came back to find all my friends in their 60's.  I have good friends and they kicked in 10k for me to 'catch up some' :D <br />
<br />
Hit the Baz a bit and eventually had more like 15-17k from 3-4 months of work/trading/upgrading, and while it does make a difference its not that huge of a difference. <br />
<br />
Well- I lie it is a big difference with a horse and Ikky BP,  REIF and haste gloves, but you can do it straight-up, you'll just have to be more careful.<br />
<br />
The moral of this story is Shaman's are versatile and fun for a casual player imo.<br />
<br />
That and its nice to have rich friends.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bu1wink1e</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, I read this thread and as another who want to start a Frogy Shaman, I need to ask: (Oh I should add I have a 52 Druid funding this toon.)<br />
<br />
What should my primary weapon type be?  I'm guessing Piercing.<br />
<br />
Armor: I have a few pieces tha I have collected:  Sun Chalice, Sun Leggings, Coldain Skin Boots, Jaundiced Bone Vambraces, Leaf Scale Gloves, and the ability to get any piece of Drake or Wyvrn armor made by a guildie.  Also have about 5k in the bank (thank you Seb).  What should I look at getting to be the Uber Shaman I know I can be?<br />
<br />
<br />
What aspects of being a Shaman should I be aware of?  I've played my Druid about 60 to 70 percent solo so have no trouble with that, and have played every role, Nuker, Slower, Healer, Transport, Buffer so I know those fairly well.<br />
<br />
I plan on PL this toon fast to lvl 16 or 20 through various quest.  Will this affect me badly in anyway other than spell casting??<br />

Too much PLing and your defense skill will suffer badly, which you will regret later.</div></div><hr />
