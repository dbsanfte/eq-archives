Besides Cann5 (which is killer) there isn't a Shaman AA ability class that seems like it really extends our class and makes us better at a core ability. Most useful for PVP tournaments, really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still think that Rabid Bear should be on a 15minute reuse timer and only last for 60 seconds. <br />
<br />
It is very seldom we find the time to melee continuously for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
This would make the skill more fun.</div></div><hr />

Depending on whether I have Torpor, I may get Rabid Bear before Mass Cann.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's just a toy.. but it's my toy, I have fun with it...  the guild gets a good laugh when the Raid Leader shouts &quot;ALL OFFENSIVE DISCS NOW&quot; and I go RB and charge in.. and that's what it's for.. a good laugh. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted.. I'd LOVE to see it on an hour, or 45 minute timer... but I'm not crying because it's not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">only parsed my bear a couple times, best dps ive gotten was 39.99   useing my tae ew war maul  ( 33  35 )  <br />
<br />
besides duels, Ive used it for the rare solo named fights (can you say summoners? I knew you could), and for just plain fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i have 118 AA points and don't even thinking to have that skill.<br />
2 hours+ refresh time is just not right and last so few minutes.<br />
<br />
for about the same time i can cast (twice).<br />
<br />
bane of nife <br />
pox of bert.<br />
env bolt.<br />
<br />
torpor/<br />
canni 5.(going near FM)<br />
JBB.between.<br />
<br />
redoing bane/env bolt/<br />
canni 5 again ,all in less than 5 min. can do very good damage.and still being FM after.<br />
<br />
if i was in a pvp server(or duelling a lot) i would surely got it,but if they don't raise the lenght of the buff,or lower the refresh time.<br />
well it's just not for me.......................................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rabid bear owns in duels, period. 99 % haste helps a lot against casters. Casting time is instant which is great, turns you from unbuffed to a well buffed and decent fighter instantly. The proc is sweet too. Was raising 2hb before I retired, but never hit 200. With epic your dps is about 35 in rabid bear form against the same target (small mushroom). It's a ton of fun, and you need to get several class skills for Elder title anyway, I'd definately get it again if I had to choose a second time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does Rabid bear grey out your gems like the Rage line does?<br />

If it doesnt then to the nay sayers I soundly direct a large amount of THHHBBPPPHHT.<br />

<br />
awesome log ! Nice weapon used, but well done overall. And I agree with most that it's a toy, but when u can afford it (wow, 116 AA) it is so much fun :-)<br />
<br />
This hotkey made me laugh out loud, thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rabid Bear is like having your favorite candy bar but only being able to take one bite from it each day.<br />
<br />
For the time and effort it takes to get it, it is a pretty sorry AA skill to have.  Apparently, someone at VI thinks that its a sin to give PC casters any shred of melee ability even though they have loaded casting skills onto PC melees and NPC casters can melee far above the abilities of PC casters of the same levels.<br />
<br />
So, if you have time to waste, sure get Rabid Bear.  But the fundamental problem of balancing caster melee abilities will stay with us until someone at VI gets a clue.</div></div><hr />
