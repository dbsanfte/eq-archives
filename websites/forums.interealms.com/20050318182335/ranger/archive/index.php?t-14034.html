Its clear it seems the really good xp is coming from tier 2+  planes.  Is it difficult to get into a trials group as a pick up or are these being done mainly by guilds now?<br />
<br />
And for those who have successfully completed them, any suggestions as to make up of the group to be most effective? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Mages.  Get 2 mages, a cleric, warrior, chanter and you, and you are set.   Mages can banish the rocks, and still do great dps with nukes and their pet...<br />

Its all a matter of DPS.  Our level 61 Exiled Summon works well on the rocks.  Using Trueshot with a good bow during the middle of the 2nd wave should last long enough to get you through most of the 4th wave.  The higher the levels of people in your group the better for both new damage tables and new spells.</div></div><hr />

As far as when to save trueshot for, I'd wouldnt use it til at least the 3rd wave, if not til a bit later.  With it, and good support damage from casters and melee, it should last through the 4th wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we commonly do it now is warrior, chanter, cleric, random_DPS, ranger, ranger.  One ranger trueshots during wave 3, the other during wave 4.  Then, if the casters are lom, kite the boss until they have mana.  I can do it in my sleep now, due to all the friends (and my level 48 shaman) I've been helping get their marks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warrior who goes AFK right before you start.<br />
<br />
The paladin and shadowknight that stand around trying to attack your pet (bard specific yes, but the whole not able to target/pet health bar next to the bards name gives it away)<br />
<br />
Hitting your rapid assist hotkey and finding the main tank/attacker targeting the rogue.<br />
<br />
Basically what you need to do is find a group of people that you know, are wiling to help and are will help you by being there.  There is no static &quot;good group&quot; in the trials because it does seriously depend on gear and the persons ability to play their character.<br />
<br />
I mean I've seen a 2 druid, magician, paladin, bard, monk group rock the place.   And conversly I've seen the 2 Rogue, Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Monk group fail miserably.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zolina</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience, a good bard seems to be the key.  AoE slow = far less damage for the group and less risk of aggro for the cleric.  Bards can also charm, regen hp/mana, etc.  I'd also recommend a mage or wizard for emergency nuking, and a warrior for the boss.  Fill the rest of the group with damage dealers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">decairn</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I see in Valor/Storms there are some people getting keyed with pick-up groups, or possibly riding a guild event or two.<br />
<br />
Pick-up groups will work, but you need to make sure your DPS is high as others have noted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vebran</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just make sure that the bard you get is level 62 and have the level 62 slow song.  That one is 50% while the level 48 one that the sub 62 bards have is (at least for me) very heavily resisted and didn't provide the agro to keep things off of the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reandn</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditto the bard thing....<br />
<br />
I had tried Execution with a variety of groups and never succeeded.  Then we got a 64 bard (who had the 62 ae slow song) and we did it perfectly, twice.  <br />
<br />
Without the bard we generally had issues with somebody getting aggro and dying.  With the bard, we barely had to heal.  So you need the bard, one decent healer, and DPS.<br />
<br />
My first successful group was: 62 ranger (me), 60 warrior, 60 rogue, 62 cleric, 62 wizard, 64 bard.<br />
<br />
Then we swapped out the 62 wizard for a 60 paladin (that's gotta be a massive cut in DPS) and suceeded again!  This time was a lot closer than the first time, due to lower DPS. We were also lacking any enchanter/shaman haste on the second run (just had bard haste when he could sing it, which probably wasn't 100%).<br />
<br />
Bard + healer + DPS seems to be the key.  Just make sure your MA latches onto mobs quickly, no wasting time.<br />
<br />
Definitely load the level 61 Exile Summoned -- nuking for 725 damage is great.  And have somebody watching the progress of the executioner and call out NUKE if it is getting close.  I had Calefaction, Firestrike and Exile Summoned loaded (along with Abolish Disease and Abolish Poison -- for curing slows and tashes), and needed them all.<br />
<br />
I used TS against the boss mob, more for fun than because we actually needed it. <br />
<br />
The cleric in my successful runs did more nuking than healing, I think.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestra</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't really matter what your group set up is. You need the dps, but you can get that from any class. Mages, melee, wizzies etc.. There's lots of classes that can dish out enough DPS to keep you in the race.<br />
<br />
What I have found to be of key importance though is having a secondary healer. Any healer, could be a druid, shaman, but even a ranger or paladin can really save your ass in there.<br />
<br />
Last night I did Trial of Hanging (think it's called that) with 2 mages, a cleric, a monk, a beastlord and me (ranger). We failed twice due to the fact that we had to learn which mobs to target first etc because they couldn't be rooted or mage-messed. The third time we would have died if it wasn't for my heals. I used weaponshield on the last guy and then healed myself up from half a bub of health and then healed the 'real' tank till we won. Cleric was OOM. Was a real close fight. But so much fun.<br />
<br />
With exe I found that we needed a secondary healer because the cleric got aggroed lots. Needed the shaman heals to keep our cleric alive.<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my take on it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymrich</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lots of good advice :) but me think is one thing overlooked..<br />
<br />
practice! am pretty sure almost any group could do the executioner trial as long as they all practice several times. with pickup groups, you will get ppl that won't try but 1 or 2 times, and have to be replaced with another lfg. all it rlly takes is a group that is willing to keep trying :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done exe with the following groups<br />
<br />
me, rog, druid, ench, wiz, mag.   me tanking<br />
me, rog, dru, shm, nec, brd.        me tanking<br />
me, rog, war, cler, brd, mnk.        war tanking<br />
<br />
you can do it with almost any classes as long as they are balanced.  Make sure you either have a bard or chanter for CC.  It is all or nothing so make sure if it looks tight you go all out offensive.  <br />
<br />
Make sure you know mana levels during wave 4 and be ready to kite.  You can keep the boss kited for ever without getting hit once you start.  I just run him around the stage.  It looks very funny for everyone else watching this big mad axe man chasing me.  I had tangling weeds memed just to get agro for kiting. (Immune to snare but still agros him).  Once I had him kited for a while the slower dropped the first slow on him while I kited and kept agro.  By the time the fight started he had no attention for anyone other then me and I never lost agro.  Hehe also the druid healing on one of the tries complained that he was gaining mana rather then losing it healing me while I tanked :)  I did have regen and fungi on to reduce the ehaling I needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't forget Exile Summoned if you have it.  this is your friend.  You can use it on the rocks.  While some people fear the rocks as they can not be mezzed I look forward to lots of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ralence</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last successful run I was in consisted of<br />
<br />
62 ranger, 62 ranger, 62 bard, 60 mage, 60 cleric, 60 ench.<br />
<br />
  As as has been stated previously bards are really great for this.  We made it to exec, and the cleric died immediately, the bard tanked the entire fight with no heals, and we won.<br />
<br />
  How he tanked the entire fight with no heals I honestly have no idea, but it definitely was impressive.<br />
<br />
  I've found that if a warrior doesn't have AE taunt, there's a lot of classes better suited to tank for this trial at least.<br />
<br />
  Rangers and SK's for example can gain aggro a lot faster than a warrior, and since time is crucial, being able to just break mez and chain cast tangling weeds to taunt is a lot more effective.<br />
<br />
  Again, this only applies to warriors without AE taunt, and from my personal experiences with the trials.</div></div><hr />

Took 4 tries.. we had the DPS, though shaman died first try, cleric died 2nd try, we were too slow killing a named rock 3rd (they have higher hp, watch out), and then it worked, though our monks were dead and casters OOM when executioner was at 25%, druid epic+my arrows while cleric kited finished it off.<br />
<br />
Instead of crowd control we just stuck big damage shields on everyone, and the shammy AoE slowed.</div></div><hr />

war w/ ae taunt or paladin, you (ranger), bard 1, bard 2, wiz or mage w/ epic, cleric...its a breeze...charm 2 right away, and you have 2 300 hitting pets...last one yoru dps goes down, so you need the mage or wiz to kill it off, rest is cake</div></div><hr />

I am not sure about the whole proccess. can someone explain please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is most of the better equipped/skilled players have already made it thorugh so generally have lower lvl etc now at trials thus its harder to get a decent pickup grp. We generally have been AOE'ing guildies through its slow and a pain i know one of our wizzies has spent over 50hrs or so doing this, aka my fiancee. The trials are put there to seperate different so callee class's of people, thebetter equipped/level/skill vs people who arent etc, letting those generally in larger guilds so better equipped xp alot faster then those below, wether you think this is fair is a different matter but like all the &quot;flags&quot; in POP it seperates those that can vs those that cant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am still doing trials.  Had another 3 groups get through on Sunday (8 people flagged).  Most of the stronger better equiped people in the guild have been flagged for a while but some like me are making sure the others get through as well.  XP in the tier 2 planes is so much better that those who do not get flagged will be left behind.  We already have many level 65s and I have slipped a bit by helping others but it will pay off in the long run as we will have more people able to raid the higher tiers in PoP.<br />
<br />
As for the AE tactics I can say it works very well.  We tried yesterday with 3 wiz, chant, cler and me.  Each wave was dead before the exe reached the stage and we had a lot of time to med up.  The problem came on the boss.  I kited him long enough to get everyone back to full mana but for some reason the cleric had trouble keeping me up.  I replaced one of the wizards with a druid, and the AE was not as efficient but worked fine.  When it came to the boss we had more then enough extra healing to see it through.  I may try variations on the AE to get my next batch of guildees through.</div></div><hr />

Don't know if it's because I've mostly had pick up groups in my 20+ attempts at trying them or what, but...<br />
The cleric always seems to die, or run oom, and ponging is almost always an issue too. There are the &quot;an enchanter is a must&quot; camps, and then those who say one isn't....<br />
But, any group I've been in has never made it past the 3rd wave without either someone (mostly the cleric or chanter) dying or them running oom. Then, of course, I get tells from friends saying &quot;oh we did it yesterday with 5 Shammies and a warrior and it was so EASY!&quot;  (I'm kidding)<br />

Best tip I can give is that the MA has to be able to target fast and never ever switch until 1st mob is dead.Also try to keep every one together,having to run to target next mob is a loss of seconds and every second counts.<br />
Dont help casters who get jumped sounds cold but every one is on there own in there pretty much.<br />
Be fully buffed to the gills when you go in,get an mr buff.Rocks are chanters they will tash,slow,and mezz you if they can.<br />

And to get the flag....this is done out of order but oh well<br />
1) Complete the trial,loot your mark<br />
2) Go down to Death Row,fight your way to Mavuin in the last cell<br />
3)Hail Mavuin..follow text say key words blah blah recieve 1st flag<br />
4)head back to Tribunal room and Hail any of the Tribunals say &quot;I have come to plead Mavuins case&quot; or something like that,recive 2nd flag<br />
5) Back to DR,Hail Mavuin a 2nd time follow text,say key words blah blah recive last flag<br />

Have your summoned nuke memmed, the ratio on the 61 summoned nuke is mad DPS, some of the rocks are immune to banishment.<br />
Druids are equal in power to mages in trials, its an outdoor zone and they can also banish summoned, another healer for emergencies on the boss mob is always good.<br />
that sums up my experiences from many trials, glad i got mine down in 2nd attempt :) hope this helps you guys wanting flags</div></div><hr />

Only glitch of the night was after the 4th wave the boss mob took down the paladin before the any of us could blink.  Much love for Weaponshield! Gave the party enough time to reorientate.<br />
<br />
Dont hestiate to trade buffs with members not part of your group - i.e. Focus and Boar from shamans are a great help, mod rod for you cleric for a little added saftey.  SoT and SoP are great buffs at trials to be able to trade with or even the older SoN/CoP or combination of new/old.</div></div><hr />
