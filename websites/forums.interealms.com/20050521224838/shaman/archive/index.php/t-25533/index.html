<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The group I normally hunt with has 2 shamans on the path to Mystic. We've only grouped together a few times, but it seems like there's a lot of overlap. Only to be expected, but also sometimes frustrating, especially as a lot of spells don't stack. At least in the later days of EQ1, our DoTs stacked.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if folks here had any comments on the usefulness of 2 shamans in a group, and whether there was much difference if one of those was a Defiler.<br />
<br />
If I'm going to change subclass or even class, I need to do it now, while I can.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

not much stacking I think, at least for 2 mystics. Usually when with another shaman in group one does wards and the other direct heals. No idea if there is less overlap with defiler though, at least their spells have different names.<br />
<br />
You can only become a mystic, btw., as you are level 18 according to your sig. To become a defiler you would have had to betray to Freeport at level 17 max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was even thinking of going Templar with my main, and keeping the shaman as an alt.</div></div><hr />

No, 17 is the max. I was capped at 17 until I finished my betrayal.<br />

<br />
Personally, druid/cleric is the best healing team in the game as far as I'm concerned.  Until they fix wards to take into account tank mitigation, our healing power will be gimped in comparison.</div></div><hr />
