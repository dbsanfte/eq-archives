<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kabruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't played in a while and i've decided to start 2-boxing, now what I want to know is exactly what the title says. <br />
<br />
Whats the best melee class to duo with my 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
I've narrowed it down to:<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Shadowknight<br />
Ranger<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Lots of input is appreciated, reasons why, experiences etc.  thank you very much for all the help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lotta posts around here about this, most would say take a knight class. If ya wanna bit more dps pick sk. If ya want more healing pick pally. If ya want track and all that entails take a ranger, they got the best dps of the 4. Not really any benefit to a zerker that I can see, no spells, crappy aa's, same defense as ranger, and they limited as to what weapons they can use as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so far, im liking my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Beastlord. Because the beastlord can basically do it all leaving the shaman time to just hang out and chat.  It could be a good duo for the shaman to get homework done during play time or read a nice novel.  All around win-win.<br />
<br />
Couldn't resist, sorry. Here's a serious answer, go with a ranger, high dps like the old monk/shaman combo but has more utility.  High dps class + shaman = levelling fast, and a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
My shammy is fairly &quot;uber&quot;, and for about a month I boxed a retired friend's 10k+hp shadowknight.  I realize this is probably irrelevant to what you're talking about, but the shaman and shadowknight were killing two and three mobs at a time in Halls of Honor.  BoT duoing was a joke as far as challenging but giants died really damn quick.<br />
<br />
SK/Shaman is one of the game's true &quot;power duos&quot; regardless of level or gear.  The only thing that could challenge SK/Shaman as far as priest/melee duo efficiency would be beastlord/druid or maybe paladin/enchanter on the very uber end of the scale (I realize enchanters aren't priests =)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Big thumbs up from me on the SK too.  Have my own, and snare and FD are two of the best spells in the game by far.  Both are fantastic for pulling and controlling mobs.  With an SK's aggro and a snared mob you can kite around all day till a slow lands without ever getting aggro on the shaman.<br />
<br />
An SK can also use his pet to FD pull singles easily.  And if you get the circlet of shadow(not shadowS), you can insta-click an invis on him to make him an even better puller.  There's also an earring that levs him and gives him EB you can click on him...add all those things together and you have a toon that can get anywhere really quickly and with minimal danger.  Heck they can ITU themselves, too.<br />
<br />
And the mana and health they can give you back with zefveer's bite can help a shaman nicely too.  <br />
<br />
Other toons can work great with shamans too, but getting the FD/snare combo is really a pretty amazing addition.  They're even kind of fun to use. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Monk will get you two to lvl 50 without any problems, by the early to mid-fifties he can't tank anymore...<br />
<br />
But otherwise monks are great, rarely have to heal them at all, with slow landing they can stay full health with Mend.  Plus they're a good DPS class on top of being a meat shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SKs are a lot more fun to play than Monks, too, in my experience. Maybe I just like spells, though, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think monks are best for old world stuff for sure.<br />
<br />
My monk/shammy combo can take out anything in terms of farming.. basically any targets in kunark / velious etc short of raid mobs... and maybe even a lot of them heh.<br />
<br />
If you want something longer term I would personally take pally just so they can rez you as well as lull pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Depends on where you want to duo really. Right now with incite and bellow etc Warriors are the aggro KINGS.. 2 1hs weapons + 2 anger 3 procs and no one can take aggro.. given that they have the highest hps and defensive which means you can tank some mobs using him that an sk/paladin just can't handle.<br />
<br />
So for the long term, nothing beats a warrior. Ya if you want to xp in ldon an sk is better. Or if you are in a deep dungeon and more than a 1 pull will kill you then SK or Paladin is better. But if you want to take out nameds worth a damn, an sk/paladin just don't cut it..<br />
<br />
Now people who have tried a 10k SK/Paladin, with that gear the warrior would be 11k+ and have unrivaled aggro/defensive capabilities. + 5% bonus to mitigation, + higher ac on their armor. <br />
<br />
I play a 11.5k warrior / 7k mana cleric / stupid shaman(me) three box a lot and I have to say it is amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you know what? even tho they are such close classes, i love grping with my brothers bstlord.  We take out some pretty fun stuff.  Nothing too tuff, but we do duo some named in BoT, the lower lvl of course.  He is of course a 65bst, has about 5khp unbuffed.  He can buff his attack to around 1800 to 1900 at any time, so him and the warder put out a TON of dos.  And of course, for a shaman, a slowed mob is a dead mob, so thats all pretty simple.  If the mob is resisting heavily my bro will slow tho, LOL he main slows yes, and i just focus on dots and heals.  But overall, its a fun combo.<br />
<br />
As far as taking out heavier content, i would prolly go with a warrior.  No he cannot put out as much dps as a SK/Pally, but as others have said, he can take a lot more punishment and can keep the agro over my slows/dots.  GL with whatever you choose.<br />

<br />
Thankfully, that's not quite true &lt;says the Monk in me&gt; :)<br />
<br />
Granted, a Monk doesn't tank as well as a knight, not so much because he will take more damage over time (which parses show is not really the case on XP mobs with comparable AC/AAs), but because a Monk's defense is based on avoidance, not mitigation. Still, with Stonestance and Mend, a Monk can usually tank XP mobs long enough for Malos/Slow to land and then it's quite doable with Q and Tnarg's. Here is a recent parse against 268-284 hitters (levels varies between 51 and 55):<br />

<br />
Very short parses, obviously, but all that missing looks quite impressive at first glance. Hwoever, there are a few caveats.<br />
<br />
The first one is that a knight can tank higher level mobs that would probably kill the Monk. That limits your choice of targets somewhat.<br />
<br />
The second one is that Monks' avoidance is good, but their mitigation is not nearly as good as what the knights have. Hence  your Monk may take little damage during 3-4 fights in a row and then get a string of hits for full damage, which will really hurt on non-trivial content when mobs' max hit is for, say, &gt;10% of yout total HP. It doesn't make for a profitable XP session for you to cruise through 4 mobs and go 'splat' on the 5th one.<br />
<br />
Third, unlike knights, Monks don't have a way to generate snap agro reliably. That's a major issue in many situations.<br />
<br />
Fourth, utility. Monks have 2 major utility abilities: FD as an innate skill as opposed to the SKs' spell (fizzles, interrupts, can't cast on the run) and an irresistable lull on mobs &lt;65, which is, in many cases, very VERY useful. On the other hand, Pallies can root/heal/lull lower level content/buff/etc and SKs can snare/self-heal/group-heal/DOT/etc, so on balance I would say that their utility is considerably higher, especially in case of the SKs.<br />
<br />
Finally, the whole issue of DPS. At first, Monks will outdamage SKs and especially Paladins, no question about it. However, at higher levels SKs gain access to good weapons and KEI and can chain cast for a long long time, so their damage output comes close to that of Monks. I believe that Paladins stay behind in the DPS department until the end, but I don't really know the end game, so can't comment on that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am reasonably happy with my Monk's performance (although more AAs wouldn't hurt), but I am also starting to build a SK as an experiment. We'll see how they stack up once the SK gains 60ish levels :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've got a 60 monk I played for a long time; he was actually a main I switched to for a bit, till the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
Monks are great, and their FD is far better than a SK's, because it can't be interrupted and doesn't require a casting time.<br />
<br />
With absolutely uber gear, I've seen monks tank elemental mobs and even nameds and bosses, but for the average guy, the SK is much the better tank.<br />
<br />
Also, it's easier for the SK to get good gear without raiding.  There's a lot of good plate out there, but not nearly as much good leather gear for monks.<br />
<br />
The new monk lull is nice, though.  Not sure why monks got it, but there ya go.<br />
<br />
Both are definitely fun to play all on their own, though.  Just as much fun as a shaman, I think, and you can chat a little instead of just canni'ing all the time, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the lack of ability to maintain aggro means your monk will often lose aggro to the shaman while the shaman tries to slow.  It's very nice not to have to worry about that with an SK -- much, much safer.<br />
<br />
Great toons both, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SK is the best by far.<br />
<br />
SNARE is great, cause you can snare and forget. Unlike rooting where a nuke or a proc will break it.<br />
<br />
The monk can pull a lot better, but with the monk nerfs they now take just tooooo much healing to keep alive.<br />
<br />
Never tried a pally.<br />
<br />
Warrior was fun, but could agro from range, so you had to always take him to the mobs, a SK pulls the mobs to him.<br />
<br />
When i dual him in ldons, i park him in the corner, when a mob some to camp, i snare/fear it and it runs to me.<br />
<br />
That leaves the sham to slow/malos and nuke like a bitch and do any emergency CC required.<br />
<br />
Warrs spend time chasing the mob untill it hates them, although i dont know how the new discs go.<br />
<br />
Snare makes dual boxing much easier though, cause you can take your eyes off teh screen for a sec to change monitors and not bother about missing a root breaking msg.<br />
<br />

I know there are times with my Enchanter that I * CAN'T * take aggro from a well played SK.  I'm talking Tash + Slow + Sit down which normally makes me number one on the ol aggro dance card.<br />
<br />
That means you can bust out the ol DOTs, Dogdog and anything else that floats your boat.<br />
<br />
Paladins? I'll relate a story I heard.<br />
<br />
Group invites a Pally to their little party in BoT. Paladin shows up, pulls begin, MOBs start dying, aggro is being held. About 30 minutes into it somebody says to the Pally:<br />
<br />
/g &quot;Hey did you know you're tanking with two Steins?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turns out the Pally came from selling and was still equipping his Charisma Steins. (Must've been a Dwarf :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro is not a problem Unless I use poisen dots. Then of course I blow more mana Trying to retake aggro with the Shadowknight.  If I am in nurga and I dot twice I am pretty much tanking Unless I Dark the mob 3-4 times with the SK.<br />
<br />
Best case is you get an Aw **** pull You Take aggro withthe knight Gate with shaman then Flop. <br />
<br />
Surviverability is great with this team. But you cannot tank Like a warrior. But then again a warrior has a hard time Feign death pulling. <br />

Just like soloing, you are the tank-in-teh-face, but you get some nice DPS from behind.  The biggest pain about soloing is how long some of the fights last.  Rogue makes that go away.  Use root to keep mob facing you, rogue will cut your kill time in 1/2 or 1/3.  Rogue could tank for short periods in an emergency if properly geared.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">it's completely situational given equal geared classes.  <br />
Warrior is better for mobs that require straight out tankage and single pulls are easy enuf to do.<br />
Paladin is great when you can get away with it and don't need a lot of dmg from yer tank.  Rez comes in damn handy when you have a little wipe.  I like to take paladins along when I'm trying something dangerous. <br />
SK is great for pharming and for anything requiring both a plate tank and snare/FD pulls.  Probably the best tank if you never need a rez.  Also they can SC2 your bodies if you wipe real far in.  That's amazingly handy sometimes.<br />
Monk is great for older zones where their AC handicap isn't as important and you really need good pulling and great damage.  By far the most damaging class in this discussion, monks will make some stuff happen thru sheer DPS like BoT named.  Not the best obv if the mob requires big tankage.<br />
<br />
It's all situational.  But of course, one of the above with great gear is gonna be preferred over one with avg or lower gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SK is the best to do with IMO. Mainly because they can tank/FD and snare.<br />
Pally is nice too because also hold aggro well...add some buffs/heals and can also res.<br />
Ranger is not worth because unless shaman is tanking and they shoot arrows the melee dps are not all that. They track tho<br />
Monk is nice dps but they cannot hold aggro and cannot stun.<br />
The warrior IS the best tank but in a duo situation been able to single pull and snare to avoid adds is important.<br />
<br />
I consider ranger/monk one of the best class to add to a SK/SHM group as a third person.<br />

I duo my monk and shaman not only by themselves, but in xp groups and raids.  The good thing about a monk is that you &quot;stack.&quot;  If I go into a group, and there is already a monk, so what?  We both do helacious damage, so no prob there.  If I were a SK/warrior/pally, and there was someone else in the group go tank, welp, I don't stack as well.<br />
<br />
Tanking --- first, it's all about gear and AA.  A wizard can tank a slowed mob with the right gear and AA.  Get your hps and AC to a respectable level, and get LR5, ID5, ND3, etc...  and you'll be able to tank things that other people who don't actually know would realize.  My monk tanks in PoTactics all the time, those guys hit for nearly 600.  That's without LR5 and ID5!<br />

It's all about getting mobs slowed ASAP.  Once that is done, the monk will do just fine.  Sure it prob would be easier to heal a warrior, but the point is I can keep the monk on his feet (and without too much effort, at that).  The monkie has tanked 2 PoTactics mobs at once and the shaman kept him on his feet.  Monks get a few snazzy discs and mend that helps in a pinch.  The discs also help when you wanna duo a named mob somewhere --- engage boss, monk hits disc, and mend when you've lost about 30% health, and by that time the shaman should have the mob debuffed.<br />
<br />
The thing that a monk does better than a SK or Pally or warrior is damage.  Mobs drop faster (thus reducing damage taken due to less time engaged with mob).  Monks love shaman buffs and perform well with them.  Monks are also awesome at pulling, especially dungeons which is where I practically live.  FD and lull make it much easier to split mobs.<br />
<br />
The only thing my combo lacks is snare and tracking... I'd love to have those abilities, especially in dungeons.<br />
<br />
I also have a 61 ranger who is not as well-geared as my monk, and I can definitely vouch that a ranger/shaman combo is extremely versatile and utilitarian...  I'd love to combine the ranger and monk class into one and then I'd have my perfect combo.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'll be a bit unorthodox here.  Obviously lots of support for the plate classes, mostly shadowknights, it seems.  I'll preface all of this by stating that my first love was my monk, born a few days after EQ went live way back in April of 1999.  He's still around today, at level 59  :p <br />
<br />
I'll vote for magician.  The mage air and earth pets have excellent agro - better than a monk by far.  The air pet procs a stun that grabs a mobs attention quick.  Once that stun goes off once, I can slow without problem and throw a Bane of Nife in right after.  Mobs really don't like that stun.<br />
<br />
Mages are possibly the easiest class of all to two-box.  Just set up a macro to assist and pet attack, and a few more for nukes, rains, malo, damage shield, etc.  They require almost no attention, because compared to shamans, they basically generate no agro at all.  I can happily drop 2k nukes with my mage while my poor shaman takes a beating from landing a 1500-hp DOT that will take 42 seconds to expire.<br />
<br />
The 59+ mage pets also improve significantly if you've got a pet focus item.  The easiest to obtain is the Diamond Prism of Companionship, purchased from the North Ro LDoN camp for 760 points.  With this focus, or any of the higher focuses, mage PoP pets regen at very high rates, hit harder, come pre-equipped with plate armor, and mitigate damage better.  The level-61 air pet generates excellent agro, does respectable dps, and avoids very well, while the level-65 earth pet has oustanding mitigation, beefy hitpoints (~6k shaman-buffed) and decent agro via his root procs.  In my opinion, both of these pets make very viable tanks.  When they're tanking slowed mobs, they make outstanding tanks.<br />
<br />
Combine that with the other benefits a mage brings.  <br />
<br />
<br />
 The second-best nukes in the game (virtual tie with druids)<br />
 Excellent damage shields for older content<br />
 Virtually the same malo line as shamans to help spread out agro<br />
 Summoned armor to significantly improve dogdog's AC and add over 500 hitpoints<br />
 Summoned focus items to provide your shaman with BA4 &amp; SH4 if you lack either<br />
 Summoned weapons that proc a 140hp dd spell - no more getting to your hunting location only to realize you forgot to stock up with rusty daggers for our dual-wieldless dogdog.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The shaman, meanwhile, adds all the utility the mage lacks, most notably crowd control.  Poor mages can't even root, for goodness sake.  If their earth pet proc doesn't go off at the right time, it's hello-train.  But teamed with a shaman, their pets perform better (marginally improved via stat buffs, more notable improvements via direct hp and AC buffs) and last longer (thanks to slow, assuming you're fighting slowable mobs).  It's a very symbiotic relationship.<br />
  <br />
The mage/shaman duo is very viable, especially if, like me, you won't have access to raid-quality items.  I'd much rather have a bazaar-equipped level 65 mage as a shaman partner than a bazaar-equipped level 65 shadowknight or monk.  You'll get MUCH better dps, very good agro, and excellent durability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I like paladin. They have good buffs, can take aggro, can stun mobs while you slow, and they are splendid patch healers.<br />
<br />
I never did duo much with other classes except druid wich is hard if you have summoners. If no summoners you can quad till you puke.</div></div><hr />
