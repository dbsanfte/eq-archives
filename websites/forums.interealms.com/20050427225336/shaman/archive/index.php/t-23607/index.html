<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOOT, Im happy and excited to be here among all the Ubers of the game.  I hit lvl 60 and Im one happy shaman to almost have all my spells to date.  Infact I'm already half way to lvl 61.  So lets get started shall we?<br />
<br />
I have made it a point to try and level in the zone with the most Exp for now.  I have noticed that if I get a group in PoI or PoN my exp is realy realy realy slow. In what I can do in those zones in 3 to 4 hours I can do in PoV in rouly 1 hour or less. (in terms of getting exp.)  So becuase of this I have no taken PoN, PoI, PoD,&amp; PoJ off my list.  I dont know if GE will be on that list as well yet though.   The pulls there are constant and seem to make up for the lack of exp you may get per kill.<br />
<br />
So for right now I have made PoV my main objective......  well to be honest with you, PoV is about all I know in terms of GOOD exp atm.   I know there are other places to hunt but I don't know what Zone I can get exp thats as good as PoV and where they are and which of those zones can shaman get groups in rather quick.<br />
<br />
Any help you can give would be loved and cherished.  Thanks to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get to the highest zone you are flagged for.<br />
<br />
PoV is excellent exp until you can get to BoT at 62.<br />
<br />
BoT is good until you get Tower of Sol Ro<br />
Tower is good until Elemental planes, etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
Dunno what GE is btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GE = Grieg's End</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 62 you can also get into Halls of Honor. If you can get a group there xp is better than BoT, loot is better in BoT though.<br />
<br />
If you can find a necro kite group at zone in to HoH (3-4 necros kiting together) join it. Give em regen, sow, buffs and then just have fun tossing dots or filling in as the emergency role when stuff happens. Excellent xp with 2 or 3 mobs being kited at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Halls of Honor, I only know those words via high lvls in passing.  Can you show me a map of how to get there please?  EQ atlas has no such map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are a bunch of stones in a cave in PoTranq.<br />
<br />
HoH,  PoV, PoT, Tower of Sol Ro (and the dead portal to PoWar) are all right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh, I never tried out all those stones, guess I should load up gate and check them out at 62.</div></div><hr />
