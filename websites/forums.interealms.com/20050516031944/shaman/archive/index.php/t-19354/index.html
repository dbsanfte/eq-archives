<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This might have been done already, but I haven't seen it in the boards.  I apologize if I seem to be plagurizing.<br />
<br />
Starting this evening, whenever I give away a MGB Fo7 I announce the following message in Shout and/or OOC.<br />
<br />
&quot; Help support your Shaman brethern!  We are fighting for Class Balance.  Sign out petition at www.shamanscrucible.com , also can be found at eqlive.station.sony.com  Forums. One Voice!  One Hope!&quot;<br />
<br />
I encourage Shaman to broadcast this message or some form of it when they do a MGB, or when they are in the PoK if you don't have MGB.<br />
<br />
Please DON'T SPAM THIS.  Only do it once per evening that you are playing.  If we have enough Shaman doing this, and I think we definately will, we will get a lot of attention.<br />
<br />
Praise Gloriana and all the others who have made our cry noticeable, but I want to take it one step past the message boards, and into the game itself.<br />
<br />
I was met with a LOT of flames in ooc or shout and that was expected.  Please just /ignore and announce that &quot;I will not argue or comment.  Please view our posts for more info.&quot;  I really think this will get peoples attention!<br />
<br />
Again, please don't spam it.  Just once per Shaman, per day.<br />
<br />
If you don't agree I understand, but I really think it will help us.<br />
<br />
Be safe, slow well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I get the feeling Many may attack you . In fact you may get Flamed on this very board for advocating this ... I must say I for one Fully support what your doing . <br />
While I dont often get the chance too MGB in PoK for my fellow players . From time too time I do . I WILL use your mesage on those rare occasions . And honestly .. In my humble opinion Kudos too you for being brave enought too step up and do this in game .<br />
However Id alsi Like too add , I do see Glori and the organiser of this effort , If she advises against it . I will follow her lead .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I understand that a lot will flame and a lot on this board may not agree.  <br />
<br />
However, I think that if done right it will geterate a lot of positive publicity for our cause.<br />
<br />
I have been absent from these boards for the last two years but I am a long time member.  Just check my enrollment date.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that Shaman will rally behind this the way they did with Gloriana's posts.  <br />
<br />
If not I understand, but I will still do my part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although I commend you in your efforts, you do realize that when you say &quot;fighting for class balance&quot; ... well let me just say, <br />
<br />
I think several classes would have difficulty with you saying that.<br />
<br />
Monks don't feel balanced<br />
Warriors don't feel balanced<br />
<br />
and rightly so imo and many others. In fact many would argue that their case is much stronger than ours.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could play with the wording a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It looks as if the Monks are making some noise about the need for improved Melee buffs which would help Shaman.  It also helps Beastlords but if you read the whole thread there is some sympathy for the Shaman's situation.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thunndar is one of the few folks from the game I know in real life and a stand up hometown guy.  He gave me my first piece of Totemic armor which I still treasure locked away in my bank.  I thank him for his efforts.<br />
<br />
At the very least you may want to bring the subject to the attention of your ingame friends who play with you often and know your difficulties as a Shaman.  I am restating what I have posted in an other thread but I had a Druid friend tell me that he certainly takes Beastlords or Enchanters as slowers over Shaman in a LDoN group unless he sees a Shaman friend.  He admits that that we have lost ground.<br />
<br />
Just because someone will flame you for being vocal about Shaman balance does not mean that deep down they don't think you are right.  Many players see EQ as a zero sum game where any advantage one class has automatically means that their class loses power.  I think much of the flaming we get over this issue is from folks who play classes that they feel may be &quot;nerfed&quot; to bring Shaman back into their rightful place.<br />
<br />
You Go Thunndar and say hey to those Server Jumpers on the 7th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love the sentiment, I'm just a little scared that an open, serverwide petition like that will attract more of the trolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you visit the crucible and not be at least dimly aware of the discussion about balancing?<br />
<br />
Not saying you have to agree, but your question makes it sound like this is catching you off guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know of a CheezorChic on Drinal, who just so happens to be in the &quot;Top&quot; guild on the server and decked out in Time gear.  If his/her (Female Barbarian) reply was serious, there is definitely something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It sounds great, but I would recommend just send them to the Sony site where the signature would count.  Plus we won't get hundreds of trolls coming in here and annoying us.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally I can see wanting to do something but I don't think this will do anything to help us. More likely it will just atract the idiots who will come up and say shaman are over powered, they can slow and can solo yeld etc or people complaining that xyz needs balancing more. I don't really see it bringing much support in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been watching the posts here for awhile now and have heard alot about this subject. I agree that we need help and our class needs balancing. But lets hope Sony doesnt do to use what they did with the last class balancing they did. My RL wife plays a pally and has done so for 2 years now and the last balanceing act did was make the warr class to strong. My wife has realy good gear but cant hold agro from a war who has ok gear and is 10 lvl below. I have talked to alot of peeps from my server and they all agree that shammys need help but are afraid that sony will over do it like they did with the last balanceing act.We, like the war, need one or 2 things changed but the war got a total make over that pissed off alot of peeps and i dont want that to happen to us. As for the top end game shammys who dont think we need help. well since you most likely have been maxed lvl since velious you wouldnt understand. You have it nice and easy where thous of use who are only 62 right now, well we have to compete with BST and ench for groups. Before 62 is hard since we can barely work as a healer and our slows are only just a little better, and forget trying to do something on raid, since out spells just wount touch the mob.As for meleeing well i soloed all the way to 55th and i meleed right along side my pet, i admite my dsp was horrid but it helped. But as soon as i hit 55 i could now longer do that and had to start the rotation of cast , sit , cast, sit. which i must say sucks. I dont want to be uber melee but to be abel to hit like a cleric would be nice. Well sine i have rambeled on lone enough , i will end this post<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, the shaman class is balanced (if you think of &quot;balance&quot; as the raw potential of a class).<br />
<br />
No, it is not fun to play, unless you're in the ONE ideal situation.  If slow isn't needed/wanted (or someone else is slowing), you're bored stiff.  I want to play a class where I'm not bored stiff 80% of the time.<br />
<br />
I've loved playing my shaman for nearly three years.  The recent trend in EQ has gotten me to all but abandon my shaman.  I never paid attention to the threads about &quot;our class needs this&quot; because I was still having fun.  The fact that this movement has gained so much momentum speaks volumes for the number of us who aren't enjoying it anymore.<br />
<br />
While I applaud your effort, and the way you're braving the flames, I find it hard to believe that anyone will understand how Sony has leeched the enjoyment of my class from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I may be only 59 and have not seen the full ramifications of our unbalanced class situation but I can honestly say... I still love my shaman, there is no other class I would rather play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ya i'm a troll, what of it. <br />
<br />
I play my shaman, and play her well, I just troll these boards to catch up on the gossip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like the sentiment, but I also agree you'll likely draw the lowest common denomonator.<br />
<br />
I hope sony gets the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What time are the buffs again?   :D <br />
<br />
If you feel there is an imbalance, this seems like a perfectly reasonable approach.  My caution is to beware the fake trolls (real trolls like me don't waste everyone's time just trying to stir up trouble...unless it's with the evil home stealing frogs.  :p )<br />
<br />
My RL wife plays a pally and has done so for 2 years now and the last balanceing act did was make the warr class to strong. My wife has realy good gear but cant hold agro from a war who has ok gear and is 10 lvl below. <br />
<br />
Umm...I couldn't let this one by...  There is no reason for a knight not to hold agro better than a warrior if the knight is using their agro spells.  I was powerlevelling a friends 50 SK with 65 my warrior and 57 shaman this weekend...the SK could pull agro from me at any time (and did just to see if he could.)<br />
<br />
If you're definition of &quot;ok gear&quot; is a blade of carnage or blade of war, that might be true (don't have em, so don't know how good their agro is), but given equal gear, the knight is still the clear agro winner.<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm not saying warriors are still way out of balance...I'm just saying that knights are still agro kings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As far as aggro goes, I've noticed in the groups I've been in that they fixed it so a Knight is &quot;snap&quot; aggro, while a warrior is &quot;aggro over time.&quot;  When working together, this is a very good combination.<br />
<br />
The Knights can draw instant aggro with their aggro spells, but a warrior using the proper provoke disc can take it from the Knight after aggro has been generated.  That's the way it should be, imo.  The Knight's there to draw the snap aggro to keep the mob off the casters, then the warrior takes aggro and does what he's supposed to do...tank the mob.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that a Knight can recapture aggro with another round of aggro spells, while the warrior has to wait for his provoke disc to refresh, or get a good taunt or two off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
some peace? i said one thing...jesus get a grip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i found that alot of poeple just cant see through the pink specs they wear, and cant see problems with our class, also i lot just cant get their heads around the facts, one guy constantly over estimated what shaman could heal and when i corrected him and showed to maths he just put me on ignore..(couldnt argue) but he still couldnt accept that shaman are not the all useful, all powerful things where once where.<br />
<br />
also alot have shaman twinks there fore get the great experience that shaman are from 1-50, and from 50 -60 , they dont often see problem between 60 to 65 , and i doubt many know the problem that shaman face on hard ldon or elemental. this being the reason most think its fine they just wont get there shaman twink to high planes and levels and just see the great that shaman are at lower levels. (i meet a few tht say rabid bear is amazing..one even thought it was overpowering:) its hard to fight that much complete lack of understanding)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Good to see someone stepping up very brave of you mate.<br />
<br />
:D <br />
<br />
(btw, if your paladin use cease and disist for agro.. low level so you can get phat resist agro :), also flash of light cna help but make sure your right in its face)</div></div><hr />
