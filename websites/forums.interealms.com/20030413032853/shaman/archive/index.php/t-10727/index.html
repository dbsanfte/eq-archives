<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning on reformatting my hard drive tomorrow and installing WinXP (currently have Win 98 installed). I've been getting a lot of system errors lately and my CD burner and DVD drive have stopped working in the last month, so I figure it's probably due to the fact that I haven't reformatted or done any hard drive maintenance in about 3 years :lol I've tried reinstalling the drivers for the burner and the DVD drive but that doesn't seem to work - the burner is working only as a CD ROM drive at the moment and the DVD drive isn't working at all.<br />
<br />
Now, as to my questions:<br />
<br />
1) Is there any way I can hold on to the data that I want to keep with my burner being broken? I've saved all my most important files like my resume and papers to floppy disk, but I've got quite a few pictures I've taken with my digital camera that I'd like to keep as well but are too large to fit on a floppy. I don't have any friends with external burners or else I'd try that.<br />
<br />
2) Is there any way to save my MP3 playlist? I use Winamp and don't really want to lose a list of the 3000+ songs that I have on my hard drive. Luckily I have most of them backed up on burned discs, but not all, and want the list for future reference to download the songs I need.<br />
<br />
3) Are there any vital details that I need to mark down before doing the reformat? What I'm most worried about is getting my internet and email to work again once I've got the system up and running again, and I'm absolutely terrible with IP addresses, Outlook mail settings, etc etc.<br />
<br />
In case it matters at all:<br />
<br />
Duron 700 @ 950<br />
512 MB RAM<br />
30 GB HD<br />
Toshiba DVD<br />
Philips CD-RW<br />
Matrox 32 MB vid card<br />
LinkSys 10/100 ethernet<br />
Soundblaster AWE 64<br />
21&quot; Sony Trinitron<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy a new hard drive.  Set it to Master.  Set your other HDD to Slave (I'm assuming you will install the new hard drive on the same IDE controller as the old one).<br />
<br />
Partition and format the new hard drive.  Install XP.  Once XP is up and running, copy and paste everything you want to keep to the new hard drive.  After that is finished, format your old hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is probably the only way to save your data unless you are can connect to another PC over a local area network.  If so you could share your hard drive and copy them over the network to the other PC.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
<br />
*edit* Since you say you're &quot;terrible&quot; at these sort of things, I'd recruit a friend that isn't.  It's not that hard, but a mis-step can lose all your data.</div></div><hr />
