<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Treyser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just visited a new EQ2 shaman site, the webpage is bland but I just brought it up yesterday.  We are looking for moderators and people to help promote the site.  I have just been lurking on the eq2 section here so thought maybe us lepers could start some conversations there.  The site is www.eq2shaman.bravehost.com.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like to stick with it, but frankly at the moment I don't see much help coming from the forum admins here.  Note that they did manage to create subforums, moderators and structure for WoW.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it, but the Sony forums are better than Crucible for EQ2 Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/Agree Sudedor.<br />
<br />
I didn't know they had all that fancy stuff for a WoW forum. That just sucks.<br />
<br />
And to think I was sticking it out here in the hopes that it was just a matter of time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip Treyser.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd like to see this site doing more.  So far, they're not, which is definitely disappointing.  I have a 23 Mystic on Permafrost, and recently started a SK/to be Defiler on Steamfront.  <br />
<br />
I was an ogre sk/shaman two-box in EQL, and really enjoyed it.  My guild went Qeynos, so I went with a barb when eq2 came out...not the same thing.  I enjoy being evil.  Anyway, the other combo on another server gives me somewhere to go when I don't want to deal with guild crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like it here.  The &quot;sane&quot; and &quot;down to earth&quot; discussions is what I like best, and miss on the other forums.   I will go take a peek at the new site, tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's interesting/sad is that many of the major sites from EQ1 that should have transitioned to EQ2 have only made small efforts to do so.  I am also a member of SK.org (SK forums) from EQ1, and while they have devoted a little more effort than the Crucible, it's still a far cry from what it could and probably should be.<br />
<br />
The SOE official forums may have some good info, but it gets lost quickly, because no one is really moderating it to preserve the posts and information that can be most beneficial.<br />
<br />
I have found this site to be the most beneficial for being able to sort through the things I might need for all the games aspects, including Shaman problems/info.<br />

Many of you may be aware of it, but if not, this is a good site to have bookmarked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25062&amp;highlight=sunmoon) thread:<br />
<br />
Sunmoon has given me admin access to create the new forums.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty busy at work this weekend, so I am not going to tackle this project until this weekend.<br />
<br />
Need some folks interested in WoW to step up for moderating duties.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in setting up the new forums. I need to get some clarification from Sunmoon and he's moving into a new home during the holidays.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much offline as well, I'm visiting my parents in Texas. I hope to get to it after the new year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow, WoW managed to get their forums set up.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
We'll find a new home, just wish it had been here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asarum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well.....  I have moved to the EQShaman site mentioned above...  seems like a good beginning and some good information setting up now...<br />
<br />
ALl it needs is some more traffic to really get rolliing...<br />
<br />
COme see and decide for your self any who wish...<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Why SHOULD these sites have transitioned to EQ 2. ?<br />
Transition means to move on from one state to another.<br />
So these sites should have dumped EQ1 for EQ2 ?.<br />
Theres not even 200 posts on this site for EQ2 why would you think Sunmoon should devote resources to something which people appear to have little interest in ?.<br />
<br />
Major shock that SoE's own forums appear to be better than here.<br />
Well suprise suprise its their game theyre the ones who stand to lose money if interest in EQ2 wanes.<br />
<br />
You lot remind me of the people on Sonys forums who post with a rant saying im leaving because EQ1 sucks and WoW is a lot better etc etc.<br />
<br />
Just 1 thing to say to you<br />
Dont let the door hit you in your ass on the way out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asarum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry Wulfbane  :( <br />
<br />
Did not mean to seem ungrateful for this site, I was a long time user (in another skin) during my years in EQ1, and appreciated the effort.  All I was saying is that we want active information now..... and the new site IS generating interest, while this one is slow to respond.<br />
<br />
It is not the fault of the board designer, nor moderators.... just the people who do or do not come here... or post no-constructive replies like yours.<br />
<br />
And yes....  the door did not hit me on the way out thanks  :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There was a lot of interest here in the initial weeks following release, but because we were treated like lepers here interest in participating at Crucible faded.<br />
<br />
Instead of embracing a new and vibrant game, the posters wanted to hang on to yesterdays news.  That's fine.<br />
<br />
I certainly check in here now and then, but I don't look for any real information here.  It simply doesn't exist, and that IS the fault of the board designers and moderators.<br />
<br />
Case and point . . . the EQ2 forum here has NO moderator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say we are working real hard at the site mentioned in this thread..  If you guys want a dedicated EQ2 shaman site please come take a look..  But I will always come here for my EQ shaman material..  <br />
<br />
so please come take a look we just updated site recently and when we get more traffic things will pick up greatly.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time<br />

Show me where on the EQ1 part of this board all the information provided by the designers is.<br />
It all comes from players so if EQ 2 PLAYERS want spell lists,hunting tips etc then surely its up to them to provide it not Sunmoon or whoever ?.<br />
Have any of you volunteered to be a moderator as the WoW moderator did ?.<br />
<br />

I read these forums everyday. Thanks.<br />
<br />
I really object to you stating that posters here &quot;hang on to yesterday's news&quot; by preferring to play their own game. Once the EQ 2 forums were set up, the cross game sniping effectively stopped. <br />
<br />
I don't give a **** about EQ 2, but I'm happy that other people are playing it and they are more than welcome to talk about it in these forums.</div></div><hr />
