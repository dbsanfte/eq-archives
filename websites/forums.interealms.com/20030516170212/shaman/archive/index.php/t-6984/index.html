<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, time for all I konw about PoJ so far.<br />
<br />
  You can meet the prisoners on Trial before seeing the Tribunal, and recieve a flag when you say you will plead their case.   I reccomend doing this in case you win and need the flag.<br />
<br />
  Prisoner that I met was Mauvin.  He was at the end of a long corridor of prosoners and KOS guards (the other prisoners I did not attempt to talk to, was with guild groups at the time and trying to hurry).<br />
<br />
  Once flagged, just gate/succor out to the entrance.  We tried fighting out and got what we think was social aggro from the guard outside, and din't want to kill him for fear of faction hits/Judgement.<br />
<br />
  Go find the appropriate Tribunal.   The prisoner hints at his quest (Mauvin was Fire) and the Tribunal will tell you the quest they guard when you ask &quot;What Ordeal&quot; Or similar type of statement.    Offer to pleade the case of the prisoner, and when ready.....<br />
<br />
  The statement &quot;I AM READY FOR THE TRIAL OF  (fire, torture, hanging.....)&quot; will send the GROUP of whoever said it into the trial.   It is a SINGLE GROUP affair.  While one group is doing a trial, or even has bodies IN a trial, nobody else can activate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Trial of Fire:<br />
  Keep the guardians away from the pillar in the center:<br />
Fire guardians spawned, at least 2 of them, and hit in the 300s.   I was unable to slow as the first 2 I saw aggro'd me before I saw them.   They were in adjascent corners, so I assume there were 4 of them.   Lacking any tanks (thought both our groups could get in, and only mine did... the backup group), we all died but I presume there are a couple waves of these fire elementals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trial of Hanging:<br />
  The second group went here while waiting for our bodies to get Grave-dumped.   They had no flags from the appropriate prisoner, and got into the trial anway.   They said there were 2 spirits up, that they could not hit, and that the prisoner died within about 10 second according to logs.   Probably some trick to the trial, but no personal experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Trial of Torture:<br />
  While coming back to the graveyward I found out some warrior had been following me.  He asked in tells how to trigger a trial, I told him, and he activated Torture.   He said 2 mobs spawned, each an SK with a LOW HT value.   They hit in the 360s and he survived long enough to see 2 more SKs spawn and hit him with higher HTs, and harder hits  (said he lasted 45 seconds, and this was only a 52 warrior.   So DPS of the mobs isn't amazing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tried the Trial of Execution:<br />
<br />
At least 6 mobs aggro -- fast -- High HP and hit hard, need melee heavy and an enchanter for mezzes.. unfortunately the executioner which goes for the guy on trial, gets there super fast!! lol -- very hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mavuins flag is for all trials and it is sufficient to get flagged once with him.<br />
Regarding Execution, it is 4 mobs per wave and not 6. Each time you kill one mob the Executioner despawns, respawns back at wall and then walks again towards the victim. kill 4 waves and the High Executioner spawns. Kill him and you are flagged to enter Plane of Valor and get a Mark of Execution. We assume once you collected the marks of all trials you can meet the 7th Hammer, but thats speculation so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you GREATLY for the information Seven.   Just the kind of feedback I was seeking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone beat any of the other trials besides the trial of execution? I'm just curious if you gain access to any other planes besides the Plane of Valor. <br />
<br />
Once you win the trial of execution, you can enter the Plane of Valor by going into the cave by PoJ entrance and click on one of the five stones. I'm guessing that the other stones are for other planes most likely accessed by winning more trials. Has anyone been to any of these other planes or know which trial gives access to which planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhaol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Trial of execution gives you access to 2 planes, Plane of Valor + Plane of Storms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really like these trials, they're a lot of fun, but I do have one major problem with them. Currently on Sol Ro, you usually have to get &quot;in line&quot; to do them. Often times there are 6-7 groups waiting ahead of you (at least for trial of execution)<br />
<br />
What happened to no long key camps? Or the ability to send different groups to different areas for the same content (I know this works in PoN for Thelin's quest)<br />
<br />
Like I said, the trials are fun, but I wish they would've done something to prevent them from being such a huge time sink of just waiting around for your turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe because you are all Wussies? 7 grp line cause you are to scared to try other 4 or 3 trials.  ppl always choose least chalangin path. Justice is easiest one so ppl wait in line like bunch of cattle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">anybody heard of any side quests that might get you around the trials via another timesink? like there's quests to get into HoHa and CoD without killing any boss mobs, maybe there's similar quests in PoN, PoJ, and PoI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's not true at all Krullan. I have tried the other trials, and will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
The problem is, most of my guild isn't focused on getting into PoV/PoS right now, so for the most part, I'm working with pick up groups of whoever is available in PoJ.  Since I haven't yet managed to get a grp together that can handle the execution (easiest) trial, what are the chances of me doing one of the harder trials with the same group?<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do at all with being a wuss and being scared to try something different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haven't heard of any side quests around it, but I hunted creature factions long enough to get ally to prisoners, and there are some incredibly extensive storylines to some of them.   I didn't get a quest out of any of the prisoners, but with that much text I may have missed a cue somewhere.</div></div><hr />
