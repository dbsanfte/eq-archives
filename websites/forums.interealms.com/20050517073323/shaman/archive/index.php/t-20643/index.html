<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sindri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need you’re help <br />
<br />
I finally made myself a Shaman! I have stop playing my USLESS Shadow knight, and started to play a real class.<br />
<br />
Now all I need  is a bit of guidance from some of you please. What are some of your mostly use hotkeys. (E.G.  /assist &lt;%t&gt;(the main assist),   /cast 1 (Slow) ) <br />
That is one of the hotkeys I have made real quickly.<br />
Is there anything else I could make that would really help me out?<br />
By they way I just made 29.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of my hotkeys deal with announcing slow and other debuffs to group. Another you will want to set up is a canni-dance hotkey. If you search the boards you will find a good write up on setting up such a hotkey.<br />
<br />
I also have a hotkey announcing Cann5 so cleric doesn't wast mana healing me.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the Shaman's Crucible! :) <br />
The Medicine Cabinet forum has some stickied threads that cover alot of the basic questions you might have about the Shaman class.  Lots of good tips in there.<br />
<br />
There is a good compilation thread that I recommend you read in that forum (hotkeys are briefly discussed as well):<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13787 <br />
It wasn't in the General forum, which might be why your search didn't come up with anything.<br />
 :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At your level slow have a marginal effect. Heal is your main job (well probably no more with twink ), so heal maccro  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to play a &quot;real class,&quot; you might want to look into the trinity.  By this i mean: ditch the shaman and invest your time into an enchanter, cleric, or warrior (all of them being in high demand right now).  If you felt useless as a shadowknight.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whats useless about a SK, I find them to be a suprerior tank to 95% of the content matched only by the paladin.<br />
<br />
If you want to be always needed Shaman was not a good choice to leap to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, if you wanted the always needed you should have rolled a GM.<br />
