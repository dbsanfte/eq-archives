<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">5 years i'm playing the game... but not anymore.<br />
<br />
Until SoE fix our balance and only if they do it one day in a &quot;good for all&quot; manner (aka not a single bone here and there).<br />
<br />
I'm tired to see the tank's hps goin down so quick when i'm healing spamming with one of the best focus and full AA healing.<br />
<br />
I'm tired to see my DPS so low in GoD because the mobs die so quick, my DD cast so slowly and my DoTs not running for full damage.<br />
<br />
I'm tired following my guild raids just to cast Fo7 here and there, FA here and there, Bihli here and there and nothing else because 4 shamans in a raid is way too much.<br />
<br />
I'm tired following my guild in raids where I don't do anything worth it, taking a spot of another mate who bring far more to the expedition than shaman #n.<br />
<br />
No thanks you for you SoE, you changed the game I liked to something who give me more troubles than fun.<br />
<br />
Thanks to my guild who don't let ppl behind even if shaman #n is more a dead weight than anything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Novae name alone brings massive credit to your post, they're one of the top dawgs.<br />
<br />
Good choice, soon the majority of the board'll be retired EQ players, hah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck Fenril,<br />
   I've stuck the game out from Beta 2 on.... but I find I'm logging in less and less.   I'm holding out some hope that this meeting in San Diego will be the start of some improvements to our class.<br />
   That one Dev's statement from the last Fan Faire still burns in my mind however...... short fights for the future, shm good in long fights, won't ever change shm to be good for short fights.....   That's the mindset we deal with now.... :(<br />
Later man<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Take care Fenril.  The game has been turning into a shadow of its past glory for some time now, and it looks like that's the vision being wholeheartedly embraced for the future, so I can't blame you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good Journies to ya, but don't make yourself too much of a stranger around here. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take care bro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Should have posted here sooner, really hard to see a member of Novae go, they are the top guild of Karana server, and all of the members I have met are top notch.<br />
They are a dedicated bunch to unlocking the secrets of the game, and if one of them has decided to head out, you know its bad.<br />
Take a look SOE, you really need to work this crap out fast.</div></div><hr />
