<br />
There are several threads in this section that represent the meat and potatoes of Shaman soloing-two boxing, such as IC, Droga, Veksar, and WW Dragons.  How about combining those with multiple threads, and stickying them so they stay at the top of the forum.<br />
<br />
I think it will save a lot of &quot;where to go?&quot; threads that wind up referring the poster to a search for the main thread dealing with the zone being asked about.  Another option would be to combine them all and put it in the Medicine Cabinet.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of good info in those threads, and it was from them that I found the locations and tactics to have a blast in these zones.<br />
<br />
Again, just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have become better at searching (250)!<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no qualm with sharing information, but would rather let the higher end spots not get sticked for the reason that it could increase our chances at our bread and butter becoming farming grounds for ige/yantis bots. Maybe I'm just paranoid- thoughts?</div></div><hr />
