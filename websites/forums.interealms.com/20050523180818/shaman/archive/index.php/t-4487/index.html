<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was so excited to finally buy luclin, started going thru the download procedures, and eventually got a catastrophic error, preventing me from downloading the software.  The error occured between disc 2 and disc 3, and occured after a window popped open saying that it couldn't download new graphics files for eq original.<br />
<br />
Tech support was no help, said talk to microsoft = no help what so ever.<br />
<br />
If this has happened to you, or you just happen to be a computer genius, help a poor guy out who just wants to kill aliens and see what his ugly troll looks like killing gnomes on Rallos Zek.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What exactly did it say when the error happened? I was using a friends Luclin CD's for the install once and It kept giving me errors about not being able to install the files from the CD. So I just used my set of Luclin CD's and it worked fine. If you know someone who happens to have a set of Luclin disks try installing with theirs and then just use your CD Key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try another CD like the guy above said but if that don't work consider this.<br />
<br />
Save all your character files, any files with your characters names on them, UIfiles and save your eqclient.ini to another folder then uninstall your old EQ via add/remove programs. DELETE the EQ folder after uninstalling. Reinstall EQ, Kunark, Velious and then SoL, then add your saved character files, DON'T add the eqclient.ini let it make a new one those settings are easy to change in the new UI, you can use the old to compare with the new if you have problems. DO NOT log on until the whole mess is installed, log on and patch up, enter codes, should only need to enter new SoL code, and get the game playable using the old interface. Don't forget to use the advanced log-in to get the optional zones and files, i.e Warrens, Stonebrundt and Jagged Pine, do this after a successful log-in. Then you can switch to the new and set that up.<br />
<br />
Set-up for SoL will ask if you want to re-texture the old world and expansions, this sounds like where you had the problems, a new install will make sure the expected files are there.<br />
<br />
If don't have broadband or don't feel comfortable re-installing EQ, do like the other guy said and try another CD or take it back for another. I like re-installing junk so that's always my suggestion. It can't hurt.</div></div><hr />
