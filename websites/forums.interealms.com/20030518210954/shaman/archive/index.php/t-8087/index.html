<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a bit confused as to where the skulls drop.  I've heard they only drop in the south wing;  I've also heard they can drop off the entrance mobs.  Has anyone solo'ing the entrance seen the skulls drop, lore or non-lore versions?<br />
<br />
If the skulls don't drop off the entrance mobs, could a 55 shaman, 56 beastlord, and 56 cleric make it to where they do drop?  Without a rogue to lockpick any doors?<br />
<br />
Any tips on getting these skulls would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hs skulls mostly drop in the south wing.  You will need a rogue to open the door.<br />
<br />
The mobs in the south wing all HT, and they can swarm up on you in groups of 4 and 5 if you're not careful.<br />
<br />
I suggest getting a chanter/bard and a rogue for this endeavor.<br />
<br />
As an alternative you can solo the entrance and basement a while (or group), and simply wait until an AOE or fully equipped group comes thru and pick up skulls off their kills.<br />
<br />
It is POSSIBLE to complete each of the previous sections, get the key, and proceed to the next section until you are in the south wing.  This would take a dedicated group because the key mobs aren't always up and may need to be spawned. With proper crowd control it should be a fun afternoon though.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I know, the skulls only drop in the South Wing off different skellies.<br />
<br />
Getting the key for the South Wing is very time consuming also, you are better off with a Lockpicking Rogue and a full group if possible, including a chanter/bard for adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is the South Wing blue to level 60, or does it start to become light blue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The lore skull drops in the east wing frequently, the others drop frequently in the south wing.   It is possible to pick off the wanderer from the east wing from the entrance, but it would be much easier to grab a group and just go for it in south.  <br />
<br />
I was able to solo the wanderer from the east wing at 54, but it was tough and I don't recommend it cause any skull drop off just one mob would be a looong wait hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got a rogue to let me into the south wing entry and soloed that room a bit, but a few hours there did not do me half as much good as getting a full group and pulling most of the south wing.  Previously, I had tried getting skulls just soloing the entrance/basement and had none drop over 12 hours.  Just get a solid group and monopolize HS south for a few hours and you shoud be good.  <br />
<br />
An undertaker skelly was the mob that finally dropped my dusty skull and the other skulls just came off random mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Undertaker skelly dropped if for me both times I got it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">was there bout 2 weeks ago.. went through 2 of the wings before i got a rogue in there ;).  Only saw skulls drop on the south wing mobs.. unfortunately i only got 3 of the 4 needed /rude hehe will have to go back again.  some mobs are light blue and some are dark at level 60.. loot is decent.. not the best.. but at least this part of the quest doesn't force you to hunt greens for hours =P</div></div><hr />
