<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FT items.<br />
<br />
Generaly all Shaman in our guild pass on everything with an FT effect. All other casters are given preference on FT items.<br />
<br />
I have no FT items at all, I dont really think i am missing out.<br />
<br />
Should a Shaman roll against the other casters on these items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You already have insane regen, FT is not a priority for you as much as it is for say, your clerics.<br />
<br />
IMO, we dont need FT as much as other classes do.  Sure its nice, and id like to have some extra mana regen, but those clerics dont have canni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">clerics, wizards, enchanters, druids...usually in that order. then its free for all on guessing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When clerics run out of mana, the fight is over, when shamans run out of mana we eat our knee's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have FT 4 :)<br />
Generally, clerics and wiz are 1rst for FT items. We don't roll for items, officer decide the attribs of the guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yep I have alllllways passed on FT gear. Gimme HP/AC gear, once im at 60 mana is just not a problem anymore. (except the 15-20 seconds after im rezzed lol, hate that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guildleader assigns loot for the most part; no dkp, little if any rolling.  We gave FT items to clerics and wizards first, shaman came last (mostly by out own suggestion).<br />
<br />
We already regen mana quickly, tho it takes effort on our part.  My only FT was from my cabbage earring untill recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Janin2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FT owns, that simple. All classes need it. No one should be entitled to ft items over any other class...if your raids fail because your clerics go oom then you need to rethink your strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We are on RPP, so it doesn't matter, whoever has the most points that wants it gets it.   That said... most of the shaman don't really care about FT at all, its a nice bonus on items with real stats like HP.  I have FT 8 but don't really notice it much with Torpor/Canni combo.  Last Aten Ha Ra kill I logged the fight and determined I regained mana from Torp/Canni at an equivalent of FT 43 over the fight  (FT 84 counting buffs, AA, and FT items).<br />
<br />
FT really isn't going to make that much difference to a shaman, but its still nice if you get it on a piece with other nice stats.  But I'd never take an item with low HP just because it had FT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, the only reason that I am specifically looking forward to some items that have FT on them is that they also have 100hp/mana on them as well. Shield from HP is one I am looking forward to eventually. Cloak from Cursed. I would be perfectly happy with a Cloak of the Sky since it has the 100hp/mana I seek, but we dont do NToV anymore, so I have to look at the options that are available to me. However, in general, I don't look specifically for items with FT on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is not one situation I think that life or death has depended upon flowing thought, for any class. By the time you're able to get FT15, groups/raids don't die because the cleric was out of mana... they died because the monk was stupid and brought 5 blinders. So, what I think... anyone should get it. The only reason I've passed on all FT items is because they're a lack of hitpoint upgrade for me; a shaman using hierophant cloak getting cloak of mourning &gt; a shaman using cloak of sky getting mourning, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Considering the fact i never have to med, I dont think I need any FT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">no particular order, who wants it(and deserves it) gets it.<br />
i have ft 10 or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We give em to the bot clerics and bot wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since FT items are mostly usefull in down time and the crawl to a target, it doesnt really matter who gets them, most of the items are pretty situational usage things anyway. We dont have any standing priority, and usually people are more interested in items stats than whether or not it has FT.<br />
<br />
Btw, the folks who scoff at FT because they have torpor should bear in mind that it is a rare spell, and not everyone has it. I think in our guild about half of our 60 shaman have it, those that dont certainly have a use for FT :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We lotto them ;)<br />
<br />
Our guild is still small and intimate enough that we trust one another's judgement--not to mention we're all good friends and have a real life get together every 6 months or so. We split off from a larger guild because we got tired of the whiners/lootwhores and made up our own rules based on what we thought was fair. It's been working out great thus far. The general consensus is to let the Clerics/Wizards get them first, because we currently only have one Mage and he isn't around very much. if we had more Mod Rod abilities, I'm sure they'd just be a free-for-all to whoever felt the item was an upgrade/necessary.</div></div><hr />
