<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We've killed him a few times without too much problem. Im trying to determine what triggers his dispell, and/or if anyone knows the name of the spell so I can look it up in lucy. I keep forgetting to turn my log on so I can have something to sift back though.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What dispell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmmm, think it's this one?<br />

AL has a nasty habit of dispelling/curing himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's been a while, but isn't AL unslowable?<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, and it is unslowable, then it can dispell/cure all it wants. All you have to worry about is cripple dropping and RT taking a few more dps. However, since he rampages so much with or without cripple, the RT should have a few healers looking after him anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am pretty sure it is just a random proc of the spell that gloriana posted.  I've been the primary crippler/malo debuffer on him about 8 times and I haven't noticed any timing or trigger to it.  You just have to wait to see the notice and reapply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The randomness to it makes me think its a proc as well. AL also procs a knockback...are they related at all? We are generally pretty short on clerics so keeping him crippled is pretty important for us. <br />
<br />
Thing is, I dont ever remember seeing emotes for &quot;Arch Lich Rhag3 has been dispelled&quot; or whatnot, and if it was that spell you'd get that emote, correct? Is that the same spell Sont uses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, make druids heal :P They wanted to be viable healers, and now they get to reap the rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What Boinshar said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that he dispells all debuffs on him self</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">he dispells 4 buffs every 18 seconds<br />
<br />
if you have half a brain you can keep him crippled 24/7</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get a kei and melee him, when he dispels chain cripple til it lands, cripple is low mana so you can regen it back up with kei and if ya ever drop below 60% mana hit cann5 and let another healer throw ya a heal.  Thats what I always did when my guild used to farm AL (killed him over 20 times heh, 1 shield, ***!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IIRC, Sontalak was slowable before disease counters went it, then it was fully slowable without dispell for a week or so, then it was flagged immune. Arch Lich probably had same track record. I remember slowing him fully when disease counters where introduced and he couldn't get rid of that slow.</div></div><hr />
