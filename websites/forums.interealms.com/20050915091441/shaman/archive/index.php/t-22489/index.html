Hi Rommel. I dont know the answer but given a little bump maybe someone will know. Ive found eq is so fickle sometimes you just have to try it and see how it goes on each system. I have some old puters that are right around the same power and specs but one will run eq and one wont. Good luck though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I appreciate the reply.  Im hoping that it will, I really dont want to have to buy a new system here just to play EQ, the money inst an issue, but I cant think of a reason Id need two when I get back to the states..Im really hoping it plays decently, IE not to much lag..I tend to solo a lot and lag spikes can kill ya, that and Im taking some good adivice from some folks here and doing some more LDONs go get my gear up graded..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, the system has a 2.0 and here is the web site that lists exactly what it has..sorry, not a direct link just a cut and paste..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looking at that PC spec, and looking at the Spec for GoD it should work. <br />
<br />
The GoD minimum specs are as follows;<br />
<br />
Pentium III 400 or greater<br />
256 MB Ram<br />
Ati Radeon 7500/Nvidea Geforce 1 equivalent or greater<br />
blah blah blah some stuff about sound cards etc<br />
Direct X 9<br />
<br />
You are fine on the chip and ram. I think that the SiS 4x APG card is above the minimum spec listed here.<br />
<br />
You will probably have to run with a resolution lower than you are used to but it should work. <br />
<br />
Like Shilzah says though you need to install it and try it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the help.  The video card is one of those integrated video cards, and should be the equal of a ati 7500.  Im anxious to see if it works.</div></div><hr />
