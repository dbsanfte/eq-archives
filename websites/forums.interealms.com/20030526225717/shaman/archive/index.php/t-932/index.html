<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to a lot of sites with spell info they all says Chloroblast the 55 shaman spell heal for 428 pts.  But I tested again and again in game it only heals 385.  I even cast it on my friend and asked him to do the math for me instead of just read the healing message.  Still, 385.<br />
<br />
Are all those boards giving the wrong info or did they nerf the spell or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Web info must be incorrect. Chloroblast heals 385 normally...would heal 423 if you had max Healing Adept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The web info is mostly correct. The 428 number is what is in the SPDAT. What is not being factored in is the 10% non-cleric healing penalty.<br />
<br />
10% of 428 = 43<br />
428-43= 385.  &lt;-- what you actually get.<br />
<br />
Every heal spell in the game is effected by the cleric/non-cleric situation even if the spell isn't available to clerics.<br />
<br />
Something you many want to try : Go look up Superior Heal on the same site. I can pretty much guarantee that it will say 300. When it is cast by a Shaman/Druid/Ranger/Paladin/Beastlord it only does 270.<br />
<br />
BTW, Clerics get a 5% bonus so THEY get to do 315 with Superior. If Clerics were to be given Chloroblast it would do 449 or 450 (actual number 449.4 - depends on if they round the number normally or not) for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you are referring to Greater Heal Zyphyr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are right - had a brain fart at that point. Other that the fact that I put the wrong spell name in, it is correct though.</div></div><hr />
