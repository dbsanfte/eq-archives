<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't really have any weighting system like that.<br />
When you raid for gear, stuff like that doesn't factor in as much.<br />
Focus effects and flowing thought and HPs are all I pay attention to anymore really.<br />
For example, I would wear a ceramic shield of valor for extended buff 4 more often than I'd wear Cazic Thule's brain (100hp mana and FT1).<br />
Once you get into raiding for gear, good stats on gear goes along with all items with good focus.<br />
<br />
To try and put a weighting system on stuff:<br />
Str, Sta, Wis, Int, Dex all have zero weight for me because I have max str, sta, wis, and dex, and my int doesn't matter.<br />
Cha has zero weight for me because I have over 115 cha unbuffed, so I don't have to buff myself to sell crap to vendors.<br />
Agl has next to zero weight only because I can buff myself to max it, though I'd like to have 305 agl without the need for any buff slot being wasted.<br />
<br />
What does matter to me:<br />
Focus effects for me have utmost priority over everything else.  There's mana pres, mana pres for dots, spell haste, spell haste for detrimental, spell haste for beneficial, longer buffs, longer debuffs, bigger nukes, bigger cold nukes, special Time Gear mods and GoD armor mods like Stun Resist, Spell Shield, Shielding, Avoidance, Dot Shielding, etc, haste, weapon procs, and right clickies of all sorts.  There's so many of them, that the absolute priority over all other things for my gear selections is finding a slot for each focus effect.  With raiding time and God, getting a piece of gear with a focus in a wrong slot can have &quot;repercussions&quot; in your later gear choices.<br />
<br />
For example, I have better healing on my arms.  If I get the time arms, I need a new healing focus, which would be my shield slot from Quarm when he drops it.  If I was to hold out for getting the GoD armor from Qvic/Uqua with better healing on it, then I wouldn't have the time arms with it's spell haste of whatever type it is, so instead of getting a hammer of hours I wanted to get easily, I'll have to hold out for getting the illuminated hammer from Ikkinz or whatever zone it is.  Other options are to get the healing shoulder from time, and still go for hammer of hours if you want timeburn, but then you need the bloodlink chest for mana pres instead of going for time chest for chronoburn.<br />
When you raid high end gear, picking up a focus item in a slot means you might have to give up another focus you already have in that slot, and have to find a replacement elsewhere, and focus effects aren't usually spread on a lot of items.  There's only 1 shaman item with chronoburn on it, while there's multiple with good mana preservation.  There's only 2 items shaman can get with chrononostrum, so if you want those focus effects, you have to plan your gear choices around them.<br />
<br />
Aside from focus items, this is where your personal preferences come into play for what gear you pick.<br />
My main choices are to go for in order:<br />
1.  Items with awesome right clickies.  Quarm ring is a fine choice.  Items with &quot;form of XXX&quot; are great.  Ornate BP is great for free SLTW.  etc.<br />
2.  Items with massive HP are second in priority.<br />
3.  Items with 15-20 resists to all, or massive 30+ resists to 2+ slots are good for consideration.<br />
4.  Items with lots of mana are worth of consideration.<br />
5.  Don't forget to keep your AC up there.  No ac = beats.<br />
<br />
If you are shopping for gear from the bazaar you might want to let focus effects slide, and concentrate more on the HPs and mana.<br />
If you don't have max sta, then sta equates to HPs and is much more valuable.<br />
If you have enough HPs to comfortably hunt in your places of choice, then consider focusing more on getting focus items even if it means sacrificing some HPs for it.<br />
Resists are also important to keep up in general.  The locations you hunt and the mobs you fight determine how much you need resists.  Fighting in ToV for example you want high resists to deal with Wurms and Drakes and Dragons.  If you fight in POP, resists aren't that big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am nowhere near the raiding Shaman that Juujuu is, but right now it's: WIS, STA, FT=Effects.<br />
<br />
On my Enchanter it's INT (355 so done), STA (yes), Effects &gt; FT<br />
<br />
Note I use AA's to help me achieve those goals if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have a weighting system but I value focus effects &gt; click effects &gt; shielding &gt; HP &gt; resists &gt; AC. I do not look at mana, FT or stats at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a 'heavy' EP shaman (just need corniav/rathe for time, we farm the rest):<br />
<br />
1. Hp<br />
2. Focus effects/clicks<br />
3. Ft<br />
4. Resists<br />
5. Ac<br />
<br />
What I think is more important is upgrading your weakest slots of gear as a priority.<br />
<br />
ie: if you look at my magelo, I'm currently holding out for Phoenix claw talisman for neck slot, as my last loot was the ft7 earth sheild, which put me on ft20 meaning I can dump some of my weaker ft slots.<br />
<br />
The Talisman has good hp (140) great resists (+30 cr/fr/mr I think), clicky abolish disease and the rest of stats are good.<br />
<br />
Another example is I want to upgrade my shoulders, but don't want to lose beneficial spell haste (I have qb3 but need the haste for heals/cures). So I'm looking to replace 'haste of mith' with 'speed of mith'+. <br />
My best pre-time option I think is to hope for the haste mask from smith rondo (don't need the Ih4 on knucklebone anymore). Fennin belt would have been nice but I got the air belt with 20% buff extension focus early in to EP's so don't want to lose this yet ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Perpetually pre-elemental here. Sta is at 305 with buffs, so I no longer look for that. for me, it's:<br />
<br />
Focus, HP, and Clicky &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Unless something has huge saves on it. I HATE carrying around resist gear. Thank goodness for augs. and I used to have a complex formula for the configurator... but not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I take gear based on HP, and only use HP augs on the new gear. All other stuff like focus/resists/ac are secondary. The other stuff normally comes with high hp gear. If I am missing a focus (like I'm missing Quickening of Mithaniel right now), I will just use tribute focus till I get a piece of gear with that focus.<br />
<br />
Clicky effects also infleunced my choice before in items such as TA, Quarm shawl and Uqua cloak but it is mainly hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Focus effects, HP, resists. Clickies if it's a good effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very pre-elemental shaman here, I'm Mr. LDON Man, lol. Finally got my HP close to where I want it (soon to be 3600+ unbuffed! yay me!), so that and STA aren't as much of a concern anymore. Nowadays, it's Focus Effects, AC, FT, Resists, Clickies, HP. I have never been known to turn down a good HP item, though. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Low end EP here, guild hasnt attempted any of the EP Gods yet.<br />
<br />
I just look to see what it does for me, of course focus effects I dont have are highly valued as are clickies that relieve a spell slot.  My stamina and wis are as high as I can use currently without more AAs, both max with a single buff so they are very low priority (but used to be higher priority), hp and items with lots of resists are also important to me since I raid.<br />
<br />
In general for me, focus &gt; clickies &gt; hp &gt; resists &gt; ft &gt; ac &gt; stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Time+ shaman, my order:<br />
Focus:  Mana pres &gt; spell haste &gt; improved healing<br />
1 AC = 2 HP = 3 mana = 4 saves if I try to weigh items<br />
<br />
remaining stats are usually pretty balanced at that level, so Uqua gets us all groaning and moaning again (hint: Make sure you're not carrying 2 k plat with you, you will delete them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hp + Mana &gt; than all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I will take a shot at a straight answer to your question. This is my opinion based on my current situation and gear. Your Mileage May Vary. <br />
<br />
hp = 1<br />
mana =.4<br />
<br />
AC = 1<br />
<br />
Sta = 4<br />
Wis = 1<br />
Agi = 0<br />
Str = 0<br />
Dex = 0<br />
Int = 0<br />
Cha = 0<br />
<br />
Mag R = 1.5<br />
Poison R = 1.5<br />
Disease R = 1<br />
Cold R = 1<br />
Fire R = 1<br />
<br />
Stamina will go to 0 once my worn stamina is 280. It will go to 1.2 once my worn stamina is 255. Mana is .4 because that is about the CanniV ratio of hp to mana. When everything hits the fan, a nice large mana pool is helpful. <br />
<br />
Focus effects are much more important than stats. I recommend the following as the four most important: Haste of Mithaniel, Haste of Solusek, Extended Enhancement IV, Mana Preservation IV. The shawl effect is longer than EBIV, but does not affect Q. I have two of the four in the scaled avatar boots and the Wicked Bone Atlatl. After I get these, I am also hoping for Improved Healing IV, which is on the scaled avatar arms. <br />
<br />
Finally, certain clickies are very nice. I would recommend especially a root clicky, which is on the scaled avatar pants and a ring. With VP3 and a root clicky, you may feel OK leaving root unloaded most of the time except when you are primary cc. You will need a couple of INSTANT spell icon clickies for debuffing mobs, mostly raid targets. The telescope works for a few seconds at a time. The Velious and Jaundiced Bone armor buffs are slow casting, so pretty worthless for this role. Of course, stinging wort and other old world instant buff potion work, but can get expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jedani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HP &gt; Focus effects&gt; HP&gt; HP&gt; everything else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">HP = 1<br />
Focus Effects = .5<br />
Mana = .4<br />
AC = .2<br />
<br />
WIS and STA are maxxed so I don't need them and HP is so far above everything else I have to say it's twice as important.  And frankly, AC is dropping because with friends' buffs and self buffs I am around 1400 and I am getting hit so much in GoD regardless, and in the older content I haven't seen a significant reduction in how much/how often I am hit for the last 100 AC I've gone up.  <br />
<br />
HP is so much more important than everything else it isn't even funny.</div></div><hr />
