I hope to be hitting 34 finally after two years of playing my Alt Shaman, I'm pretty excited about getting a pet and doing Alchemy.<br />
<br />
I've not done Alchemy at all and was going to wait till 34 to dumb 20 points into it, by putting in 20 points what do you suggest I make to Max my Alchemy at level 34?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you actually want to make a profit and not just dump cash into a botomless hole i suggest making SoW potions untill trivial at 37 then Kiva's Blistering Flesh or Kithor's Disease treatemnt to get skill to 52 - 57 so you wont get as many fails on SoW potions, then make nothing but SoW potions, its the only thing that really sells for a profit anymore and actually moves out of your inventory. At this time there really isn't much of a reason to waste plat on try for any higher skills. Verant/SOE has abandoned Alchemy and so have I except for personal use i no longer practice Alchemy.  My skill is like 155 or so, and I would be richer if i had never trained that high.</div></div><hr />
