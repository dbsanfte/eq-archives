I'm sure I'm not alone in wondering what SoE has planned for us next, boy I can't wait for LoY.:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea...I fail to understand how this affects us...really.  What did you guys do before focus items?  Yea, that's what I thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Focus items were created to help address weaknesses in caster classes, as compared to melee classes.  Now shaman (and enchanters) are at the same position they were in pre&quot;balancing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Shaman were able to survive without affliction foci, and will continue to be able to do so.  However, they now have a much more difficult way to go, as other classes are getting an easier way to go.  Even before, leveling a shaman was a challenge to people, more so than many other classes.  Making it just that more difficult is going to ensure that shaman are rare indeed in the future.  <br />
<br />
Another thing to consider would be that the PoP playtesters no doubt used these focus items, meaning that PoP mobs were designed around the use of affliction foci.  These focus effects could be the make or break difference in many PoP raids, for many guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im a hardcore dedicated EQ player.<br />
<br />
This was the straw that broke the camels back. <br />
<br />
Nerfing Can5... hmm , well ok i can still do ok.<br />
<br />
Bland spells for PoP compared to other classes  ...  well i love my shaman , no biggy.<br />
<br />
Sow mitigation  ...  ***, hello nerf. sigh well ok , i love my shaman.<br />
<br />
PoP spells are increased in mana and decreased in duration.....  Grrrr now ihave to rebuff MORE when clerics and chanters and whoever else have EXTENDED durations . Obviously a nerf to our mana regen. Bleh &gt;=\     ok well . i love my shaman, i love this game , it.lll be ok , they will through us a bone.<br />
<br />
Removal of affliction haste to  Malo/turg/root.......   Before i got pissed i tried living with this in a group enviroment and all morning i get &quot; yo , are you slowing ?&quot; Watching a BST  &quot;/g %t slowed&quot; while im still casting malo.  **** this , i been cooling down all night and it has led me to one course of action this morning. You see it doesnt matter if it was a bug or not , i didnt know anything about it cause i didnt have focus items back then , there is no excuse to let it go for so long, how the hell was i supposed to know about a patch 9 months ago , all i knew was it worked and there were NEW items in the game with the same &quot;broken&quot; effect. If it was broken you should NOT have continued to build on it and give the impression it was ok , PURE and SIMPLE.<br />
So despite being a hardcore EQ fan and loving this game , i have canceled LoY, i have talked my GF into it as her main is a druid and am persuing means to getting back into first person shooter games like q3 and UT2k. Atleast the only bitch we had there was netcode. <br />
<br />
If sony realizes what they have done and how unhappy they have made us all , then thats another story , till then my hat and coat are off the rack and im heading for the door.</div></div><hr />

Just make a Alt and move your shaman to another account. On a unrelated subject how much do decently equip 65 shamans go for on PA?<br />

The fact they did it SILENT I can not.<br />
<br />
Just like we had to find out the slow Mitigation (and reversed slowing) by ourselfs we got no Info from Absor about this.<br />
<br />
I remember when we where told that &quot;All priest classes should be able to heal in a group&quot; Well surpise we got crap heals based on 100% slow and we got a nerfed slow.<br />
<br />
We got Dots to deal damage but we see mobs that die before my best dot (disease) deals even half damage.<br />
<br />
We got Stat buffs for stats no-one cares about.<br />
<br />
But I bet that someone will post that we can solo Yeldema and that all is fine for the shaman class.</div></div><hr />

A few weeks later they nerf mana burn.  Well I didnt like that class much anyway.  Ok make a bl.  Oh you remove the complete heal.  Thanks well I will make a shaman.  <br />
<br />
I really do love my shaman but I am feeling less and less useful in groups as I progress through PoP.  Not ready to give up yet but would like to be evened out again.</div></div><hr />

thats all i care about , not  turgurs lasting longer , i can recast that , DoTs lasting longer and casting shorter i dont care about.<br />
<br />
I can live with the default casting time of all the spells. Its malo that is killing me. we NEED to cast malo/malosini/malosinia to land the slows. once thats done the rest i can &quot;deal with&quot;</div></div><hr />

I haven't tested yet, but I assume they no longer affect root/snares though.</div></div><hr />

line 7 is where the bug was. The line that should have been limiting it to dots only wasn't.  Darkness since it is a dot would be effected, snare and root would not. <br />
<br />
Before you replay it only says allowed not required keep in mind the info isn't in text like that in the file. it's all numbers and lucy people are the ones who pick the exact wording based on observations in game.</div></div><hr />

screw this , im heading out the door , its become a solid resolve now , not just a pissed off threat. You know that moment when something becomes more then a idea , it settles down and your on course to follow it out one way or another? I just got that as i clicked for this post. Im sick of fighting to enjoy a game that was pretty much perfect when i came to it.<br />
<br />
peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah, Lit me too. I was wavering a month ago over the malo issue. Paid 110k for malo and that got me playing again for a bit (110k!). The thrill of getting it is gone and the wipe out on some gear I am very fond of. Also the very noticable difference in ability. Slowing pov mobs as they were hitting 85-75% when not the day before I was easily getting slowed 98-90%. Did some time in bot using malo/sini/slow was a huge difference. <br />
<br />
Just checked the moo3 site its gone gold think I'll be playing that game till wow hits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hey try starting a Necro then a Monk then a Shaman Holly Crap batman, you'd think id quit the game by now, wanna see nerfs :) ask me all about them over the last 4 years. All i gotta say is i found a good group of guild mates to 4 box with and rely on my Chanter box to help cut the slack on my Shaman :)<br />
<br />
I am not stupid, the only way to get somewhere was to 4 box a chanter, warrior,cleric,and Shaman. Each class is very useful to us, and when something gets broken? well we pop in a Monk, or Druid, or some other class we have built up into the fold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I do feel badly for the people that put time/money into affliction focus items.  I came back to the game after they were introduced and never got a chance to pick any up.<br />
<br />
But Ive done fine since then and Im still doing fine and I malo/turgur everything that is pulled and I do fine.  Malo is so low agro you can cast it as soon as the mob gets in range and have it slowed right after it gets there.<br />
<br />
As Gloriana (I think it was) pointed out in the other pissy thread, slows and debuffs are our bread and butter and there are no focus items for it now unlike every other caster class has to enhance their important spells.  I definitely think its something that needs to be looked at.<br />
<br />
Im not saying it doesnt suck or that you shouldnt get angry, but the class is still very viable, very fun and one of the best classes in the game imo.  Ever watched an enchanter trying to slow giants in PoS early?  It aint a pretty sight.<br />
<br />
And I wouldnt be playing the game if I was worried or paranoid about the class, if it worries you that much you should have quit long ago.  Its already easy to get a group as a shaman, everyone quitting would make it even easier.<br />
<br />
To say Sony doesnt care about its customers is rediculous.  You think they dont know that angry players quit?  That happy players stay and buy more products?  They saw what they percieved to be unbalanced and was unintended in the first place, although it took them a long time to fix it, they finally did.  Additionally, just about every class has its own issues, we are not/have not been singled out.</div></div><hr />

SONY is going to turn all us good shaman into whiny druids.<br />

Please, just the BASICS would make most of us happy:<br />
<br />
1)  INCREASE DROP RATES FOR SHAMAN SPELLS!<br />
    --namely Pox, Malo, and Torpor.<br />
<br />
2)  FIX SLOW MITIGATION<br />
<br />
3)  Undo the latest Affliction focus effect nerf.<br />
<br />
4)  Get rid of useless+60 spells (maybe add one or two more useful).<br />

Just these changes would make many many shaman happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Honestly, the changing of AE items back to what they were doing before anyone bothered to get them is little more than a speedbump in the history of the shaman class.  I am guessing that SOE pulled the plug on AE items simply because they were getting double coverage from some of the PoP focus items.  Why have 2 different focus effects do the same thing?  Pre-nerf, Focus of Solusek and Affliction Effeciency were very similar.<br />
<br />
This really does not signal the demise of our class or merit quitting when you consider the other &quot;big deals&quot; that inspired people to exit EQ and proclaim the shaman class &quot;FUXXXORED!&quot;:<br />
<br />
1) My manastone quit working!<br />
2) Barbarians for Totemic quests are KOS to evil races!<br />
3) The Glacier Bear and  Grizzleknot are too rare!<br />
4) Spite Golems NEVER drop RE while other class armor falls like rain!<br />
5) JB BP and legs only drop off ubah mobs!<br />
6) I'm 60 and can't find all my spells......<br />
<br />
And the list goes on and on and on, but for some reason our gear keeps getting better, we can finally modify our basic profiles, we can fast heal for 1K+, and the game is profoundly more interesting that it ever was at day one.<br />
<br />
I can still do more than any other class out there and I feel bad for all those people who never had the chance to play a high-level shaman. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Naagruz you are blind if you think you can do more then any other class out there. It's shaman like you and few other here that make it possible for sony to butcher this game and not have to feel the repercussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">So what did you do before they enhanced affliction items Uusal?  Were you useless and underpowered?  Unable to solo effectively?  Not helpful in groups or raids?  Ever look at the predicament warriors, rogues, and some of the other group dependent classes are in?<br />
<br />
Granted, there are gifted classes out there like mages and chanters that can pull off some amazing things, but the shaman class is still a powerhouse and we still bring lots to the table WITHOUT affliction focus items.  Sure, I liked being able to have 3/4 of my spells cast faster, last longer, and use less mana, but I was fine before I had them and am fine without them now.<br />
<br />
As for helping Sony to butcher the game, I don't think my tiny voice of dissention is going to impact the game as much as the horde of posts with people cancelling accounts, e-mailing petitions, and dropping LoY orders.  &quot;Shaman like me&quot; make up such a small minority on this particular issue that I don't think you need to worry much.<br />
<br />
I don't think we are gimped and I have seen this sort of thing happen many, many times before.  It's an opinion man, don't freak out. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Sorry Naag I'm freaked out. Didnt mean to jump on you. As far as the difference in before after Affliction patch. I never casted malo as a 5 sec spell I have had my focus before the spell so basically for me it was a very apparent loss in power. Also what should be worrying you and every shaman is the consitent shaft shaman are getting month after month. Do you have to wait till you dire4ctly are effected in a way you feel is unacceptible before you will join with the &quot;majority&quot; of shaman that think our class is getting the shaft. It's alarming to see patch after patch the people who last month were shaman rule and are fine only to have there favorite toy nerfed or a run in with a bad string of parches or gimped cheal finally kills them on and on. So many here are completely ego centric and it doesnt hurt me so I'm not worried stop whining. Eventually if this goes on long enough every single shaman will have had a bad experience with VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have had bad experiences aplenty with VI/SOE and think they REALLY screwed up on this issue by letting affliction items do so much for so long and then casually &quot;turning them off&quot; without even mentioning it.  We did deserve a warning at least and this is very much the way that VI/SOE has always operated.  One day they will hopefully wake up and pay a little more attention to things before they haul off and change them, but until that time we all get to ride the EQ rollercoaster.<br />
<br />
Once this all boils down, chances are that a few more PoP items are going to come into play that do the same jobs that the old affliction items did.  That Malarian Ear Stud off Grummus just got much better looking btw.</div></div><hr />
