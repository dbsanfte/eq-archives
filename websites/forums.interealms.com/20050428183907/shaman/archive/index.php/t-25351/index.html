I will play my shaman still but for now i am leveling up ym hunter and i have to say OH ......MY......GOD...the damage a hunter does is insane. I can drop stuff dead at around the 10 second mark after engaging it. Pet sticks on it and keeps it busy while i rain down arrows. Up close however even a shaman can own a hunter. But for soloing it seems to be an amazing class :)<br />

Anyone else play hunter?<br />

I had alot of fun with my dwarf hunter in beta. Hunter are amazing killers when facing 1 mob. Loosing your pet or getting multiples and things go south fast.<br />
<br />
That said 2 hunters can shred through mobs at an amazing rate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most people agree that hunter's are the best soloing class, and one of the best for pvp if they can engage from a distance.  They look like a fun class and I almost rolled one as my alt, but went with a priest instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I made a hunter alt and I must say, I do kill pretty fast and efficiently solo.  As for pvp with hunter, I fought this level 60 hunter when he was near death and he wing clipped me and crit aimed shot me for 1737 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A hunter is going to be my next alt, they own me if they know what they are doing.  Thankfully, most do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have a 37 shammy and 37 hunter I duo. Great combo, I shred through zones. The combo of massive dps, a pet, instant dps surge (drop 2-3 shots and a instant dd from shammy at once), healing, and speed is nice. Hunter is specced for farming (mining/herb) and teh shammy is LC/skinning so its a good farm combo as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Groov - does your shaman's Windfury totem help the pet too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I group with a hunter regularly.  The Windfury totem does not seem to affect the Hunter or his pet.  They only seem to be useful to melee classes like pallies, warriors, and rogues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters are very strong, as long as they have enough open room.  Outdoors my hunter is great, but I must confess I envy my rogue freind in instances, where I often don't have line of sight, or an afriad to back up because of possible agro in other rooms, or have party members who always seem to instinctivly pull mobs closer and closer to me, no matter how far I back up.<br />
<br />
But inthe great outdoors, hunters are a great class. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or do other hunters start to get claustrophobic in instances?</div></div><hr />

Yep...those comments mirror my experiences as well (32 now.)  Half the time in instances I can't shoot...and I definintely can't tank an elite mob! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I knew back in ST1, even before pets were fully functional and before Hunter talents were available, that the class was going to be a superior damage dealer.<br />
<br />
Case in point, this past weekend. At 34 I was in Southshore. A 32 Undead Warlock and his 33 Undead Mage buddy killed a PVP enabling NPC and set of the local defense alerts. Normally I wouldn't engage lower levels, but there were two of them plus the Warlocks pet. I have minimal Arcane and Shadow magic resists, but was able to fend off their spells and take both of them out easily. <br />
<br />
Sic'd pet on mage to keep him busy with stun/cast interupt (I hate being sheeped :)), then I focused on the Warlock while he sent his pet after me. I have decent armor (870'ish at the time), so the pet didn't do a whole lot of damage. The 'lock died pretty quickly, then I turned to focus on the Mage who successfully feared my pet right as I finished off his buddy. Pet had done enough damage that it only took one Aimed Shot Rank 1 (300'ish dmg), one Concussive Shot (that also stunned him) and one regular arrow. Dead Mage.<br />
<br />
After playing my Tauren Shaman a bit lately, I've learned to really appreciate the damage my Hunter can do in ranged combat. But Tormac and Aby are right. Melee we're only half baked due to our lower armor compared to true melee classes. As long as I can have at least 8 yards between me and a mob, I'm ok (cave type dungeons are ok since I have room to send in pet and keep sufficient distance). However, building type environments (towers in particular) things can be a little more complicated and get dicey rather quickly if I'm not paying close enough attention (Tower of Althalaxx in Darkshore is a perfect example).<br />
<br />
Overall though, I couldn't be happier with my Hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agreed Val,<br />
<br />
I play a 36 NE Hunter on HellScream, and feel playing this class is the most fun I've had in any online game.  Part Ranger, part Beastlord and have FD to boot, what's not to love.  :)<br />
<br />
The fact that you can tame and keep different animals as pets is nothing short of brilliant.  I change pets all the time, because most of them are so cool looking.  Love the dps and the other utility skills like track, flare, fd and traps.<br />
<br />
Yeah, just like in EQ, indoors are not our best environment, and some hunters complain about issues in instanced zones.  However, you just have to play a little smarter.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hit level 40 last night. Also got my Leathercrafting up to 226 and one of our guild Pallies sent me the patterns for Tough Scorpid[/URL] BP and Gloves. Now that I've trained in Mail, I'll be heading to Tanaris to hunt down some scorpid scales so I can make some of this stuff. For a leather wearer, this crafted mail is nothing short of amazing. Awesome AC (compared to its like-leveled leather counterparts) + Agility + Spirit. Hard to beat!<br />
<br />
Gonna try and obtain the patterns for all pieces, then use rings, necklace, and trinkets to fluff out other stats. My INT is severly lacking. Took FOREVER to get my gun skills up yesterday after changing over to a new 20.8 DPS gun from my 15.7 DPS crossbow. 55 points came slowly and painfully, but I finally got it maxed out.<br />
<br />
My STR is pretty low too, since I've focused mainly on AGI to improve ranged combat. Best crit so far with Aimed Shot R3 is 660'ish followed by two subsequent normal crits of 254 each. 1100+ dmg in about 5 seconds. Not too shabby. My AGI is 189 at the moment, but soon to increase once I make some new mail armor! :) My ranged attack power is 530'ish with AoH.<br />
<br />
In case anyone missed when I said it before...<br />
<br />
[U]HUNTERS RAWK!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Am level 28 now and I crit for 427 damage with aimed shot /flex SO AMAZING :D<br />
<br />
<br />
The final level of aimed shot adds 600 damage /drool<br />
With good agi i can prob try and go for 2k :)<br />
