+8% dodge<br />
<br />
Does this mean that 8% of all incming hits will become misses, or that our inherent dodge skill is increased from 75 to 81 - i.e. an 8% increase in our dodge ability?<br />
<br />
Obviously an increase in 8% melee damage avoidance is significant, but an 8% increase in the dodge skill is almost useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's an 8% increase to your skill.</div></div><hr />

Like many things EQ it's the aggregate gain of more then one item they are planning on, it's like the old saying a dollar here, a dollar there pretty soon we're talking about a whole lot of money!  One item ain't much but put together 5 items and your looking at a nice bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understand the ethos, and EQ is very much about myriad tiny advancements. Nevertheless, its also about comparing, say, increasing dodge from 75 to 81 as against, for example additional +3 to regen.<br />
<br />
If the 8% had been like an equivalent to Combat agility - i.e avoiding a percentage of total incoming damage, it would have been a no brainer, as it is, I suspect it has just become a &quot;nice but not yet&quot; to be picked up sometime down the</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dont forget, the augment isnt just for shamans who have a 75 cap on dodge, unlike, say monks or rogues who's dodge cap is 250, IIRC [might be 200, been a while since i played my monk].<br />
<br />
8% of 200 or 250 is an impressive bump in skill level.  8% bump in skill for someone capped at 75 or 100 is modest but not impressive.<br />
<br />
== frynque</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can see how 8% would be great for classes who have a &quot;real&quot; dodge skill cap rather than our own rather crappy 75 cap (don't you think that we could have had our dodge skill cap raised over some of the many expansions, so that it might now be, say 150 - we are supposed to be &quot;battle priests&quot; or something?)<br />
<br />
I am not knocking the 8% dodge aug, I am just trying to decide what aug to buy next as I close in on 200 LDoNs completed ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
considering that last i heard skill mods dont stack.. 5 items together still wont do jack for the dodge mod :p</div></div><hr />
