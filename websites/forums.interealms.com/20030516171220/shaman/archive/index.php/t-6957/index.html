<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been looking at the different sets Spirit Callers, Rune Crafters, and Scaled Hierophant.  Mainly my question is on the Rune Crafters and Spirit Callers.  <br />
<br />
My question is which of these should I be trying to get right now.  I am on good faction with the dwarfs so should I work on trying to get what Rune Crafters and Scaled Hierophant armor I can get now and then later on try for the Spirit Callers or something else?<br />
<br />
I am level 45 right now and leveling quickly so I hope to be level 47 soon and getting to go along on some Hate raids and Kael raids.  <br />
<br />
Any input on the differences between the Spirit Callers and Rune Crafters would be helpful or even any info on what I should be looking for.<br />
<br />
One other quick question is I currently have two forest loops I had gotten while leveling in WW and FM would it be worth it to try and change those out with Imbued Golden Ivory earrings or should I just hold off and see if I can just save up for a Sol earring and a twisted leaves?<br />
<br />
Oh and why is the Umbral Planes shaman armor so bad? =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely save for Solstice earring.  Its the best earring most players will ever see, and, hell, if you do find a better one, thats whay you have two ears.</div></div><hr />
