Vah Shirs, Ogres, and probably frogloks (never seen a 55+ frog shaman) are brown bears.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Iksars are black bears.<br />
<br />
Barbarians are polar bears.</div></div><hr />

If you wear illusion of a PC race, NPCs will perceive you as being of that race.  If you wear a NON PC race (wolf, NDT, elemental, etc), there is no longer a faction change.<br />
<br />
For confirmation, I've been in wolfy form near the Halas guards without bothering them.  Used to be a death sentence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that's exactly why I love bear form...I don't get dizzy with the motion from canni dancing...it's not too hard to know if you're sitting or standing...just look on the actions window (i think that's what it is called...the one on extreme bottom right by default). I can honestly say only a few times have I realized I was sitting/standing when I wanted to be standing /sitting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, you are 65 and did not know you can sit in bear form? True, there is no graphic for changing position, or for sitting, just surprised you didn't know this, and feel bad for you for all that extra time in your younger days that you spent having to med standing lol :) (although it sounds like you never used bear form before...which would also be a little surprising)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hear, hear.  NEVER CHANGE THE ANIMATION.  I hate the damn bouncy bouncy cannidance animation, bearform fixes it right up.<br />
<br />
I also hate levitate for the same reason.<br />
<br />
Once you get used to it, you ALWAYS know whether you're standing or sitting.  I might mess it up once every 4-5 hours of gameplay, but I get the benefit of no up/down bouncing all the time.<br />
<br />
Admittedly this is less important now that A) I have a horse, and B) I have torpor and therefore mana coming out of my ears, but it was pretty important to me pre-60.</div></div><hr />

anyways, point is the spell isnt that great.</div></div><hr />

In addition to the visual change, the extra wisdom, minor hp regen, and innate ultravision, bearform also offers these advantages:<br />
<br />
1. Superior Climbing ability.  If the surface has a slope other than vertical, you can generally climb it in bearform even if you couldn't EVER do it in your natural form.  Climbing the wizard spires, the chasm walls of Western Wastes, or the hills and valleys of Mons Letalis (en route to Ssra on a CR w/ no batwings I found this very handy most recently) for example.  Shrinking while in bearform makes it easier to wiggle through the Hole entrance (w/o a key) than in a normal large race bodytype (even shrunk in my experience).<br />
<br />
2.  ICE skating!  Yes, it isn't as cool as the &quot;ass-boarding&quot; of days gone by, but if you are on certain flat surfaces you can ice skate while in bearform.  My normal ice rink is at the ToV entrance room.  I do this while waiting for the raid force to get grouped/buffed when bored, or when waiting for a rez (since I generally bind outside &amp; zone-in after death).  I usually bearform right after a death when there are peeping toms staring at my barbie booby beauties.<br />
<br />
You can ice skate by ducking while in bearform and then moving around.  Your paws will be locked in position, so there will be no &quot;leg-moving&quot; graphic as you run around.  It looks kind of neat, and can be good for some comic-relief as you race an ass-boarding Ogre around the room. :D Great fun!  (It doesn't work everywhere though.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The climbing trick can also be achieved with shrink... it has to do to the relative distance between the 'bottom' of your model (i.e. your feets) and the 'center' of your model (usually the center of your upper torso, i.e. the point used to calculate line-of-sights for AE, spells and aggro).<br />
<br />
The large the distance between the 2 points, the farther away the slope is from your 'center' point, the sharper the physic engine thinks the slope is and the slower you climb.<br />
<br />
I always wondered if it was what they had in mind or a lucky artifact from a piece of bad code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Cragael Im not certain that is entirely the whole story.<br />
Simple fact is as a Barb (on my Rogue and my Shammy) I physically can not climb the wall in Plane of Fire unless I use an illusion or shrink, but other large races can. Ogres and Trolls can climb up without shrinks NP. Same goes for the chasm in the Deep and as mentioned above also for several other places.<br />
There is a bug with the Barbarian models that causes the problems and it's not just model height or being flagged large.<br />
<br />
As to Bearform it's been pretty well covered as to what it can do and I agree the loss of bash is a shame and a tad silly as a Bear is a bloody big animal so it should be able to bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I personally have never liked bear form.... never really saw the much needed improvement from it. As an Iksar my regen was plenty high any ways. The +10 wis was nice for a short while, but when your max wis what's the point?  Bear form imo is really only good for non iksar races and those with out max wis.</div></div><hr />
