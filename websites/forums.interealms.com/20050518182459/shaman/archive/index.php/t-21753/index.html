<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night we went into VT.  We hadn't been there for over a month.  Anyway, we went with 2 shamans and we both had crazy resists on everything but malos.<br />
<br />
We would cast malos, and then try to slow getting 3-6 resists on average (maybe more) and then try to dot/nuke and those would be resisted as well.  The mobs were annulling slow and would have to be re-slowed often.  It wasn't a nightmare or anything, but it did make a tough job twice as tough because we had to constantly reslow mobs.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else experienced this recently?  This isn't our first time in VT by any means and I didn't have this problem (that I noticed) when I was the only shaman and we killed the TVX's on Sunday.  Did they beef up resists and ac on mobs?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You mean they were dispelling Malos?  You cannot dispell Shaman slow spells, you have to cure disease them off.<br />
<br />
Resists are flakey in VT some nights.  On the big pulls of 8 - 12 our BSTs always jump in because they can slow much faster then us.  EoMs always need malo to land slow first though and even then it usually takes 2 or 3 casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seemed about the same to me the other day.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes you get few in a row that just resist even after malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">since when can you not dispell slow ? ... bvellos constantly dispells slow with his proccing weap. ive soloed him a few times and it made for an anoying time. Is it different for an equiped weapon than to have the innate ability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have killed bvellos post slow counter change and he does not dispell slow, he is very resistant and you pretty much need malos to land and he will dispell that off so you have to slip slow in quick but no he cannot dispell slow once it's in. Check him again. You have to cure slow since it's disease counters for a while now. As far as the VT commentary above, someone could have been using Nihil so you get the wear off messages on Turgurs and visa versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Granted its been a damn longtime since i soloed him so ya ill try him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nothing unusual to me.  Then again, we usually  have 5 or more Shamans each raid and all are slowing once the resists debuffs land and anybody who lands a slow announces in rsay.  So from my perspective, VT is unchanged.<br />
<br />
On the slow being debuffed.  Check your players and make sure they are not using cancel/annul/pillage magic on the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did you have a bard harm'ing and chanter tashing?  Our chanters can get busy with mezzing so we usually have to slow without tash.  Since I bot a bard I almost never get resists after Malos+Harmony, but I do get resists when one of those two isn't on the mob which happens sometimes with the dang Eom stun AEs interrupting me and/or the bard.  Some bards don't Harmony/Occlusoin mobs if they are twisting 4 groups songs or busy mezzing.  When I can't have my bot I always work with a real bard to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't speak for resists, but when I get a message saying Turgur's has worn off, these days it's almost always someone having cast Nihil on that mob.<br />
<br />
Other occasions when Turgur's has worn off have been down to wearing off in time, the mob being charmed and me curing it and one time where we had a freak where a mob AE (which included slow) went off as the mob died and the spell landed on other mobs around it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a mob cure itself, but I don't think so. It can't be dispelled though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">GoD slow overwrites turgurs which is prolly what was happening there...<br />
<br />
as far as the resists system....yes it's fubar'd beyond belief right now...sucks to be a shammy / necro nowadays... May 12th resist changes were nice...then they pulled everything back and maybe even went too far... i had mobs in fire the other day resist 5 dots in a row even after I casted Malosinia -70....not just malos....<br />
<br />
WTB DECENT SOE PROGRAMMERS PLS!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed an increase in resists last night in PoTimeb during a couple encounters with adds. Some RZ adds after malos and sinia took 75% of my mana to slow it. Granted usually I would give up before that, but i was just plain stubborn, another shaman in the slow crew reported the same thing. Maybe it was just a wierd night for slows /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">no such thing as a weird night...its crappy programming for sure...they need to stop dicking arround on the live servers so much and invest in some Q &amp; A ON TEST SERVERS!!!!!</div></div><hr />
