I almost find it funny that after playing eq for over 5 years and helping hundreds of people in the game, helping several people on this board and posting many positive helpful posts, ..  i have a negative reputation because i made a recent post about shaman complaining.  Everything that I have ever done positive and helpful is ignored and 1 thread puts me in negative numbers.<br />
<br />
The whole point of my post was: 'stop complaining.  they know what's wrong - if you hate playing your shaman so much that all you do is complain, then play a different char'.  <br />
<br />
I am embarrased when i bring up my shaman in the game and hear other shaman complaining about their shaman in the game.  I got in an ooc debate in the bazaar one day with a shaman.  Someone said that they where thinking of making a shaman and asked for peoples opinion.  A 64 shaman started ripping on the class.  I debated everything he said in ooc and convinced the person that the shaman class is a great class to play solo or in groups.  Their main was a char in the teens.  The person created a shaman and I then donated some gear to help them get started and told them where / how to fight for their first 25 lvls.  <br />
<br />
My point here is...  1 thread doesn't reflect a persons true character.  I was bored and irritated at some negative posts when I made the thread that ruined my rep.  Did any of you that posted a negative splat by my name bother to search on my previous / current posts and see what else I have done, or was everything based on 1 thread?  <br />

**** stares at you in disbelief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Telling you right now. This was a waste of breathe on this crowd for the most part. If your concerned about your rep i have a tip for you. Dont be concerned about your rep. Just keep speaking with a healthy dose of &quot;F you F'er&quot; in the back of your mind. They aint god, they dont know it all, so getting pissed when they say something negitive about is futile.<br />

Hear me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really wouldnt worry about it I dont even look at peoples reps. As a matter of fact I think it is kind of silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its when reputation is thought of as superiority in terms of their post quality that is the problem, its not, usually its in terms of expressing well a popular opinion or providing useful information.<br />
Reputation really means nothing as it currently stands, because you got a negative reputation for a post does not mean anything. It just means most likely someone disagreed with your stance or is being an ass. The nature of the reputation system does not differentiate those who rate a post for disagreeing, and for those who purposefully flame and direct insults. As such it is a poor system with little relevance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, complaining about others complaining isn't very popular. In a sense its belittling others peoples point of view with little constructivity from my perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i don't really care too much.  i just thought i would comment on the knee-jerk reaction of some of the people on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't worry about rep too much, people will get to know you by the quality of your posts if you keep posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's amazing how the small things occupy our minds most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, wait, it means something?  Like...REALLY means something?!<br />
<br />
=p Nawwww  nothing to get worried about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ooooh and people that give negative rep bumps and then don't leave a name stink!  I wanna know who doesn't like me so I can pester them! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't even know how to look at reputations, and even if I did I wouldn't bother.<br />
<br />
I go by the content of the post, or how well a point is argued, nothing more.</div></div><hr />
