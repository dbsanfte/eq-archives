<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">edit:  helps to read more than the first post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This just in - someone failed (eep!) the brewing combine with a skill of 42, so it isn't no-fail! <br />
<br />
not no-fail :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hear it's very easy and cheap to go to PoT and buy grubs, combine them with water in a brew barrel, and get to 100 skill.<br />
<br />
Luckily it's a cheap, fast skill to master.  I just got LoY and haven't been yet, but I assume cle/dru/sha all do the same thing for the quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have no idea which components are droppable and which are not, but if you need a brewer on The Nameless, feel free to look up Xaoshaen (220-ish skill).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah, brewing is easy, at least up into the high 150's.  Go ahead and get it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, one fishing grub from the gnome vendor on the porch across from the “evil” area of PoK and one water flask from the lady standing next to him in a brew barrel.  It doesn’t get any easier or cheaper than that.  And doing that over and over again can get you to 122 skill. Just don’t get spoiled.  Most trade skills are NOT that easy.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The blood's no drop, so...yah you need to brew.<br />
<br />
Luckily I am over 200 and its one of the few skills you can easily raise with just mind numbing clicking and PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's all you really need to know:<br />
<br />
In a brew barrel combine A Blackened Vial (drop in Nadex) + the troll skull blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands) + Gunthak Gulf Water (Foraged and dropped in Gunthak). You get A Black Potion.<br />
<br />
Then combine A Black Potion + Pure Blood (dropped off a Luggold Initiate in Nadox) to recieve A Glowing Black Potion.<br />
<br />
You may be able to hand in the glowing black potion all by itself for the spell, but I handed in the &quot;A Torn Page&quot; (no-drop, all/all, Nadox drop) along with it to the npc and I got my Pure Blood scroll!</div></div><hr />
