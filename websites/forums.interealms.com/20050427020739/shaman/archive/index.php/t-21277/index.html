<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wribit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, Wribit Wribit here.  I was wondering what DoTs u all use when u<br />
r soloing in PoT.  So far this is my pulling pattern:<br />
<br />
Malos, run, Petrifying Earth/VP1, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Anathema, Epic,<br />
sit, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Anathema, etc.<br />
<br />
I do this until it is dead.  However, this tends to chew up a good deal of mana, and its about 4-6% a kill, with a 2% occasionally for unknown reasons.  I have a recovery period after EVERY mob cuz Bane/BoS tend to chew up a chunk of mana.  I use a BA4 bracer from Mage, Haste of Solusek mask from Hard BB LDON.  I was wondering if i should switch to a longer kill method that uses less mana, say, MD, VP1, Ultor, Pox, BoS?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any feedback.  Looking forward to chain-pull while soloing sometime soon after I find my &quot;Sweet Spot.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency IV (through tribute or an item) will help alot with your mana costs.  Keep wearing the BA4 bracer.  VP3 will help alot - I recommend getting that soon if you want to solo alot.  VP3 lasts 2 minutes and a few seconds, letting you keep a mob perma-parked without using any mana.<br />
<br />
I recommend this for your lineup:<br />
Pull with Malicious Decay or Turgur's, depending on your style.<br />
VP the mob where you want him.<br />
Breath of Ultor.<br />
Malos.<br />
(Slow w/ Turgur's for safety).<br />
Blood of Saryn.<br />
Bane.<br />
Anathema.<br />
Epic.<br />
Petrifying Earth.<br />
Then refresh Blood, Bane, Anathema, and Epic as they drop they way you have been doing.  Work out the last 10% of the mobs health as exactly as you can, so you aren't wasting mana on 2-3 dots that are only running to half duration when the mob drops.  When I'm paying attention, the mob dies to the last few ticks of my epic DoT w/ all other DoT's worn off.  This also lets you use dogdog to help finish a mob off if he's running away at low health.  Pet /hold helps dogdog from getting whacked if you get clipped once or twice during root/rotting.<br />
<br />
Time your CanniV &amp; do as much of your active regen during battle as you can.  <br />
<br />
Remember that downtime is to be expected when soloing in Tactics until your gear and manapool grow some.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo there and never have downtime. I do always make it a habit to get KEI first though. <br />
<br />
Now, against the Diaku's, it does take me 5-6 mins to take a mob down though that's without Bane (Coincidentally I'll be getting it tonight, just need one more win)<br />
<br />
My method is pull with MD, then root with PE.<br />
<br />
Malos<br />
Turgurs<br />
Epic<br />
BoU<br />
BoS<br />
<br />
And keep re-applying BoS and Epic as needed. I'll usually have to re-apply one more BoU at 50%.<br />
<br />
I don't bother with Pox, BoN since they can break root.<br />
<br />
I just Cann in between casts and save VP3 for when root breaks and the mobs is in my face. <br />
<br />
When the mob goes down I'm usually around 80-90% mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">anything that isn't slow midigated i tank down there (while i dot, bane, anath, epic, ancient scourge)...can use the dog and quiesance keeps up with the mobs dps...then again i am full defencive AAs and ft 15.<br />
<br />
zaviax, <br />
when you get bane you will see your solo times drop tremendously.  that spell puts out so much more dps than any of our other dots, it is sick.  i think my best crit on bane was over 1100 (pritty sure you can get higher), and my best run was 3 crits all over 900 in 1 cast of bane.  even base dps is sick with bane.  i suggest you get anath too, it puts out very respectable dps and is usable in groups situations in conjuctoin with bane.  stacking the 2 curse dots with another dot or 2 and you can take hoh and tactics mobs down so fast it's unreal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wribit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the feedback, I tried Zaviax's method, and it works well.  I'll be using that until I get the AA's to try your method Galelor.  1100 crit on a DoT...all I can say is WOW!  I'm finishing up on VP, then going to do Critical Affliction.  Hopefully then I can notice a difference.  Also gonna work on getting FT up, only FT7 atm.  Well, thanks again for all the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got Bane recently and went back did the same solo method I said above only this time adding in Bane a few times.<br />
<br />
I only need to cast BoU once now and the mobs go down about 2 mins + quicker. I end the battles around 70-80% now too.<br />
<br />
Didn't think I'd like Bane that much, now I wish I got it much sooner. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Incidently, Zaviax's method is also very close to the method used in PoFire.  <br />
Root rot is very effective with a good method.</div></div><hr />
