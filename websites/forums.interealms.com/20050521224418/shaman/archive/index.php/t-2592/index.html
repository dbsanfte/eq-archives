<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">last time i saw them for sale..they were 19k....<br />
<br />
worth more then a JBB?  not worth it.<br />
<br />
but if yer in for the look..go for it.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the new high end smithing changes, there are actually some nice player-made leggings available.<br />
<br />
For instance, the stats on Artificer's Ringmail Leggings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12476) are pretty comparable:<br />
<br />
JB legs:  AC 24, +8 Wis, +75 Mana, +8 Str, +8 Dex, right-click Health, Wt 7.5<br />
AR legs: AC 22, +5 Wis, +40 Mana, +40 HP, +10 Str, Wt 3<br />
<br />
AR legs are Barbarian/Tribunal only, but there equivalents for other races, too.<br />
<br />
Since the smithed stuff is still new, prices vary widely.  On a thread here I saw someone got a set for just under 15k.  I asked around last night and was given a quote of 30k.  At 15k, I think they're worth it (I could sell my existing legs to pay for most of it.)<br />
<br />
On Karana, JB legs go for between 20-30k, but they don't come up very often... and there are a few people always flooding the trade channel with &quot;WTB JB legs!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's always the option of going with xxxxdragonleg breeches.  Bagged the 23 ac 10 dex 6 sta ones for 8500...<br />
<br />
Then again, that kinda kills the idea of having a full set of JB for the look, I suppose....<br />
