good read... long read...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read that whole thing including the intro on gamers. Too funny.<br />
<br />
Some of the classes sound interesting. The PvE sounds as if it is going to be fast paced and not a med fest. Hopefully PvE will have more of an EQ feel and less of a DAOC feel if those are the only two options.<br />
<br />
Interesting philospohy: If a class is underutilized, they will upgrade the class and not nerf others. The emphasis on 'FUN' something I think Sony has lost sight of.<br />
<br />
Huge emphasis on storage. What in the world are people going to be collecting? Even craftizons isn't this storage - intensive afaIk.<br />
<br />
Very much looking forward to trying this one out, and I haven't said that about DAOC, AO, AC, Craftizons or any other. (Course the game based on Asgardian gods looks interesting too)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds about right - go Blizzard! :)<br />
someone pass me a margarita...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pff WoW giving people what they want to hear. Sure WoW will have new ideas, sure they claim now they will never nerf things but its marketing. Admittedly though I do hold high hope for WoW, and hope gameplay is a big factor over the treadmill and timesinks related to eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I doubt that they can hold the 'no nerf' rule either but I liked what I read. I had high hopes that Blizzard would get the 'fun factor' right and I think that post doesn't do anything to make me think otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea, im getting very exciting about the shaman and the hunter class. even the enchanter/healer ( priest ) class sound fun. I like how they are going to make it so you dont have to group either, that ALL classes will be able to solo to max level. Good call there. Also, quests are a large portion of your exp if you want, so according to them atleast, if your sick of level grinding you can do quests to mix it up and gain exp.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a game with depth but not so much you have to give your life up to play it. Right up my alley :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guess on lots of storage space is items take up more than one slot in storage..anyone that has played diablo2 (and maybe diablo, i forget) will know that certain items take up more inventory space than others, which is a little more realistic than eq.  Although realism isn't always practical.  Just a random thought, but in EQ you could potentially carry ~80 fine steel breastplates (and if you were sow'd) move around slowly.<br />
<br />
I hope WoW turns out to be the great game people are thinking it will be.  Until then, I'll be playing EQ, because there simply isn't better out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Worries about guild dominance of a server are unfounded. The best mobs are in instanced areas of a dungeon; if an uberguild is raiding the ubermobs, your group can do it, too, with no interference. The same is true of major quest mobs – they all appear in instanced areas of the world. <br />
<br />
It seems like this one thing alone will remove 90% of the complaints with current high level content in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cant believ EQ hasnt addressed this yet, just doing trak for me is still fun, but how often do you find him up?<br />
