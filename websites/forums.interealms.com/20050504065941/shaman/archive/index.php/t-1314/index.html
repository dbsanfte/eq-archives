<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpeabear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just saw a message welcoming the latest member to the Shaman's Crucible. <br />
Big question is, is it really him? And can we ask you questions pertinent to shaman, or is it more a case-by-case thing?<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds want to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, considering the ip constains: (removed) station.sony.com, I'd say there is a good chance.  Jeez, guess I better get off my arse and finish the spell list.  Personally I'd assume he doesn't want to be bugged unless I hear different  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure many Verant employees read various message boards such as this one, the safehouse, and probably even flamevault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000555.html<br />
<br />
I think perhaps this is in regard to showing some more presence on the class message boards, which he talked about in the post about petitions.<br />
<br />
&quot;That being said, I plan to post more on message boards. But you should expect one-shot posts, not lengthy discussions. That’s really the only way that I know of to avoid the clamor for attention that can really ruin some of the communities that the fan sites have built. I know that as a team we get a lot from sneaking through these communities and seeing how people think when they don’t know we’re watching.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I don't think we've seen any offical posts from verant employees on the shaman's crusible I have no doubt that we have had high lvl people who read here before and it wouldn't surpise me at all if that was absor who created the account. Safehouse and gaffe's wizards site both have occational posts by people in verant and like henora quoted it's basically one line answers or quick explainations and never debating a topic.<br />
<br />
Heck they obviously read large guilds pages like Triton, FoH and legacy of steel when they impliment changes based on the rants from the posters on thier front pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I forsee posts like:<br />
<br />
ABSOR IKSAR NEED JBB! PLZ READ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">try not to harass him too much guys.  its pretty cool that we have an actual verant employee here who reads our posts...seeing as in the past it really seemed that VI was oblivious to our class issues.  it would be nice if we could avoid the attention-whoring that went on at the old everquest message boards.  having said that, please absor do not hesitate to chime in ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was really impressed with Absor at the Seattle Fan Faire.  I was at the &quot;community discussion&quot; forum, he was all alone in a room full of semi hostile, mostly whiney, die hard, rabid EQ players.  He didn't always give people the answers they wanted, but he kept his cool the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's good to see that Verant still listens to what the gamers have to say once in a while. If you read the Gamespot interview about EQ2, there stance on banking has already gone back to &quot;in testing&quot; based on the backlash from the boards :)<br />
It's simple really; companies with an existing product release information about upcoming products, then troll through the backlash that is sure to follow about the upcoming product. :D<br />
/hug Absor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My only thoughts are, if you're goiing to Troll, er scroll through these boards anonymously, looking for threads as players Beta Test your product - <br />
<br />
Wouldn't you create a less obvious account name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If indeed it is the real Absor, im sure he will be welcomed with loving arms (chuckle) .  I think its interesting to say the least. Maybe someday changes will be made to the shaman class through reading these boards. <br />
<br />
BTW ignore the Jbb comment from above. Not all Iksar want one, I for one have no need for it, yet am disgruntled about the Last cudgel quest. That effect is a smack in the face if ya ask me. <br />
<br />
Welcome To The Crucible  Absor ... LOL!</div></div><hr />
