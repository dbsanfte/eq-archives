<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When thinking about shaman spell, first thing that comes to your mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say the combination of Cann (especially Can IV and V) and torpor make shaman pretty unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is cannibalizing that makes us unique, in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
I thought hard on the slows, but ... enchanters have slows very similar (I do not personally get upset  about slows on items - not all that many around).  It is the constant refresh of the mana pool with cannibalize that  makes me a shaman - or an addict to the &quot;4&quot; key (yep, that's my hotkey for canni).<br />
<br />
Torpor and malo are not even possible before level 60, so I don't see how they can be &quot;class defining&quot; are you not a shaman until 60?  or until 60 AND with torpor?  then a lot of us on these boards should stop posting!<br />
<br />
of course, I do see some posts in which &quot;peak of the class's abilities&quot; is confused with &quot;class defining.&quot;  But all that I have learned, here and in game, has not been geared to torpor (or malo or avatar - remember the threads on how avatar was a bust as a &quot;class defining&quot; spell?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Making mana is all well and good, but you need to do something with it too...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Class-defining doesn't mean unique, as a lot of people here mistakenly seem to assume.<br />
<br />
Here's a rundown of non-unique and yet class-defining spells/abilities that illustrate my point:<br />
<br />
Clerics: heals (I know complete heal is unique. Everyone knows that. But heals per se are not.)<br />
Monks: FD<br />
Enchanters: mez (both bards &amp; necros have this)<br />
Wizards: nukes<br />
<br />
There are many more examples, but my point is that class-defining doesn't have to be unique. A class simply has to be the best at something.<br />
<br />
I mean, what's the last time a raid leader said &quot;WAIT! We can't go yet - we need a shammie for his ability to cannibalize!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cannibalizing makes us unique<br />
<br />
but slowing I think is our class defining deal.<br />
<br />
there is way too much overlapping of classes in EQ, in my opinion.  For example, I think people think of shaman as the &quot;slowers&quot; of eq.  However, enchanters can do it very well also...beastlords, bards and even necros can slow too.<br />
<br />
Torpor is powerful, but not quite unique.  Clerics do have celestial elixir and druids have their longer duration heal over time spell.<br />
<br />
Monks, SKs, Necros and some lucky shaman with a rare PoA quest ring can FD too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Too bad I can't click them all.<br />
<br />
What makes me  a shaman is the fact that I can do dang near any job there is out there.  I may have to spend some plat to do it, but I can do it.<br />
<br />
I can tank, buff, slow, heal, dot, nuke, and even provide limited versions of clarity.  With due preparation I can instantly CH myself for about 500p (and a few hrs farming before that), and a tank for about 1k (and a few more hours).<br />
<br />
How many classes can still solo a yellow at 53, and be ready for another pull immediately after?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Malo because it is what make us useful on raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A class defining skill cannot be something that is achieved only at 60(aka torpor).<br />
<br />
A class defining skill is something that has been the job of our clas in both groups and solo.<br />
<br />
We slow, thats what we do, thats what we are here to do.  Shamans are the MAIN SLOWERS in raids, not main dotters etc.<br />
-<br />
necros dot<br />
wizzys nuke<br />
clerics heal<br />
chanters mez<br />
bards kinda everything<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no class defining spell for the shaman class.<br />
<br />
None.  <br />
<br />
Spirit of Wolf is shared by both druids and rangers.  People don't recognize a shaman because of Spirit of Wolf.  They don't ask shamans to raids for Spirit of Wolf.  <br />
<br />
Cannibalization is a unique ability, but it doesn't define the shaman class.  As someone else mentioned, raid leaders don't say &quot;lets make sure we have shamans to cannibalize.&quot;  Exp groups don't look for shamans because they can convert hit points to mana.<br />
<br />
Insects line (togors, turgurs, etc) is the closest the shaman class has to a defining spell, but this ability is shared with enchanters.<br />
<br />
Torpor is an end game spell.  Class defining abilities do not exclude the entire game to just level 60.  Not every shaman even has Torpor to begin with.  Besides, shamans aren't recognized for a great ability to heal anyway.<br />
<br />
Malo is strong, but it doesn't define the class.  Not only do mages have a similar spell (mala), but Malo isn't required for all aspects of EverQuest.  It helps, but it isnt what makes a shaman a shaman.<br />
<br />
The pet is certainly not a class defining ability.  Two words:  Mages, Necros.<br />
<br />
Buffs are a central ability to the class and one of the things people know shamans best for.  They're probably the closest thing that shamans have to a class defining spell ability, but most don't recognize casting buffs as their main vocation.<br />
<br />
Heal is the cleric class defining ability.<br />
<br />
Damage over Time spells are shared with Necromancers, who actually have more spell lines and thus better damage output with DoT spells.<br />
<br />
Clicky items aren't unique, every class has clicky items.   Also, not everyone has all the clicky items.<br />
<br />
The shaman class is a generalist class.  We can deal damage, heal, debuff, buff, cast a pet, do some crowd control and look sexy doing it.  There isn't a single ability that we have that is clearly &quot;class defining.&quot;  The thing is, when someone mentions shamans, people get different ideas about what they do.  The most common, of course, are Slowing (debuffing) and Buffing.  The responses on this thread are an indication that the class doesn't have a single class defining spell..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Making mana is all well and good, but you need to do something with it too... <br />
<br />
Not making mana for us, making mana for other people.  Torpor + mod rod 2 = nearly endless mana for clerics/casters during battles that last 20+ minutes.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's a big paradigm shift to go from the idea that it only takes one shaman on a raid to land that big slow to the idea that multiple shaman grouped with clerics/casters and doing the much less glamorous task of making sure others have mana to finish a fight, but if it gives my guild an edge to win, I embrace this ability.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I put clicky because I skimmed over it fast and missed the canni and slow options... But if I was paying attention I would have said slow.  Canni is a VERY close second. When I get 60 I may change my mind on alot of this. :) Canni 5 and torpor might make me sway a different way. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I put torpor though slow is on par with it.  I choose it cause it drasticly changes the shaman class, the level of dificuty u can do is crazy.  i hit 60 scribed torpor and have never played a shaman the same since, that sure is class defining imo.<br />
<br />
But slows are just about as class defining, but well i guess the reason i choose torpor is u see the imidiate change when u scribe the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree, what makes us unique is the inability to run out of mana. There's never a need to wait for the Shaman to be FM. It's also what we're doing all our life (well starting from lvl 24). It becomes more powerful as we level, incredibly powerful at lvl 60 with torpor and tops with Canni V and Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Slow is our defining spell line. People look for Shaman for a group mainly based on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">To me its a combination of <br />
<br />
Cann IV <br />
Torpor<br />
Malo<br />
Focus (For the additional hitpoints it provides the MT)<br />
<br />
Those are the spells that make a shaman desired and enhances our ability to slow, heal, buff, etc.  Don't get me wrong saying you need to be 60 to be desired..  there are lesser versions of each of the spells cept Malo. Fungi = torpor replacement till 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You know.. If it was a year or so ago, I bet Bufffs will be on top of the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I had a nice little post written up but realized it all boils down to this:<br />
<br />
Shamans define our class with Cannibalize, and our ability to recover massive amounts of mana.<br />
<br />
Non-Shamans define our class with Slows (and Buffs a close second) because that's what we bring to the raid or group.  <br />
<br />
It makes sense if you ruminate on it a bit.<br />
<br />
I can't ever remember a groupmember saying 'Wow, nice canni!'.  But we (shamans) all know its the Cannibalize that lets us slow every mob, plus buff, and heal, and all the other things that (subtly) save the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I voted Buffs (HAHAHA) because everytime I get into XP grind mode, people don't stop pestering me for &quot;shammy buffies&quot;, &quot;shammie goodies&quot;, &quot;shammy buffz&quot;, &quot;buffies&quot;, &quot;buffs&quot;. Even though they don't realize that 90% of our buffs are crap. In most players' eyes a shaman is nothing more than a buffwhore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd say<br />
-slow<br />
-malo<br />
-torpor<br />
-canni<br />
in that order, from class defining to whole raids to selfish spells ;)<br />
we couldn't miss any of them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'll look at it this way: if you were to take away one spell and it made Shamans undesireable moreso than taking away any of the other spells, then that makes it our class defining spell.  Let's include the life of a Shaman post 50, as below that is just..meh.<br />
<br />
Taking all that into consideration, our class defining spell is Turgur's Insects.  If you take away our buffs, we can still slow.  If you take away Malo, we can still slow (/wave Mage Mala), if you take away Torpor, we can still slow.  If you take away our slow, then that leaves it up to the Enchanter(s).  And let's face it, it is not a good idea to make an Enchanter tash + slow everything, although it certainly can be done, but you'll be ressing that Enchanter a lot more than if you had a Shaman along slowing stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I voted for slows :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Depends on the level of the player, as well.  Up until 30s their view of a shaman would be buffs first, then healing.   By late 30s and early 40s we're still buffs but they're now starting to see our slows take effect.<br />
<br />
Getting into the 50s the casters know us for slows, backup healing and HP buffs but Tanks are starting to really respect our slows and then our buffs.<br />
<br />
60s - conjecture because I'm not there yet - but I'm pretty sure they know the main points of a shaman by now.  We're there to slow the mob first and formost, then do some healing.  The buffs are nice but high end mobs will eat you, buffs or not, unless it is slowed.  Oh, we wince non-stop, too.<br />
<br />
Slows, we're best at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My vote is not for any spells, but rather our ability to wear armour and our total hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Translation - we are offensive casters who take an immense beating.  Ya chanters get slow - why don't they cast it?  Cast - SPLAT!  Clerics can wear plate, but what are they going to do?  Stand there and heal themselves until they die?  You get the idea.  If not for our AC and hitpoints, we'd quite frankly suck...<br />

<br />
one more thing<br />
<br />
Your basicly saying that your voting for canni here.<br />
<br />
The only reason we wear AC/HP gear is cause of canni.  If we didnt have Canni, alot of shammys would be GEB'dup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just take a look at what Shamans do most on a raid that affects and is visible by others:<br />
<br />
-Buff.<br />
-Debuff (Slow.)<br />
-Backup Healing.<br />
<br />
And that is what defines our class! Those three functions all being done quite well. Cannibalize is, as said above, a unique ability. It really doesn't &quot;define&quot; us to other classes.<br />
<br />
You want a REAL challenge? Try defining a Mage. [:p]</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS Shaman are WAY cooler than mages imho - very glad I switched mains :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's the slows!!!<br />
<br />
Sure... Canni, Torpor and Malo are nice but think for a second about that. You canni so you have mana for slows. You Torpor so you have mana for slows. You malo so you can land your slows.<br />
<br />
If you weren't slowing... what exactly would you be doing? Stat buffs???<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice that all the slowing classes get a method for regenerating their mana faster (aside from BSTs but their slows are about 50m a piece so as if it even matters).</div></div><hr />
