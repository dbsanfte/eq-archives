<br />
Greetings Everyone<br />
<br />
Well I had some time this week and noticed that there wasnt really alot of sites that give information for us shamans...so I decided to make an ezboard type site for shamans! Now bear with me as I just started it today, but please feel free to come and post any information regarding playing the shaman class on it.<br />
<br />
It can be found here Shamans Unite (pub151.ezboard.com/bshamansunite) and I hope that in the future we can all use it for a reference page if needed<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Not flaming, just found it humorous that there &quot;wasn't really lot of sites that give information for us shamans&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well luck to her =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you have to give her credit for one thing:<br />
<br />
She didn't call it &quot;Shaman Unite&quot; or &quot;Shamen Unite.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol... there seems to be some resentment for us Cruciblers on the few shaman that post on that site.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the Crucible has been around and is regarded as &quot;The Authority&quot; on shaman, but it's full of stubborn players who don't respect you unless you are 65 with 100+ AA, epic, JBB, and play the way they do. Don't get me wrong thought, alot of nice advice there if you are willing to wade through the [explicative]. <br />
<br />
It doesnt really seem that bad around here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait till they get the ezboard bill if that board becomes even remotely popular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol... there seems to be some resentment for us Cruciblers on the few shaman that post on that site.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesnt really seem that bad around here...<br />
 <br />
/shrug.  what that poster said is true.<br />
<br />
Look at the response people get when they post thier magelo and they are dressed like a druid.  They get derided and called &quot;newb&quot; &quot;idiot&quot; and other less kind names.  How you equip your shaman is a matter of personal preference, yet most of the people here see only one route to equiping the shaman (The HP/sta/ac way).  (Not that I disagree with that; I dress my shaman as tankish as I can...)<br />
<br />
For some folks that attitude is too much and they dont return.  <br />
<br />
GL with the site, hope it works out well for ya.  I'll stay here, thanks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, sure, it's preference.<br />
<br />
But you can prefer to put all your Warrior's points in CHA and dress in cloth.  Nobody will stop you, but it doesn't mean it's a particularly good way to go in a game where other people's enjoyment is often dependant on your ability to play at an adequate level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats a general problem with all class message boards.<br />
<br />
Only fairly hard-core players are willing to spend the time to bother with them, and those are the sorts of players that are going to be 60+/lots of AAs.  Plus, at lower levels, the game is easy enough that there isn't as much of a benefit to tweaking the finer points of play.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would rate this board in about the middle: slightly less informative/useful than the safehouse and steel warriors, but far, far more civil than monkly-business, but I don't have experience with ranger's glade or the druid board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been around quite a while and seen this board grow and evolve.<br />
<br />
I personally like it here and to me, this *IS* the shaman boards, but when I posted that on the shaman unite board, I got a &quot;stern&quot; talking-to about it from posters there.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm not one to worry much either way about what folks post on message boards.  I just think it's better to have a united front than little splinter groups... and if they wanna post here, that's fine, there - that's fine too ... so long as they know there *IS* a true and existant shaman's board ... and from the initial post, it almost sounds like the person making that one didn't realize there was one...  plus I just dunno about boards that one person starts, then starts spamming everywhere trying to get folks to use it.  That always sets off the warning bells with me...<br />
<br />
They're trying to set up a channel too, and I again pointed 'em to crucible:crucible -- we'll see how that works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The fine advice you'll get over yonder:<br />
<br />
jbb sucks donkey balls  <br />
why in the world would you wanna cast a 263dmg nuke that takes 8 sec to cast, even if it is mana free...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, for the JBB it's really very situational and dependant on level, where you're hunting, etc.<br />
<br />
While I disagree with a blanket statement like the above, I do believe that a JBB is very limited in it's usefulness past lvl 60 (provided you have torpor), and even more limited as you approach lvl 65 and quiescience, blood of saryn, and mobs that will slaughter you 4 hits if root breaks.<br />
<br />
I sold mine at 62 and haven't missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hm.. well i looked around and its basically castersrealm (i.e. lots of bad information)  My favorite being listing the wrong stats on epic...someone pointed out half the mistake there but missed the rest :).<br />
<br />
I like how &quot;crucible is hard to navigate&quot;..spoken like a true &quot;which race should i be&quot; poster who cant seem to find the search button &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speaking of &lt;a href = &quot;http://pub151.ezboard.com/fshamansunitefrm16.showMessage?topicID=17.topic&quot;&gt;which race should I be.....&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hichar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Notice how about half the threads on that new board also have been started by the board owner?  Quiet bunch of people over there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets kill these Shamenzes untie people.... they all sound like weak drumans anyways, we'll just poke them with sticks until they cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't agree with your perspective there Coraz - or with calling folks Drumans, etc.<br />
<br />
The only issue I have with that site, is that originally, the crucible was made as a place where shaman could come together and have one centralized point of reference and gathering area for everyone who played a shaman.  And we were about the only class that really did that.<br />
<br />
But what have we become if another group feels so profoundly that they're not welcome here and feels like they need to go make another site for the &quot;other&quot; shaman to go and talk.<br />
<br />
I'm not into this us vs. them stuff.  I want what we originally set out to do, and that's make ONE central repository for shaman, both in game, and on the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This board has been here a long time and in that time pretty much every topic that can have ever been discussed about shamans has been covered.<br />
<br />
The seeming lack of patience on this site is merely from the fact that a little searching on the posters part would answer 90% of the questions that have ever been posted.<br />
<br />
And if I see a magelo and thier dressed like a druid I'm gonna say something. Better me in this forum than getting your ass kicked in BoT cause you have 255 wis and only 1600 hps unbuffed. Plus by the end game most of the people you group with know what every class does and how it should be done for the most part.  If they see a sham in leather they will say something, ask a guild sham about the leather shaman thier grouping with and after they finish laughing, dump em and get a shaman who can take it in teh face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, notice the advertisements on the site?  EQ Plat and Items Cheap?<br />
<br />
This supposed &quot;shamans&quot; board is nothing more than some schmuck looking to generate some traffic for their ebay site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, I agree there, Wally on the HP issue, but sometimes it's best to let folks learn on their own if they're not asking for that advice.  If someone's asking advice on gearing, it's one thing, and they should be willing to listen to the advice folks who've been there and done that have to offer, but even then, I don't think it's right to use derogitory names or attitudes towards those folks.  It's just better IMO to offer advice and be friendly about it than to belittle someone for their choices so far.<br />
<br />
And if they don't want to listen and don't mind dying repeatedly - they'll start to figure out something's wrong and come to those decisions the hard way.  In the end, it all works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This board has a tendancy to eat its young from time to time. If you happen to ask an often discussed question on a day when one of the &quot;old school&quot; people are having a bad day, you're probably not going to be back. For new people, ones who don't know how Shaman evolved from wearing Wis gear to AC/HP stuff or why the JBB isn't the end all be all (when an Iksar asks about it ;)), the out right hostility that can greet them here is rather pointless, they don't know why they're being attacked. <br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm glad I wasn't flamed for asking something that was already asked. I probably wouldn't have stuck around, questioned how I played the game and turned into a good Shaman. Its sad that new players aren't given the same oppertunity because they didn't search properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Better me in this forum than getting your ass kicked in BoT cause you have 255 wis and only 1600 hps unbuffed.

<br />
I think that is part of the issue, there's a whole lot of game between rolling up your char and the end game. There are plenty of shaman out there who haven't seen the 'end game' from 2 expansions ago and aren't off soloing in teh face til 60 on their 5th alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I find it hard to believe that a new forum for shaman can thrive at this point, but i wish her the best of luck and will check in from time to time. I fresh enviroment is a good thing and who knows, it might take off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, she probably is making most the topics to get the ball rolling, i mean you cant just put up a forum and expect people to apear, cut her some slack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I'll be checking it. Judging by the response of posters here, I can't blame them at all for wanting a more hospitable home at times.<br />
<br />
A lot of the time the response to an answered question here is to post the search button, which I've never understood. If a question has been answered before, so what? Don't respond. Nothing forces you to. If I see a thread with the same question as thread below it, I ignore it. If I feel I have something to add anyway, I'll post. Either way it's hardly something that should create a vitriolic response.<br />
<br />
Question: Which class/race combo is best?<br />
<br />
Response: It doesn't matter you freakin idiot. Hail a dead horse. Use the search button, it's not hard. Etc etc...<br />
<br />
While the information here can be exceptional, and there are plenty of people here who go out of their way to improve the game for everyone (parsing, quest walkthroughs, zone information etc), there's also a seed of people who've become so bored with it all that the only fun they seem to have is by making a younger, less knowledgable shaman feel stupid for daring to ask a rudimentary question.<br />
<br />
I'm very appreciative of this place. My understanding of my character has grown 10 fold since I've started reading here. It's my first stop for anything Shaman related, and I hope it will be for the rest of my time playing EQ. But god forbid I should ask a question that has been asked before. I'll get attacked.<br />
<br />
Last point: the search feature here isn't very good, however you cut it. 4 letter minimum and only one search every 60 seconds. It's not like there's no room for improvement.<br />

Oh, come on. There are very rare occasions, when some grumpy old schooler let's off a bit steam and some poster with question_asked_537_times_before gets in the way. Since i started lurking this board, there were TOTAL maybe one or two threads, where a regular really got off on some new poster (and i don't condone that in any way).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when someone comes to a messageboard and can't stand a joke or two or a bit 'constructive' criticism, maybe posting on the internet isn't his/her thing.<br />
<br />
This board is one of the most civil EQ boards you will find (in my opinion only EQ druids and rangers glade are more 'tree hugging'  :D ).<br />
<br />
Is this board becoming to 60+ heavy? Maybe. Is it a solution to split off newer players and ignore the knowledge of the more experienced ones, because you fear to read a snotty remark here and there? No, don't think so.<br />
<br />

I can understand how this board and its populace can be intimidating to newer posters, especially ones who would be asking the proverbial 'stupid question', however playing the shaman class often requires a thick skin just as much as participating in this board does.</div></div><hr />

     ive had that happen to me many times.  just wait till you do the rathe council with 2 shaman  :p   wanna talk about suck  i had to put a afk msg saying dont ask for buffs unless your a tank or something of that sort and be in Fing range.  2 nights ago we did RC  with 4 freaking shaman  for backflagging......  i was soo relived it went very smoothly.  i usualy got stressed out when the clerics saw their tanks drop faster and faster and they say &quot;slow mine its not slowed&quot;  you say in gc &quot;**** off i know how to play my class&quot;   thats how bad it was one night heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
This board, and a mentor shaman of mine, have taught me a lot.  I've still got a ways to go.  Working on upgrading gear, have a little more than 6k in the bank (more than I've EVER had in my life on any character)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dunno, I came here after playing my shaman for little over a month, so I was probably in the upper teens or so.  And while the info was already geared toward &quot;high-level&quot; players (read: 40+ since this was in late '99) I always felt that the info was either relevant to me, notable for future use, or skippable.  Sure, I didn't need to know the precise optimal buff order for Vox, but knowing that someone had put some thought into one became handy later when the matter came up.<br />
<br />
Since then I've TRIED to at least be moderately helpful in giving the short-answer reply along with &quot;and say, check the search function, or maybe that OTHER thread on the main page with the identical title,&quot; but come on, you have to hope that people will have at least the good sense of thinking:<br />
<br />
1. Hey, is this already being covered here on the front page?<br />
and<br />
2. Is this such an obvious question that it MUST have come up before, for a lot of people?<br />
<br />
And that goes for ANY topical forum.  The thing that comes to mind to help is probably to work on that FAQ, I think I'll go over it today to see if I can contribute anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The title of the other board is rather presumptuous in my opinion, and I don't see it surviving a year, but good luck to them.  I'll probably make a few posts when I notice mistakes or to give the shaman browsing their better resources.<br />
<br />
This is THE place to get information for our class.  EQshaman.com (which was a fair site at one time, but didn't keep up or update often &amp; has since sold out to the mysupersales guy) links their forums to here for good reason.<br />

<br />
player_01 says, &quot;Wow there's a level 60 oracle online... that must be a shaman.&quot;<br />

Heck, I remember the first time I saw someone had hit lvl 50.  I was impressed then.  I also remember taking my ogre shaman (on Xegony at the time), into the great uncharted wilderness of Greater Faydark and at how long and arduous the journey was to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Yep, I leveled Rorgg in Crushbone from 9 to 14.<br />
<br />
I didn't know it would cause Neriak-problems eventually (oh well) but because of it I'm not KOS in Kelethin or Kaladim, and until I hunted PoG I could also go into Felwithe.<br />
<br />
Everyone would just be stunned at the ogre.  It was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yep, back then, that was part of the mystique of being an ogre ... I'd be in GFay and running up to the PoD lift to buff folks and everyone would just flip out.<br />
<br />
I even had aspirations that I would become &quot;Ciccero the Crushbone Ogre&quot; ... and my EQ goal was to level to 40ish or so and then stand at crushbone buffing folks and killing the trains when folks trained D'Vinn or the Emperor to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I remember spending time, reading the boards and getting an idea of things. It must have been about 3 months, before I dared even open my mouth on Anything.<br />
<br />
I didn't expect people to drop everything and cater to me, and answer my questions. Game and world didn't revolve around me. I read, I looked, I wanted to make intellegent comments, so I learned.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chinese Proverb (actually probably alot more recent but sounds better this way)<br />
&quot;Remain silent, and let others merely question your intellect. Open your mouth and remove all doubt&quot;<br />
<br />
It's truely amazing what someone can learn, by just watching what goes on between other people...just don't watch to closely, cause those pesky stalking laws get brought up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I took over my shammy from a friend when he was 51. The friend had stripped him so I geared him up the best I could, and having played a druid he had alot of leather. First time I zoned into Poi aaan older wiser shammy inspected me and politely sent me a tell, kinda laughing about how he had once looked like I did and good luck getting better gear. I eventually got some money together and started reading the crucible religously, and now my shammy is 55 with 2k hps and over 900 ac, with only 163 wisdom. Hes alot more uber than he was with 200 wisdom and 750 ac with 1200 hps. I owe alot of thanks to this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I like this board.<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm not 65 with 30 aa's.  I'm 51, no aa's, and I like to solo, and take things in my own time.  I enjoy all aspects of the game, tradeskilling, exploring, etc.  No one has flamed me for it, or as far as I see, treated my any worse on the rare occasions I post.<br />
<br />
This board, and a mentor shaman of mine, have taught me a lot.  I've still got a ways to go.  Working on upgrading gear, have a little more than 6k in the bank (more than I've EVER had in my life on any character)...<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm saying I'll stay here.  And thanks to all of you.<br />
<br />
You must have been missed, sorry.  :(  Please start a new thread and we'll start your welcome flame.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">How you equip your shaman is a matter of personal preference, yet most of the people here see only one route to equiping the shaman (The HP/sta/ac way).<br />
Why do some people keep insisting that going for pure WIS is a viable gear path? I'm only level 41, but I can't stand it when I see a Shaman decked out in Druid gear. You don't have to be 65 with tons of AA's and Epic to get frustrated with Shamans who don't take five seconds to browse The Crucible and find out what the recommended route for Shaman gear is around here.<br />
<br />
When I started playing my Shaman, I came to these boards and didn't post hardly anything at all (I still don't :) ). I went through threads and read to see if my questions had possibly been answered already, that way I didn't make a redundant post. I expect the same of others who visit these boards. Read up a little and learn something instead of rushing in and opening your mouth because you're too lazy to do some research.<br />
