<br />
Once you have the container you have to kill a dragon. There is a huge dragon sitting outside the entrance to VP. Hail it, say &quot;I am ready&quot;. He tells you to go and activate the four portals.<br />
<br />
Send 4 people in your raid to the 4 portals around the zone and have them click at the same time. <br />
<br />
A named dragon appears somewhere in the zone. For us it was in the middle of the lava lake. Kill that, he drops 48 bloods.<br />
<br />
Combine the blood and the veeshans peak key that you didn't destroy in the container to get the new key.<br />
<br />
If you destroyed the key you have to get 3 essences instead.<br />
<br />
We didn't win because it was a pickup raid and we underestimated him. We had a little over 40 in it. He's really not hard, there are a couple of little things to know but its not tough. We will get him later.<br />

You can slow this dragon, he doesn't mitigate slow at all (remember to stand under his belly to cast).<br />
He has some DD AoE that strip 4 buff, a snare and some mega gravity flux (I crossed the lava lake in the air.. fun !).<br />
He also rampage (not sure if it's single, I was busy laughing from the Gflux thingy).<br />
I remember taking a round of rampage or 2. <br />
I m not sure of his max hit, but on me rampage was between 1k and 2k I think and looked like quadding /shrug.<br />
When he dies (he is perma rooted), a few chest pop behind him with the books inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What about those of us who havnt gotten there VP key?  Does this mean 50 hour lines on the Pained Soul camp now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">max hit on me is 1800 FYI<br />
<br />
<br />
Redchief you dont need to do the original quest. I beleive you need to came 4 essesnes in SF now, but they are ultra rare, so i dont know if its easier to do the old quest or not. Im sure its not though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NOTE: I have not personally done this quest, this info i got from The Nameless Tavern (http://www.namelesstavern.org)<br />
<br />
Two ways to get key:<br />
<br />
Key of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20884) + Brood Dragon Blood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69309) + Drained Cipher of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69310) = Cipher of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69312)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Essence of ? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69306) + Essence of Howling Stones (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69307) + Essence of ? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69308) + Brood Dragon Blood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69309) + Drained Cipher of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69310) = Cipher of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69312)<br />
<br />
1) Spawn Suled Dar`s Shade in Skyfire by clicking the four orbs in the zone at the same time.<br />
2) Kill him and loot one of 48 A Worn and Ancient Book (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69313).<br />
3) Give A Worn and Ancient Book (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69313) to Dry Sapara at the VP entrance for Brood Dragon Blood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69309)<br />
4) Do one of the combines listed above.<br />
<br />
Drained Cipher of Veeshan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69310) comes from an NPC southwest of the VP entrance.<br />
<br />
They say Suled Dar`s Shade hits for 1k, AE rampages and does AE Shock Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5159&amp;source=Live). It took a pickup raid 40 people to kill.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">got my new vp key today. the info listed above sounds 100% right...i did the dragon first, killed the wyverns, got the container, handed in the item from dragon and did the combine<br />
<br />
the vp key is a 30/30/30 aug that fits in all slots btw, much like the tipt augs.<br />
<br />
info bout the dragon:<br />
<br />
max hit of 1800, quads, fully slowable, AE is a 4 slot dispell, huge gflux, 1543pt AE (1543, weird number). he also AE ramps. our raid was fine for the AE, but ramp took out a lot of people. did him with 40 people ranging from elem to qvic, but we were heavy on the qvic side with a 11500 qvic SK tank. he 20kd to gflux at some point lol.<br />
<br />
anyways, that seems it. i don't know anything about the new quest, i just had my old key in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brihanna Iceravyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The 3 essences drop in Howling Stones, Seb and Chardok.  From what I gathered, the HS one drops of hexbones in HS, but never dropped for my group.  The seb essence drops from Echo of Sebilis who doesn't seem to be a static spawn...my guild had him pop in the lower jail area and just in front of Juggs.  The Chardok one drops from Echo of Chardok....guildies got him too, but they didn't say where.  The seb one hits in the 800's, the chardok one hits for less (500-600 I think) and I think he has a stun aoe, but I'm not 100% sure on that one.  The 3 essences apparently replace the old key when you do the combine in the box with the blood.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I finished the whole new VP key in one night, and other than the dragon I duo'd both echoes and hexbones in HS.<br />
<br />
<br />
 HS <br />
In HS, you have to get an essence of howling stones which drops from hexbone skeletons (what I have been hearing, and where I found mine ). These mainly spawn in the east wing of HS. It is a really rare drop and can take some hours of camping.<br />
<br />
If you are not familiar with HS, you have to either have a rogue or a master key to get into the east wing. If you don't ( like me ) you have to kill a sperm type mob and get a candle, then go camp the North wing until you get to the named and get a norent key from the named. The named who drops key is behind a locked door, and the key is a ground spawn somewhere in the wing. <br />
<br />
In the west wing, its the same thing-the name is behind a locked door. Find the key, go through the door and kill it and loot the key. Note, if you are at the portal and there is no named up, you have to kill the named PH and wait for a repop until the named spawns. <br />
<br />
Once your done with the west wing, you can go to the south wing which connects to the east wing. The mobs are gimp and die with my pet + a bane. I had a warrior along but he was doing more harm than good ( stepping on rugs, bringing 30 mob trains... even died once when he fell off rug  :mad: )<br />
<br />
 Dont step on the rugs, if you do you are dropped out of the wing ( with a possible 20k fall ) and you have to follow the path to get back to the entrance. <br />
<br />
I got mine after about 15 hexbones, but people have reported killing 100 or more before getting one. So this is rather rare.<br />
<br />
Thanks to lanys.luvly for the extensive help he gave me in tells about HS  ;) <br />
<br />
 Chardok  <br />
<br />
<br />
In chardok the echo of chardok spawned for me right inside the castle past the bridge and elite guards. It was a 2k AE and a stun, and also hits 700s. The AE is very nasty because while your healer is stunned, it can kill your tank. Warrior went down at 10% ( I was 2boxing tank and cleric was with us ) but I didnt have problems tanking it from 10% (making me think that a  melee with good gear could). I also heard a monk can pull this to zone.<br />
<br />
Clearing to the mob took around half an hour, but would not pose a problem to anyone who is ally to chardok. The warrior solod all the mobs on the way there. If you are not that well equipped, be careful of trains as in some areas the mobs are relatively well packed together. <br />
<br />
Edit : Echo of Chardok - DPS on warrior with 2250 AC is 301 when slightly slowed. It had approximately 50khp, and low AC since warrior did 251 DPS on it (used fellstrike somewhere in there). Warrior took around 40k damage in the fight which lasted 3 minutes. He died at 9% or so and I took around 4k damage before it went down. Echo of Chardok is also indifferent until attacked, so its easy to clear the gimpy trash right up to it and then pull it.<br />
<br />
 Sebilis <br />
In sebilis the echo of sebilis spawned in lower jail, and is really easy to get to. This one is significantly easier. It has a 1500 point AE, but no stun. It may hit a little harder but without the stun its not hard to kill. <br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : Around 50khp on the sebilis essence, and again low AC as warrior did 271 DPS. Warrior took approximately 48k damage this fight, even though he was stonewall the whole fight ( I didn't use stonewall in chardok ). Be careful on this one. Echo of sebilis is also indifferent on spawn, so it is easy to kill the gimpy trash right up to it (I only had to kill 4 frogs I think) and then pull it.<br />
<br />
Once you get the 3 essences, and the brood dragon blood combine it in the drained cipher. The alternate quest cipher is only 15/15/15 compared to the 30/30/30 of doing the full quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So, by doing the new quest you end up w a 15/15/15 aug?  Wonder if it's possible to get both keys to VP.  Not that i have the time to do it, just wondering.</div></div><hr />

Keep us updated on what you find in there though :) <br />

Maybe while the main populace is distracted we can run into fear to get our two lower guild shaman some tears...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I saw some people in KC looking for essence last night:)  Guess they were confused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. East wing entrance door is not locked and it is possible to get directly to the East wing from center by climbing onto a fireport on the North or South platforms and levitating over to the East platform (you can't use the East stairs because they are nothing but an illusion). You might not be able to make the crossing if you have video lag or run slow. East is the highest level wing, BTW.</div></div><hr />

Yes, which also means Trak will likely be Perma-killed on most servers for a while. That 15 extra mana and hps on the key could save your life you know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hail,<br />

Trak on E. Marr at least has been uncontested last several days despite all the hoopla.  Took him out twice this week, and we weren't racing anyone.  I know a few classes can solo him (while we haven't yet), but a single shaman really makes that kill so much easier with Blood of Nadox, Talisman of Tribunal, and Quiescence. :) <br />
<br />
I got my tooth last night, helping some others get their piece. :D <br />
Now I have to work on those annoying camps I gave up on years ago!<br />
15hp/mana isn't a huge deal, but since I have the hard part done, may as well finish it. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Do pickup raids occur for these? Ive done all the quests i can and the vp old key for my 3 accounts. I'm not guilded right now ( though might actually be looking again). But do pickup raids ever occur for the SF Dragon/Shade to get the turn in for the blood? Ive been on this last part for who knows how long now and cant seem to find one on CT. <br />

The quest turn ins for the shoulder/shield/ear/belt is burning holes in my bags! lol.</div></div><hr />
