<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im very new to EQ (about 2 months) but have somehow managed to get my Shaman up to lvl 35 however I have just heard that are DoT stack. We get to lines of them Posion &amp; Disease, now at 35 my best of each are Scourge &amp; Envenomed Breath. Now I know I can cast both of these on a MOB however I was lead to belive that if I where to cast a weeker posion or disease (Like Tainted Breath) DoT on a MOB that already has my stongest 1 on it they would fail or if I cast a stronger 1 on top of a weeker 1 it would overight the weeker 1.<br />
<br />
Now Ive heard that they will all stack with each other, so I can have 2 posion and 1 disease (or more) on the same MOB. Can any1 confirm this please?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ALL shaman DoT's stack with each other, so all the spells below EB and Scourge will stack. I wouldn't bother with anything other than these 2 st your level, just stick with EB and scourge (at your level i only used scourge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok thanks man</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I have always just used my two best poison dots, as those are the ones that work the fastest.  It's really up to you though and what your goals are.  I remember back at 35 I was working hard at keeping up my melee and defense skills so prolonging fights was something I did quite a lot (having blown through level 14-24 in Paludal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always felt it was more situational based on the mobs I was fighting.  <br />
<br />
If they were low HP/High DPS I would go for two poison DoTs to kill them quick.  <br />
<br />
If they were High HP/Low DPS types I would use a poison/disease combo since the disease would last longer and do all of it's damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah my melee stats are ok I also raced from 18 - 25 In PC but I worked on them alot in HHK so Im happy to use DoT at the moment however I do like the idea of using to posion for Low HP mobs thanks for that</div></div><hr />
