<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im not sure how the exp for others may be or how it is compared to a group, but unless ya get a really good group i found an OK solo spot, not sure how well ya could do it but ill tell ya how i do it.<br />
(If this has already been brought up sorry)<br />
Firstly, you NEED kei/virtue, cause if you have been in planes alot you know how bad it is to get attacked after a resisted slow  ;) <br />
Secondly, Lots of mana/hp, cause these guys got bout 14k hp, so it can be up to 7-8 minutes long.  Pretty much root/rot, carful for adds, they are the end of ya until you zone, i was getting botu 1-2% per kill, pretty good for 54, but i do got my epic so it made it alot easier.  Give it a try, but you probably need lots of mana, Having tons of HP and bout 160 wisdom wont help ya here, cause Canni'ing is extremely hard. Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the tip. I was just checking out your magelo to see your gear in comparison to mine, to see if I was equipped enough to solo them too. Just curious as to why you are wearing bracelet of beauty? I'd say that's by far the worst of those bracelets, as what in the hell is a shaman (or just about anyone) gonna do with charisma lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehehe, get that all the time, only wear it cause i was selling my JBB for 18k, but the guy only had 15k, and he said the bracer would come with it.  Right now im saving every copper piece i can for some tae ew armor, but ill get a replacement once i get it :)</div></div><hr />
