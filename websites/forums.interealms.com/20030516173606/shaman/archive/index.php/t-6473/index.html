There are a lot of items I would love to have, but I can't decide what to save for.  I want an ikky bp, but would the 7k be better used buying other upgrades?  (not that I have 7k, but in theory:))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">An ikky bp is nice. Unless you find some godly wis-item (with nice stats other than just wis), I'd recommend getting it. The extra regen is nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your chest slot is really the least of your problems if you are looking to do some upgrading.<br />
<br />
A pair of Brown Chitin leggings and one of those chitin belts would go a long way towards improving your Wis and your resist base.  That would prolly run around 3k on Xeg, but server prices can be screwy.  Also, get rid of that serp bracer and trade up for a Sentry bracer.<br />
<br />
You could also benefit by picking up a SBS and swapping those JB boots out for Shimmering Terrorhide boots or Tribal War boots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also agree on the Iksar Ceremonial Chestplate. Regen is very nice until you get Kragg's Mending at lvl 58 and Torpor at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>anonomus_x</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if u really wanted to make some good upgrades to ur wizdom, i would sell that JBB. you could get ur ikky BP, brown chitin legs, Runed mithril bracers are nice, coldain skin boots, and im shure u would have alot more pp left over. just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />

DON'T SELL YOUR JBB. That has to be the worst advice I've seen on this board to date.<br />
<br />
I and many other people (many lvl 60) use our JBBs on a daily basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not saying JBB will be cheaper after PoP, but people go crazy selling old junk to buy the newest drops.<br />
<br />
Haveing a cache of Plat the weeks after an expansion can alow you to purchase from the more... &quot;rash&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

Didn't mean to belittle you are anything, but with you mispelling anonomous and recommending selling an expensive &quot;free damage&quot; item over some cheap wisdom trinkets, it seemed obvious that you played a druid at some time. :) The only shaman that don't use a JBB on a daily basis are known as Iksars....and thats only because they can't use them.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, don't worry, I would never do that.   Not only do I just think it is a bad idea in general but it was a gift and I think it'd be very rude to sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">talk the Ikkie BP to around 5k if you can :)<br />
<br />
And Sentry Bracer,  thats a great upgrade to the serp one...Or a Jarcrap from KC, its free, and easy to get.  Jarcrap legs are fairly good, and again free, and frequently rotting</div></div><hr />

Server prices are screwy indeed.  I checked out the legs and they are 4k.  The belt is 2k.  Ouch!  So are the legs more important?  The belt?  I can't even find a sentry bracer to price it, maybe tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yay, I got a chitinous belt today for only 950 pp.  Minutes after I bought it, 2 went up for sale for 6k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you doing with a JBB at 9? It won't proc until 45.<br />
<br />
Go get yourself a polished bone bracelet, with Focus Affliction I. Put the JBB away until you're mature enough to handle it.</div></div><hr />

Could you make a more specific suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Huksh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am a vah shir and was in the same boat as you around that level..not really a very high wis but I really didn't find it to be a problem. Once you get a few more levels and can hunt in the arena, POG or even hate you should start getting some decent upgrades. <br />
<br />
My suggestions are:<br />
-Can't beat an iksar regen bp if you can swing the cost.<br />
-See if maybe a caster that can wear the grey flesh gloves might have a pair of shissar guants that they would trade with you. <br />
-Earrings - the 2ac, 25hps, 25 mana ones ( black spahire?)<br />
-Face - enshrouded veil if you can find it cheap<br />
-Legs - not sure of the value on those but they seem to fetch a fair price maybe you can sell them and use the plat to finance some of the other things mentioned here. Kylong Greaves have decent ac and are cheap, should hold you for a while.<br />
-Shield - definatly pick up a SBS, much better ac, saves and hps. Or if you can find one cheap a skull marked shield is a great value.<br />
-Back slot - tough call, not a lot of really good cheap cloaks. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Good Luck.<br />

Thanks!  I am pretty sure I have a pair of shissar gaunts lying around, but I have been using the grey flesh to save mana, which I seem to be chronically short of.  I can probably buy an SBS now, I had a good weekend and am back up to almost 1k pp after having spent all my money getting the new belt, but my fear is that if I lose the CGS and the earrings I'm going to be down what 14 or 15 wis?  <br />
<br />
I'm *always* out of mana and running around at about 2 bubbles of health from canni as it is so it would bother me to lose that much wis.  Maybe if I get the legs first then the SBS it would be better?  I can probably get the legs by next weekend, and hope to be 49 by then too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like a plan..the 40's and early 50's were really lean for me gear wise but you will start to get some nice upgrades so just keep with it. Once you hit the 50s more options where you can get items and better cash loot will open up. Added my magelo so you can see where I am at now.<br />

That was helpful:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Wisdom gear the Arctic Wyvern Armour is pretty good, I picked up:<br />
 the Skull Cap +9 AC +10 Wis +5 vsCold, <br />
the Tunic +14 AC +10 Str +8 Dex +10 Wis +10 vsCold,<br />
the Leggings +9 AC +6 Str +8 Dex +5 Wis +8 vsCold &amp;<br />
one Wristband  +7 AC +6 Str +5 Sta +5 Wis +3 vsCold , <br />
<br />
For the grand total of 7500 pp in the bazaar about a week ago, maybe I was just lucky but the same Trader was selling them again the next day for the same prices.</div></div><hr />
