<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As many of you know that were on last night, KoE did a General V'Ghera raid in Kithicor Woods for Blaydde, Harryfooty and Grizz.  This was the final epic battle for the Rogue epic weapon Ragebringer.  Failure to win this battle means that the quest must be restarted.<br />
<br />
By about 6:30 pm EST the necessary forces were assembled at the crossroads just west of the dark elf cabin in which the trigger mobs reside.  The pull group began to split the cabin so that there were only a couple of dark elves left.  The rogue then turns in a trigger item to one of the DEs while in hide/sneak mode, thereby spawning the General.  The pull group then pulls the General (again splitting him from the cabin) to the assembled forces.  The General is a level 63 SK and can be very tough to bring down.<br />
<br />
Once the cabin was split, Grizz called for Blaydde to turn in his trigger item.  I sneaked to the cabin and clicked on one of the DEs.  Sadly, Blaydde was immediately aggroed (this occasionally happens), and in his haste to escape, he traded the item to the DE rather than cancelling the trade.  Blaydde died fast.  But more significantly, the General did not spawn.  This is because if the turn-in happens while the rogue is aggroed, the trigger item is lost and the General does not spawn.  Blaydde knew this but, in his excitement, he hit the Trade button instead of the Cancel button.  This also happens a fair amount, as visitors to the Safehouse Boards can attest.  People make this mistake ALL the time.  The result is that the quest must be restarted.<br />
<br />
As you all might expect, Blaydde was crushed.  The guild was incredibly supportive, making clear that they would help re-do the quest, but, although I tried not to show it, my disappointment was extreme.  But we proceeded to trigger the next General, this time for Grizz.   The turn-in went well, the General was spawned and soon he died at the hands of the guild.   We rezzed Grizz so that he could loot the General's pouch, but soon there appeared in guildsay instructions from Grizz for me to loot the pouch.  I could not believe my eyes.  I protested in say, in tells to Grizz and in guildsay that I could not, WOULD not, loot the pouch - that it belonged to Grizz, who would only have to re-do the quest himself.  Grizz would not budge, however, and Waran and Zelfani assured me that if I did not loot it Grizz would let it rot.  After arguing some more, I eventually looted the pouch.  Blaydde is now one Kedge Robe away from completing Ragebringer.<br />
<br />
Grizz's actions last night were, of course, extraordinary.  I am relatively new to KoE (though I have known many of you since release), but I have always known of Rizz's reputation.  (Eariana spoke glowingly of him when she originally joined LoA in '99)  Last night was the first time I benefitted directly from his renowned generosity, and it occurred to me that his generosity is not only extraordinary, it is uncommon.   I have many good friends in EQ, but I can say with confidence that few if any of them would have done what Grizz did last night, and this for a relatively new member of the guild that he barely knows.  I am humbled.<br />
<br />
There is one final piece to this story, however. What no one in the guild was aware of last night (except Drolgin), was that Adam did the trade to the DE, not me (though I was with him).  Adam is my 14 year old son who plays Blaydde with me, and he so much wanted to handle Blaydde at the final moment.  The resulting failure to spawn the General terribly upset him (though, as I said, this is a common problem with spawning the General).  Grizz's act of generosity made Adam's day.  As the riad continued for Harry's General, Adam turned to me and said, &quot;People always say they will follow Rizz anywhere.  Now I understand why.&quot;<br />

Add this to the legend that is Rizz<br />

Rizz as soon as you are ready and whenever you need assistance in redoing this quest just say so and we'll all be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All I can say is WOW.  What a selfless act.  How many other people would do such a thing?  One measure of a leader is that he leads by example, not just by words.  Can there be any better of a leader than Rizz?  This act would be amazing enough, on its own, but the fact is that this is only one of many that he has done.  I have always been willing to help friends/guildies, but I am now especially motivated to be even more helpful due to the inspiration provided by Rizz.<br />
/salute Rizz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just and FYI incase you didn't know. (Please don't kill me Rizz)<br />
<br />
Last night after everything with the General was done, Zelfani and Moe insisted that Grizz Re-start the quest over. When I talked to Grizz after all this fighting was over they were over in Kaladim starting his quest over. I got a port over there and the 3 of us proceded to help Grizz get the things he needed to restart this quest. <br />
<br />
After a bit he got the note from the Rogue in Kaladim. Fazzar was asked to port us all up to Hate where just by luck there was the book just rotting on the Mob there. He ported us. Fazzar killed Grizz and I revived him. He ran naked (Woo Hoo hehe) through hate and looted the book. Came back looted his corpse and Zelfi ported us out. We then went to Nek and he tried the Rogue there. <br />
<br />
Please know that Zelf, Grizz and Moe died doing this quest. I camped at 1:30am est and Grizz and Moe were still in Nek trying for the note so I am not sure if he got it or not.<br />
<br />
I am not a KoE member (yet I hope). I am just a recruit. But I can tell you this. Even if I do not make it into this great guild I would still follow Rizz to the ends of the earth. I've watch all the things he does for the people of this guild and even people not in this guild. He is one of the most selfless people i've ever met in this game. He is willing to give everything he has if it means that he can help someone in a bind.<br />
<br />
Rizz has my undying loyalty and respect.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am very honored that he calls me friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well after 5 cycles of the Rogue in Neriak, Grizz still did not have the note when I went to bed about 12:30am this morning.  The mob either repopped too quickly to PP him down or he aggroed or just did not have it.  It was very frustrating and I'm sure it was killing Grizz for this simple part to take so much of the evening.  I hope he was able to get this piece after I had to leave.  The next part is to find the mob up in Lake Rathe.  This mob has a extremely varied spawn cycle ranging from hours to days so if anyone has a capable gimp that can be planted there, Grizz will need it ASAP.  Eldreth in the island tower at location +2600, -550<br />
<br />
After that and a few turn ins, we'll be ready for the Renux fight, 1 to 2 groups and its done.  We will then be ready to hit the general for Grizz again.  I want to have this done with him by this weekend.  Personally I want Grizz to be in TOV with Ragebringer in hand for this Friday.  I call on all KOE to do what they can to make this happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, this was an Uncommonly Generous Act!!!   ...however very common for Rizz!

<br />
I was upset for Blayyde when I saw his trigger fail.  I decided quickly that I must do something, Blayyde had waited a long time for this general fight.<br />
<br />
I had been looking forward to Kithicor fight for Grizz for a long time, and I knew how crushing it would be for Blayyde, it was crushing for myself.<br />
<br />
With Moebeus and Zelfani being stubborn and insisting that I restart the quest, when I wanted to do nothing but log out, I was able to quickly get the note from kaladim, and then we ported up to Hate, where I made a kamikaze run to the Maestro room.  Fazzar dueled me out, and I made a 6 minute naked run to the room with a revive box on me, in case I was spotted.<br />
<br />
We then went to Neriak, and as Meiamour said, Moebues and Zelfani died trying to position the mob for me as it would aggro.  He would not always go back to his room, rather he would get hung up on a wall.<br />
<br />
Several game days passed, but I'm happy to say at 4:00 this morning I got the note.  I then headed to Highpass completed the turn in there, and then immediately headed for Lake Rathe, sure enough Eldreth was up.  I was able to complete that hand in and I am now ready for the Renux fight in Steamfont.  After that its time for battle with the General.<br />
<br />
I am happy for Blayyde, and I am happy for Harryfooty.  Thank you to all of those who assisted in Kithicor.  I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to that battle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">WOOT! Great news boss.   Lets get Renox dead and back to Kithicor tonight.  Glad that the other mobs were up for the hand-ins.  That makes things much easier to get this done ASAP.<br />
<br />
And Helek, all you need is to be 50+, your pickpocket skill up to 190 or so and a porter and we can do the same for you.  The Ragebringer is very important for damage dealing to a rogue and in turn very helpful to the guild for the big mobs.  I'd be happy to help you out with this.  Being a DE you shouldn't have to deal with the faction part up front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea Rizz! I am glad you got that far. Now if you all go tonight and need a cleric or druid please let me know. I will be there for you.<br />

<br />
A little note about the pickpocketing in Neriak....something I found out by experimenting when i was doing mine.<br />
<br />
The rogue guild is on a separate faction from and guards, inner or outer...  As long as you have not killed any rogue guild NPCs and are a follower of Bristlebane, all you have to do is use you DE illusion mask and you will not be KoS to the DE rogues, as I recall, after putting up my illusion, they conned warmly to me :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Harryfooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh yeah one more thing P When I went to PP guy in Neriak I could not get him forever standing on roof and PPing him from there. I stole every bit of his items. Guess he didnt have it. So I waiting a full day game time. Some dwarf ran into the building and tried to PP him but got aggroed and tried to run, so he pulled general on the roof and died. I was scared that he would see me but of course he wouldnt :) So he was on the roof right infront of me and I pped him once again and POP there was the note in my hands. So mabey has to do something with him standing on roof or having to be able to see him. But that was cool :)</div></div><hr />

Rizz is truly an amazing leader.  It is actions like this that truly make a good leader and is one of the many reasons that people look to KoE when they are seeking a Guild.  <br />
<br />
Everytime I have had the opportunity to group with one of your members they have always conducted themselves with the utmost honor and were truly great people to fight with.  Having someone like Rizz to look up to I can see why your standards are so high and your members are proud to wear the Keepers name.<br />
<br />
I look forward to the next time I have the opportunity to work with any of your members.  And congratz to everyone for getting his or her quest items!<br />
<br />
Good luck to you all.</div></div><hr />
