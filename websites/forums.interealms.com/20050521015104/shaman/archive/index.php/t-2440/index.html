<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone worked on this earring yet?  My guild did two evenings of tradeskilling teamwork to get around 20 done, I'm exhausted!  It's nice that tradeskills have value.  Although I'm no grandmaster of any skill, I felt useful with my 175 smithing and my 140 brewing, I was able to help make several of the ingredients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice that they are making tradeskills valuable.<br />
<br />
Now for the question.  Stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are two earring rewards, one is a druid earring that non druids turn in to get THIS:<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice: AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 5, sv cold 5, sv magic 5, recommended level 51, flowing thought 1, tiny, wt 0.1, ALL/ALL, LORE, NO DROP<br />
<br />
There is a full write up of the quest on eqtraders:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm<br />
<br />
It requires 9 gifts...and the services of a grandmaster brewer, baker, potter, fisher, smith, JC and tailor.  My guild did a divide and conquer approach, each person assigned a task and gathering all the stuff we needed in the Bazaar for combines.  The quest looks overwhelming, but I was amazed at how quickly we could gather ingredients.  <br />
<br />
Each gift is droppable, you could technically purchase all 9 gifts, combine them in a forge (no fail combination) and turn in the druid earring for the non druid earring.<br />
<br />
The biggest advice I could give is, buy in bulk.  Scent of Marr can be purchased in EC and is needed to make celestial essence (celestial solvent purchased in Bazaar + high level research component, combined in a mortar/pestle, no fail combination).  Being able to buy an endless supply of Scent of Marr is a huge plus!<br />
<br />
Foraging is another big one.  Get some druids/rangers into POG to forage the planks of oak, get some folks out to the Karanas to get cabbages and Plains pebbles.  Get everyone with no trade skill ability farming iron oxides, lotus sap from FG, spider silks and spiderling silks.  Get someone to Freeport to buy tons of elven wine and mistletoe.<br />
<br />
Oh and emeralds, stacks and stacks of imbued emeralds :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice to see that others are thinking the same way.   We are working to skill up or get enough together to make some of these.   They are a great ear ring for Casting classes.   <br />
<br />
Been doing the clicky - clicky for a couple nights now to get brewing to GM myself.   After looking at the requirements for this ... it' make you marvel at the person that completed it the first time in such a short period of time.   It was a Questor's dream challenge and a fitting name ... Solstice ... but the PoTC earring is named after the person that solved the challenge ... Xanthe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the hitpoints and AC on that earring, we have melees doing it as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did not really think that this earring was worth the 10k-20k worth of stuff you need to combine to make it. But then, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm, that's a good point.  I think 10K for a FT earring with 55 hitpoints/mana, sta and AC is a pretty good deal.  But, what would it cost to buy it all?<br />
<br />
The most expensive piece is the gem studded chain (silver bar + emerald + ruby + sapphire) for the robe and it is returned on a failure. (it's actually a rather cheap way to skill up tailoring, considering the rest of the bits cost around 30 plat!)<br />
<br />
Champagne - cheap, cost me around 500 plat and I had 5 made for guildies, they are for sale for 200 plat each on my server.<br />
<br />
Sickle - expensive, but they are for sale on my server for 3K, I'm sure it cost less for the guild smiths to make for us<br />
<br />
Idol - cost 400 plat to make (according to guild grand master potter), currently on sale on my server for 4K<br />
<br />
Lotus pie - 200 plat<br />
<br />
Picnic - I bought mine for 1K<br />
<br />
Lucky cabbage - easy to forage, easy to make, no more than 100 plat<br />
<br />
Fishing pole - Nothing expensive in this one, just some annoying foraging stuff (planks of oak, dragon eggs), haven't seen one of these for sale, so don't know what people would charge<br />
<br />
Star ruby encrusted stein - currently selling for 250 plat on my server<br />
<br />
Robe - Big pain (but you did get the expensive part back on failure).  Currently one for sale on my server board for &quot;a handful of blue diamonds.&quot;  (whatever that means).<br />
<br />
I spent around 7K over the last two days on the earring...but I fronted 10 of the gem studded chains (5K), bought 1 picnic basket (1K) and I guess bought around 1K of just needed stuff (emeralds, scent of marr, elven wine, mistletoe, sandlewood).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could spend 10k on an earring like that.<br />
Definitely worth it for a nice upgrade.  That's more MR and almost the same CR FR as a blue diamond earring as well, so that's one more item I dont have to swap out for raids.  <br />
<br />
Yah thanks info Gloriana.  I'm gonna check into that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nothing posted yet, of course, but I would be willing to bet this quest will be severly nerfed in the patch tomorrow night.  I'd expect to see a lot of the gifts suddenly become no drop.  I hope I'm wrong . . . but you may want to get it done soon.  :(<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This quest is all about networking.  My guild made a channel with all the people working on it.  My suggestion is become a master at one of the gifts--then you can trade for the other gifts.  A couple of the gifts might be worth buying if none of your friends can make.  That said, the prices Gloriana mentioned are almost identical on Quellious.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chotoi, I'm not sure how multiple gifts could become no drop.  Each gift requires a grandmaster tradeskiller and Verant has limited each individual to only one tradeskill that can go over 200.  Having to create 8 gifts with tradeskills below 200 would be punitive.<br />
<br />
I see them nerfing the limitless scent of marr in EC, having to scrouge up high level research components in huge, stackable quantities would slow it down a LOT.<br />
<br />
I plan on majorly stocking up on those tonight.  Worst case scenario, I make a bunch of celestial essences.<br />
<br />
My guild did start an earring channel! Doing the earring quest has nearly been fun, everyone is contributing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got mine last night. Thus the benefits of having a roommate with pottery 240 who doesn't pay the bills and has a guilty conscience about it.<br />
<br />
He, a cleric, made one for himself. Then made one for me. He's finished the items needed for a third and is starting to work on the fourth.<br />
<br />
He's already sold those items needed for the third earring for 30k. Lemme repeat that; THIRTY THOUSAND PLATINUM. Having heard that there are people on other servers offering up to SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PLATINUM, he's holding off on immediately selling the fourth earring.<br />
<br />
Yes. This earring is worth it. The stats are amazing. FT is amazing. The AC is pleasant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Batuda is absolutely correct. The gifts will NOT become nodrop, simply because it's impossible for any one person to do the quest without going quite mad.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER...<br />
<br />
...do expect one massive nerf in the next patch which WILL increase the difficulty of this quest tenfold. Either removing Scent of Marr from the vendor in EC or removing it as a component in Celestial Essences. This will definitely put the kibosh on people 'easily' getting this amazing earring.<br />
<br />
Edit: Garr, Gloriana made my point before I did. ;( Oh well. Hey, Glori, while you're being proactive, give Magelo the correct stats for the earring. Currently it's like AC 5, Wis + 5, Int + 5, +40 mana/hp. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Might as well make it a hat trick. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bidding on the items (gifts) for this quest has exceeded 80k on Brell. Pretty damn sick if you ask me, but since you didn't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What is great about this is some of the items once created come in more than one quantity.  A guildmate of mine who did this quest gave me a &quot;spare&quot; picnic, champagne and lotus pie.<br />
<br />
I would much rather at this point in the game, work on some detailed quests for a nice item than camping numerous key parts for some of the high end zones and NPC's where I will have to invest many hours, some experience on deaths and have a smaller chance of a reward. (NPC drops 5 things with 40 ppl present)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The biggest advice I could give is, buy in bulk. Scent of Marr can be purchased in EC <br />
<br />
WHere at in EC?<br />
<br />
I should prob buy a couple hundred of these tonight hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Okay, the person wouldn't sell to me, but would sell to me in wolf form.<br />
<br />
You know when you're in EC, at the last set of Inns before WC?  There is a small hut with a gypsy inside, she's the one.  <br />
<br />
Oh, I just found this on eqtraders:<br />
<br />
Note: for those of you who would rather spend money than spend time scrounging the below items, you can buy unlimited amounts of Scent of Marr from 3 different vendors: Lyth Spellstar in East Commons is in a hut beside the inn closest to the West Commons zoneline, Hanlore Escaval is in the Herb Jar in South Qeynos, and a clockwork merchant is in Ak'Anon's Library Mechanamagica (loc 1075, -1040, near Tergon Brenclog). Lyth and Hanlore are on Qeynos Caster faction (Order of Three), and the clockwork merchant is on Ak'Anon Caster faction (Eldritch Collective). Faction work, sneaking or wolf form may be needed in order to shop from them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cost break down from eqtraders (fairly close to my estimates)<br />
<br />
The rest of the thread is pretty interesting too:<br />
<br />
http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=704.topic<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Elves - Demi-Sec Champagne<br />
A 250 brewer has a 95% success rate. Cost of materials per champagne is about 35pp<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Elves - Mistletoe Cutting Sickle<br />
A smith with effective 255 skill seems to succeed 1 in 3 (based on 24 combines, 8 successes). Often 1 subcombine failure in the attempts. This works out to a raw cost in materials of about 1200pp for a success.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Elves - Golden Idol of Tunare<br />
Trivial at 242 pottery skill, success rate at 250 pottery a little better than 50%. Cost per attempt about 225pp, but be prepared to provide 3 sets of components, or just pay the potter 2-4K for a finished idol (market price depends on server). 200 skill potters have about 15% success rate.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Man - Blessed Fishing Pole<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 175pp. Not a lot of data on this. Guessing about 75% success rate for a 200 skill fisher.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Man - Star Ruby Stein<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 75pp. At 250 pottery skill success rate is about 50%. Be prepared with 3 sets of components or just pay the potter 1-4K for a finished stein (market price depends on the server). 200 skill potters have about 10% success rate.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Man - Ceremonial Solstice Robe<br />
250 JC'er has been consistently 50% on the Gem Studded Chain with a geerlock, through 32 attempts. So count on raw average cost of about 510pp for the chain. Since the chain is returned on failure of the robe, it's about 40pp per robe attempt. Could get really expensive since there are not a lot of 250 tailors out there. Guessing about 1K average for a 200 tailor. At 181 tailoring I failed 20 combines and gave up. I've heard of a 232 tailor charging 1K for success if you bring components.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Halflings - Lotus Pie<br />
Raw cost per attempt is low (50pp?). I've seen people selling finished Pies for 500-1K, seems to be standard on our server.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Halflings - Misty Thicket Picnic<br />
Raw cost per attempt a few pp (approx). I've seen finished ones sell for 500pp-1K.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Halflings - Lucky Cabbage<br />
Raw cost per attempt &lt; 10pp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Got my earring made already. It's definitely a cery nice peice and seems way to easy for the reward on any mature server. I estamate about 5k spent on my first earring. Most of that was buying the idol and stein and paying for a combine on the robe. I did have the benifit of getting the sickle for free since I'm the highest skill smith in the guild and a guildmate ended up with an extra. I'm not sure how they could nurf it. Making Gifts no drop would be an absolute pain since several gifts are still usually numerous fails at 200 skill. They might be able to make some of the easier ones like the lotus pie, the fishing pole, the demi-sec and such no drop at least requiring the person actually doing it have to get at least some trade skills up.<br />
<br />
Done enough sickle combines to get a smithing skill up on them and I'm sure I've got more coming too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just KNEW my grandmaster fishing skill would come in handy someday!:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't see how removing scents of marr would make celestial solvents all THAT hard to get. You can make them with a HUGE number (like 20+) of research components. Basically any research item that drops in Seb qualifies, and any ML can tell you how many of those they destroy over the course of a couple hours. Buyable scent of marr is certainly a convenience...removing it is not going to create any sort of roadblock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Keep thinkin' that. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, technically I agree Arriana.  The problem with using dropped research items is the STACKING issues.   <br />

2 Nitilim's Grimoire Page 116<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It would be a stacking, combining nightmare!!!  You need tons of celestial essence to do this quest and being close to doing a robe combine, but having to stop because you don't have the blessed dust of Tunare because you don't have any Celestial Essence because you have a bunch of people out wacking frogs in OS....<br />
You also need celestial essences in large quantities to do the sickle part of the quest.<br />
<br />
It would be a roadblock, not a showstopper.<br />
<br />
list of applicable research items:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/celestial_solvent.htm<br />
<br />
<br />
I plan on making 100 celestial essences AND 100 mistletoe tempers tonight.  This is my contribution to the guild earring bonanza and will hopefully nearly finish our goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They won't remove the Scent of Marr.  For many reasons, one is its main use in Magician spell research chaining.  Another is Essences are used in TONS of the new recipies from the May 8th patch.  You would create a huge amount of pissed off people by removing SoM's, not just the questers of this one earring.<br />
<br />
I have used 500 Celestial Essences in pottery alone so far, and not even for this quest.   Celestial Essences and this quest are major money sinks that work very well.  I don't see those being changed at all.<br />
<br />
At best you will spend 6-8k on this earring in items that will be destroyed on completing the quest.  Thats 6-8k x 100s of people on a server doing the quest.  Thats a TON of cash leaving the game.  Its got to be the best money sink I've seen in game.   Take the average guild with 30 people wanting to get earrings together, that guild will probably spend 300k to 350k getting those 30 earrings.  Now do that for 50 guilds and you have put a huge dent in the cash on a server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Jaradis - honest question<br />
<br />
Why would this be a money sink other than the pure costs of GM'ing and getting each piece?   If you pay for some (possible all) of the nine parts ... aren't you just spreading cash around?    I like the whole idea ... and wish that VI would do more of these.    Making Trade Skills work better is a great thing.  <br />
<br />
I'm just confused over the cash sink part ... esp after tradespeople get to GM levels and failure rates drop (some - I know many of these are painful even at GM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yes, some of the money is spent to the Grandmasters to do the combines, but a large portion of the money is spent on the ingredients themselves.<br />
<br />
How often does the average player spend funds on 100 emeralds?  100 celestial solvents?  100 elven wines?  100 mistletoes? <br />
<br />
How about the cost of getting to a Grandmaster level? That's money that's gone from the game forever, not just transferred to another player.<br />
<br />
If you pay for the 9 pieces, SOMEONE is paying for the materials and they are quite the money sink.  Like I said earlier, I spent 7K on the quest, and 6K was for materials.<br />
<br />
When's the last time you spent 6K at a merchant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This is definitely a money sink. Using the sickle which i know best since I'm the official guild smith.<br />
<br />
For one combine assuming no fails at the sub combines or other parts you need<br />
1 sapphire 105pp<br />
1 ruby 131 pp<br />
4 emeralds 13pp each for a total of 52pp<br />
Thats 288pp in gems alone per combine. Add in things like 9 celestial essence at 1.5pp per, 3 sheet of metal a about 1pp each (i think) and what ever the molds cost and your easily over 300pp a combine in just raw materials with out failing anything up to the final combine. Fail one of the attempts at the blessed dust of tunare and thats 13pp gone. Fail one of the combines for the hilt and thats 150pp gone.<br />
<br />
Figuring a generous 1 in 2 success rate rate thats still probably over 750pp to get just the one item made in just raw cost not accounting for any money spent getting ports to collect the items, pay people for combines or even imbuing the gems since that isn't money leaving the economy.<br />
<br />
The quote from eqtraders that gloriana posted says 1200pp or so in raw materials figuring off a 1 in 3 success rate and I'd beleive that no problem.<br />
<br />
Just from doing combines for my guild alone I know i've probably proccessed over 20k worth of combines in just the sickles in just raw materials. Thats one smith doing combines mainly for my own guild. I could easily see this pulling 100's of k of plat out of the economy already.</div></div><hr />

Various types of food and drink will last longer than others.  I was actually looking at the Misty Picnic's because of the stats and duration, but it's a pain to make...  fairly low cost, and might be good to skill up, but at 145 Baking, I've succeeded 2 times out of about 100+ combines - but I've gone up to 153 skill.  It's pretty easy to make up lots of the components for the Picnic, if you have a couple of empty bags...</div></div><hr />

My guild made about 50 total.<br />
<br />
There are only two 250 tailors on Emarr as well, I think it's cool that they are finally reaping a reward for working up such an incredibly difficult skill.  I think my guild paid 1K per combine + extra gem studded chains.  <br />
<br />
As far as the miraculous meal, you can keep it forever (practically)!  As long as you remember to eat something else every now and then (ie right click an iron rations or something).<br />
<br />
I like the stats on the picnic too, I'm considering getting one to keep with me for the stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Ok that just rediculous. Not only is his success rate going to be rather low from my experiences meaning you'll need to bring quite a few combines to him most likely but he's also SKILLING up on the combines. I guess if the highest skill taylor on the server but that seems really high to me. CT is lucky enough to have 2 250 skill taylors doing the combines for 500pp.<br />
<br />
Personally as a smith with 236 skill right now i'm only asking 100-250pp for the combine depending on if it's the raw components or just the final combine. I've gotten 3 skill ups so far making the sickles for my guild at no cost to my self. The more combines I can do for other people the more chances I can get for skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think I'm going to work on my baking and make some picnics ... although as a troll I feeel that a 'Misty Thicket Picnic' should have real halflings in it or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Jaradis - honest question <br />
<br />
Why would this be a money sink other than the pure costs of GM'ing and getting each piece? If you pay for some (possible all) of the nine parts ... aren't you just spreading cash around? I like the whole idea ... and wish that VI would do more of these. Making Trade Skills work better is a great thing. <br />
<br />
I'm just confused over the cash sink part ... esp after tradespeople get to GM levels and failure rates drop (some - I know many of these are painful even at GM).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it a money sink?  Sure you are paying others BUT those items cost something to make.<br />
<br />
I bought all the componets for mine. <br />
<br />
Total cost to me - 7600pp <br />
<br />
Lets assume all the gifts can be made for 8k on average.  The money sink comes in when you DESTROY those 9 gifts when they are placed in the forge.  Thats 8k of items GONE from the server,  8k worth of cash paid to merchants for components to make the gifts.   That is why its a major money sink.<br />
<br />
I made 2 earrings last night, going to make a 3rd (2 for my druid, 1 for my shaman).   30 of my friends made earrings last night in a mass effort.   That is ~250k of cash gone from the server just in one guild.  I call that a major money sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ahhhh ... Thanks Jaradis.   I wasn't thinking about the fact that to complete this quest you are trading ... i.e. destroying ... 9 items.   While some are consumables (Misty's , Champagne, Lotus pie, etc) you are turning nine NON no-drops for one No-Drop earring.  <br />
<br />
Hmmm I don't know of another quest like this in the game.   Maybe by chance VI has stumbled across something ... hint hint.<br />

<br />
80k to alot of people is nothing for an FT1 earring with those stats. <br />
<br />
Btw i'm on Rodcet Nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My guild finished 11 or so of these earrings tonight.<br />
<br />
It took us about 3 full days of 3-8 people working on foraging, tradeskills and rounding up components.<br />
<br />
I personally spent around 14k raising pottery from 188 to 207.<br />
Tradeskills are hellish and miserable for me, but the earring is very nice and worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
Next week we need to finish about 6-8 more after a break from the tradeskills grind.<br />
<br />
Overall expense for 11 earrings was around 30k for all of us.  The reward is well worth the slightly less than 3k per earring it took to make them, including funding skillups.  It was truely a full guild effort for our small grp of folks and quite rewarding to have us all work together with our respective skills.<br />
<br />
That being said. Damn tradeskills SUCK.</div></div><hr />

Sure killing UBER XYZ mob can offer similar UBER gear ... but what does ever- Quest really mean.   I've never thought of killing static mobs as a quest.   But this thread shows how a well thought out quest can gain interest from both the indivual and guild lvl.   <br />

<br />
Did you describe the stats to your guild? :)<br />
<br />
If your guild doesn't have a few grandmasters (pottery, brewing, JC, smithing, tailoring) you're going to find it a lot harder to do it all in house.  <br />
<br />
If your guild isn't willing (or able) to help you, you can start gathering all the pieces for your earring and work with grandmasters on your server who will probably attempts combines for you for a fee.  <br />
<br />
I know the quest looks overwhelming, but just start on a few pieces.  I started on the champagne and with the help of a 250 jeweler and a 180 brewer, I had 5 champagnes (one for each of us and two spare for my guild) in about an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
Make some celestial essences (scent of marr + celestial solvent) both are buyable and the combination is no fail.  See if a high level tailor/smith needs you to do some low level stuff for them in exchange for their help on combines.<br />
<br />
It's pretty easy to get brewing to 100 or so, and after that you can work to create mistletoe tempers which you could trade to a smith for their services.  Grand master smiths want to make lots of sickles, you could help out by doing some of the &quot;scut&quot; work for them.<br />
<br />
Work on getting your gem studded chain made, you only need one of these!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">This earring is definitely worth the 80k if someone has it.  It has 10 different stats, and all 10 are good stats.  <br />
<br />
AC 5<br />
Stamina 5<br />
Int 8<br />
Wis 8<br />
55 HP<br />
55 Mana<br />
5 sv magic<br />
5 sv fire<br />
5 sv cold<br />
Flowing thought I<br />
<br />
ANY 3 of those stats (well besides the saves) and this would be a very wearable earring by most classes.   Just the AC 5 +55 hp would rock for melees... but put all 10 together this earring kicks booty!<br />
<br />
Misquito earrings go for 70-80k+ easy.. and those are only (lol only) AC 8 +7 Sta +65 HP.. now for a pure melee sure they dont need the mana or the wis/int or the flowing thought I.. and if you got lots of bards in your guild you might not want to trade 3 raw AC, 2 sta and 10 HP for +5 to 3 saves.. but its not a hard loss. <br />
<br />
Most hardcore level 60 raiding types dont have jack for tradeskills... go to the legends homepage and look through some of the skills for a lot of the Main Assists in guilds and what not.. they dont even have any points in swimming, sense heading, or fishing for crying out loud, let alone tradeskills.  For that type of player its all about raiding and exping and upgrading their gear.. these are the guys that win the right sort of drops often enough to have 300k in the bank for a SoD.. or for flowing thought 3 boots... the guys that twink their alts w/suits of Cobalt at level 10 with Dain IV weapons and cloaks of flame etc etc etc.. guys that run 2 or 3 boxes all the time farming stuff for cash.   If youre one of these guys do you really want to try to get any of your skills up to 180+ to make this stuff? or Spend a couple of days running around looking for a master smith, a master potter, a master tailor etc... no you just toss the 60k or whatever out and wear your earring and go back to Ssra.<br />
<br />
I have 180+ in 8 tradeskills and 202 tailoring, within a couple points of the highest skill i know of on my server.   I've sold a couple of the robes for 5-9k each and i've made a bunch for free for people (that brought me lots of the stuff needed to make it) who in turn gave me other pieces that I need for the quest.. i've been laughed at a lot for how much i charge but hey if you dont like it you go spend 2 years of your life collecting supplies and paying hundreds of thousands of plat to get a skill up :P  I'm going to sell off a couple full sets of gifts.. I'll actually be able to pay the outrageous prices for malo and torpors now.. have enuf to buy one of them finally woot!  <br />
<br />
This earring rocks hard and is well worth the effort and or the plat you put towards it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I'm well on my way to finishing this.<br />
<br />
It's a very nice &quot;money sink&quot; in my opinion. Costing taking maybe 7-8kpp out of the economy per ear ring, costing you about twice as much giving some back to those grandmasters.<br />
<br />
Eventhough you can't resell the reward you must remember that you're getting an earring that would easily fetch six figures on the market if it was droppable for a mere 10-15k and a bit of running around.</div></div><hr />

A few of my frnds on vaz.. are what you just desribed kinda. Hardcore farmers with a bunch of cash and trade skills..  Your right about it being a way to spend some of the 50 k most of us have banked with nothing to spend on.. Im an Iksar shaman.. DUnno if there is any other class with less high end crap to buy.. So i really  liked this earring. Goes good with the essense pearl  =)<br />
<br />
Anyways its about time Casters got a nice item,, for all the crap melee get at low lvls with ease..  Ever see a lvl 10 wielding 2 centi long swords?? *** is that?<br />
<br />
All this melee crap for sale. but finnally some nice items for the poor casters who rely on  no drop only stuff.  <br />
Seriously tho. This earring beasts Just ABOUT EVERYthing that drops. No better drops in velious..  Yes some better drops in Luclin but not without  a huge ass raid. Anyways  this is has to be one of the best items ive been them come out with since the 8th cudgel.. Even tho its bugged as hell and the effect STILL doesnt work =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Hmmmm, I would say Tunare's earring is a better Velious drop.    But I do agree with you, this earring is GREAT!<br />

Since you have an Essence Pearl, I was wondering if any of the other Essence items received a focus effect besides the Essence Lens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">After i heard the lens had an effect i ran over and scrolled through malafens essense items.. only lense has an effect ! =0 and i wont use that POS cause i have 8th cudgel</div></div><hr />

<br />
20 earrings a night X 50k per earring = 1 million plat a night.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are costs that go into the earrings, and the profits would be split among many people, but it still seems like a very lucrative proposition.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I wholeheartedly encourage this... so they'll populate the market more quickly and I'll have a shot at finding one for 15k in a few months.  :)</div></div><hr />
