<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I multi box and I dont have access to any zones with all my chars other than the recently opened ones.  I know PoJ trials are doable with one group but rather pointless now.  And I know that some of the other PoP zones can be opened via quests rather than killing the boss mob for that zone.  My question is.  <br />
<br />
What zones are worth getting flagged for via questing for the entry per character and how difficult are the quests to do with one group?  <br />
<br />
I would just like to go find a new quiet(er) area to multi box in as BoT is so boring and I am running out of places that I am having fun playing in.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The PoV/PoS flag is one group doable.<br />
The CoD alternate key is solo-able.<br />
The HoH key is duo-able (but you have to be creative-- like getting a vexed banshee to attack the nightmare up top and getting summoned, then fading agro).<br />
The Torment key is duo-able, except for the Terror Matriarch part.<br />
The Tactics key is solo-able (duo or group preference)<br />
The BoT flag is one group doable-- the minis may need more than one group unless you're uber-- can only get 3 people flagged at a time (minis drop 3 medallions at a time, and you can only single-character quest the BoT flag).<br />
<br />
By solo-able I mean 60+ bard or less.  Any other class can probably solo but it would be a pain in the arse.<br />
By duo-able I mean 64+ bard and 65 shaman.<br />
By group doable I mean a decently outfitted group that isn't botted-- you really need to be on your toes, especially for PoV/PoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just Plane of Tactics. Quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2292) in Plane of Storms gives your group a key/flag for alternate entry.<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor, Plane of Storms, Bastion of Thunder, Crypt of Decay, Halls of Honor, Plane of Torment have all recently been opened so a key is no longer required. Entry quests for those zones are still doable if you're inclined - good for increasing the power of your Intricate Wooden Figurine charm.</div></div><hr />
