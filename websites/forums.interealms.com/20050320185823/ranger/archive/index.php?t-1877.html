<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deranos Elessedil</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well recently I've noticed my computer is starting to lag behind so I've decided it needs a little upgrading(plus I'm running out of hard drive space).<br />
Right I've got a Pentium 2 450mhz, 384megs of SDRAM, Voodoo 5 Video Card, 16.8gig hard drive and I think my motherboard is like a 100mhz bus speed or something like that.<br />
Now I'm looking at something along the lines of a larger hard drive, and probably a Pentium 4 2.0ghz+, and I know I'll need a new motherboard and hopefully it'll be DDR &amp; SD RAM compatible.<br />
Could anyone give me a little advice? I don't know much about upgrading/building computers so any advice will help, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[H]ard OCP (http://www.hardocp.com) <br />
Tom's Hardware Guide (http://www.tomshardware.com/) <br />
<br />
There are a lot of others out there, but between these two you'll get a good idea.  Tom's recently reviewed the various chipsets available for AMD and Inhell processors.  Top dog in the AMD world (I'm sick of Inhell, and won't be buying anything they make if I can avoid it) is the KT266A (266MHz FSB) and KT333 chipsets.  333 is tops for AMD, and when comparing AMD and Inhell processors, AMD gives you a better bang to buck ratio.  But then again I'm biased... :)<br />

Edit:  Almost forgot Pricewatch!  When you determine what you're going to get, check out Pricewatch (http://www.pricewatch.com)  because they'll typically have the best prices on whatever you're looking for.  I built my entire system for right around $1000, and the only thing I don't have is a new monitor.</div></div><hr />
