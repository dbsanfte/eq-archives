<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khrent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all again,<br />
<br />
I was curious as to what kind of mobs this group of people might be able to take down:<br />
<br />
Shaman (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=699400)<br />
Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1046509)<br />
Beastlord (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1087386)<br />
Beastlord (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1046527)<br />
Cleric (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1092049)<br />
Druid (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1092375)<br />
<br />
What we are mostly looking for is a challenge and to upgrade the cleric/druids gear.  We can also add another friend with a cleric/druid combo about the same gear as the ones listed above.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Remember the theoretically temporary zones of SolC and Chardok B?<br />
<br />
they are still up and would offer a nice challange and potential upgrades.  shoot for the ig named or deeper parts of zone.  I know SolC has nice ring events and interesting drops.  Never got deep in into Chardok B, but seen lovely links and been told the boss is one-gourpable(ish).<br />
<br />
Both are hard to get too.<br />
<br />
ChardokB would be hardest for cleric as their Chardok faction is probably crappy.  but is easy for allies to chardok (me).<br />
<br />
SolC involves lava that will take off 70+ hp per second (not tick), but might be easier to get too since you don't need to worry about faction and just need to kill kobolds to get there.  I lose 2K HP max (didn't realized I was swimming ducked) getting in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might be able to take out Korocust in ChardokB, I hear he is one groupable if you have RGC and know where to hide your healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since one half of your group is Time flagged, it might be better for your group to work on getting the Druid / Cleric KT flagged.   <br />
<br />
There might be some drops in the sewers that would be an upgrade for the druid / cleric.<br />
<br />
You can farm the crag trap for hp/mana augs in tipt as well as work on getting GoD spells.<br />
<br />
In KT, you can take on named that drop GoD spells and augs.  Also, trash in the area drops a decent ring / mask / ranged item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your group should be able to take some GoD content, looks like the tank is pretty well geared, and ya got some decent dps in the beastlords and good healing power.<br />
<br />
For other encounters, Korucust does drop decent stuff and might be doable by your group.<br />
<br />
Another nice named mob for your group would be innoruuk in nadox. Need a good MT and rampage tank, good heals, and good dps. He does AE knockback and dispell(1), and you can hide healers from it. He also does major dispells on the MT and RT(4 slots, and random casting) so unbuffed HP is important.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think about that may have upgrades for your guys, I do inny twice a week(if I find him up) with my RL friends, we have a blast doin him. Your best bet would probably be GoD for upgrades, wouldn't really recommend anything less if you are capable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
None of them are really badly geared, though a few are very nicely equipped while the cleric &amp; druid obviously lack the flags to play catch-up on most NO DROP gear.<br />
<br />
High Risk LDoN adventures would help advance your cleric/druid's gear pretty easily though. The Cleric &amp; Druid have already done quite a few normals from looking at their Magelos.  Adding in augments (Solid Coals of Prowess, the FT augments, etc) would help fill them out considerably, and since the cleric has finished opening up Takish, you could work up their charm augments while opening up other themes as well.  High risks should be challenging to pull for your group, but with those high-end beastlords &amp; their warders assisting the paladin you should have enough DPS w/ plenty of healing to spare as well. :cool: <br />
<br />
Aside from that, working the new VP keys (except for the blood which is a raid encounter) and quests would be easily single-groupable with that force.  I've picked up 4 of the new VP quest rewards working mostly by myself, with only occasional assistance from 1-3 others.  Your group could split up much of the questing EASILY with that party to cover alot of ground rapidly.<br />
<br />
For other options, I'd recommend Ferubi for single group content.  Lots of decent stuff dropping off minor named there.  <br />
<br />
Tipt/VXed farming might also be an option.  Farming the Cragbeast momma in Tipt just for the augments could rapidly improve the worn FT (weak on both the cleric/druid) in just a day or two of farming.  The Paladin is plenty beefy enough to tank it since the last tuning. :) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you could kill very easy  rhag 1 und 2 in sraa.<br />
<br />
drops a nice shield &quot;Focus Crystal&quot; for the cleric and druid, as well as RGC, which none of those char have if those magelos are updated !</div></div><hr />
