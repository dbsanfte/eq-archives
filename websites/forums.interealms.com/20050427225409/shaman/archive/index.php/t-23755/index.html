<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>whatchaa1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen a list of raid progression mobs in the past (I.E.if rumblecrush is in the same range as X-mob or easier or harder etc. etc.) and cannot find seem to find it anywere. I have searched here and a couple other boards as well as a google search with no luck. <br />
<br />
Can someone point me in the right direction or supply a link to this chart so I can help keep my guild busy with raid mobs in our range?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Whatchaa<br />
<br />
ps. Sorry if I missed an obvious thread somewhere</div></div><hr />

The above is a link to the chart my guild is currently using. It was shamelessly stolen and adapted from a chart created by the Clan X guid on the Rathe server (http://www.eqclanx.com/) so the real kudos belongs to them. We added the color bands to reflect how our leadership thinks our raid skills stack against the mobs on the chart. These are obviously different for every guild so they may not be totally accurate for you and it doesn't include any GoD or OoW. Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
