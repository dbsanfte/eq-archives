<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hyperflux77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize we're all talking about similar things, but I had a couple questions.  I'm currently doing the kunark circuit (as is everyone else these days).  I just hit 39, and the experience in OT is not worth my time anymore.  Will I be able to find a group in dreadlands at this level?  I've also heard about going to SolB or Lower Guk as well.  Which would be the best course of action?  <br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok the oasis to Loio ot then dl is BORING.  I would hit up solb.  Get in a kings room group and win yourself some runed mithril bracers.  Just got some myself.  Lower guk is fun to.  I like solb because when there is a naggy raid I can always go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forget the kunark circuit, head up to the luclin circuit, you should get into a group or solo in dawnshroud, good xp, no loot, no sarnaks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have to agree with Asyn on Dawnshroud Peaks for pure exp grinding.  Hunting there with my 35 paladin right now and the exp is still great on shrooms, lightcrawler, and zelniaks.  Even at 52 the rockhoppers and tribal guys are good exp for my shaman.<br />
<br />
In old world Lower Guk and Sol A &amp; B are hard to beat (these are the &quot;real&quot; dungeons btw.  Tight corridors, tons of mobs, horrible trains)  :)  <br />
<br />
Splitpaw is awesome farther in as well, but a little out of the way and you'll probably need to bring your own group.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns is probably my favorite zone in the game on the Velious side.  The ambience is awesome and the terrors should all be blue to you in this zone.  Geonids also if you don't mind the faction hits.  You can hit mid 40's easily here.<br />
<br />
In Kunark don't forget about Dalnir.  At 39 the 2d and 3rd floors are good exp though it's another &quot;bring your own group&quot; type of zone.  I don't have alot of experience with Nurga but with a small group I think the spiders may be doable as well?  Going to have to ask someone else to comment on that one.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did 39 - 44 on Tundra Yetis in Dreadlands.  It was pretty easy solo experience and it helped me catch up some with my lagging melee skills.  Another advantage to this, is you can easily get a group in DL if you feel like be sociable.<br />
<br />
I found the cave in the North-West corner to be best, if it is not camped.  There are 7 static spawns with very low aggro radius and one wanderer.  I would just slow, DoT and tank for my pup.<br />
<br />
If someone else is camping that cave, there is another one along the south wall.  Check the EQ Atlas map.  I didn't like this one as there were at least 2 wanderers and it was more difficult to get a good routine going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mookle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">would a 36 warrior and a 37 shaman be able to hunt effectively in Lower Guk, say at the zone in?<br />
Or would you need a larger group?<br />
We want to get some dungeon xp but don't want to have to rely on others if getting a group is tricky with our time limits.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
