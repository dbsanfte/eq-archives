What a year EverQuest has had.  2004 brought many changes to EverQuest.   New content, new features, 2 new expansions, hundreds of community requested features, the first Community Summit, a Fan Faire in New Orleans and Las Vegas as well as thousands and thousands of hours of enjoyment for hundreds of thousands of EQ fans.  A new Graphics Engine was launched allowing our artists to use new tools when building zones and NPCs.  Zones were revamped to add some new life to older areas, new Adventure zones were added to keep small group gameplay fresh. We are quite proud of all that we accomplished but we are not sitting back and resting.<br />
 <br />
EverQuest in 2005 will continue to expand with more of what you have come to expect and appreciate from the game we all enjoy.  While EverQuest will soon be 6 years young, it is aging well and still setting standards in the industry.  A new expansion, EverQuest®: Dragons of Norrath™, has been announced which opens an area that has long been on the maps of Norrath but not yet available.  We are adding new tradeskill recipes, new features that ease communication and gameplay.  You will see the continued addition of new NPCs and Zones modeled to make use of our New Graphics Engine and will bring a new quality standard to EQ art.  In the coming weeks you will see more of the improvements as screenshots and movies are released for the upcoming EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath launch.<br />
 <br />
We have announced that we are re-envisioning classes in EverQuest, which in itself is a huge undertaking.  We are looking at each class and what roles they fill in groups, followed by raids.  Our goal is to make certain that each class has a desirable role to play when grouped and while raiding.   We will have a series of developer chats to discuss our plans and our findings as we gather and collate all the additional data the servers are currently mining and we will share any conclusions we come to at the appropriate times.  There will be ongoing discussion threads on the EQ forums (Eqforums.station.sony.com) and we encourage you to take part in them.<br />
 <br />
We are aware that with the recent release of new MMO's that some of our fans have moved on and we wish them the best of luck.  We have noted that this has had an impact on some server populations, most noticeably our PVP servers.  The PvP community has asked that we further explore the idea of server mergers and to that end, we’ve put a poll for PvP players asking if servers were to be merged, which rule set they would most like to play under.   More details for you on that soon.  Although we are satisfied with the current population of most other servers, we will take a look at each after the release of EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and identify whether any additional mergers will be needed.<br />
 <br />
We do have another Fan Faire planned for June in Las Vegas and again hope to meet many of you there.  We enjoy meeting you in person and sharing our mutual passion for this world of Norrath.  We also have begun planning for two community summits this year, one in conjunction with the June Fan Faire and one tentatively planned for the fall.  We are quite proud of what was accomplished in our first summit and our goal is continue the feedback process with the community leaders.  We plan to have representatives for raiding players, non-raiding players and each class in attendance.  This will provide a solid cross section of the EQ community to share ideas and discuss concerns with.<br />
 <br />
Of course this is only what comes to mind now, we have other projects in the works and will continue to expand this little world we share.  We want Norrath to be a living vibrant world for years to come and with the team we have here, partnered with your passion and feedback, we are sure we can accomplish that goal.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for playing!<br />

Hey look at us!  We've been going 6 years.  Don't stop playing now!<br />
<br />
We have another Fan Faire coming up!  Just ignore the fact we fired the guy that was running the fanfaires for the past few years.  Also ignore that we had about 1/2 the people we normally have at the last one.<br />
<br />
Hey look!  Dragon expansion!  And more features that should be released in the base version of the game but we'll bundle in the expansion so you *have* to buy it.<br />
<br />
And look!  We're adding, like, at least 5 more new character models to the game!  We'll even color them differently and say we have 50 new models.  Isn't that swell?<br />
<br />
Also, we're still updating the class lists of stuff we aren't ever going to fix.  We're updating the lists, so that means we're working on those issues, right?  RIGHT?  nudge nudge wink wink<br />

It won't do anything.  That's part of the point.  They don't listen.  You can scream and yell at them about the major outstanding problems in the game, and the most they will do is make a list of problems to ignore for the past year+.  Only with being threatened with mass numbers of people willing to outright quit the game did they scramble to keep people from stopping playing by having that guild summit thing.  The game is fun.  But the people and processes that are used to add new content and fix outstanding issues with the game need to be fired, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

I just figure their attention has been gotten with the number of folks who have cancelled subscriptions and moved on to other games (Juujuu is right in some respects). <br />
<br />
As the my version of the saying goes: If your attention can't be gotten with a feather, the brick is incoming. So it is with a lump on their collective head that they send Mr. Pfister forth with letters. Suits me.<br />
<br />
I do see a couple of things that caught my interest:<br />
<br />
1. Dragons of Norrath: Some interesting things coming up in this expansion. I haven't been sold on it (I don't usually purchase expansions until they've been out a couple weeks) but it has the interest piqued, if only mildly.<br />
<br />
2. Re-envisioning of classes and their roles. That has my interest piqued too, in spite of all the &quot;too little, too late&quot; crap that overtook the thread Grimbear posted. I'm interested to see what SOE will do with the opportunity. It has a lot of promise, but also a lot of room for more screwup. Sure, SOE has a plethora of information on retuning classes already available to them, but at least they're finally getting around to using it and seeking more information. Took them awhile, but then again, it takes me awhile to get around to some things, too.<br />
<br />
3. Server Merges. SOE sees there's a problem. They're responding to it, at least when it comes to the PVP folks. They're saying they're satisfied with the population of the other servers (and honestly, so am I ... life on Karana has been much less crowded lately) and will examine further merges in February. Sounds fine.<br />
<br />
4. Two more community summits. Sounds fine. Glori's summit wrap-up post made it seem as though the summit was rather productive, and I've seen quite a few things implemented in past patches that were community requests. Sure, you can go on about how those things were commonsensical, etc. etc. and should have been done prior to the summit of SOE's own volition, but at least they listened on a few things.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm a happy camper. Joined a new raid guild that's done more for Tordail's progression in the last month than my last guild did in 18 months. I'm seeing content I never saw before. Sure, it's old to some of you, but brand new and jaw-dropping to me. I also get to see my friends every single night. Worth my $13 right there.<br />

What progression segments you working on atm, Tordail?<br />
<br />
And I think that, while it is cheapening in someways, sony defintly had the right *type* of idea for easing PoP Progression. 2 of my best friends in game are enjoying PoTime wiyht me now, and the druid looks hawt in elemental leggings (I didn't realize elemental leggins had a special graphic with twisty vines and flowers and a nice shade of leather)~_^<br />
<br />
I don't feel hopeful for the new expansion, cause of teh track record. but EQ still holds some enjoyment for me.</div></div><hr />

I want to respectfully disagree with that statement.  I don't (or didn't) log on to EQ for ...four and a half years because the game sucked. No, the game was fine. I had fun. (For the most part). Sure there were characters and some people whose company I enjoyed in group (primarily because they were good players), but not because I was enamored with their RP ability, scinitillating personality or rapier-like wit.<br />
<br />
No, I enjoyed the game.<br />
<br />
Or as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoy MMORPG's in spite of people, not because of them.&quot;</div></div><hr />

As of last night, we have finished almost all of Tier 1-3 POP in two weeks. We just need to down Solusek Ro. We have upwards of 80% of our membership elemental flagged, and while we've done a few EP raids here and there just to fool around (downed 3 Air avatars and the croc in Earth so far), we're going to really start up raids on Friday. Also, the number of folks who are flagged for Kod'Taz is growing daily, so we should be able to start some of the simpler ring events there by the end of the month at the absolute latest. Rondo is on the list at some point (go go BIC augs!) as well.<br />
<br />
I've been EP and KT flagged for quite some time now and enjoyed some single-group progression there (heh, Diabolic Destroyer down! lol), but my previous guild was never capable of raiding that kind of content.<br />
<br />
its not the game that keeps the person in the game ... its the people<br />
<br />
To some extent for some folks, this is true. At least, it is for me. I play, in spite of my frustrations with SOE and the game, because of my friends. The progression I am now enjoying is wholly secondary to that. After all, they're just pixels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">To everyone who says &quot;Give SoE a CHANCE! GEEZ!&quot; I have the following to say.....<br />
<br />
SoE has had a chance.  They've had many chances.  The posts like this on this board, including this one, tend to be cyclical.  As does SoE's response to the problems in game.  It's not that we aren't willing to give SoE a chance.  It's that every time they do have a chance to fix stuff and show they really care about the customer, they put the damn &quot;fixes&quot; in an expansion that YOU the consumer must pay them $$$ to get.  Personally, I'm tired of being treated like a 12 year old.  SoE is like the boy who cried &quot;WOLF!&quot;.  For years they've been crying &quot;We'll fix it in THIS expansion!!!&quot; and it hasn't been fixed.  For years they've asked us to suggest things we'd like to see done in the game and they haven't done it.<br />
<br />
Sure, I'll buy the expansion.  But only because I will need to to keep raiding with my guild.  It's not in hopes that stuff will be fixed.  Personally, I've stopped hoping for fixes and have built an igloo out of all the snow they've been tossing at me.  It's kinda warm and outta the elements in my igloo.  Cozy, ya know?  And after a while, you don't care about the snow anymore, although you can hear it howling past yer door.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Is EQ1 ready for another exapnsion already?<br />
<br />
I mean it doesn't seem all that long ago that Omens of War™ was held back due to &quot;player revolt&quot; and wow did it turn out to be a great expansion.  I wonder if the next expansion, Dragons of Norrath™ is really ready for the players.  I have to ask myself if the delay was part of the reason for the success.  The Gates of Discord™ expansion comes to mind now....<br />
<br />
I love to play EQ and have not run off like almost all of my friends to bigger and better things, namely WoW and EQ2.  I want to have faith that those people at SOE are hungry for the $$ so they will spend the time to re vamp the old parts of the game and spice up the gaming experience.  They could start by removing broken quests and adding progressive ones that will keep players busy while they XP up through the levels, allowing upgrades to their newbie stuff as they go along and replacing those 6 year old graphics that scare most of the new players away.  <br />
<br />
There are MANY old zones that are always empty that can be revamped and made into viable XP and questing zones instead of adding a bunch more only adding to the huge list of problems.  I have no problem paying for an expansion package that revamped a 'good deal' of zones without having to run to yet another place.<br />
<br />
I understand that there would be a great deal of effort in revamping some and eventually all of the zones.... but would it really be too much effort, considering the resources involved in creating them from scratch?  If so, then re-invent the zones.  Give something back to those that have stayed and give a reason for new players to stay.<br />
<br />
I have a zillion ideas (yes... exactly 1 zillion) about things to improve EQ1 and it doesn't even start at class balance.  Apparently I have no idea about that.... only the wise dev's at SOE do  :p  <br />
<br />
Maybe, SOE needs to recreate the wheel.  Make EQ all slim and sleek and redo a great deal of the zones 1 expansion at a time, trim the fat or something like that.<br />
<br />
Go ahead, give me a negative rep bump :rolleyes: , but I think that SOE has slacked on the EQ comunity, up until OoW and need to spend some of that money that they get paid every month.  I don't trust SOE enough to think that the new expansion will be a hit like OoW was in the short period of time that they have been at it.  A LOT of work has to be done if EQ is gonig to hold on till the next money grab.... I mean expansion comes out after this one does.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion, like it, love it or hate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">All SOE opinions aside, anything to do with dragons might be interesting.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this means the return of Velious(the dragon), or maybe high end fights against Vox, Naggy and Wuoshi(sp?). (I still have yet to kill them). <br />
<br />
And the classes have always needed balancing. I honestly think they need to work on warriors and clerics before any other class. They really do get the shaft as far as class balance goes. A lvl 60 war and a lvl 60 paladin/SK are VASTLY different in getting agro if they have the same gear on them (those spells make a huge difference). And the basic cleric should have a better chance at defending themselves a bit at lower lvls. They shouldn't have to wait until lvl 66+ or a billion AAs to be able to hold their own in a fight.<br />
<br />
I am pretty happy with the Shaman class. I have seen the changes to us and liked every one. I think Shaman hold their own pretty well in a fight even at a young age. Yes we get a lot of agro still from slowing but this has its advantages too. Better the shaman dies than the cleric or paladin (who can rez you) as long as you get your slow off, and we can dodge things pretty well as far as classes go. I find myself being able to stay alive much longer the more I work on Lightning reflexes.<br />
<br />
Lets see where this expansion goes before we go &quot;disgruntled player&quot; on SOE. Ya never know, now that they have far more competition they will have their ears open to their customers.</div></div><hr />

that costs way too much time for soe tho  ~  they need to revmap where the old encoutners are ie if its permafrost vox needs to be moved to a certian area along with everything in the way  just lots of stuff here and there needs to be taken into consideration.  its more or less &quot;cheaper&quot; to make a new zone in a &quot;newer&quot; expansion then to revmap content wich is most of the time &quot;free&quot;  am i wrong?</div></div><hr />

It seems like a total waste of time ... and a lot of those zones simply move the quest mob to the adjacent zone, maybe add a cave that will lead to Vox in Everfrost and have a few IG's along the way to remain in character and something along the same lines in Lavastorm for Naggy for example....  These are simple ideas that would consume the dev's time, but allow the new zones to be revamped versions of the traditional EQ that we all grew up with.<br />
<br />
Will it be more work? Probably yes.<br />
Will it be worth it? In my eyes, yeah.<br />
<br />
I think that there is too much 'trash' that needs to be reworked and fixed alnog the way to make EQ look and feel better and some new concepts added to make the game a competator rather than a poor old propped up horse, waiting to die to EQ2 and WoW.<br />
<br />
Call me crazy, but that is how I see it.<br />

PS Negative rep bumps welcome, just tell me why.</div></div><hr />

Oh right... I keep forgetting that.<br />
<br />
I enjoy playing EQ and also get irritated by EQ.<br />
<br />
Currently, my level of enjoyment is higher than my level of irritation.  As long as it stays that way, I keep paying and playing. <br />
<br />
I can't say what is in the future though...</div></div><hr />

My quote was &quot;You were going to get this without asking for it.&quot; For my above post... a bump worth 6 points, so it was by a reputable source.<br />

Bring it on, bump away, all I want to know is why... who would be a luxury.</div></div><hr />

if you don't play the game, you have nothing of value to post on eq1 boards, go troll somewhere else.<br />

The game is fine.  It could use a few tweaks now and again (malo and torp drop rate, dx9 collision crap) but overall its a good game.<br />

Customer service has been pretty good, of the 3-4 times I needed it in the last 5+ years I got what I needed.<br />

I agree with your first point wholly.<br />
<br />
second point, not so much. there is alot of advice you can get from people who aren't necessarily involved with whatever you are doing.<br />
<br />
the game is not fine. it needs to go through a serious debugging process, similar to what they put console games through. &quot;Droprates&quot; can be tweaked rather easily, so unless sony wants to change it, its just luck.<br />
<br />
You're lucky, many of us have experienced a lack of productive customer service, I do take in account there are those who just call up SOE to redesign the game completely because they didn't like the way an event worked, but there are those of us who have had little or no response from sony, with occasional legal jargon that essentially says nothing to the customer, but is legal proof that they have had contact with the customer.<br />
<br />
yes, a majority of the problems are caused by other players, but that is what makes this such an interesting game. it involves people, people who help and hurt other people, just like the real world.<br />
<br />
and the nice little list, some of it is SOE, some of it is Player, and some just don't belong in that list....I've never had a problem doing my job in RSS with less than 50 AAs, and my gear is far from stellar, look at my magelo. I ground out 2 gold bubbles of normal exp in RSS last night.<br />
guildhopping, KSing, loot whoring, and ripping off are player caused.<br />
farming, breaking mezzes, &quot;feeding on lower content&quot;, are problems in game design, and just plain accidents that happen regardless, (hollowshade moor for instance, tradeskill farming, how do you think people got smithing skills up? or made the armor that you see selling in bazaar? If you think they should drop more commonly off more appropriate level mobs, call SOE and be just like the ones who want to redesign the game that they aren't happy with.)<br />
<br />
btw &quot;exploits&quot; and &quot;cheats&quot; wouldn't exist if SOE debugged and eliminated loopholes in game code and quests.<br />
<br />
just so you know, I'm not attacking you, or SOE, I've stated before that I don't have any vendetta against them, I've seen their good sides and bad sides. I'm just pointing out some flaws in the reasoning of your writing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Odull3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">with just 50 aa you are a liability to the group.  50 aa is indicative of being undergeared for that content.

As far as anything to do with game development we do not have access to internal game data.  Therefore we cannot say for sure that this is this and that is that.  Look at the velious era &quot;ac softcap&quot;.  People swore up and down by it, but it turns out to never have been there.   Even tons of parsing supported that theory, but the parsing was showing something else.  <br />
<br />
And take a step back, look at posts on the class and guild boards.  Do you see a population that you could intelligently communicate with and discuss the current game state and future direction of development?  I don't<br />
<br />
 (edit-eq players are like the blind men feeling an elephant.  each comes away with a different impression.  each will have different ideas on whats wrong, whats right and what needs changing.  Sony/verant on the other hand created the elephant and see the whole animal).<br />

The game is the game, with its own rules, not ours.  You make the best of it warts and all because nothing in life is perfect.  We pay to play, nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to call that very general indeed.  I'm currently only up to 148 AA points (need to update my Mageloto show I just got HA3), but I've been told on a number of occasions by people I've grouped with that I help more than others who are far better-geared and have many more AA points than I do.<br />
<br />
I realise that this is only 1 item out of what was posted above, but something this inflammatory's pretty certain to distract attention from most of the rest of what was said (much of which I do agree with).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmm although you raise some good points your brushstrokes are as broad as broad can be.<br />
Ive got 267 AA at the moment yet ive grouped with Shaman who have double that and dont contribute as much as I do.<br />
AA is not a measure of how good the person behind the toon is but of how much time theyve spent exping.Yes its as simple as that.<br />
Too many people treat  EQ like a virtual penis world and think that bigger is always better.<br />
There are undoubtedly Shaman who have more and less AA than me that contribute more than me but the number of AA is not the reason.<br />
Kind of like saying if you dont have a slowstick then youre leeching in MPG trials because malos/slowstick is quicker than malos/BoN.<br />
<br />
Yes the game is a game we pay to play.Now the fact we pay to play it does not give us a reason to get what we ask for.BUT it does gives us a right to complain/comment whatever.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Now this ive got to strongly disagree with.<br />
Chutoi,Grizlor,Snoww,Samanna,Blazz,Giac,Glorianna,Tugela,Faern.<br />
Do you want more names ?<br />
These people undoubtedly have a better feel for how the end product is than the Devs ever will.Thats to be expected people involved in the development of something are purely that developers and go on to not actually use the end product or if they do they do it in short burst ussually testing out 1 particular thing.<br />
