<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what equip do you have now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Caster role?  Why not spend 50K and make a really nice druid?<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you are serious about your shaman, the best thing you can buy him/her is a fungi tunic (barring kitty shaman, of course).  It would blow most of your stash, but you could buy the rest of the needed equipment VERY cheaply.<br />
<br />
* ears - forest loops (500 a pair), imbued ivory for barbies<br />
* face - artic wyvern mask (600), bone mask of the jarsath (saw one for sale for 400 plat on Emarr)<br />
* JB - gloves, hat, arms and boots are very cheap<br />
* Dark ember - one hand blunt<br />
* Slime harpoon - piercing (I bought one this weekend for 250 plat for a newbie friend)<br />
* range - goranga idol - 200 plat on Emarr<br />
* spider belt - 500 plat<br />
* neck - ivory collar from chardok (very cheap)<br />
* hat - totemic helm, jaundiced bone helm<br />
* legs - leg choices suck for shaman, rygorr I guess<br />
* shoulders - tattered mantle - 200 plat<br />
* cloak - mammoth<br />
<br />
Some pricier items:<br />
<br />
* Coldain skin gloves - 3K <br />
* SBS - 3K<br />
* That bone shield from SoL, I forget the name of it: AC 25 wis mana/hitpoints? I saw it for sale for 9K on Emarr <br />
* any of the dragon hide armor from WW (the bracers, bp and shoulders are especially nice)<br />
* Heiro Cloak - 15K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>safa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so non caster role advice the same - what would you di different if anything for a mixed role casting and in the fighting side - I have trained his piercing already a bit so any good pirecers out there?<br />
<br />
thanks for info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman are in a mixed role of casting and fighting.  Melee does become increasingly ineffective, but that doesn't mean shaman still can't take hits.  Whereas druids use snare to keep mobs from hitting them (their AC limited leather armor doesn't allow them to stay close to the mob for very long), shaman lack snare (except for inny worshipping shaman) and need the AC + hitpoints to take hits from mob (shaman have a wider variety of higher AC armor that allows this).  Even root/rotting doesn't protect a shaman from being hit for several reasons:<br />
<br />
*shaman dots have an intial damage component that breaks root.<br />
* Nuking a mob via our ice nukes or JBB can break root<br />
* Root's just darned unpredictable<br />
<br />
Although there are many differing views on the subject, just remember that unlike other priests a shaman's mana pool is not solely determined by wis + mana items, but also by how quickly the shaman can convert hitpoints to mana.  Hitpoints are potential mana.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
Higher AC = good, because less damage taken = more hitpoints to convert to mana.<br />
<br />
Higher hitpoints = good, because more hitpoints to be converted to mana.<br />
<br />
Higher hitpoints = good for a &quot;caster&quot; shaman, because there is more potential for mana conversion AND higher hitpoints = good for &quot;melee&quot; shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>safa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so should a shammy have high STA for hit points and what is a good hp to have in around lvl 55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The more hitpoints the better.  If you intend to play your shaman seriously, the goal should be an unbuffed hitpoint total of 1900+ which will allow you to cast cann 5 without dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>safa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what gear should i wear to maximize HP.  Right now my STA sucks at 100 or something - what to change here is my current gear:<br />
<br />
Ears: Hollowed Pixie Rib (some wis) / Blue Diamond earring<br />
Neck: Sabertooth amulet<br />
Face: Platinum ruby Veil<br />
Head: Scaled heirophant Helm<br />
Fingers: rune Etched Wedding band / Golem tear Ring<br />
Wrists: Blue Diamond Bracer / Imbued Cabilis Scale Bracelet<br />
Arms: Spirit Caller's Vambraces<br />
Hands: Coldain Skin Gloves or Spirit caller's gauntlets<br />
Shlder: Obulous mantle<br />
Chest: Fungi (for now thought of selling it)<br />
Back: Scaled Heirophant Cloak<br />
Waist: Flayed Turmoilskin belt<br />
Legs: Sebilite Scale leggings<br />
Feet: Spirit Caller's boots<br />
Primary: Howling Harpoon<br />
Secondary: nothing atm<br />
Range: Stone of Morid<br />
<br />
He is lvl 55 almost 56<br />
<br />
I used to play him a lot but he always seemed sub par and he really does now with an unbuffed HP of 1156 and AC 854 something must be wrong somewhere - pls help with gear upgrades / changes <br />
<br />
Much appreciated.  Oh yea and I play on a PvP sever<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, both your hitpoints and AC are low for what I consider appropriate for your level, but I don't play on a pvp server so I don't have to factor in the importance of resists like you would.<br />
<br />
I would absolutely NOT sell the Fungi tunic, it's arguably the most powerful piece of shaman gear pre Torpor (and probably the most powerful for iksars since they don't have access to JBB).  Remember, hitpoints = mana?  Regen is godly for shaman.<br />
<br />
For secondary, considering you don't have to spend any money on a fungi, you might consider an Orb of the Infinite Void, AC 35 wis/int 5 75 hitpoints/mana, it's an excellent piece of equipment.  It goes for about 20K on my server (maybe a little more).<br />
<br />
You definitely need something better for the face slot, crystal spider eyes might be good, high AC and 35 hitpoints/mana.  For a belt, I'm wearing a bone clasped girdle (AC 4 (bleh) 7 sta, 75 hitpoints/mana).  It will probably be pricey though.<br />
<br />
Working on your epic would be an excellent goal...20 wis, hitpoints/mana and 10 to all resists.  The shaman epic is one of the easiest to do and except for the tear in Fear, most parts can be accomplished by a single group.  Our epic is also well suited for  multiple epic drops per raid (enchanter bits in the Hole and CoM, lots of epic drops in Fear, reavers in CoM, mage drop in CoM) so many epic bits can be acquired on a single raid to benefit multiple people.<br />
<br />
My equipment is linked in my sig, I don't have anything really stellar (no NTOV gear or anything) and I have an unbuffed hitpoint of nearly 2000 with over 100 MR/CR/FR unbuffed in regular gear (PR and DR need a little help and are lagging around 70 each).<br />
<br />
Hopefully, a shaman from one of the PVP servers can help you out for gear suitable for your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok what I'm using (yes I know you need resists) that would be an upgrade for you<br />
<br />
Sarny Shield 25 ac great resists <br />
<br />
IVandry's hoop (not sure if IKS can use but I think you can) 6 ac wis int hp, should run  you between 3-5k<br />
<br />
HP/AC rings in place of the Tear and Wedding band.  You have Fungi :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Kael/Thurg/SS legs: These are just nice.  Either get them MQ'd or camp them.  Not too tough.<br />
<br />
Though I'm NOT an Iksar adn I don't know all your options either, but best of luck to you :)  Currently I have an AC of just over 910 with self buffs outside of Guardian (as like everything overwrites that) but I have also maxxed my defense a long time ago and don't have to deal with the resist issues you do.  (my fire resist just sucks)</div></div><hr />
