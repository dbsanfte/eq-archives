<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ny one here been in a raid that killed the shade in skyfire??<br />
<br />
if so could u be very nice and suggest a few tactics......our guild has this on our &quot;to do list&quot; but tbh were to scared to try as its well known to be a really hard encounter.<br />
<br />
I myself saw a time guild wipe 4 times on it; tho they were trying with only 4/5 grps!<br />
<br />
We not done anything harder than poi dragon so far, but in last weeks we have had 6 lvl 70 peeps drop out of a time guild and come join us(they wanted to cut there play time to only 20hrs a week)<br />
<br />
anyway this is one of our aims for the next few months....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some research goes a long way:<br />
Xanamech information (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10234)<br />
Suled Dar's Shade information (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=15620)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's the tricks to winning:<br />
<br />
The dragon AoE dispels multiple buffs, and it does a gravity flux type effect - that does a LOT of damage.  Heck the fall can be from so far on high it can 20K you.  <br />
<br />
1) Everyone (no exceptions) on the raid get 15 buffs (or more).  make sure that your [B]last[B] buff is levitate.  Make srue your first 3-4 buffs are junk.  <br />
<br />
2) Have people cast group buffs on their own group regularly. to preserve your decent buffs.  Make sure you have 1-2 group buffs memmed - quick casting, low mana cost.  <br />
<br />
3) Evereyone should have instant cast clickies of one form or another and should be spamming them like mad (most raid guilds require an instant cast clickie)<br />
<br />
4) The dragon is immune to spells cast from outside melee range, but is easily slowable from inside melee range with just Malos on.  <br />
<br />
5) Once you engage and slow go maximum DPS (except for the restoring group buffs).</div></div><hr />
