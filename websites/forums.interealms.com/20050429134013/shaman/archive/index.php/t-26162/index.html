About time!<br />

IGE and their ilk got served!<br />

Yeh, I know, it's probably a drop in the bucket, but a small victory is still a victory, none-the-less. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally don't care at all if people want to sell stuff in game for RL money.  Actually, I kind of support it.  It doesn't affect other people.<br />
<br />
What I do like is that Blizzard is actually sticking to their convictions and when they catch people doing stuff against the rules, they actually do ban them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">100 gold pieces for 28 bucks...saved me 28 hours of searching for it in game at lvl 20! This is what some people may be thinking. I am pretty sure I could use a few hundred gold pirces right about now. I dont have all my spells skills at 21...maybe I am not suppose to either. I just think that some people want to have all the game has to offer. Just an opinion on an old discusion from EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I didn't like about the practice was how they dominated entire areas and tried to bully you out if they felt your presence was compromising their ability to farm the maximum amount of gold per hour.<br />
<br />
Perfect example was one of Garona's well know Chinese farmers in Azhara. He was there killing the Furbolg's that you have to build faction with to get through Timbermaw Alley from Felwood to Winterspring. My wife and I were in Azhara just exploring when this jackass rogue decided to round up a bunch of them then try to dump them on us by vanishing. Uh, sorry, knucklehead. They don't mind us being here, so piss off! Others who never spent the time building their faction may not be so lucky. Loly, another well known Chinese farmer (60 NE Rogue) use to like farming Venture Co. in STV before they reduced the sell price of the Broken Electro Lanterns. He trained me a few times, and I saw him continually training Horde players anytime he saw them even come close.<br />
<br />
It's the entire &quot;go now, you go now&quot; crap and the tactics they use to try and keep the area clear of any competition that irks me. Ban 'em all I say.<br />
<br />
Buying gold from these companies is cheating, pure and simple. The game wasn't designed around it, and only those who suck at playing resort to buying from them.<br />
<br />
My opinion, agree or not, I don't care. You buy from them, you suck.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong.  It certainly does affect other players.  The business model of these parasites is twofold; 1) farm gold, 2) create inflation so the real dollar value of game gold increases.  They pervert the economy and the result is like mass paycuts to honest players.  The amount you earn from normal play begins to buy less and less.  It was silly easy for them do in EQ, a bit tougher in WoW.<br />
<br />
Thank you Blizzard!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When someone spends their time in game farming cash, it doesn't affect me.  A person is legally allowed to spend their time as they wish in game.  They can farm up that cash.  If they give that gold to a real life friend for free, that's fine, but if they give that gold to a real life friend for the exchange of real life cash, that's somehow different?  What about when I farm gold and transfer it to my alt.  How is that any different.  Net result in game is the same.  X time units spent farming gold and transferred to another character.  The reason why the gold has been transferred to the other character is superfluous to the situation.  X gold farmed.  X gold transferred.  That's the bottom line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The difference is you arent on 24 hrs a day bringing in the gold and selling it in large chunks. <br />
<br />
I buy stuff off of what i earn from playing a couple hrs stretches. People buying money are getting stuff that takes weeks to earn. Once that kind of money gets into the game you realize what that does to the average prices? That rise some on their own of course but not at the rate bought gold brings in. <br />
<br />
You giving your money to an alt or friend isnt nearly the game. Their are rogues on my server on both sides who are on 24 hrs a day in ashzara farming constantly. They get purple items and constatly put them up for 200-400 gold. What do they care if they sell. People will come in under than for a bargain of &quot;175 &quot; gold. The more people who buy chunks of gold from places like that can BUY those items NOT ME. <br />
<br />
I dont have a problem really people buying gold persay but it doest effect the economy. Its not the average farmer that is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Once that kind of money gets into the game you realize what that does to the average prices?It does the same thing as if the person used the cash themself on their own character or on an alt.<br />
<br />
X cash enters the system from farmer.<br />
X cash is used to buy stuff in the AH.<br />
It doesn't matter who uses the gold in the system as long as it's gained legitimately.<br />
If someone is duping stuff, ya, that actually affects the economy.<br />
But you whiners complaing that someone farming stuff and selling it is wrong don't have anything concrete to stand on to say why it's wrong.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between:<br />
a)  I farm stuff 12 hours a day to make cash to twink my level 20 character.<br />
b)  I farm stuff 12 hours a day to give cash to someone to twink their level 20 character.<br />
<br />
Give me one way which the economy is different between those 2 situations.<br />
It's not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah, juujuu, your equation is basically true if you want to look at things utterly simplistically.<br />
however, what you fail to note is that as long as selling in-game currency is profitable in terms of real-life tender, people will have much, much more motivation to farm than if they were simply twinking up an alt.<br />
<br />
therefore your X value for cash entering the game's economy will be a lot higher than if there were no currency vending market.  thus the prices will be inflated, the currency devalued, and the people who rely on normal in-game means of gold farmage put at a distinct disadvantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It does affect the game when money is involved.  You throw in a dollar incentive for farmers to succeed, and you open a whole can of worms.  This includes dedicated hackers, dupers, and exploiters who will try and make a living by ruining the economy and the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Juujuu,<br />
<br />
It's way more than that.   You're thinking from the point of view of a player.  They are looking at it like stripminers in your back yard.<br />
<br />
Hogging the best cash camps with toons that are played in shifts and never camp down.  You lose access to nice cash camps.<br />
<br />
Employing people to sit in the auction house all day and snatch up rare items then re-list them with outrageous markups.  They don't even need them to sell.  They want the playerbase to assume 600gp for X is the going price.  You pay more for gear.<br />
<br />
They search for bottlenecks and control them.  They need rare drops to be rarer even if that means destroying things. Doing tradeskills and quests becomes harder.  <br />
<br />
All of this designed to add frustration to the game so players will reach for their visa cards 'just to save a little grief'.  In short, they add the affliction AND the cure.<br />
<br />
Juujuu, they f*** with the game.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, they've already bought new accounts and are PLing up their new farmers I'm sure.  I'm really looking forward to the honor system going in so I can rack up a really nice ranking by farming the farmers. My only real problem is that you can't gank people on the same faction, which is a crying shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ive already answered the difference Juujuu. <br />
<br />
<br />
Vs the aveage farmer or the guy who just gives himself some gold when he gets a nice tax return is not the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the ones on 24 hrs aday who jack prices up so high and dont care if the item actually sells. The ones who people buy the gold from to buy the other scaled up overpriced items. When you and I sell/twink farm do you go for blood and every ounce of cash you can? Do you set the prices on the rare drops for higher combines ? It escalates things at an unnatural rate thats the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's one thing to claim it doesn't affect you, but to claim it doesn't affect other people is just ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is good news.  It always pissed me off that SoE didn't do jack to stop this crap, good to see some integrity from Blizz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Macroeconomics isn't a HARD topic by any stretch, but it isn't one that everyone's had much exposure to.<br />
<br />
Pure &amp; simple?  Without the real world $ incentive, these people would NOT be farming gold in WoW.  Remove that possibility and a lot less gold enters the economy.  Less inflation, and your gold buys more.  It's not a *maybe* thing - that's what's happened in every mmorpg with an economy to speak of.<br />
<br />
Inflation is a natural part of any economy, but the goal of an mmorpg is to reach some kind of equilibrium, so they don't have to constantly update quest rewards, spell prices, etc.<br />
<br />
Farmers aren't a natural part of the economy because they wouldn't exist, save for the RL $ changing hands.  Hell, I guess it doesn't matter how many other people do or don't understand the impact they have, just so long as Blizzard gets it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I was Blizzard I wouldn't just have stopped with banning. Dragging them to court for industrial sabotage would make a greater example to discourage others. Selfishly destroying someone else's product for the sake of making money is criminal.</div></div><hr />

Juujuu, normally you are pretty smart, but... are you nuts?  Of course these guys have a big impact, adversely so, on others.  <br />
<br />
There is such a thing as a difference in degree.  They spike the economy in a way twinkers can't touch.</div></div><hr />
