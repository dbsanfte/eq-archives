<br />
Its questionable whether it will be viable but I think the potential is there ESPECIALLY if they can seal inside looks at upcoming products.<br />
<br />
It'll be one thing to see single screen shots or still pictures in websites and magazines but to see actual footage from upcoming releases could gain support for this channel.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No the sega channel was a channel devoted to hooking up your consol to play games streaming in over cable...<br />
<br />
This is a channel devoted to shows about games/gaming industry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. that could be pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
I don't think it will be very successful if they try to charge a premium for it like HBO or Showtime. If it's just part of the normal cable package then it will have a pretty good chance of success.</div></div><hr />

All I ever see is EQ when I am not working around the house.  I think TV may be that mysterious box my husband stares at that shows nothing but sports 24 hours a day.</div></div><hr />

On an ESPN channel (ESPN2?) he said he saw a &quot;Magic the Gathering Tournament&quot; with commentators and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh.  He just did a bold move and played the Red Riotous Orc card.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a tricky move, Bill.  Is his opponent up to the challenge?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's just wrong.  Sick and grossly wrong.  That is the kind of thing that rapists and murderers should be forced to watch as part of their punishment.</div></div><hr />

Once in a blue moon it might have something interesting on it but the rest of the time it just has boring outdated stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is is that the gaming industry is huge and makes TONS of money... whenever something is making lots of money people are gonna want to stick the their hand in the cookie jar too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like a real winner.</div></div><hr />
