<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, my shaman is level 39 almost and my defense is SO low it's sad.  Anyone have any good ideas for how I can work my defense up in an efficient manner?  I usually group, as I really dislike soloing, but I can certainly take some time out once I hit 39 to work on my defense.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please?  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Built up my brother's defense in the 61+'s, and got to use dogdog and spirit call as well to bring him up-- torpor helped a lot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a female Barbarian quest NPC in Lavastorm near the Nekt. zone line that will con DB to you at 39. Buff yourself up and pull her to the zone. Just let her beat on you for awhile and heal yourself with Gheal as needed. It's boring but works. <br />
<br />
If you want to work on it while EXPing I would suggest going to a place like Timorous Deep and killing Spirocs (birds) by pulling with slow and tanking. Have your pet up and stack Scourge/VoS and they die pretty easy and your D should go up.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think it was possible to get skill increases from a pet? If it is, then it would rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As long as the pet is blue it works just fine.  Lightblue pets seem to take forever though, darkblue = best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Come on guys, how about the old fashioned way.  Go to OT, fight chickens and cactus with puppy, you as the tank.  39-41 there, defense is maxed.<br />

65 shaman, 108 aa's and still fighting.  BTW we shaman cant tank Vindi, I don't know what the guy that posted today is smoking, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never really concentrated on defense at lower levels. I think I did a good bit of leveling in Splitpaw and DL/KC, and never really took hits. It's probably easier, but honestly, sooner or later it'll get maxed either way. Slowed mobs in DL are pitiful, you could do them later. IMHO you should just do as the previous person posted and go to Lavastorm. Remember, Dex helps :).<br />
<br />
I did Ice Giants in Everfrost for, I believe it was, the low 50's. It wasn't really hard, just tank until you need to heal and back off. Dogdog tanks fairly well. Stoi would make this trivial, IMHO. DoTs stick nicely after Malo****, and the plat drops are what makes it worthwhile. Maybe you could hit this spot for a few levels later on.<br />
<br />
Also, on HoT or such raids, you can do it on mobs that enrage. You should be able to absorb some hits with raid buffs, and you can just turn off autoattack at 35ish percent health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unfortunatley, you will pretty much need to do this solo. In order to get skill raises in defence you need to be taking hits (well, strictly speaking, you need to be getting missed!).<br />
<br />
The idea is to try and find dark blue con mobs that hit fast, but not hard. Ideally, you dont want to slow them, because slow mobs = less hits = less skill raises, but realistically, if your AC is not high, the chances of finding mobs that you can tank unslowed are low.<br />
<br />
Using the &quot;cripple&quot; line of debuff skills is of marginal benefit in this exercise.<br />
<br />
Maximising your AC is sensible even at the expense of other stats (such as wisdom)<br />
<br />
Do it at a zone line, so that you can zone at low health / mana <br />
<br />
Toggle you pet taunting on and off so that you can give aggro to / get aggro from your pet as needed for healing yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hangman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard about this but have not done it myself. Go to an arena with a mate who cons DB and get him to beet up on you. When your nearly dead heal your self and do it again. I can not say this works to improve your deff because Ihave only heard from chats that it does, worth a try though.</div></div><hr />

Fighting their pets DOES raid skills, the pets are NPCs.</div></div><hr />

Ah right - that definitely does make sense now.</div></div><hr />
