<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It is funny how many of the things we see as big problems for Shaman in the current version of EQI or Live as some folks call it are being remedied in EQII.<br />
<br />
I know that some of you all are so mad at SoE that you would not have a 72&quot; Plasma Sony TV in your house if it was given to you free, but I think I am going to give EQII a try.  And the reason that I think I am going to do so is that the EQII team seems to be doing everything humanly possible to NOT be the total CHARLIE FOXTROT, that EQ Live has become.  It will no doubt be a different CF but I like the effort so far.<br />
<br />
Case in point:<br />
<br />
No &quot;freaking&quot; Beastlords!  Woot can I hear an Amen?  Since my days in EQ are numbered let me just be honest and say that Beastlords were the dumbest freaking idea that SoE came up with in the game next to Beserkers.  Oh don't get me wrong, a lot of cool folks play Beasts and I can see where a non-caster pet class is a good idea but it totally hosed Shaman.<br />
<br />
All Priest classes will heal equally!  <br />
<br />
All archetypes will be able to fill the role.  Any melee, any priest, any caster, any scout and any two others can get together and take on any group level content.  Okay they may be BSing but at least they are saying the right things.  Heck EQ Live does not even try to tell us what we want to hear any more.<br />
<br />
<br />
You all may have heard about other things that you don't like such as locked encounters but at least it seems like the EQII team has learned some lessons from the EQ Live screw-ups.  I kind of see it as an intra-company rivalry where EQII is saying &quot;man did those morons over at the EQ Live division screw up, and they are just digging themselves deeper. Oh well cool, it will make our project look that much more appealing.&quot;<br />
<br />
If priests having healing parity is a bad idea then why is EQII going with it?  This tells me that Shaman are in fact on the right track and that the new generation is going to try to avoid the same mistakes.  I can understand that it is difficult for SoE to fix what is so broken, but not even trying to soften the harshness of our situation is going to cost them. (it will cost them at least my $13)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will also give EQ2 a fair shot.<br />
<br />
I think not even trying it and giving it a fair shot would hurt me more than sony.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ill try EQ2 and im very impressed with how the battles look and the quests will work and stuff.<br />
<br />
Really the only thing i have against EQ2 right now is that dark elves look ... cartoonish or something, they just are very odd and Barbarians look way off so far. But beyond that the biggest thign i have a issue with is how they are breaking the classes up. I am very displeased with what i have read about the shaman split so far. I like shaman how they are and since its my fav class in the game ill probably be wanting to play one in EQ2 also. Itll be a huge disapointment if shaman arent as much fun as they are to me now.</div></div><hr />

From what I remember they said they would be opening beta up to more people as they went so hopefully I will get to try it at some time in the not to distant future.</div></div><hr />

Dont worry...they have yet to start the public beta.  Acceptance  e-mails should be getting sent out sometime this month though.  Public beta is slated to start in July.</div></div><hr />
