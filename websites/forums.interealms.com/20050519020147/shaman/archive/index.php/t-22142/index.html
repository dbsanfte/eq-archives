Gravy and a side of fries .... seriously, insta cast Malo (not malos) would have been nice and either some sort of BA4 (with a 25-30% mod), chronoburn or chrononostrum effect would be sweet, granted, I'm very unfamiliar with time and GoD gear, so I figure whatever is generally unavailable or hard to get.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
The thread is locked.  Wish you had said something earlier, I wanted to post there.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see an aggro-reducer focus effect for the epic plus a specific clicky dot.<br />
<br />
The aggro reducer should be like the enchie weapon  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24771)  that drops in PoI off the Prototypes.  Only instead of working on Tash, it would reduce aggro from casting Turgur's Insects.  This could be done by making the effect work as follows:<br />
<br />
Decrease Spell/Bash Hate by 40% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Effect(Disease Counter allowed).<br />
<br />
If instead they made it Poison Counter (to reduce our poison DoT aggro), I could live with that too if they gave us a Poison Counter Slow similar to Turgur's with OoW's release (not likely).<br />
<br />
The clicky dot I'd like to see would do 1800 damage in 3 ticks, 600 per tick, 6 second cast time, curse based, with a casting range at least twice that of our Epic 1.0.  Put a 60 second recast delay on the effect.  This would neither be overpowering but it would add damage that we could put out on every mob &amp; aid us in our burst DPS for regular mobs in groups without letting us trivialize content when soloing.  Basically it would only be a modest upgrade to our Epic 1.0 click dot in terms of total damage &amp; time period (1 minute vs. 1.4 minutes), but it would be much more functional.<br />
<br />
Coupled with an inherent aggro reducer focus effect, I think this would be very nice when coupled with decent stats so we aren't sacrificing alot to equip it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If possible i would like the focus effect to give us a slight edge (say -10) to all our resist checks for slows and debuffs.<br />
<br />
The effect should be good and enhance us in some nice way, but it should not be a completely new ability that noone has.<br />
<br />
Actually i think that clickable Turgurs from the TA is the ultimate effect for a shaman epic. It takes our core ability and makes it slightly better, and free's a spell gem.<br />
<br />
A mana free dot would be nice too. Preferably one that does not take 1 and a half minute to be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does it matter?  It took me 2 years past the release of Kunark to earn my current epic.  I may be mistaken, but I seriously doubt I'll still be playing in 2 years from the release of OOW so I doubt I'll ever see it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes it matters, Quiinn.  Not everyone here is a total pessimist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Clicky slow would be sweet. So would clicky malo line spell also, anything that frees up a spell slot off a spell we have perma memmed for groupage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...have to think about the right-clicky Effect again. I dont want it to be Turgurs, because there is already a Weapon with Turgurs (TA) and if u will be able to get Epic2.0, you will most likely have the TA already. Debuffer like Malos would be nice too.<br />
I really would like to see a good Detrimental Spell Haste on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think all of these would be appropriate:<br />
<br />
Clickables<br />
- Slow<br />
- HoT<br />
- Malos<br />
- cannibalize<br />
<br />
always on<br />
- rune (save 50 HPs off every hit and every cannibalize!)<br />
<br />
focus<br />
- resist modifier<br />
- detrimental mana preservation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">clicky canni 5 would be nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh Oh I know just what it should be how bout Clicky Rez!!!<br />
<br />
 :p <br />
Haha ok I just couldn't resist the urge. Seriously Malo line or a fast DoT would be very nice. Just hope is isnt some outrageous cast time especially for Malos fast end quick enough without spending the time waiting for 30 sec cast nothing like hitting a corpse with a debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would go for any of the clicky things like Malos or slow but it would be acceptable t ohave a clicky Fo7 also. I wouldn't want any kindof clicky that you can't instantly reclick. Especially if it's a damage dealing sorta thing that could be resisted. One thing I can not stand atm is when I try to FA someone and they take one step andend up out of range then I have to wait for the stupid gem to pop again I don't want that kinda crap happening in my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If its a primary: clicky balance of nihil with normal cast time, foci: either 50% healing focus (if they don't give us a 2k+ base fast heal) or a 50% dd focus, worn ft and regen 5ish.<br />
<br />
If its a secondary: Clicky: &quot;whatever the new version of malos is&quot; spell, foci/worn: same as primary.<br />
<br />
Heard something about epic 2.0 being possibly secondary for all classes with single 1hander epics, but I don't think people with a weapon from 4 expansions ago should be forced to stick with it over the new epic just because of its click effect.<br />
<br />
This is assuming they want epics to be upgrades for casual and &quot;uber&quot; types alike, because I dont' see anybody with a TA dropping their clicky slow except situationally (ie maybe you KNOW you're gonna be going against a bunch of mobs that are completely unslowable, or you're on a raid with like 5 shamans with TA, etc...)<br />
<br />
Edit: oh and some sort of shielding, dot shielding, etc.. because these effects are pretty much standard now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Frankly, I'd be happiest with an across-the-board (ie all spells) highest spell haste, and a clicky of maloXX (whatever the highest unresistable is) with a 3 sec cast time.  That would be fantastic for us.<br />
<br />
If we could cast malos quickly, with no recast, a lot of our problems would go away.  Of course, it's assassine to have to balance a class with an item since SoE can't get their collective heads out of their lower orfices long enough to do it . . .  :(<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What about a clicky 75% slow with a 5 minute recast time, -50 resist &amp; make it not affected by slow mitigation...that would be awesome &amp; not asking for too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jolav - VERY interesting idea. Could possibly unbalance some end-game encounters where Gods are immune to slow.  Lord, can you imagine the rush to get all the guild Shaman their Epics? Then you could just rotate who was slowing the next &quot;unslowable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oops. Maybe I shouldn't have posted that.<br />
<br />
One thing to consider. And I would err on the side of the player - don't be suprised if this super-duper effect / artifact / Epic sooner or later finds its way into the hands of a lower level shaman.  Heck, I got my Epic at 51 or so.<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of intermediate rewards. Sow Booties &gt; *.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Clicky FA?<br />
Failing that clicky charisma could come in handy. Or how about clicky improved invisibility!! Just kidding.<br />
<br />
If SoE was imaginative they could put some really nice effects on some of them. Imagine say if druids got this clicky bear which did decent damage with a recast of 5 mins or something.<br />
Or as a poster suggested an idea where the epic effect could be needed  for certain encounters, will fuel people to do them then.<br />
Wonder what they would put on a clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">5 minute recast would make it useless for most situations (average 5 minute time period in GoD see's what, 6 mobs in a group and 15 in a raid? &gt;&lt;), and if soe was going to give us a way to break slow mitigation, they'd have said so by now.  Mitigation sucks, but if it wasn't there, even more mobs would just be straight up immune.  Also, this would COMPLETELY trivialise a lot of content.  There are definitely mobs that would be made soloable with an unmitigated slow, and I don't want another Yeldema situation putting our spell lists and power levels in a holding pattern for 5 expansions (ie until the end of EQ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The clicky dot I'd like to see would do 1800 damage in 3 ticks <br />

Dam, thats 100dps from a no mana spell.  Thats more dps then a 65 sk/pally/bard/warrior would do with avg gear.  Its hard to suggest an effect if we don't know how powerful its supposed to be.  Is it supposed to be crazy powerful or on par with epics 1.0 when they came out??</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we suddenly were able to fully slow mitigating mobs, it would unbalance encounters by making them way too easy.<br />
<br />
There is no way of introducing a mitigation-free slow unless you want to give baby versions to chanters and beastlords and retune about every important mitigating boss in the game...<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation is here to stay. I honestly think that the only thing that can save slow is for SoE to stop adding lots of mitigation in the future and/or make fights take longer time. If not we need some kind of upgrade to Balance of the Nihil, because slowing fast and safe is the only thing thats left to excel in...<br />
<br />
We already have the TA available to us.... Here's my vote to see it become a Secondary/Range item also... <br />
<br />
Youre absolutely right. If EPIC 2.0 comes into the game and the effect is worse than on the TA, we will have a hell swapping between the epic and the TA...<br />
<br />
I keep thinking that the EPIC should have some kind of spell haste focus for slows hehe, and it should be equipable in Secondary and Range... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wish I had seen that thread sooner. I would have recommended a right click effect to summon something better looking than a cat head on a stick. :)<br />
<br />
But seriously, I would normally would say that it whould be something that enhances what we do best. ie. DoT or Slow related focus. But the way it is looking for the future, DoTs and Slows will only be marginally useful. So I am at a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What I'd put on it:<br />
<br />
Burning Affliction 5<br />
Extended Torment<br />
Extended Enhancement 5<br />
Enhancement Haste 5<br />
<br />
Yes ALL of them. And maybe a fresh new bearform as well to go with those effects, just for spice.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming this epic will be *very* high difficulty like the first round of epics 3+ years ago where it was impossible for most people for the first year, so don't worry about my suggestion being way overpowered.<br />
<br />
Of course ideally there would be some cool new thing that hasn't existed before in the game, something unique. But none of us can think of anything so....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Remember people, this is OOW end game. This stuff is supposed to make GoD/Time gear look realtively bad. So, while it may seem unbalanced now, these are going to take raids of a cailber of gear we have yet to see.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a focus like this...<br />
<br />
A slow mitigation focus with a mana pres<br />
<br />
(since it looks like one of the rattles you see the vodoo people have in some movies)<br />
stats like<br />
slot:secondary<br />
AC:65(or higher, who knows?)<br />
random stats, at this level it could have 500 cha and 30000 wis and I doubt anyone seriously at that level would be effected.<br />
500 hp/mana<br />
20 all saves<br />
<br />
clicky GoD slow<br />
<br />
worn over cap mana/hp regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't want it to fit in range, it would make my Lodestar sadface irl.<br />
<br />
A secondary would be hot. We don' tneed another weapon, there are plenty out there for melee dps. I would like to see like a lot of AC (does this even do anything when you have alot?), stats are worthless, id sacrifice some stats for resists and hp (screw mana). A huge ass damage shield would be hot ;p Damage Shield +50~. But seriously a clicky buff that increases DoT damage and the chance to crit that stacks with trusic and other item DoT focii. That would be hot. Throw on some stun resist, shielding, spell shield and I'm good to go. Man thats a sweet clicky buff. I wouldnt log til i had epic 2.0 if it gave me more dps mwahahaha.<br />

THIS would bring me back to EQ ;)  I never really charmed and buffed enough newbie zone mobs.  If I'd done that while I was bored, I'd still be playing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Idea 1)<br />
<br />
How about an irresistable insta-click VP with a 3-tick stun and malos.  I would assume that a 10 minute recast would be enough to keep it from becoming too powerful.  Good for positioning bosses?<br />
<br />
Idea 2)<br />
Some type of AoE protection bubble.  Perhaps an ability like the old rage line where the spell melted away your mana. <br />
<br />
ie.  The Shaman clicks the new Epic which creates a anti-magic bubble giving all inside (probably Casters and Healers) some crazy +500( or whatever would be appropriate MR ) as the Shaman's mana ticks down at 300 per tick.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Shaman could make or purchase special Gems to place in the Epic which would allow the Shaman the ability to select what type of resistance the Bubble would provide.  Depending on the zone or raid the Shaman could prepare accordingly.  <br />
<br />
Of course the effect would have to have a sane recast limit to keep the Shaman from running the mana down, Canning and then recasting.  Of course folks like Necros could just keep the Shaman recharged with mana keeping the bubble up for a long period of time but eventually the Necro will run out and how much personnel can you commit to this Anti-magic shield before the rest of the raid starts to suffer Healing and DPS shortages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My epic 2.0 would have:<br />
<br />
Effect: Protection of the Spirits (Keeping in line with the name of the old effect)<br />
<br />
Cast time 0.5 - Re-use time 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Which would be a Rune / Mitigation for melee attacks absorbing 75% of damage for up to 2000-2500 points of damage before fading. (They said it's going to be for the high end level, not high end players, and based on what others have assumed, that a level 70 normal ldon would be equal to a 65 hard, this is where these numbers come from)<br />
<br />
This would solve one of the problems of 'oh crap, slow was resisted!' in multiple cases, and yet the re-use time keeps it from being overpowering (at least in the way I would be using it, as an OH ****! button)<br />
<br />
a) You have a tank that can get solid aggro, but slow just doesn't stick - you are the only healer - click epic on the tank, attempt slowing the mob again, then proceed to catch up with heals. I think this would buy enough time (say a full round of melee combat in a hard 65 ldon) to attempt another slow, AND if it lands, get a Quiescence or Trushar on the tank and keep them alive without having to spam Tnargs / Daluda. Though, a second resist may prove troublesome, still.<br />
<br />
b) Cleric gets aggro from a fast heal - click them and it buys the tank enough time (again, say a full combat round in a hard 65 ldon) to gain aggro, or the cleric enough time to get DA on.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this would solve any of the 'well they want a beastlord instead of me for the group because..' issues - but I sure know I'd always want a shaman in the group if they have a way to save any member in the group in the blink of an eye from sure death - a beastlord can't do that :P<br />
<br />
It may also help on raids helping with the &quot;shaman don't stack&quot; issue - if used properly on raids it could save the tank an extra hit (which, if you are raiding GOD, or high end Planes / Time, you know 1 hit can be life or death)<br />
<br />
Shrug, I don't know, just my crazy idea of what I would want... even more than having Burning Affliction or FT... this would be my pick over anything. :)</div></div><hr />
