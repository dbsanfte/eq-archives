<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ordee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
  I gotta tell you. LDoN is a great expansion. I love the adventures and basically the whole set up. My complaint is this. If I have one more 3 hour EQ session without even making it through &quot;1&quot; dungeon I am gonna scream! I am in shock at how things have turned out in the past week and a half. When the expansion first opened I was lucky enough to get into about 3 or 4 great adventure groups. We failed one due to a wipe but it was an honest mistake and nobody was upset. But lately, MY GOD what a nightmare! Start out doing the old LFG in BB and then making your run to each of the zones with the translocators doing LFG OOC's. Finally get the tell you've been waiting for. So you find the chap and join his/her group. Upon entering the group you see it's made up of you, the guy/gal who invited you and usually 1 or 2 on the way. This situation usually takes 10 to 20 mins depending on the folks. Finally get the group filled and are ready to roll right? Wrong LOL. Now here is my problem. I have had more adventures fail due to sudden &quot;I gotta go&quot; syndrome than not. I know you can't predict when RL stuff is gonna come crashing in but in but it's just killing me lately. I usually try to figure out what's going on in the guild or in RL that might cause me to have to leave an adventure before it's finished. If there is any doubt, I don't do LDoN adventures. There have been so many &quot;Sorry guys but....&quot; situations so far that I am loosing interest in LDoN all together. Is anyone else feeling this? Group finally formed and everyone agrees on the adventure you want. Get the adventure, run to the dungeon, and buff up. It's usually between this point and the first 10 mins of the adventure that things start going south. &quot;Sorry guys, guild needs me.&quot; , &quot;Sorry folks but I gotta jet. Promised a friend I would help him with a quest&quot; and many personal problems between folks in the group that end up with the LD(slash q out) and never to return players. Had a fight start the other day between the Cleric and the MA because the MA refused to let the designated puller pull. Cleric left about 5 mins into the adventure. People got upset and began to find other places to be real quick. I love the expajnsion but the pick up group nightmares are beginning to kill EQ for me. I am sorry for the long drawn out rant but I am getting more frustrated than I have been in 4 years of playing. I am seeing allot of the &quot;OMG how did he make it this far in EQ&quot; type of players with this expansion and it's wearing me out. Hope I have hit something that others have felt and experienced lately.<br />

<br />
If I log on and there is nothing going on when I ask, I start looking for or setting up a LDoN group. If nothing pops up on guild before the start of the adventire, I am going to be busy for the next 90-120 minutes. Yes this has slowed our raiding down and made MM mobs more difficult to get before someone else, but I'm not in the habbit of screwing other peeps because it suits my needs. The ONLY time I have bailed on an adventure is when it was a guild group and we agreed to ditch it for a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that people that &quot;have to go&quot; because there guild needs them should stop playing LDoN. At least with people other than thier guild. I have never had this happen to me, but I have heard horror stories and if it does happen to me, I will be sure that one of the guild officers know about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Point is, if you know there is a possibility of not being able to complete an adventure, don't get in one. Go do regular XP group or something that you DON'T scew other players over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My advice is this. Start your own groups dont go lfg it will take too long and you have no idea what kinda of group your getting in to. I always start my own groups unless im invited by people i know or people in good guilds that I know can play. I just bought the chain bp from everfrost last night. I get in at least 3 wins a night from making my own groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If you dont like the way things are going stop following and start leading.&quot; -Elder Stickygoo Onjooshoe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thing that can kill you is constant or long LD's.   I was in a group the other night with 3 int casters, a cleric, me, and an SK.  The SK being the only melee, of coarse goes LD on a slaughter mission for 15 minutes.  No biggy right?  It just ends up turning into quite a pain me trying to keep aggro on mobs using debuffs while the wizards and mages are criting for over 5k.  We almost lost but the SK came back just in time to finish out the adventure.  Even though we still had a ton of dps none of us could keep aggro very well and it slowed down our kill rate to almost a halt until the SK came back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hate to say it, but this has become a problem of several people I know.  I&#8217;ve only had it happen once, while buffing just before entering the dungeon, and it bugged the quest.  We were all willing to do the adventure with 5 in our group but instead we had to take the time to go back and get another adventure.  This person had to leave because his guild was doing a raid.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned such an excuse is crap.  Once you&#8217;ve committed yourself to a group you should be a person of your word and finish it unless it&#8217;s a real life crisis, like your house burning down. <br />
<br />
I hate to say it but some members of my guild will no longer invite high-level characters that are in guilds unless they personally know them.  Non-guilded characters are proving to be much more reliable.  And I find that to be really sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From a raid leaders prospective:<br />
<br />
I don't know about your guilds, but all of the raiding guilds on our server have a required raid policy. If you are online when a raid is called you have to go or face guild removal. There might be nothing at all scheduled, or we're supposed to start later, so people go and get their LDoN groups. If Target Mob X spawns though and we've got the people on to kill it I will call a raid. I don't care where people are and I expect them to get there pretty quick. Everyone agreed to this when they joined the guild. <br />
<br />
Thats one reason I strongly suggest that anyone in my guild only takes LDoN groups with other raiding guild members or better yet guild groups only because those people know what its like. Sorry if it screws up your LDoN groups, but thats the way the stupid spawn timers make this game. Personally I'd like to see every raid zone be instanced and every guild be able to spawn it once a week. <br />
<br />
As for people who have to leave because &quot;something just came up&quot;, now that does seriously suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I once had a cleric leave a group suddenly in PoN with, &quot;My wife's waters just broke.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think I'd take that as a good reason to leave a LDoN group, but I agree, &quot;I gotta go&quot; is a bit lame, even if it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild calls raids without prior notice, forces you to leave adventures within 15min, and deducts raids points if you don't. This is a problem with guild leaders not with individuals. One person leading one guild can cause tons of people on tons of days to screw over their groups. I wouldn't be surprised if guilds start getting bad reps on this, and people start refusing to group with guilds that make their people leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was really hating this expansion for a while too.  I have a very small guild and they only log on on Tuesday and Friday nights.  They are on EST and I am on CST and work 2-10.  Also most of my friends by the time I log on are already on an adventure and don't want to start another one when they get done.   Now I have not done any pickup groups since about level 30.  I would sit and wait for someone I knew to log on, do tradeskills or whatever.  But I wanted to do some adventures and so I had to go lfg.  At first it was horrible.   I had lovely stuff happen like a monk in my group got mad at me for some reason,  was trying to conspire with the cleric to /q out and pretend to be linkdead so they could look for another group, then got all her friends to log on and tell me, in all caps, that I was the WORST SHAMAN EVER.  I felt really bad that night, as I tend to take stuff like that pretty personally.  Then there was the level 65 BL who 1.  had purchased the expansion and didn't know he had to register it, so when I was trying to get an adventure it kept saying &quot;BL can't go on an adventure.&quot;  He camped and registered it.  2.  Did not know the way from BB to Lfay.  3.  Did not know whether his pet would last form zone to zone.  We did not make it past the 2nd room of the dungeon, it was quite the nightmare.  <br />
<br />
Then things turned around for me.  I got lucky and got in a group with a good enchanter.  He pacified all the mobs and I pulled with slow, we tore through the dungeon and it was FUN.  We ended up on each other's friend lists.  He told me he usually only grouped with 65 folks but he was glad he picked me (I'm 63).  That kinda made up for the worst shaman ever thing. I'm gradually ending up on other people's friends lists and getting better groups.  Plus I get groups in HOH and BOT because everyone is in LDON.  <br />
<br />
I have had flaky people - but not so much people just taking off randomly.  I always wait for the end of an adventure before I leave also. <br />
<br />
My won loss record is not great, but I am gradually getting better known and I am by no means a great shaman - but hopefully not the WORST SHAMAN EVER either:)</div></div><hr />

As a required raid guild, you might want to put it in your policies that you can only LDoN with guildies. Might save you some rep loss and some very annoyed tells to officers from people like me who will hold the guild responsible for its members actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kudos to you for being able to have perspective on the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As far as raiding guilds go I guess I just see the game from a different perspective.  I&#8217;ve never been a member of a large raiding guild.  I prefer being in a small family guild where we are all friends and I don&#8217;t have to worry about being kicked out for not showing up for an event I didn&#8217;t sign up for.  I have enough stress from my life in the real world; I don&#8217;t need to add to it from a game that&#8217;s supposed to be fun.  <br />
<br />
For those players who are in a raiding guild that requires them to turn their backs on other people they&#8217;ve committed to, I guess I can understand their dilemma.  But I agree with Darkpaw, that under those circumstances they should only group with guild members.  It&#8217;s not really fair, but they agreed to the guild rules of their own free will.  And it&#8217;s even less fair to other players to ruin their fun when they had no idea their group member is in such a guild.  <br />
<br />
The only thing I can think to do from my end is keep a list of everyone I come across who abandons my group for a guild raid or other non-emergencies and share that list with everyone I know so we won&#8217;t invite those characters back into a group and risk it happening again.  I really hate doing that, but we each have to deal with the reputations we choose to create.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put together my own groups for LDoN and try to find members from respectable guilds first, regardless of class.  Yeah, a 65th cleric with 200 aa's is nice, but I'd rather have a 60th druid if I know he's committed to stay the entire time.  A person who bails for lame-o reason 101 goes straight to the /ignore for me.  Luckily, it hasn't happened yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes it's no fun when people leave once an adventure has started, but it's not impossible to finish without the person.  We went into an adventure, 65 pal, 65 bard, 65 shm (me) 65 clr, 65 necro, and 63 ranger.  Five minutes into adventure pally got called to a guild raid, ok, np...we continued and we succeeded.  We got a great laugh when the pally msg'd us with &quot;you guys succeeded! I got the points!&quot;<br />
<br />
If your part of a mandatory raiding guild, then I agree, you should only group with guildies to save face with others, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups are fickle.  Some of my best friends (in game) I've met in pickup groups, but also some of the worst experiences came from pickup groups also.<br />

It's sort of like joining a competitive sports team versus a YMCA team.  You aren't going to show up to the games? We'll find someone who will.  When a guild has goals, they lay them out to you and join them saying that your goals are pretty much in line with theirs.<br />
<br />
As Guild leader of a reasonably strong guild and often a raid leader in that guild, we have gone to giving one day off of raiding per week to enjoy exp/ldon/etc, and tried to tell people don't start LDON after 5:30 EST.<br />
<br />
Oh and I am married. Work a full time job, go to school also.  It doesn't take 16 hours a day to be in a strong guild and doing things. *shrug*<br />
<br />
And for the guy saying &quot;I'd just tell them to go f*** themselves&quot;  That sounds good to me.  Go ahead and remove your guild tag, lose your DKP and enjoy your bottomless pit LDON adventures.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All that being said, there should still be a happy medium between losing face with the population of your server and losing targets to other raid guilds.  While it maybe the individual's fault if they have to leave an LDoN adventure because a raid is called during designated raid hours, that will still reflect badly on the guild as a whole.  Raid leaders need to realize that while LDoN is still fresh people are going to want to play it, regardless of whether or not you advise against it.  Perhaps, rather than penilizing the no shows, you can reward those who do make it on time, at least until the novelty of LDoN wears off.</div></div><hr />

I don't worry about it much personally because I now play on a Porta-Potty with a small fridge built into it to ensure Teh Win.<br />
<br />
If someone is not leaving for a raid, you can always ask politely for them to AFK back at the ZI where you started.  I have had a couple groups where this has happened and it worked out.  Granted, you might have to get over any hang-ups on getting exp/points for the AFK guy, but it beats blowing something you have been working on.</div></div><hr />

Actually, most are married with kids working 50 hours a week.  The policy is &quot;IF YOU ARE ONLINE and a raid is called, you must attend.&quot;  There are guilds, like CoE on Veeshan, where guild leaders have members phone numbers and actually call them to get online.  I think that is nuts but believe that it is reasonable that, if you are already playing online, to expect you to attend a raid.  After all, raids cannot be done without sufficient force.<br />
<br />
My favorite LDoN is the &quot;I need an adventure stone??&quot;  question from someone you have just invited into your group.  My second favorite is peeps who don't know where the zones are, lol.  My third favorite is the proverbial just plain bad group.  I agree, most of this can be avoided by remembering who you grouped with that was good and doing the inviting rather than LFA.</div></div><hr />

If someone is going to be in my group, I want them there from the minute we enter the dungeon to the minute we fail or pass. No 5 min afk food, phone, washroom. At best it takes 1-2 min max to do that and you can just run and do whatever you need to do while were fighting a mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You should not be going on a LDON adventure if your guild is scheduled to raid any minute Most guilds, mine included would be pretty mad if you were in an adventure VS . going for a raid. Its not your guilds fault, its not luck's fault... its your own fault for going to an adventure when scheduled to raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who cares about your RL, if you joined my adventure group, you made a commitment to be there till the adventure is done. If you can't fulfill this, go to hell. It pisses me off to no end one person would screw over five others like that.<br />

LDs, connection problems and pc problems are an exception however... and they suck but honestly can't be mad at a person for that.</div></div><hr />

Man, you are pretty ignorant. Raiding guilds are not only for people with no life... alot of people in raiding guilds have a family, a full time job, full time school or college, and are involved with other things...in fact I would say MOST people myself included, and it is not required you play 6 hours a night, or even every night. It just means when your online you raid if a raid is going on.</div></div><hr />

So if my dog takes a big, steaming crap right on my floor to get my attention, you expect me to just leave it there so I continue to play a videogame?   What if I had a child and she woke up crying, should I just let my baby throw a fit while I sit gape jawed in front of Everquest?  That's just silly and self-centered.</div></div><hr />

Do either of those take more than 5 minute maximum to sort out or disable you to play your character in my group?<br />
<br />
If so, then I may be silly and self-centered but as far as I am concerned as long as you are a stranger you are not doing your job and should not be doing an adventure if either of those can / will hapen and disable you from playing your character in my group for excessive time periods.<br />
<br />
As someone mentioned earlier... if you were playing on a sports team would your child be sleeping in the benches and cry during the game so you drop the ball and go take care of him/her? <br />
<br />
I know the replies coming up... I'm the devil because I am pissed at you for failing my adventure to take care of your pet monkey who took a piss on your $4000 rug.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit : in no way am I saying to neglect your children... I am saying that when you join in an adventure you should be assured that you can not be disturbed by things which require your attention for more than 5 minutes at the time.</div></div><hr />

Of course not.  I wouldn't bring my hypothetical child courtside when I'm playing down at the park for a number of reasons.  However, my house isn't Venice Beach.  I'm here, so is Hypo the baby, thats just the way it is.  I'm not going to send Hypo to daycare for a videogame.  Ain't gonna happen, no way no how.  Everquest isn't a job, its a hobby.  If you as a player can't handle the idea that there are some things in life that take precedent over Everquest, then you need to take a serious look at where your priorities sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the required raid attendance problem can be solved, morally at least, with full disclosure.  When you are in a required raid attendance guild and are invited to an LDoN group, you should warn them you will leave if a raid is called.  If they take you anyway, then they were willing to assume that risk.</div></div><hr />

I have a dog, I take him out 3 times a day, on the rare occasion he does want to do business, he does it on a piece of newspaper... and I hardly trained him. Your dog must be pretty dumb / untrained if he can't even do that.<br />

I live on my own, have a full time job and school, and alot of other responsibilities in my life, but I make sure these are taken care of before I play Everquest so I do not waste other peoples time. There are very few scenarios where people should have to go for more than five minutes or leave a group.<br />
<br />
If a baby is crying, pick it up calm it down and put it back to sleep... if your dog is ****ting on your carpet, take some time and love and train it to not do that. Don't give five other people who dedicate their time to a group that you need to leave to go take care of these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think it's more than fine for you to prioritize RL over everquest.  However, if your RL is so unstructured for whatever reason that you cannot manage a 2 hour block of mostly uninterrupted time, the least you can do is warn your group ahead of time, whether it be for a raid or because RL often drags you away.  If they are all parents or in forced-raid guilds also, they'll probably understand.  If they're all unemployed full time eq players, they can politely tell you to find another group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This thread is a bit silly.<br />
<br />
Set the expectations when you join the group.<br />
<br />
Parents:  Warn people if you have kids that might need chunks of your time.  Rule of thumb, if you have little kids that need your time, playing a cleric in a LDoN adventure might not be the place for you.<br />
<br />
Losers with too much time on their hands and no responsibilities (like me):  Lighten the hell up, if someone has a kid that showed up unexpectedly with some kind of a need, **** happens, don't be a jerk.   Remember, you wouldn't be here if someone hadn't gone afk to wipe your ass whenever you needed it. <br />
<br />
Just the other night, a ranger joined up and let us know that she had some kids that would need a bit of her time during the adventure.  We all said no problem and kicked lots of ass and completed the adventure.  It probably wouldn't have worked that great if she was the cleric, but as a DPS (and a ranger at that, gawd) it was fine for her to take a break or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thanks for the heads up on what's happening in the pick up groups!  Here's what I'll be doing if this happens once I buy the expansion:<br />
<br />
Ask them to stay and point out that they shouldn't play LDoN if they aren't sure they have the time.  Be polite, but don't be shy of offending them (they are injuring you and insulting you by their actions).  This way just maybe they will think before they join next time.  Some players need this feedback to learn how to act in the game.<br />
<br />
Keep a list of the people who drop.  If they send a tell for a group later on, tell them straight up that last time they bailed, and they can't be trusted to stay in the dungeon the whole time.  Maybe I'll even check their standing after a while and if they win more than they bail, then take them off the list.<br />
<br />
Some may call me harsh, but I think I am fair.  Honesty, and truthful feedback are sometimes harsh.  Lying to them (even through silence) will never help them or the future people they group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is somewhat off topic, but anyway... My dog isn't around anymore, but when she was she may have gone poop inside 2 or 3 times in her entire life.  She was a big dog that made big poop, so you can be damn sure that I put as much effort as possible into making sure those lil doggie presents weren't inside my house if I could help it.  As they say, however, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride, and accidents happened.  I'm sure as a dog owner you know that they realize they can sometimes try to get your attention by doing things like pooping in front of you, chewing up your stuff, barfing on your carpet, etc.  When they decide to do it, they don't care what your doing.  Hell, sometimes they misbehave because you're not giving them enough love to them and they remember how much of an attention getter poopies inside the house are.  <br />
<br />
I digress.  <br />
<br />
My larger point is that such an attitude is why that poor kid died in Arkansas back in August.  EQ should not be your primary responsibility as a human being.  We've all got real existances that occasionally impinge on our quaint little fantasy world in the form of toilet explosions and babies crying and the mighty brown vengence of Taco Bell.  Those things must be attended to before leisure time, even if they happen to inturrupt it.  Simply say to your group, &quot;I'm very sorry, but I've got an emergency that needs my immidiate attention,&quot; gate out and take care of it.  If they're normal, well adjusted people, they'll understand.  But if you think that I should ignore my toilet overflowing or my simmering taco bowels because you perceive it as an inconvenience, that's really your problem, not mine.<br />
<br />
Remember, you wouldn't be here if someone hadn't gone afk to wipe your ass whenever you needed it.  <br />
Damn right Gandalfh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thought I should comment on this since unfortunately I had to leave my group last week because of a miscommunication between a raid leader and my boyfriend, which ended up with me having the wrong raid starting time. I started the Adventure with 2 and a half hours to spare before the raid, find out shortly after getting into the adventure (about 40 minutes in) that we had the times wrong and the raid was starting right then, I freak out tell my group about it, and put my ass on the line with the raid leader asking for him to let me know the last second I can gate out of the adventure and meet up with them, luckily he says ok. Another 40 minutes go by, and with 10 minutes left on the adventure I had to go, I felt like a total ass and wouldnt be surprised if they wouldn't group with me again (except the guy in my guild who called me ditchyface for the next day =P)<br />
But I had to make a decision between getting flagged, or finishing out the last 10 minutes of an adventure, and I made it and explained it to the group and the most I can hope for is they understand.<br />
Think I forgot my point in there somewhere =P Oh yes, even though it sucks to have people leaving, its better to think of it as they have something important to do, then to think they're going to jerk off. Cause trust me if they are, they're not gonna give you a second thought, and you'll be ruining your EQ experience over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hi all,<br />
<br />
  I gotta tell you. LDoN is a great expansion. I love the adventures and basically the whole set up. My complaint is this. If I have one more 3 hour EQ session without even making it through &quot;1&quot; dungeon I am gonna scream! I am in shock at how things have turned out in the past week and a half. When the expansion first opened I was lucky enough to get into about 3 or 4 great adventure groups. We failed one due to a wipe but it was an honest mistake and nobody was upset. But lately, MY GOD what a nightmare! Start out doing the old LFG in BB and then making your run to each of the zones with the translocators doing LFG OOC's. Finally get the tell you've been waiting for. So you find the chap and join his/her group. Upon entering the group you see it's made up of you, the guy/gal who invited you and usually 1 or 2 on the way. This situation usually takes 10 to 20 mins depending on the folks. Finally get the group filled and are ready to roll right? Wrong LOL. Now here is my problem. I have had more adventures fail due to sudden &quot;I gotta go&quot; syndrome than not. I know you can't predict when RL stuff is gonna come crashing in but in but it's just killing me lately. I usually try to figure out what's going on in the guild or in RL that might cause me to have to leave an adventure before it's finished. If there is any doubt, I don't do LDoN adventures. There have been so many &quot;Sorry guys but....&quot; situations so far that I am loosing interest in LDoN all together. Is anyone else feeling this? Group finally formed and everyone agrees on the adventure you want. Get the adventure, run to the dungeon, and buff up. It's usually between this point and the first 10 mins of the adventure that things start going south. &quot;Sorry guys, guild needs me.&quot; , &quot;Sorry folks but I gotta jet. Promised a friend I would help him with a quest&quot; and many personal problems between folks in the group that end up with the LD(slash q out) and never to return players. Had a fight start the other day between the Cleric and the MA because the MA refused to let the designated puller pull. Cleric left about 5 mins into the adventure. People got upset and began to find other places to be real quick. I love the expajnsion but the pick up group nightmares are beginning to kill EQ for me. I am sorry for the long drawn out rant but I am getting more frustrated than I have been in 4 years of playing. I am seeing allot of the &quot;OMG how did he make it this far in EQ&quot; type of players with this expansion and it's wearing me out. Hope I have hit something that others have felt and experienced lately.<br />

LDON and Pickup Groups<br />
<br />
This is an easy probem to address.<br />
<br />
&lt;Cavaet this applies to Miraguals only, group makeups may differ in other dungeons, I wouldnt know I am working on Spectors)<br />
<br />
Firstly and most importantly NEVER join other peoples pickup LDON groups unless one of the following conditions applies.<br />
(a) Its your guild. (guildies dont drop out)<br />
<br />
(b) Its a another guild's group you know are very capable and committed, and they know you. (doubt you would receive an invite otherwise)<br />
<br />
(c) The inviter is someone in your /note list (more on this later.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, YOU set up LDON groups. At the start you will likely be calling upon people you dont know, but some you will. Following are the actions I take when doing this.<br />
<br />
(a) Use lfg, find people wanting to do LDON only.<br />
<br />
(b) Look for the best/easiest to manage/most likely to succeed group make ups first. IMO this would be.<br />
     <br />
     1.SHM (Yourself I assume)<br />
     2.DRU/CLR (Healer, not another SHM)<br />
     3.PAL (Your tank)<br />
     4.BAR (Puller, A good bard pulling is worth 100 Monks in LDON)<br />
     5.Insert DPS here&gt;<br />
     6.Insert DPS here&gt;<br />
<br />
(c) If you have to comprimise, be extremley carefull where you do, think hard about the roles you are filling. For example if you have to use a Monk for pulling (personally I would pull before I chose a Monk) you will have to likely convince the Monk that FD pulling will result in a failed adventure (unless he has a clue), this can be hard to do. And if you dont get the point across you will have a terrible experience and possibly fail.<br />
<br />
(d) Choose level 65 people ONLY<br />
<br />
(e) If the person is from a mid to uber level guild they are obviously more valuable to you.<br />
<br />
(f) Make it explicitly clear, from the start that there will be NO afk's and NO leaving the adventure, if anyone can not commit, or is unsure, boot them, no if's or but's...boot them. (I pity your server, I have had plenty of people get called up by guilds, chastised by guild leaders and even have to do things in RL during a raid but not one has bailed, everytime its the same tell to me &quot;I need to go asap after this, but will not leave now, I never leave a group mid-stream&quot; I thought it was this way on all servers, perhaps Brell is a little more moral than I thought it was.<br />
<br />
(g) Once everyone is assembled take charge, even though some people will get pissed because you tell themthier job do it anyway and explain that you are doing it soley for clarity and that you are sure they knew thier role anyway. Dont be too specific, something simple like &quot;Bard - Puller, Druid - Healer, Pally - Obvious&quot; does the trick, at least that way you wont find the druid sitting on his ass with the Pally at 15% health and having to Kragg him.<br />
Ask casters to mem bind to bind immediately outside the dungeon, ask melee to get bound at the camp (Soulbinders are avail if memory serves) or at least near a POK book.<br />
Be ready to buff everyone as soon as that 6th person joins, have a Chanter ready to C you or if not possible have everyone travel via POK and get C and Virtue on the way. As you are buffing select/cancel adventures as you try to find the one you want (see item (h))<br />
As soon as you have the one you want have everyone run to the dungeon together, have everyone sound off with &quot;here&quot; to announce thier arrival so you know you are ready to zone, dont forget casters are binding here.<br />
<br />
(h) While compiling your list of people (more on this later) ONLY do the slaughter adventures, this is key to honing skills in those not familiar with LDON and has a much much higher chance of success than any other adventure.<br />
<br />
(i) If people die do not let them res till after the adventure (thats why they bound nearby but you knew that right?) have everyone stay behind the Pally at all times, have the Bard lull/pull etc etc, you know how to do this.<br />
<br />
(j) Keep it moving, allways have at least 2 mobs in camp, win with at least 30 mins to spare. Idiots will be impressed, competent people will remeber you.<br />
<br />
Lastly use /note to compile a list of those people you ahve adventured with, thier class, and capability. Use this list and extend upon it. Eventually (once you have done enough adventures succesfully with repeat attendees) you will find people sending you tells when they get on wanting to join your groups, you already know who these people are. Setting up groups becomes a piece of cake, and knocking off 2 adventures in 2.5 hours is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As a required raid guild, you might want to put it in your policies that you can only LDoN with guildies. Might save you some rep loss and some very annoyed tells to officers from people like me who will hold the guild responsible for its members actions.<br />
<br />
Most raid guilds (not all, but most) don't give a damn about what reputation they have with casual players. And their officers likely response to you coming to them whining about people leaving your LDoN group for a raid will be something along the lines of &quot;So what?&quot; It might phrased more politely, but that is what they are gonna say.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don't want to run the risk, don't group with the members of such guilds. They really won't mind.<br />
<br />
Whenever you group with a member of a raid guild you run a risk of them bailing on you for a raid. You have always had that risk. The only thing that has changed is you actually notice it now due to the nature of LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You all should know the names of these required raiding guilds on your server by now. I know the names of the ones on Karana. Just don't invite them into you LDoN groups. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Leaving mid anyplace is real bad form.<br />
<br />
Now if you are in a 'required attend'  guild, then you really do not have much choice.<br />
<br />
The catch is you are doing yourself and your guild a disservice in casualy ditching on your LDoN group.<br />
<br />
As some people have said to a large part the 'raiding' guilds do not care about anyone else. (to a slight extend their Rep with other 'raiding guilds' but even their far less than the non-'required' guilds.<br />
<br />
Things that the Raiding guilds can do to help offset this problem:<br />
<br />
1) Please inform you members that anytime the 'non-guild' group they do make it clear that they are 'on-call' for their guild and will leave on a moments notice if called.  (then their group mates can decide if they want to take the risks)<br />
<br />
2) Take the slight time to not only say sorry they are needed, if somebody complains about 'Soandso just bailed on us mid-adventure', but explain it is your guild policy that if a 'raid' (or sometimes a particular person for an event) is called the person 'MUST' attend.  That one person (and must of their friends then) will know the status quo (even if you guildmembers are not doing the above suggestion) and so can chose to take the risk, or say sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
For LDoN group leaders (and or anyone doing LDoN)<br />
<br />
1)  This is just another thing to file away at the back of you head for groups.  If filling a vital (or any) role,  Is the 'guild' tag on the person is known for 'bailing' do to events, then make the call, have (generally) a better equipped group member (increasing your chance of winning if they stay) but risk the fact that they may be called away........<br />
<br />
2) Ask, but be polite other in the guild what was up when the person bails.  If they tell you the above, atleast you do know the risks next time....<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the one thing I have already seen which is annoying me to know end, it people that try to go anon to avoid their guildtag when adventuring...<br />
<br />
To me 'anon' generally means the person is up to no good at all, and I tend to avoid like the plague.  /roleplay  I can live with them hiding their class, but (IMO) only person of Anon is to hide guild, which means they do not want you to look back at where they come from.....<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Just double checking, you know you can't hide your guild tag with anon, right?  If the person is in the same zone as you are, just type /guildstatus name and it will return the guild of the individual, even if they are anon or roleplay.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've started going anon while waiting for a group to arrive at a camp due to the incessant buff requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">As some people have said to a large part the 'raiding' guilds do not care about anyone else.

I won't comment on that further than saying I agree completely.<br />
<br />
As for the anon thing, I just /guildstatus ... originally had that here, but Gloriana beat me to the click just barely, hehe<br />
<br />
Now, on topic, I find those who bail mid-group and especially in adventure groups because they &quot;have to raid&quot; incredibly rude.  Which is part of the reason why I've included a couple guilds in my &quot;Do not include these guilds in my search results&quot; box (either that or falling into the category outlined above).  Granted, /who all LFG gets around that, but I still look.<br />
<br />
I remember one night in PoV I got asked if I wanted to raid with (insert one of those guilds as above) and I immediately declined.  Didn't even think twice ... group broke up half an hour later and I saw all sorts of people from said guild in PoK - naked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding higher end stuff, especially trying PoP stuff for the first few times usually garuntees you a free ride to PoK a couple of times before you get it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Most guilds have set timeframes that they raid in AFAIK.  For some guilds like mine, we have 3 days a week at certain hours we raid.  For others it may be 7 days a week...  The point is that very few guilds raid 7 days a week 24 hours a day.  <br />
<br />
For the non-guilded or casual guilded people that are forming groups and taking raid-guild people, ask up front if they're going to have to leave or likely to have  a raid within the next hour or two.  The raiding-guild people know what times their guilds raid and should be honest about it.  If they're not, then there's not much you can do but hold that PERSON responsible.  It's not the guilds fault that a specific member is trying to double dip at the possible expense of a pickup group, it's that persons fault.  <br />
<br />
My guild is in Time right now and we do have a mandatory raid requirement.  We only raid 3 days a week though or with 24 hours notice on any other day, so there's never an excuse for anyone in my guild to be mid-adventure in LDON when a raid is called.  Pretty much every other raiding guild on the server operates similarly.  There are at least roughly set times that they may or may not raid on a given day, and the members are well aware of that in advance.  PoP especially has relieved a lot of the stress of having to be ready to raid at a moments notice anytime of the day since the respawn timers are much more reasonable for flagging mobs and cockblocking is much less of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">We normally start raiding around 6PM PST 6-7 days a week. Sometimes though we'll get the required people on at 5PM, a few times we've had enough to take out a target of opportunity around noon. A few times we've ended raiding at 8PM due to a lack of target, but something spawns at 9:30 and enough people are still online so we call another one. So while we do have a usually set raid time there can and are variances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Groller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I try like mad to stay within the guild to do ldon groups.

<br />
Having a mostly-guildie group can be great for guild recruitment, too, as I've personally gotten a few people to join based on their ldon experiences with the group -- gives a good example of how well they can play their chracters.<br />

<br />
Yes I am aware of it and if you can target them, you can find out.<br />
<br />
However:<br />
<br />
Before forming a group,  I do not pry,  if they chose to hide it, then they can hide it,  however if they chose to hide it, then I do not need to group with them.<br />
<br />
After the fact,  alot of them have bailed on so short notice,  the are saying 'gotta go' at the same time they are click gate (or drinking their gate potion)...  no time to target /guidlstatus...<br />
<br />
As to your hiding from buffs,  try /roleplay  hides your class....  still leave guild affiliation open.  To me the only 'valid' reason for /anon is possibly to clear clutter on screen (large raids or say in bazaar).<br />
<br />
Hiding class, as a 65 shaman, I know all about buff requests.....  and at rare times will go /role to hide from buff requests (though 90% of the time, will just ignore or reply back (if polite and not too too many).<br />
<br />

/guildstatus Kianor</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, just because to you, &quot;roleplay&quot; is the only suitable option, you would deny who knows how many potentially nice group mates a spot in your adventure JUST because they happen to be anon?<br />
<br />
A lot of times I am anon because I was in the bazaar and my guild asks that if you leave your character in the bazaar for an extended period of time, you go anon.  This way, when the guild leaders are doing a quick /who all guild, an inactive seller doesn't show up on their list and distort available numbers.  Many times, I leave the bazaar, and I forget to switch it back.<br />
<br />
To me, roleplay is for roleplaying.  A long lost vestige from my old days as a roleplayer, I honestly wouldn't even think to set it to roleplay.<br />
<br />
I still think your argument is just a little silly since there is NO WAY a person can hide their guild from you in the same zone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">My take on the issue about looking after kids: I once had a guildie who used to go afk or semi-afk for 5-10 minute stretches to change diapers, or feed the baby, etc. That was fine, he was a guildie, we understood. It was a little frustrating at times, particularly when he was pulling for a raid (yes, it happened!), but hey.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be impressed if it was a member of a pickup LDoN group though. If you can't give it your full concentration for 90 minutes, then at least tell the group, let them decide.<br />
<br />
Real life stuff happens, and children do need your attention, and SHOULD come first. But, if you're in charge of children, you need to find something to do that you can drop in an instant without unduly affecting other people.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it's unfair on your group *and* unfair on your children.</div></div><hr />

I too am married have two kids. and work full time job.  I love fact that raid is called you move to kill.  Guild it self does not have forces raids before and after certain times.  Why the Dont start Ldon after 530est is plenty Fair for the members<br />
<br />
Lost of peeps say junk about raiding guilds and ther leaders.  As in fook that i do what i want with my time blah blah is stuiped for guild to say you have to raid blah blah...When it is not...True its my time and i chooce to join raid guild. I didnt join the guild cause of friends family in it.. I went ther to raid no other reason.  Yes ive made killer friends in ther and what ever but raiding was the only reason for my app to his Guild.  I can exp grind ldon blah blah anytime before 5est after 11est. which im on a lot those times from Never sleeping.<br />
<br />
The ones that say forced raids are dumb are not the ones with the goals of seeing and doing what only 1-5cent of everyone in this game will.. I strive to kill all ele gods.. Thanks to Bakkal and rest of our guild members though omg lots of work. Lots of backflagging. Lots of wipeing Lots of learing, Am now ele flagged and working way to Time.  Time being a very large goal of mine.<br />
<br />
Yet with all this forced raid time some how like 5 of our guild i think is in the top 25 on server.  True none of us going possible break into the top 5 in ldon rank again cause we are more set on Time then some leader board of Ldon.   <br />
<br />
Each person in this game has goals and things they would like and want to do.. Farmers. Grinders. Tradeskillers. Platsellers Bazaar twinks.  Most of us fit in somewhere.. Raiders highenders end up in raid guild and love it.</div></div><hr />

If you're on child duty, play something with a pause button!  Hell, even getting a pickup group in the planes is better than screwing over 5 people who do NOT have an infant to tend to on an instant's notice.<br />
<br />
Of course friend and guild groups where they know you are different.  But people who decide to inflict their limitations on unsuspecting strangers are just as rude as the 14 year old who bails in the middle of a dungeon because they just changed their mind.<br />
<br />
As far as anon people - if they're not in the zone, I'm not inviting someone whose tag I can't read.  There are about three guilds on Xev I'll have nothing to do with, due to past actions.  Am I going to take the chance that I'll invite someone just to find out they're in Peritus or Hawkestone once they show up?  No.  I despise drama.<br />
<br />
Now there's a question.  If you have your LFG tool set to filter out a guild, and someone in one of those guilds is LFG and anon, will they show up?</div></div><hr />

Children are a 24x7 job.  They can wake up in the middle of the night, and thousands of other spur of the moment things.  As &quot;unfair&quot; as it is, EQ is still the game and the child is more important.<br />
<br />
The best a parent can do is play the odds on when they are least likely to have something come up.<br />
<br />
The fact I have 4 daughters was a large part of why I left EQ.  My shaman was level 56, I hate raiding, very rarely group outside my guild.  It was looking very much like game over for me (or very little game left).  <br />
<br />

Out of curiosity, Hawkestone and Peritus are the obvious hated ones, but what's your third &quot;won't group with&quot; guild?<br />
<br />
As an aside, I know some people in Peritus, former guildies, who are good people, reliable, etc. I think it's mostly a few members of the guild and their leadership who've given them a bad name. I was surprised my friends joined a guild with such a bad rep, but they say it's a good guild to be a member of from an internal point of view.<br />
<br />
Partly as a result of that, I try not to judge people according to their tag, I can't think of one guild who's done something so bad that any reasonable person would deguild in disgust. With the possible exception of Hawkestone, depending on how you feel about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">One thing I must state,  while I have my 'policy' very few things with me are cut and dry.<br />
<br />
<br />
The not invite /anon is my policy, but as with most things if very flexiable.<br />
<br />
If time permits, instead of not inviting I will generally ask why anon, and/or take the time to determine their status.<br />
<br />
However, it is much like appearance during an interview.  While I would not 'rule out' you for your appearance (for most jobs),  it does make an impression.<br />
<br />
If a claims to be 63 warrior is anon and there is also a 60 warrior (non-anon), both LFG I will tend to take the non-anon first. They have a better 'appearance' to me.<br />
<br />
Now if needing a tank for a group, and the only one available is a anon person claiming to be a 63 warrior, I would still give them a tell (often ask them to drop anon atleast long enough for me to /who (have also been burned by 'needing a puller of X level' and have that person claim to be, but fight out the gave themself an extra level or two, much to my surprise when adds come) and verify class/level and guild.<br />
<br />
So it is not like I will never group with a /anon.  However it will tend to count as a 'negative appearance' when making judgement.<br />
<br />
Much like if not grouped I am much much more likely to buff somebody that comes up and ask, &quot;Could I have Focus, please&quot;, (does not need to be 'roleplayed' but something approaching a polite 'asking for a favor'') over the person that walks by be and, 'NEED FOCUS', or 'Give me FOCUS', or 'FOCUS NOW'.  To me anyways appearance does matter.<br />
<br />
Now grouped (if I am slacking and not keeping timed, or perhaps fighting dispelling mobs and things tend to get off timer), I have no problem when to save keystrokes in battles it is simple 'Focus down', 'Haste plz', etc.  Short-hand Codes for battle talk are as old as organized combat,  and heck if truly not busy, the hanging out in Tranquality and they 'FOCUS NOW' might still get focus, if I have it memmed, doing nothing better and have the mana, but if there is another asking nicer, they get it first.<br />
<br />
I never expect somebody to buff me, that is not grouped with me.  If they are kind enough (or busniess orientated enough) to offer it as a service, I will take them up on the offer, and will if somebody does not look busy might even ask, but recognize they are not paid to play this game to be 'my help' rather they are paying to play a game and have fun.<br />
<br />
With Anon it is the same thing to me,  I will NOT group with somebody unless I know them, and or can ascertain certain characteristics of them.  While even 'anon' and out of my zone, I could most likely determine what guild they are in:  (if nothing else /who all, find somebody in the same zone as them, ask them to /guildstatus them, etc...)  I am certainly under no obligiation to 'work' to get the information which the game provides by default (and I consider necessary information).  I may chose to go the 'extra mile' and verify something you have chosen to 'hide', I certainly (if it comes to 'rejecting' somebody rather than just taking another as first choice) will ask why somebody is anon and if they can drop (atleast to verify) the satus, but it is not 'my responsiblity' to uncover something you have chosen to hide.<br />
<br />
As a side line, (although long before things like Bazaar (and guild management tool) many of the 'old' guilds had bans on /anon for their members, simply because it did hide you from the guild itself.   Perhaps this is were my prejudice comes from, while /role was not objected to since your guild could still always see who was online, since /anon hid you from the guild alot of them 'back in the day' considered it a de-guilding event if you were caught /anon while in the guild.<br />

For semi-related reasons, when I seek LFGs to fill a group I find people using the /lfg window... regardless of anon/roleplay status it always shows class and level. I've had to many people lie in the past about their level to get into a group. And as for the people who are shouting lfg but don't have their lfg flag on, as far as I am concerned they really aren't lfg (the feature has been in-game for ~3 years - if you are to stupid to figure it out by now, you are to stupid for me to group with).</div></div><hr />

Actually, the /lfg flag has not been in the game for 3 years, let alone the lfg window feature. I think it came out about the same time as PoP. I agree though, it's handy to use, and more and more people are making use of it now. I've even seen people use the &quot;groups looking for players&quot; thing oh, twice now!</div></div><hr />

But back onto the subject of babies or ****ting dogs.<br />
<br />
Having a baby you have to take care of does not make you a unreliable cur, the curse of LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
But having a sleeping child that could wake up any minute or an untrained dog who could crap all over the floor at any minute. And then logging onto EQ and trying to get into a LDoN group knowing your baby could wake up, that DOES make you unreliable and you should not be able to get a group in the future after droping from a few groups.<br />
<br />
Yes fine have a child if you must, Im sure it makes you feel like your the greatest person on the planet, it's not like you need any form of education or training to have one (The oposite seems to be the case, mostly)<br />
<br />
But your attitude of &quot;I have a child, therefore I can join and drop groups whenever I please&quot; is just all wrong. <br />
<br />
All that is being asked is that when you log in and don't have 2 hours with at least a 95% chance of being interupted, do not put up LFG for LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Before she was born, I was a hardcore, five-hour-a-day minimum player.  Now, I might play five hours a week, and those hours are only while she is sleeping.  I don't get involved in groups during daytime naps, because while she might sleep for two hours, she might only sleep for a half hour, and I won't bail out on a group after only a half hour.  I will, however, raid, group, or do a LDON adventure at night after my daughter is down for the night.<br />
<br />
Most nights she doesn't wake up.  Some nights she wakes up, I take a one minute AFK to stick her bink back in her mouth, she goes to sleep again, and all is fine.  However, some nights it's not that easy.  The other night my guild was just getting started with a raid in PoFire.  As I was sitting at the portal waiting for a flagdrag, the baby started crying, and it ended up taking me an hour to calm her down and get her back to bed, so I bailed out on the guild and logged.  If I had been in a LDON adventure, I would have apologized and left the group to take care of my baby.  It sucks, but life happens, and 90% of the people I've met in EQ are mature enough to accept that.<br />
<br />
Are people supposed to give up their hobbies when they have children?  Am I supposed to stop playing EQ because there is a chance I might have to take care of my daughter in the night?

You need to mellow out, its just a game. Sometimes RL things happen, people have to leave. If it isn't your only healer or slower, carry on with 5. No biggie, its just a little slower, thats all. And if its a critical class, then just move on. Chances are you have just started, so you haven't lost THAT much time. And if the person you take is from a raiding guild, everyone knows that if they are called for a raid, they are going to go. Given a choice between taking someone from a guild you've never heard of or someone from one of the top guilds on the server, 9 times out of 10 a group will go for the high end toon. For the very simple reason that a time or elemental player typically brings so much more to the group, both in terms of experience and abilities, that most people are willing to take the risk that they might cut out for a raid. Its not like it happens all the time anyway  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is a reasonable chance that I will need to take repeated AFK's, I don't get involved in a group.  When I do accept a group invite, it is with a full expectation that I will not have to go AFK.  Occasionally, I need to take one AFK of a minute's length.  To date, none of these short AFK's have inconvenience my group at all, because I leave after a pull is slowed and I'm back before it's dead.<br />
<br />
Rarely, I will have to leave a group because I need more than that one minute AFK, similar to the way you would leave a group if you got an emergency phone call or fell down and broke your leg on the way back from getting a beer.  This has actually never happened to me in a pickup group, and less than a handful of times with guild groups/raids.  My guild is fully aware and accepting of my situation and have no problems with it, since many of them are parents as well and have done the same thing.  This is where my &quot;mature&quot; comment applies.  If you are too immature to understand that sometimes life bites you in the butt and you have to leave a group, then I don't want to group with you anyway.</div></div><hr />

Tone it down.  Just because you have unresolved issues with an overboard HATRED of children doesn't mean you need to vent it here.  A child is just one of many &quot;life&quot; things (job, spouse, neighbors, etc) that could come up and disturb your precious EQ time.  <br />
<br />
The key difference is if its the exception, or the normal behavior.  Constantly leaving groups would indicate that the player is irresponsible, doing it one time doesn't.  Just like one rude post wouldn't have made you look like a complete jerk... but you've moved past that now.<br />

Craig<br />
<br />
It didn't seem to me that the original poster hated children.  In fact, I'd say Craig comes across as much more of a jerk for making such an absurd/inflammatory comment than did the previous poster.  The way I read the original comment was a strong annoyance at people who have children and believe it is incumbent upon the rest of us to grant them special dispensation from common courtesy, using their children as justification.<br />
<br />
Jora essentially implied that anyone who would be annoyed by someone leaving a LDoN group to tend their children is immature.  Mrens got pissed and called her a &quot;unreliable cur&quot;.  The &quot;cur&quot; part was totally uncalled for.  But the unreliable part is clearly true, at least in comparison to people who plan ahead and make sure that only an unpredictable emergency of some kind will drag them away (showing a lot more respect for groupmates).<br />
<br />
Craig then put the icing on the cake.  Saying &quot;tone it down&quot; then following it up by essentially calling anyone who disagrees with him a &quot;child hater&quot;.  Way to go Craig... really doing your part to &quot;tone it down&quot; there aren't you?<br />
<br />
This whole thing is really simple.  When you join a group for a LDoN session and don't warn the group that you have some potential RL issues which could drag you away in the middle (whether it be your child, your dog, your job, or whatever), you're at least implying by ommission that you intend to stay for the full 90 minutes.  If you then after not warning your group decide to leave for a reason which is entirely predictable (baby crying, on-call at work and got called, dog just ate 15 pounds of ground beef and needs to take a dump, whatever), then you are at the very least being somewhat inconsiderate of your group.<br />
<br />
We can all agree that RL issues take priority over a game, but the least everyone can do is at least try to take into account that your predictable RL issue can very easily inconvenience 5 other people and make their leisure time much less fun for them.  So have the decency to warn them ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

Running off because your guild &quot;needs&quot; you (you go to the bank and hang out asking for buffs and groups) is a no-no.  Going to a legit raid is ok.<br />

All I have to say on the guild thing is that my guild is a faimly style guild that has grown to such a size that we still dont require people to attend raids but we have enough peeps on to take most mobs we want ( we are in VT right now ). most of the raiding guild have a raid requirement becouse thay want to keep the guild as small as possable so thay need most of the peeps thay got to do raids. most of my guild has kids, are married, are not in collage, are in some jobs that you can not scedule a set time for ( like firefighters, military, Field technicions, hospitiles, tech support types ), and are encuraged that if your felling burned out to take breaks down shift play times or other such messures. just down to what you expect of guilds. that high end game goals is aways going to be there and is not going anywhere so whats you rush to getting to it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jors asked &quot;if one must give up their hobbies because they have children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrens said YES!.  In caps, in bold, with the exclaimation point.<br />
<br />
I feel that is a very hateful disposition, and quite absurd.  The semantic argument could be made that its hateful to the parents, and would be supported by other statements such as &quot;Yes fine have a child if you must, Im sure it makes you feel like your the greatest person on the planet&quot; which had nothing to do with the topic, but were included as personal attacks.<br />
<br />
I saw no evidence that Jora had not taken resonable precautions to avoid having her child inconvience her EQ group.  If I missed that, please point it out and I'll be more than willing to conceede this point to both Mrens and you.  What I did see was multiple rude statements by Mrens that ignored the precautions Jora did take and mentioned in her post.  Since resonable precautions were not enough, I assume that Mrens had problems with someone playing EQ who had children.<br />
<br />
But to be fair, I'll offer my applogy to Mrens and the board for the tone of my post.  I won't appologize for the fact I have children.  I don't want &quot;special dispensation from common courtesy&quot;, but nor do I wish to quite playing EQ simply because my daughters exist.<br />
<br />
I'm amazed and disappointed that so few seem to have taken offense to the &quot;YES!&quot; answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">My opinion is if the guy is from a raiding guild, he will do 10x better than someone not on a raiding guild, so with the risk of him being called away, you get the advantage of a much better person.<br />
<br />
For example 2 ogre warriors 65, the raiding guild will come 9.5k hps with blade of war with 2000 AC etc compared to a non guilded who if you are lucky is using his epic with 8k hps? it's a big difference..<br />
<br />
A good raiding druid will have a 5k mana pool and 6k+ hps compare that to whatever a regular druid is 4khps 4k mana pool and all that extra ft over the non raiding one..<br />
<br />
Lastly, everyone plays for fun, but someone in a raiding guild is probably 100x more upset than the 5 guys he left because he gets a loss /shudder!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Yes it is a proven fact that babies DO NOT wake up unexspected.

That 4 year olds dont wake up, walk in and say &quot;Mommy, Daddy my tummy hurts&quot; and proceed to toss thire cookies all over the carpet..<br />
<br />
All of the idiots that dont have young kids, and think that its wrong for someone to go AFK or leave a group becuse of thire kids. Need to sit down and shut up. Grow up or better yet grow a brain.<br />
<br />
And has a F.Y.I. I myself do not have any children at this time. But I at least have enugh commen sinces to know that things happen ESPICALY where young kids are concered. If you dont like kids then by all means feel free to go and get yerself spayed. But you have no right to advocate child abuse or to talk down to people who do have children.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I were on call for work, I'd warn my group that I might get called away and not be even remotely offended if they chose to find someone else.  Someone on call for their children should similarly warn their groups ahead of time.  If you don't have the courtesy to do so, you shouldn't be surprised if people start avoiding you as unreliable or inconsiderate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">My guild calls raids without prior notice, forces you to leave adventures within 15min, and deducts raids points if you don't. This is a problem with guild leaders not with individuals. One person leading one guild can cause tons of people on tons of days to screw over their groups. I wouldn't be surprised if guilds start getting bad reps on this, and people start refusing to group with guilds that make their people leave.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence why I will never, ever be in a raiding guild. Oh dears, I may not get UberGear(tm). I'll also never have to put up with crap like that or be expected to answer to someone else's whims.<br />
<br />
When I do a LDoN, it's always based off a guild or alliance group, but we usually fill one or two slots with outside people. I gaurantee bailing for a raid will get you put on the &quot;Don't Group With Again&quot; list.<br />
<br />
While there will always be something that can happen that means you really do need to leave, ditching so you can go raid isn't one of 'em. If you agree to a LDoN group, you are commiting to spending the next 90+ minutes to complete the mission. Much like the person above who doesn't care who gets screwed so his precious unannounced raid can happen, I don't care if your raid fails because you aren't there. If it was scheduled previously, you shouldn't have joined a LDoN group, and if it just came up, they should have planned better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">The answer is fairly simple (and stated earlier I believe). Tell your group (before the adventure begins) that you have children that are asleep, and the possibility exists, that you will have to go AFK.  If they accept you, they have NO reason to be mad.<br />
<br />
Easy enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I applaud the parents who are at least willing to go AKF to take care of their children.  Even if it's not an &quot;emergency&quot; and just to look in and make sure they're alright, I'll gladly spend the two minutes canning from half mana to full mana and refreshing buffs.  It's worth it that much to me.  I'd rather lose by those two minutes and know the person went AFK because they were a good parent that checks on their kids than to find out they didn't even think about it when we succeed.</div></div><hr />

I have a pager within 10 feet of me... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<br />
I'm not divorced, so I'm &quot;on call&quot; for kids... 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  (What is &quot;on call&quot; for a kid?)<br />
<br />
Very rarely is it ever an issue with EQ.  I think its been a group &quot;interruption&quot; less than 3 times in 3 years.  Never has it been an issue on a raid level event.<br />
<br />
If a player is unreliable, the rl issue is irrelevant as far as EQ is concrned.<br />
Why is the details of my personal life your business (or anyone elses) in game?  Where do we draw the line.  <br />

/tell uberwarrior what equipment, how many AAs, what power company/internet provider do you use, whats the MTF rating on your hard drive, are you prone to any epileptic ceasures, what blood type, when was the lasttime you used the bathroom, number 1 or 2, whats the crime rate in your neighborhood, is your significant other likely to make a booty call, what video driver do you use, are you taking any medications, has your account left your possession since the time you entered the airport, is your EQ account paid up, do you promise to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?  For your convience, a group request information form has been setup at www.getaclue.com (edit: oh wow, that really is a site!)<br />
<br />
I still think the bottom line is, you judge the player by their actions in the game...  You don't need kids or a job to be an unreliable flake in game... nor does having kids or a job mean you are automatically unreliable.  Asking for a &quot;disclaimer&quot; or a warning, implies that it does. <br />

<br />
WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!  Read the darned thread.  I don't want a disclaimer from you because you have kids.  I want one if there's a decent chance of your not being able to commit 90 relatively interruption free minutes to your group, for WHATEVER reason.  If you're in a raiding guild and you must leave immediately upon raids being called, I want a warning, especially if they raid frequently.  If you work for the power company, you have a beeper, and there's a hurricane blowing in, I want a warning that you might get called into work.  If you have a dog who's gonna crap on your carpet if you don't walk him when he starts scratching the door, I want a warning.  If you have kids and your spouse resents EQ and is going to refuse to be the primary care giver for 90 minutes, you might want to give your group a heads up. <br />
<br />
How difficult is it for you to type a half a dozen words before being invited into a group?  I don't want your freakin' life story, I just want a warning that you might have to leave if you're in a situation where foreseeable events may very well take you away.  Not giving that sort of warning makes someone an inconsiderate unreliable person and I'm gonna avoid him in the future.<br />
<br />
Sounds like Craig isn't unreliable and doesn't need to give such a warning.  A friend of mine is in fact very unreliable and ALWAYS has the consideration for us to remind us that he's on parent duty and might have to leave if the baby starts fussing.  And most of us already know anyhow and don't mind.  Look how far a nice little warning goes.  Instead of being considered an unreliable jerk, my friend is thought of kindly as a good parent.  All because he takes a moment to mention that he's on parent duty.<br />
<br />
If you think you being a good parent who has primary care duty with your kids is a good way to behave, you're right.  What's a bad way to behave is doing so and not bothering to mention to your groupmates that RL is kind of hectic at that moment and you might get dragged away.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I can't see how anyone can possibly be arguing against the suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">People want to feel ok about NOT telling potential groups that they'll likely be interrupted -- because they don't want to be refused the group.  It's more important to them to POSSIBLY get a dungeon group than to think about the fact that they'll POSSIBLY ruin the experience for five other people.  It's selfish not to warn your group, hands down.  If you're too self-absorbed to realize that, then I feel almost as bad for you as I feel for the people who end up stranded in a dungeon because of you.<br />
<br />
Now, people blowing this out of proportion and comparing their 2 minute AFK to someone who gates, camps, /quits out, or just stops helping for prolonged periods of time -- get a grip, nobody's talking about you.<br />
<br />
And for those lacking in critical reading skills - nobody cares if you give up EQ or not.  But taking on an LDoN mission when you're gonna bomb it for the group with your AFK is rude.  Rude.  Rude.  Stop making excuses.  It's rude.  There's a lot of EQ out there where they'll barely notice the odd 5 minute AFK here or there.  LDoN ain't like that.  Think of someone else for a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">People who go AFK for long periods (5 min+), unless the entire group is on a break are being unfair to the other group members.  I don't care if it's a pet, a baby, a cow, a case of the runs, what-ever.<br />
<br />
But so what?!  Life happens guys.  This is a frickin game.  Ah, your precious ranking is screwed up, cry me a river.<br />
<br />
I really do not think people quit out of the group all the time.  There are many people that play the game that have other obligations.  So you may frequently find a person who ends up having an obligation to deal with.<br />
<br />
I get calls from work that require my full attention for a few min at a time.  It happens rarely, but it happens.  I am going to play the game, and if it happens, I'll be apologetic, but I won't feel sorry for having started a LDoN adventure.  Deal with it.<br />
<br />
As a parting shot, do you think the kind of person who would join a group knowing that it was likely they would have to bail and did not state it up front will read this post and actually change their behavior?  I think the vast majority of the posters on this thread are reasonable people taking reasonable risks when playing the game.  It's the few jerk wads that know they only have 15 minutes to play, but somehow think they can complete an adventure in that time that are the problem.  Their version of reality is so skewed that they would not think that this post was about them at all.<br />
