<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 2 question: <br />
<br />
1. Do people 2 box much on PvP, and if so, how well does it work for you? Shaman SK or something mebbe?<br />
<br />
2. What class, handled by a good PvP'er of course, stands the best chance against the most different classes?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and looking forward to taking out all my pent up blue server agression /grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bard is the PVP god<br />
<br />
selo's, resist songs, MR debuffs/slows/snares, AE's, DD's, cancel magic song, some melee...<br />
<br />
coupled with a shaman a bard would be a nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A well played, even modestly equipped SK can kill anything or shadowstep out of a ganking if things don't go well.  Fear (for pets), darkness line, shadowstep and harm touch are all extremely useful PvP abilities.  Make sure you invest in resist gear (MR first) and try to kill in groups whenever possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to second the SK.. very close to one shot kill and not easy to kill.  Bards are great at &quot;disruption&quot; but aren't great pvp'ers they can hardly kill anyone but can definitely train the hell out of people and ruin raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Multiboxers are generally easier to kill in PvP, especially once most people know that you 2box.   So I wouldn't really reccommend it unless you just plan on having your healer lev'd on top of buildings the whole time and just run in range for heals. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There isn't such a thing as the 'best' pvp class. It changes depending what you are going up against and what the setting is.<br />
<br />
However, at lvl65 id say these are all very strong classes:<br />
paladin<br />
sk<br />
bard<br />
enchanter<br />
<br />
After the archery nerf i wouldn't consider rangers in the top anymore.<br />
<br />
Shaman ranks somewhere in the lower half, after the above mentioned and necromancer and druid.</div></div><hr />
