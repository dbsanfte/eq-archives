<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">that we should get some sort of group heal? I'm quite proud to be a shaman, just wish we had SOMETHING. My guild is about done with VT, and we are doing the pre-elemental fights now, and any group heal would help. Even like group chloroblast. BST have paragon of spirit(1200hp 450mana over a few ticks) mana-free as an AA, druids have spirit of the wood. An AA ability to make chloroblast or Quiescence hit our group(every 12 mins or so perhaps?) would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Just something I was thinking about. I'm really happy with all these recent changes though and figured I might as well chime in with this while their changing stuff! Anyone agree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yea , to be 100% cxlear off the bat , im totaly content , but this seems like a natural progression in our abilities.<br />
<br />
Group Q , got my vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think that the best we would get would be like that lvl 44 mini torpor except group style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm..I agree with the group Q, but I would vote against a group Torpor or Stoicism.  The reason?  I 've only had Stoicism for about 5 days now and Im already so sick and tired of having melees bitch and complain when I try and save thier sorry ass by healing them with it.  I swear that they would rather die and lose experience than to suffer a 30% atk slow and snare for 24 farkin seconds.  <br />
<br />
I can only imagine the flack I would get if I did that to a whole group....<br />
<br />
Ive taken to only healing myself, the cleric, or casters with it just to save myself the grief.  Oh, and dogdog...but he never complains about anything.  Hes truly a mans best friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does the slow from Stoicism count against their total attack speed, or over-ride haste and count towards their base+item haste speed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well...Ive tried to see the difference on my SK.  It seems to take the unbuffed speed...so whatever the delay on thier weapon.  <br />
<br />
In not sure on that though. Maybe someone that has torpor and done some tests could answer that. I could run a search, but Im to lazy right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Group torpor/stoicism just wouldn't be useful.  Melees don't like it.  I never torpor melees except POSSIBLY during downtime, and then I mention that they can just click it off if they want.<br />
<br />
Group chloroplast would be more like it.  500HP heal, low cast time, long range group AE.  Not as good as pallys but still useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heal over times are our thing though and being that a BST is essentialy a modified shaman and has this ability already as a AA , it all just seems to fit that we have a group Quiscence style AA/spell. Let the pallies keep one of their greater abilities as their own.<br />
<br />
Besides , i dont know what level your talking about , but at 65 group CB would be useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again , not complaining here , but it would be cool ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman group heals seem a bit doubtful in my eyes.  Especially heals over time.<br />
<br />
Clerics received Ethereal Elixer at level 60 from SoL.  Before that they had heals from level 34 Word of Health (100hp heal) to level 60 Word of Redemption (Group CH).  Word of Replenishment was a PoP spell (Group heal 2500 and cure for the same cost of Group CH 1100) that seems rather lame to me.  Ethereal Elixer is the ONLY heal over time group spell clerics have.  Paladins have two I believe.  Druids have the AA spirit of wood ability but no other group heals.<br />
<br />
Now the ONLY cleric group heal that can be Mass Group Buffed is Ethereal Elixer.  This is limiting as it should be but still a powerfull tactic.  Now imagine shamans with the ability to MGB Torpor.  That would be highly dangerous and exploitable.  So if you pick Quiescence for a group heal to avoid the snare/slow it steps right into the cleric territory.  Then how much mana are you willing to have it cost; 975, 1100, 1500?<br />
<br />
S: Torpor is 200 mana for a 1200 heal but has restrictions.<br />
S: Quiescence is 200 mana for a 1200 heal but no restrictions.  <br />
C: Celestial Elixer is 300 mana for a 1000 heal.  And was what EE was based off of.<br />
C: Ethereal Elixer is 975 mana for a 1200 group heal.<br />
C: Supernal Elixer is 400 mana for a 2000 heal.  <br />
<br />
All of these can be extended with Spell Casting Reinforcement and SCRMastery.  Shaman do not have a very linear progression of Heals over Time.  Clerics have a very obvious one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Does the slow from Stoicism count against their total attack speed, or over-ride haste and count towards their base+item haste speed?<br />
<br />
Any slow - even a 1% slow - completely overrides all item and spell based hastes.  It doesn't remove the buff, so if something is hasted pre slow it is also hasted post slow.<br />
<br />
So - taking as an example me.  :)  Ceris is at 36% item haste and generally 50% spell haste, so his mainhand swings right around every 1.1 seconds.  If I hit him with stoicism, that takes his mainhand to every 2.8 seconds or so... it feels like I've completely stopped attacking.  When Stoicism wears off, I'm back up to full speed.</div></div><hr />
