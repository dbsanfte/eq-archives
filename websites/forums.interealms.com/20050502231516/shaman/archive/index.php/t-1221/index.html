On my server it seems as though the quest giver is being killed by a GM.  I've heard that on others, he is still around, but with a &quot;!&quot; in his name, and broken.<br />
<br />
I guess it's bone chips for me now.  But I will wait til they make it possible for barb's to do the cudgels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm... I bought a bunch of knives but haven't got around to turning them in yet. that's too bad, I could really use some faction in cabilis for my rogue just to buy/sell and bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The quest still works you just cant buy the knives.  If you bought them already you are golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did the quest 2 nights ago lol, in fact I stayed doing it even when my guild needed me in Ntov until it was done.   I was sure they were gonna nerf this thing quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I worked on it myself a bit the other night, did neriak, then turned in 35 stacks of knives.  Only got me to dubious to the crusaders though.  Oh well, I know a necro with the meat to bone class AA skill that I might bribe/beg/harrass if they fix it so I could do the cudgels.<br />
<br />
After just recently assisting a friend with farming 8000 bonechips in Kurns and making disposable newbies to MQ faction quests... I can say that this knives quest was way too easy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">quest still works on RZ. realized the knives were no drop and had to go buy some for my rogue. the vendor was still there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Way too easy in comparision to what?  Jabbing hot needles through your eyeballs?<br />
<br />
Harvesting 8000 bonechips is meaningful ... why?<br />
<br />
I understand there should be some difficulty associated with obtaining faction, but that one is over the line in my book.  I wish I had had time to buy the knives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is this about? what knives? This is a new one I havnt heard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The bonechip quest is bull****.     I hated leveling up in Kurns with my enchanter when we had lvl 50s mowing down all the mobs in the zone I was trying ot kill, just so they could get faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">damn...the vendor wouldnt sell them to me and i didnt have time to do the red wine quest.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gart, I agree that 8000 bonechips is way too freaking much work by far.<br />
<br />
But it seriously took me like 45 minutes including travel times and turnins to faction Neriak, via wine quest, high enough to use the troll vendor, then port to NK, run to RM buy knives, port to DL, run to lake of ill omen and turn in the knives.   45 minutes to get to non-kos to both cabalis and neriak.<br />
<br />
I just think 45 minutes of running around and a few plat is too easy.   The exact same way 3 weeks of bonechip collecting was way too hard. - only my opinion.<br />
<br />
I wish they could put in some kind of meaningful quest to do faction rather than slaughtering in Kurns, or buying knives from a vendor and then handing them in.  <br />
<br />
But hey, I'm a big hypocrit and took advantage of this while I could.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think it would be easiest if they removed both the bonechip AND the explorer knife quests.<br />
<br />
You wanna cudgel?  start an Iksar.  <br />
<br />
No one would be complaining about mind numbing farming, because it wouldn't be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">people have factioned Cabilis in the past for a place to bank and train Snapdragn.<br />
<br />
The majority of shaman's can't do the cudgel as is, anyways.  From what I understand indifferent is not high enough faction to do past the second cudgel, and that is the best non-cazic worshippers can get.  right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From what I understand indifferent is not high enough faction to do past the second cudgel, and that is the best non-cazic worshippers can get. <br />
If I'm not mistaken, from reading the original thread at Monkly Business, agnostic monks could get up to warmly and get the shackle quests, and again, if I'm not mistaken, Vah'Shiir shaman are all agnostic, so they may also be able to do the Cudgel quests as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry Mojo.  Guess we should have done Neriak that night.  Still think your DE mask should have been good enough for faction, but what do I know? :p<br />
<br />
A human monk guildmate did the knives turn-in and is presently working through all the shackles now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Am I reading this right in that the red wine quest in Neriak is not 'nerfed' as well?<br />
<br />
I am glad I spent time doing that one already.  The guards and merchants love me.  If only I could do something about the cleric guild....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wine quest won't be nerfed because using it to change faction requires a few hundred platinum as well as initial work on Dark Bargainers to speak to him in the first place (unless you use invis and other tricks etc).</div></div><hr />
