<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other than the &quot;official&quot; Sony boards, are there any other sites besides this one for us to use as we level?  While I have seen some good info here, it hasn't approached the amount of info for EQ2 yet.<br />
<br />
Are there other sites that outdo this one now for Mystics/Defiliers, or is this the best one out there for us still?<br />
<br />
I'd like to keep us here, because of the familiarity of the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It won't take long for someone to put one together unless we get off our duff, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
The SOE boards are good sources of information, but because of the moderators and design, it is very easy for information to be lost there.  Additionally, there isn't much structure to those boards, something that Crucible could do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been browsing this site for a while:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've found the quality of information at EQ2 Preists to be pretty sub-par when compared to here. The discussions going on around here are much more in depth than anything that's been showing up at EQ2 Priests. Although I check those boards from time to time to see if anything interesting comes up, I'm sticking with the Crucible as my primary Shaman resource.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah.. EQ2 Priests &quot;Looks&quot; pretty, but I've found a better wealth of knowledge here.<br />
<br />
I wish I had the spare time to devote to helping a site like this get their databases and sections together, but it's a crazy holiday this year!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looks like this is still the place for us, and I appreciate those who are contributing.  I decided to stick with a shaman/mystic for EQ2, and I'm quite pleased so far.  I'm lvl 22, but have taken a break to start working on tradeskilling (jeweler), which has postponed my leveling for about another week.  If you hated tradeskilling in EQ1, take a look at it this time.  It's pretty well thought out, and not the PITA that it was in EQ1.  One stop shopping for devices, a broker or merchant to buy things at that you need, and abundant &quot;nodes&quot; to find the dropped components you need.  Actually, if I would have known about it before, I probably would have been an artisan, since it doesn't impact your ability to level. <br />
<br />
I agree with Sudedor that we (either us or the site) need to get off our duffs to keep this site viable.  I know I don't have the posts/rep here to make an impact, but you might, Sud.  It's an opportunity for this site to continue the work it's done, and not die in the months to come.  I know EQ1 is still viable, but I'm probably going to cancel billing on my 4 accounts this month, because EQ2 appears to have it's act together thus far, contrary to what many of us thought was going to happen.  Although, I wasn't too happy about yesterday :confused: <br />
<br />
Stuff like the spoiler info for the 20+ quest armor needs to be stickied, as will other info as it comes along.  I'm liking what we can do in this game so far.</div></div><hr />
