<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far I have been pretty disapointed. It seems like everything we are getting is for lvl 65 or requires 10+aa each. Knowing my luck they'll add a spell or two that requires 100 misions worth of points to get. Anyone elses take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">supposedly the new cann spell will be 1492 adventure points, as rumor states.<br />
i hope it just a rumor, i've got only 700 points after buying bane left.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont have time for LDoN normally because I raid rather then xp.  There needs be a way to get them w/o points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, I wont see that spell for a very long time if its bought with adventure points.  Would rather it come from a Rune or quest, like a beefed up LoY type.  I enjoyed LDoN for about a week, now I would rather not be forced to do them for a spell that is a sorely needed upgrade.  Just my 2cps though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">New spells are always hard to get when an expansion first comes out.  With luclin you had to kill (what were at the time) pretty formidable mobs just to get khura's, let alone ancients, but about halfway through luclin you could get khura's with just a few groups or 10k plat.  Remember runes?  People screamed about how hard it was to get even ethereal spells because they didn't have a full set of them a week in to the expansion.  A month in to it, though, I was destroying ethereals because no one needed them.  People thought they would never get their runes, but now anyone who has been 65 for a while and spent a few weeks in BoT has a full spellbook.  Your spells aren't going to just fall in to your outstretched hands, but I really doubt they will be that difficult to get.  Even if you don't get them right away, it will only get easier.  The less people need spells, typically the easier it is to get them.  Remember rune spells for 150k?  Now they're 20k if you wait for a reasonable seller.<br />
<br />
If it is as straightforward as &quot;spend 1492 adventure points&quot; I'll be really (pleasantly) surprised.  Remember when PoP came out and there was a flurry of rumors on what you had to do to get ethereal parchments and where they might drop?  It'd be great if you knew exactly how long it was going to take you to work for your spells.  You don't have to deal with bad dice and constantly losing specs/runes, and you don't have to deal with hoping that your rare spell drops off of your raid target.  You just do 30 adventures and buy the damn thing.  How many times did we suggest a system like that for torpor/malo, where you could just buy it for an exorbiant amount of plat from a vendor, or do some long stupid quest?  This is much much better.<br />
<br />
If it really is 1492, that isn't bad at all.  I spent about three months trying to fill my spellbook after PoP came out.  If all I have to do is win 30 adventures x 2, it'll take me two weeks.  Even doing just two a day (thats two hours tops unless you've got a horrible group) that will only take a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you rather have to go through a variation of runes?  Or have it drop from raid targets that your guild won't be killing for months?  Or better yet, do you want it to just magically appear in your inventory when you install GoD?<br />
<br />
Think about the following spells and how you got them when they were new:<br />
<br />
Poxx of Bertoxx<br />
Ancient Scourge<br />
Blood of Saryrn<br />
Bane<br />
<br />
Which was the easiest?<br />
<br />
Offer a suggestion or at least meaningful commentary rather than just mindless whining and account-cancellation threats.</div></div><hr />

With ldon I know if I complate an adv I get points towards something I can buy, rather than farming mob xyz for 1 month hoping to get lucky on a random roll. yikes!<br />
<br />
At least with point system you can pick and choose.<br />
<br />
Spell system and level sucks. You want canni 4? level to 58<br />
<br />
You want canni 5 anytime after lvl 59 you can get it, it's up to you - lvl to 65 first or stop at 60 and get it, it's totally up to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
You guys that whine, gheesh....<br />
<br />
Why don't you find a game where you can pay $500.00 and get max level character, all skills and all spells - just get it over with. <br />
<br />
Oh right... Then you'll whine cause you have nothing to do.</div></div><hr />

if i dont agree with it being that many points thats my opinion and i can and will state my opinion at any time i want. wether its right or wrong it is my opinion<br />

yes, i would prefer it to be a rune, or a drop, or a even a quested spell.<br />
at least then the people that dont have time to do 2 or 3 adventures every day still have a chance at this.<br />
<br />
i personaly dont have time to do 2 or 3 a day, so in cancelling my preorder for GoD im not whining, im simply not spending money on something that i cant use, just basic common sense<br />
<br />
if it were something that were a major upgrade, or something new gave us an extreme increase in what we had. then yes, make it hard as hell to get. although it is a nice upgrade and good to see actually getting something useful out of this expansion i just dont see enough of an upgrade in this spell to make it worth 1500 points</div></div><hr />

That's a much better post.  Now I understand why you don't want it to be bought via points.  I still disagree and think that points would be best for everyone, but at least I can respect your opinion because I know why you think that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Omg some of you are the biggest whiners I've ever seen.  I swear they could have it sold on a vendor for 1cp and some of you would bitch how its too hard.<br />
<br />
After seeing some of these posts I hope its a drop from a bad ass mob in a keyed zone just so I can hear all you that complained about how hard 1492 points is whine when you can't get the spell.  The same way so many bitched about the Rune system being unfair.<br />
<br />
1492 points makes it accessable to ANYONE that wants it.  All they have to do is do the adventures.  Hell you get xp and loot while doing it.  If someone doesn't have the time to earn 1492 points then they won't be getting it under a Rune based system at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What about those of us who have limited time would rather raid with our guild then do adventures?  1492 points is not very accessable to us.  I'm fine with the idea of putting the spells in the adventure system as long as thats not the only way to get them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And btw, Blood of Saryrn was the easiest to get.  Dont much time for LDoN (and when I do, I'm LFA for 30+min), Pox is just to rare of drop for a lvl58 spell and have yet to see a copy of Ancient Scrounge drop in VT (though I have seen multiples of other class spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And btw, Blood of Saryrn was the easiest to get.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity, were you 60 already when PoP came out, and in a guild that immediately pushed in to PoP?  If you leveled up after PoP first came out, I can see how blood of saryrn would be the easiest to get because by that time you could just buy it.  If you were in a raiding guild that started getting runes right away, I could also see how runes turned in by your guild (or that you won with a /random, depending on your system) could net you an easy Blood of Saryrn.  I was 60 and in a raiding guild, but we didn't go for PoP right away, we were still mucking around in ssra.  We didn't start getting runes for a while, and spells in bazaar were outrageously expensive for the first few months.  Bane, though, I got the second week of LDoN.  It would have been the first day if people had done the camp I wanted to do :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sunrise_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd rather the rune/parch vs the points system myself.<br />
<br />
*Boggle* You still had to hunt IN PoP to get the runes/parch.<br />
The only difference is since it is not RANDOM which spell you will get the result is no drop. So you will have to hunt in the zone rather than buy the spell overpriced from somebody that won it in a roll and cant use it.<br />
<br />
Personally I would much rather do the points than have somebody that can not even use spells win the roll on a rune then sell me the spell.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of earning my spells vs buying them at some insane outrageous price.</div></div><hr />

It also cost almost a third less money.  If they start selling different class spells at different instanced camps its going to be extremely tough to get the canni as well as any other spells within a reasonable amount of time.</div></div><hr />

that is the problems with ldon ... you have people asking me &quot; want a tak adventure i need new plate ^_^;; kekeke? &quot; <br />
who has &quot;lfg ec ldon only&quot; <br />
then i get those people who do this, guess what?! were doing hard !!<br />
and im the only healer ....<br />
or i get this one &quot;want a ruj grp&quot; me &quot;YAY ! yes i do !&quot; them &quot;ok come&quot; i get there .. its just me and him waiting for &quot;phantom players&quot;.<br />
ldon was fun, then became trash, its only fun if you have 24/7 to play and 5 other friends who do nothing but that.<br />

Why do you think people are complaining?<br />
<br />
WHAT?! N00bs not even in EP's can get the SAME SPELLS?!  *&amp;($$ U SONY! <br />
<br />
LDON is a godsend to the casual or frustrated powergamer. It allows a person to not only tailor his or her equipment (and pretty decent equipment it is), but allows for a CERTAINTY in that IF you spend a certain amount of time you WILL receive an upgrade.<br />
<br />
There is more than one way to skin a cat. For those who enjoy raiding 24/7 - woot - more power to ya.  But that should not be the ONLY way to advance and or better your skills / equipment / spellbook.<br />
<br />
I love  LDON. 102-4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have spent quite a while doing adventures, but due to people generally hating EF and refusing to go there I still haven't got anywhere near the 1492 points to get my nice chain armour...<br />
<br />
So I foresee this spell taking ages to get. Shame, as it's an upgrade that I would like.<br />
<br />
But that's a side issue. This is a spell about which I would say &quot;It's damn well TIME we got this upgrade&quot; not just for class balance but for class development.<br />
<br />
The shaman class *needs* this spell as an upgrade and yet Sony make us jump through (boring) hoops for it, as well as paying through the nose for it.<br />
<br />
Something about that is not quite right.</div></div><hr />

       Yes i prefer runes system ,because we can buy them. Alone spell will cost 1500 points ? how many for all spell ? 10.000 ? it's insane ,specially sony's(at opposite of verant) exp zone are pathetic.</div></div><hr />

If I have 100k pp lying around from ornate farming or whatever, I should be able to buy my spells.  Money should be a viable way of acquiring spells (as well as raiding, finding runes/parchs etc.).  This bit of *having* to get points within a particular expansion is just awful, as it requires a significant time investment within the expansion no matter what.<br />
<br />
Very poorly thought out.  Two years from now, you may still want to grab Bane, but you'll have to spend hours in crappy old LDoN zones to get it.  All these spells should be droppable, imo.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, it is Everquest.  <br />
<br />
Some little quest to get it would make more sense to me.  I actually thought the LoY quests for Blood and Stoicism weren't too bad, although it is a bit too much of a bottleneck on release.  <br />
<br />
LDoN was designed by Code Monkeys and Accountants.  It's a number cruncher approach to game play and reward and I find very boring as a result.</div></div><hr />

I was actually in a smaller guild that that did BoT a whole lot so we did get a few runes a day.  <br />
<br />
But forcing people who spend to majority of there time raiding to go and do LDON for there spells is not right either.  There needs to be a middle ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Bottom line, Sony wants everyone to play more and longer.  The only way to ensure this is by making it so that you can only get critical spells and items through hours of adventuring.  The beauty of LDoN and now GoD is that you can not buy your new spells, you have to grind to get them.<br />
<br />
This is both good and bad.  It eliminates the &quot;chance&quot; element of the parchment and rune turn-ins which can be very frustrating and gives you a set goal for attaining the item in question.  <br />
<br />
However, it can also be frustrating for us (me included) who rarely have time for 1-2 adventures a night and therefore it takes several months of play to get the items we need.<br />
<br />
Worse, because points have to be earned in the specific zone in which the item is sold, it takes MUCH longer to get the item than if you could use points earned anywhere on everything.  I understand why they did this, again it makes us play longer, but it is a royal pain to wait for a group in a specific  zone (and no, I don't have a guild or complete group of friends that are always on when I am and ready to do an adventure in the zone I need).<br />
<br />
So, bottom line, this is good for some of you, those with the time and friends to get a group into an adventure in a specific zone when needed, but not good for those of us with more limited time or resources.  We all know how bad pick-up groups suck.<br />
<br />
Sony will generate their revenue, and unfortunately, some of us will never see the new spells.  If they were droppable it would go a long way in solving the problem, I could farm pp or trade items for them, but alas, that would not give Sony the additional hours of my time that they are looking for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, I can do the math, so I know how long it takes.  And, you assume that the one hard adventure a day will always be in the camp you need, good luck.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with my personal commitments (wife, 3 kids and my own business), no guild and only a handfull of friends I normally play with, who are not always on when I am) I rarely do more than 1 LDoN &quot;regular&quot; adventure a week.  Yes, 1 regular mission a week, and at level 56, I get a whole 20-22 pts.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it won't be as bad when I get to level 65, but trying to get a pickup group for hard adventures in a specific camp when you only have a total of 60-90 min playing time is almost impossible to do, even if you try starting your own group (been there, done that, many times).<br />
<br />
Like I said, make them droppable and I'd have a much better chance of getting it.  Just the reality for a casual player.<br />

Just seems even doing LDoN normals would take less time than trying too farm rune droping camps . Esp at level 56 . I dont know of many Rune droping mobs that a group of mid 50's can farm .<br />
My guess is that these spells . if sellable will be prived VERY high by ppl in Bazaar . At least at first . So farming the plat as a level 56 shaman would take a lot of time as well .<br />
<br />
Not trying too seem asinine here . Im just failing too see why completeing 30 or so LDoN normal adventures is seen as being so much harder than farming a rune in say BoT .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Still the point is not everyone can or has the ability to hit raid targets, but everyone that bought LDON can do adventures and earn points. Some will earn points faster then others but everyone will eventually be able to get the spell.<br />
<br />
That's far better then essentially being locked out of getting the spell at all because you don't hit raid targets.<br />
<br />
LDON points is the most fair route they could of followed short of just putting it on a vendor for 30 plat.<br />
<br />
I still haven't bought bane yet and don't miss it, would rather use rains for now, but I KNOW that all I have to do is make the choice to spend points on it to acquire it, so it's on my list of to-do things. What isn't on my list of to-do things is finding a bloated guild, leave my already established guild and friends, earn DKP points in new raid guild, gear up to live through raid targets, hope I get lucky and get the spell drop or it's token. Glorify in my new spell for a week then wonder why I left my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I usually raid from the time I get home from work until I log for the night. That leaves zero time for doing LDoN's most nights unless raiding ends early. <br />
<br />
For the people saying do one hard a day you don't seem to get that for people that don't have EP gear, you pretty much have to get a perfect group to have a decent shot at a hard mission. <br />
<br />
I don't mind having it availble via points for the people that can't get it any other way, but it should also be available as rune and sellable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'd rather have the spells cost 20 runes each than 1492 LDoN points.

<br />
Make them droppable at least, so people that enjoy doing LDoN can sell them to people like me who'd rather pound toothpicks into our eyelids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Got to agree, would be great if there were several ways to earn a spell or item, vs. only LDoN or turn-in or random drop.  How about all three, so everyone, regardless of play time or guild abilities at least has a chance at getting them.<br />
<br />
Just me being crazy again.  I'm sure Sony won't do anything that might actually &quot;reduce&quot; play time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">So some people dont like too do LDoN ? well im sure people dont LIKE farming items either . But you do what you gotta do too aquire your spells .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think that's the point.  Why does there have to be only one means of getting the spell.  And why must they be undroppable, so they can not be sold or traded.  Because Sony wants us to grind away so they can continue to get our $13 a month, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
A little variety would not hurt one bit, and would actually cater to the overall player community.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kumtha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I wasnt in any way suggesting they be easy. Not all people like the same thing. I think that making several ways to arive at point B all of equal length but varied scenery might be a nice change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Still 1500 LDoN points is WAY too much for a spell.  Average joe shaman only gets Normal Risk missions in pickup groups.  That equals 30 LDoN Wins just for 1 spell.  <br />
<br />
Why can't I just buy the damn thing for 5k off a vendor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Another good thing about if it were a Rune turn in (pretty sure it wont be) is that it keeps more and more spells coming into the game and lowers the prices for peeps who buy spells in the baz.  I soloed my shaman 95% of the way to 65 and 80 or so AAs.  He has never rolled on a Spec or Rune and has done very few LDoNs, therefore almost all of his spells that he didnt loot or quest for were bought.  Simple facts have been stated before as to why LDoNs can suck.  I would rather see a quest like Stocism or something on a grander scale.<br />
Cant keep us all happy though.  Guess I'll have to hire an uber shaman to buy the spell with Adv points and buy it from him /shudder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I would be overjoyed if Chaotic Pain was a purchasable via points....overjoyed. Anyone can make progress toward getting this spell, even the most casual gamers. I'd much rather make steady progress toward purchasing a spell than taking my chances on runes in bot or tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I would be really happy if they used the LDoN model for making spells available.  The simple reason is that 30 adventures (1492 points) is fair to everyone in the sense that you can get it no matter what -- it might take person A a month to get it and person B two months, but realistically it is obtaining and straight-forward.  I like that idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">IMHO...<br />
<br />
Making our new spells available through LDoN points is good... I'll leave the bickering over price to others.<br />
<br />
Making our new spells available through Mob drops is good... this gives those Shaman that raid more than LDoN the chance to acquire the spells also.<br />
<br />
It's been said a couple of time... have multiple ways to get these spells. Use both methods, why is this not feasible? It seems that some saying that the only way we will be able to get these spells is through LDoN points. I don't believe this will be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Funny,<br />
<br />
After reading the bulk of the responses, and all who think its bad for it to be purchasable, its funny<br />
<br />
I hold almost the opposite view...LDoN is great, I play it a fair bit...after all, exping in the planes gets boring...relying on rare drops gets annoying.<br />
<br />
With LDoN, you do adventures, and eventually, you get a reward, no ifs ands or buts...I like that about LDoN<br />
<br />
I was much more concerned that the spell would (like other ancient spells in the game) come from some raid-level zone, as a rare drop off some uber-mob, that no one really wants to kill that often...thus letting the uber-shaman belonging to the uber-guilds get the spell.<br />
<br />
If its purchaseable, then its all good...specially if the points are awarded the same as in the current LDoN's.  1492 points is only 30 normal adventures or 15 hard ones...not really all that unattainable.<br />
<br />
Who knows, I may actually even buy this expansion, just for this spell...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Well everyone has their own view I guess. <br />
<br />
I remember killing Guardian Worms over and over and over and still not getting Malo and Torpor.<br />
<br />
I would have jumped for joy back then if they would have patched in a system where you could aquire adventure points towards the purchase of Malo and Torpor. <br />
<br />
Even if I didn't like the content, I'd have been happy at the idea that no matter what I could simply grind through it and be sure I was going to get the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I hated hunting for Malo and Torpor. Ultra-rare<br />

<br />
The parchments and runes were a PITA because<br />
you not only had to win the random in your group,<br />
but also had to turn them in for random spells. <br />
<br />
LDON is much better IMHO, however the different<br />
Brotherhood &quot;factions&quot; really sucks. Just because<br />
you want to do a Takish adventure, doesn't mean<br />
any of your friends want to. Everyone's got their<br />
own points to build up, so it takes forever. <br />
<br />
The proposed price for this is way out of whack for<br />
the reason above. 700 would be much more <br />
realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I just think the idea of LDoN spells for points is a bad one.  If I have 100k pp lying around from ornate farming or whatever, I should be able to buy my spells.  Money should be a viable way of acquiring spells (as well as raiding, finding runes/parchs etc.).  This bit of *having* to get points within a particular expansion is just awful, as it requires a significant time investment within the expansion no matter what.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the idea of LDON spells for points is a *great* one.  I've never seen 100k at one time, and I doubt I ever will.  It took me months and months to save up enough money to purchase all my 65 spells, but I finally did it.  No way do I want to spend more and more and more months every time an expansion comes along trying to scrape up the money to buy spells.<br />
<br />
LDON points I always have..haven't had under 1500 in quite some time.</div></div><hr />

Actualy i have to say it was kinda fun, but it was too rare is all. I had fun camping things for them, but they were so ultra rare that it went beyond fun and entered into frustrating.<br />
<br />
As the wise man said above. They need to be Dropable from mobs and LDoN bought. You need to give peopel options like a chose your own adventure book. :)</div></div><hr />

I don't have EP gear, and neither do the vast majority of my friends and we love doing hard missions.  I have lost about 2 and won about 7.  Most of the time they are pretty close, I have won a couple with less than 5 minutes to spare.  The most fun one the tank went ld on a collection with 6 drops to go.  I tanked the rest of them and we won.  It was *fun*.:)<br />

I can guarantee you I have no EP gear as I am not flagged, and probably never will be as I don't care to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've suggested several times that all spells be available in the following ways :  dropped, quested, vendor purchaseable (for a LARGE sum) and bought with LDON points.  It'd get rid of some of the cash floating around and people would have access to their spells, and they would be able to choose how to get them.  But it does make too much sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">What about those of us who have limited time would rather raid with our guild then do adventures?  1492 points is not very accessable to us.  I'm fine with the idea of putting the spells in the adventure system as long as thats not the only way to get them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And btw, Blood of Saryrn was the easiest to get.  Dont much time for LDoN (and when I do, I'm LFA for 30+min), Pox is just to rare of drop for a lvl58 spell and have yet to see a copy of Ancient Scrounge drop in VT (though I have seen multiples of other class spells).<br />
<br />
Sorry but to me this post is the biggest load of rubbish ive read for a long time.<br />
Read on this board all the time about how many raids take so many hrs etc and thats why drops should be better.Thats fine by me.<br />
You're guild is obviously VT keyed maybe higher.<br />
BUT YOU HAVENT GOT THE TIME TO DO A FEW LDON ADVENTURES ???<br />
Lets think about this....<br />
You would need 15 Hard successes to earn enough pts for the spell.<br />
With a VT equipped guild that should take you all of about 15 hrs the equivalent of 2 raids.<br />
Sorry but you are also one of the first people ive seen on here state that youre well equipped but you sit 30+mins lfa in ldon.<br />
This to me says more about your guild than anything else.<br />

I'm a fairly well equipped 65 Shaman in a non-elemental guild.  I haven't purchased LDON and probably never will.  Why exactly should I have to buy LDON to get a GoD spell?  Seems rather absurd.  If they do it the ldon route, it is purely to MAKE everyone buy Ldon if they want this spell.  It is a nice spell, but not as big of an upgrade as some would think.  If we got a substantial increase in Q and this spell, maybe worth it.  <br />
<br />
As for the new GoD zones.. I grouped around in flurby or whatever.  It was ok.  I do think they need to relevel the mobs or something.  The mobs toughness was fair I think in the new zones.  However, those mobs being green or light blue was a little absurd.  I like the difficulty, but relevel them so the xp is in line with the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Well this is just a hunch and probably not right, but anyone else noticing that mobs in GoD are Dropin research components...and ALOT of em, plus they just revamped trade skills, mabye these new spells are researchable...prolly wrong but should be looked into</div></div><hr />
