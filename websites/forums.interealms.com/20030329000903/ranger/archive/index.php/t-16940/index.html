<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SZRanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I usually lurk away but I have a question that needs answering as of tonight!<br />
<br />
I just trained Endless quiver tonight and I'm a bit surprised at the damage that I'm doing at the moment, which is basically pathetic.<br />
<br />
Bow: NightmareWood Compound<br />
Arrow: Mithril Champion<br />
<br />
Ok, so I run to RV and test a few shots on the noob mobs there, hoping to see a big improvement. I was surprised that my bow damage increase wasnt that much, and was pretty much on par with what i was doing before. I shot numerous mobs, over 50, and my bow damage was like it always was before I had the skill. I hit for about 70 dmg on average, all the time. <br />
<br />
I then load up the 3 damage arrows and my damage seemed to be half of what I normally did before I had Endless Quiver using the same arrows.<br />
<br />
What's the deal with the skill? I'm aiming for Archery Mastery 3 now, but I'm a bit worried by my damage at the moment. Is it because of my stats ?<br />
<br />
STR    175  (210 buffed)<br />
STA    176 <br />
AGI    145 <br />
DEX    177 <br />
<br />
(I'm not in a guild at the moment, so I basically use bazaar bought items)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for any tips / advice you can give me on this subject. I'm just a little disappointed at the moment. Guess I may have to go for am2 / 3 and test from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snakeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Endless quiver has nothing to do with the ammount of damage an arrow can do all it does is allow you to place one arrow in your ammo slot and forget about replacing it.  Perhaps you had a string of bad luck on your 1st attempt.  EQ is a God send.  <br />
<br />
To increase your damage output with your archery skill train CF to 1 to increase your chance of crits if you have not already done so,  continue training AM to 3 dramatic increase in damage at that point, and if possable find some meatshield to keep the mobs attention while you are makeing it into a porkupine as your damage is double when the mob is engaged in melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With EQ and the new arrows our dmg doesn't go up that much really. But trust me, it won't go down either just because you have EQ.<br />
<br />
Things to keep in mind, when you compare 2 rounds of archery:<br />
<br />
-Your DEX!<br />
-Your ATK<br />
-Your haste<br />
-Is the mob rooted?<br />
-Mob level<br />
<br />
And on top of that, archery dmg is inconsistent by nature. Parse some rounds, keeping all of the items above constant, and I am sure you will see a difference between the 3 dmg and the mithril champion arrows. Won't be much thou, the real improvement dmg-wise comes with AM 1/2/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mdbrown1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just got Endless Quiver on Saturday myself.  I was kind of disappointed as well with the DMG output.  Didn't seem to be much of an improvement.  I'm kind of wishing I had done AM1 and AM2 and then gotten EQ.  I still haven't gotten to use EQ yet on a raid with Trueshot.  I do have Combat Fury 3 and am looking forward to Doomshade Tonite.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once you get endless quiver it's imperative you get a mithril or blessed faydark champion arrow as soon as possible.  While the damage output in the short term won't be as much as archery mastery 1 would have been, you will NEVER SUMMON OR FLETCH ARROWS FOR PERSONAL USE AGAIN :)  Also, you can now kill things you couldn't before, by simply kiting with your bow until they fall over.  You will find shortly, that the power gains from having an unlimited supply of arrows with no archery mastery far outweighs the generous damage output curve bonus of the archery masteries with conventional ammunition.<br />
<br />
Besides, shooting 11 damage +4 fire dmg arrows is just...cool :P  You cant kill the thought stealer in maidens (or a 2 pull of golems in valor) with archery mastery 3 and no endless quiver unless you stop to fletch on the run or have 5 bags of arrows lol, but dernit if you are crafty enough you CAN with just endless quiver and no archery masteries at all if you keep at it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PhyrexDarkmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just curious about damage increase when using better arrows.  I have crited in the 730-750 range using 3 damage summoned arrows and Twisted Bow against the likes of Rumblecrush and Jorlerg in Ntov.  What kind of crits can I expect once I get EQ and start using real arrows?  I just turned level 60, well turned level 60 about 18 times now actually, and about to ding my second AA tonight so none of that fancy Combat Fury stuff yet.  When I had these I was 255 STR, 255 DEX and attack was probably between 1350 and 1450 or so.  Just want to know if I can start expecting some monster crits with these numbers and crappy arrows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At level 60, with a 30 damage bow and 11 +4 arrows I was getting crits for up to 1000 when using disc, with endless quiver and no AM, but mostly around the 800 mark.  With the twisted bow, and having AM3 as well that shoots up to 1600+.  With a 38 damage bow I'm pushing 2k, but haven't quite made it yet.<br />
<br />
Having endless quiver made a small but noticeable difference to my bow damage, but AM is what gives archery the &quot;wow&quot; factor, for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want to know what the damage increase is just do the math. Its simple.<br />
<br />
Example: 30 / 36 Nightmare Bow<br />
Before EQ: Summoned 3 damage arrows<br />
After EQ: Fletched 11 + 4 fire damage arrows<br />
<br />
Before EQ dmg ratio = (30+ 3) / 36 = 0.91667<br />
After EQ dmg ratio = (30 + 11) / 36 = 1.13888<br />
After EQ dmg ratio (inc. elemental) = (30 + 15) / 36 = 1.2500<br />
<br />
So with a Nightmare bow EQ will give you 24.2 to 36.4% improvement depending on elemental component. With a 33/35 bow the damage increase is 22.2% to 33.3% depending on elemental component. To compare, AM1 is +30%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snakeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A note on the thought of getting AM1 or AM2 prior to getting EQ consider the cost in time and plat saved by never haveing to summon or fletch arrows again and by simply placeing one of your best arrows in your ammo slot and fireing away you decidedly gain an increase in your archery damage as you never get the out of ammo message .......ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tendaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just got EQ lastnight and DELETED my fletching kit.  Ever since I hit 201 fletching on making arrows it's been just a pain if nothing else... not to mention a waste of inventory space... I got Innate Cammo first (felt that was most useful, and it is)... then when PoP came out I got guardian cuz I was excited and stupid.... then just the other day I looted bow of doom so I realized I need to get my AA's in order... took the day off work yesterday and got 8 aa's (had one banked) in a 12 hour period and clicked EQ on..... no idea how good that made me feel... I thought about doing AM first but IMO EQ is better before AM....<br />

NEVER FLETCHING AGAIN!</div></div><hr />
