I would like to take a few minutes of your time to make a quick post so express my interest in joining your great guild on raids.  I am druid of the 48th season (hopefully 49 in a few days:) hehe ) and have heard many great things about your guild, not only from people I know in the guild but from others that have grouped with your members as well.  I would consider it an honor to be able to join you on your raids or groups should you have any openings.   I am a flexible Druid as I can buff or heal the group or debuff, and DD the mobs.  My girlfriend, a level 48 Enchanter would also like to help in your efforts should you have room for her.  I also have a few 50+ Cleric friends who would be honored to fight along side your great guild should you be in need of their services.  <br />
<br />
If you are in need of our services for a raid or a group, you can email me at radoen@yahoo.com or just give me a tell in Norrath.  I will check this message board often to find out what you have planed and post a reply if I am able to attend.</div></div><hr />
