I dont know if any of you have already read this, but i was linked to it by a guildmate today.  Its about a year old so i suspect one or two of you have already read it, but it is one of the better stories i have read in a long time.<br />
<br />
Its based of a story the author and his wife came up with to explain why they were always together.  They were/are avid roleplayers, and as a druid and a SK, they needed a roleplay reason, the pact was the reason, and the husband ended up writing this fine story.<br />
<br />
I suggest you all read it.  It took always for me to finish, but it held my attention for every second.</div></div><hr />
