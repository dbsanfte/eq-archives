All i can say is this is def. not normal, something else was going on.</div></div><hr />

Not gonna jump on the parents just yet but id bet alot of money they were abusive.  That or someone else the kids somehow had contact with (family friend, uncle etc).</div></div><hr />

If you lead a normal childhood you dont do that.<br />

Truth is we don't know the background or the history of this tragedy.  We do know that the girl has a criminal record as an arsonist.<br />
<br />
Simas, be aware it is quite possible that abnormal kids in a normal childhood environment can do something very bad.<br />
<br />
For example, read about the recent trial of the two high-school boys in NH who murdered a professor and his wife in their home.  It was a random murder, simply because they were bored and wanted to see &quot;what it was like to kill someone&quot;.  By all accounts, both boys had good loving families in nice neighborhoods in a pleasant small town setting (the lawyers of one claimed otherwise for a while, but could present no evidence to back his claim).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simas, I totally agree, but what you must realize is that the reason you speak of is usually not environmental, but rathar physical. Some people are born with messed up wiring in thier brains. I know, I am one of them. My hands shake, I pick at dead skin on my thumbs making them look very disgusting, I have eye and nose tics that set on sometimes, ect, ect.<br />
<br />
Some people have it worse than me, and it begins to effect thier behavior. Others have it even worse, and it effects thier perception of reality. We have such little understanding of the human brain that there is really no way to diagnose or treat most of these people.....<br />
<br />
And when they do random and horrible things such as this, a lot of people want to blame thier environment...but a lot of times, the enviroment has nothing to do with it.....sometimes, we have no control over this kind of thing. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree there can also be phsical issues. However i would think they would manifest them selves in some sort of smaller detail, other then a murder.<br />
<br />
It does not seem likely to me that, if there were physical issues, that they would just murder their brother one day.  I would think it would esscalate (sp?) and culminate in murder or something further (if there can be such a thing).  This being the case there would be signs, and a failure to notice these signs is due to the environment in which they are in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just seems so senseless. Losing a child is the worst thing that could happen to a parent. To lose your child to murder is horrific, but for the murders to ALSO be your children.<br />
<br />
I don't know how a person can possibly handle that. It's just incomprehensible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What scares me about this story is that I almost feel that my oldest stepson fits these kinds of signs. Unfortuneately, Not only do we not have the money for the intensive counseling he needs, but when we went to the state for help, they decided to pull him from our home. &quot;He was a danger to the parents and children.&quot; No fault of our own. This sounded good to us, at first...<br />
<br />
Then, because of budgetary concerns, they decided they needed to place him. Well, they contacted his alcoholic abusive biological father, who at the time had no custody rights, and a protective order filed against him. (The protective order became moot, because the state had custody.)<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, we waded through over a year of court, before the state said, &quot;Hey wait, let's give him back to mom and stepdad.&quot; Why? Not because they'd helped my stepson, but because biological dad got enough paperwork together to almost prove he could get the boy back. (This is after court documented incidents of him beating, kicking, and urinating on my stepson just 2 years before.)<br />
<br />
So, he's back. What did we learn? Well, my stepson learned that by causing enough problems to warrant state intervention, he can see the father he idolizes. This includes beating on his brothers and sisters constantly, threatening my life, and constant verbal abuse in the form of vulgar name calling and extreme disobedience.<br />
<br />
My wife and I learned that state intervention = bad. We now have them in our home constantly, trying to teach us how to be better parents, and telling us there isn't anything they can do about him, until he actually injures someone our causes major destruction to the home. We've been through so many classes, I could teach them now.<br />
<br />
It makes me sick to say it, but I could see my family being in the exact same situation, and it would probably read the exact same way in the news. The only thing we've been able to do is limit the ammount of time his brothers and sister spend with him.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I forgot to mention, we have even less money now because we owe the state child support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know the whole story, but I do know my own. My son is autistic. He's on Ritalin to help control his hyperactivity. In four years he was expelled from 6 daycare/preschools - mostly for biting. What is the response to that?<br />
<br />

<br />
I am doing the best I can with a difficult situation. I read all the books. I take him to the best doctors and therapists in Denver. I have spent thousands of dollars in medical fees, consultations, and still he has problems with violent outbursts. We might have to get rid of our two cats because he hurts them whenever he's alone with them. We can't watch him 24 hours a day, and he just can't be gentle with them. He doesn't think before he acts, and he has no concept that his actions can actually hurt someone else. His disability leaves him totally self-centered.   You have no idea what anxiety his behavior causes me with a new baby on the way.<br />
<br />
What do you want me to do, choose one of my children over the other? <br />
<br />
I KNOW some of his problems might have been prevented if I'd known what to do when he was very young. Maybe if I hadn't divorced his father, things would be better. The fact is that hindsight is 20/20. When you're in the situtation, then you can start blaming the parents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylnathorn</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to post some facts about columbine..... It wasn't totally the parents fault... although they were negligent, they worked alot(both of them) and they really didn't have time to monitor them well. Really though I think 60% of the blame is on that school(other 40% for parents). Those 2 boys made a video or them doing exactly what they did FOR A FRIGGIN SCHOOL PROJECT!!! And then showed it in class.... HELLO RING RING MCFLY!! ANYBODY HOME!!!... so in some cases it is the parents/shcool/communities just not all of them... Sad to say but i think columbine reaped what they sowed... They ignored the warning signs... Not saying they deserved it but they could have prevented it.... If you are a teacher and students make a video of KILLING OTHER STUDENTS they should be counselled and watched VERY CLOSELY.... <br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting but that columbine incidents just sparks something in me....</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was 60% the school, and 40% the parents, I would guess that the two boys were completely guiltless. Just 'products of their environment'??<br />
<br />
*shakes his head sadly* <br />
<br />
I disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may sound wrong, but I'm gonna state it anyway. I would be more ok with the columbine shooting if they had ONLY targeted the people who directly wronged them. I believe in revenge, but not taking it out on people who didn't do anything to them, firing madly into crowds is not the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylnathorn</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Aethereal you are right it was the kids fault I am not saying they are not to blame.... I just spazzed out and forgot to blame them too.... but really they are on a different blame scale.... They are 100% to blame for their actions. I am saying that their parents and the school was to blame for not preventing it...</div></div><hr />
