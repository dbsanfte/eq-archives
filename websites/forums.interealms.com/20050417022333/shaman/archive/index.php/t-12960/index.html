I'm 36 and going real slow with solo. No I dont have the luxury of an icewurm fang and fungi tunic, although I think my gear isnt too bad.<br />
<br />
I've tried Dawnshroud...overcrowded and slow exp.<br />
<br />
GD - slow now.<br />
<br />
CC - ok but normally overcrowded and trains from hell.<br />
<br />
Anywhere in LoY or anywhere else where a tiny pet and I can solo get some loot (only way I'll ever get gear) and get decent exp?</div></div><hr />

I hunted in CC for quite a while, and did so without more than a couple of trains...At 36 with KEI, you can take the four Terrors in the room with the bridge very easily, and the exp is great. Single pulls and enough time to med up between each fight. Slow, Dot, Doggy, rinse and repeat. I lvled from 36-39 just tackling those, which also allows you to get on a list for the geos, which is sick loot and great exp as well. <br />
<br />
As for GD, I also hit this zone a bit, and found the Frost giant scouts to be a great source of xp. What are you hunting in these zones?? it might help to know what you are killing, as both GD and CC have a few options....</div></div><hr />
