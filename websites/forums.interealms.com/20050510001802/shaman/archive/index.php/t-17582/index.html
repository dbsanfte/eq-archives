One tick, 2352 damage, putting my peak DPS at 392. Peak value actually means very little since it is the nature of this type of damage to build up then taper off in stages. <br />
<br />
Regardless, an average 203 DPS for 2 minutes isn't too bad. However, compared to peak burst damage for other classes at this level (and yes this was a burst, I probably couldn't maintain it very long) it is weak at best. Just proof that we can do some respectable damage when necessary, and that we still are not anything close to a DPS class. <br />

Disclaimers - No, I do not solo this way or recommend it, yes I realize using that many DoTs is inefficient, yes you can get much higher DPS if you throw the big DoTs and back them up with nukes/rains.<br />
That being said, this was basically done to compare our primary DoTs next to each other.  I did not use a parser and left all pertinant info up for you to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good info, thanks for collecting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are using the best DoT focus currently available in the game. Subtract 15,5% from your average, burst or whatever DPS you parsed at and things will look even worse.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
Why didn't you use the epic DoT Curse of the Spirits   I would think our epic would be better employed than casting Plague.  I'm just curious.  Excellent job on posting your results though.  Beautiful Magelo &amp; AA's.  Looks like alot of time put into the game has paid off. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This was actually a continuation of several posts I had been making.  Before DoT damage was shown, before BA was put in, after BA, etc.<br />
<br />
I used epic in earlier runs, and since it is not affected by BA focus I did not repeat.<br />
<br />
I did use plague because I have had many tells from 50's level shaman asking how their DoTs compared to the higher ones.  The link on the first post shows all of them.  I can copy them to here if it is necessary.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am using symbol of the planesmasters, and in that post I had timeburn, not chronoburn.  Guess I need to repeat the run ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe Im a sick bastard, but seeing things like that makes my pants feel funny.<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pardon my stupid question ... what's the goal of this post? Looks like a Thottish post that has no resemblance to real game situations.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, you are using the best DoT focuses in the game (25% extension AND 30% damage). Of course every level 50 shaman will see these ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my parse show I can only keep 90-110dps constantly while solo (PoFire 50khp mob root/dot/run solo, or BoT 15khp mob tanking solo; and with 33% effeciency, 20% damage, 15% duration focus)<br />
<br />
remember, a shaman just control it mana with constant dps and chain pull, a druid just dump all mana into 1 mob for fast kill then go afk 10minutes to med up. <br />
<br />
we are not dps class, think about a necro can doting 350's dps on raid boss mob without agro, while we will have problem with agro when reach 200dps(mainly rain dps), anyway there are lots more than just dps, just buff 8 melee with FA, it will make extra 200dps+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow, you killed a mob with DoTs! congratulations~<br />
This isnt what we are capable of doing with DOTs unless you neglect aggro (unless you are tanking i suppose) or are talking when solo i can pump this out or maybe time equipped tanks can keep aggro (i wouldnt know).  I'm also not sure what the point of this is besides to say that one time you killed a mob and did 203dps over the fight, yay!<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure chaining our two rains with 6 levels of crits would net much more damage and FAR less aggro, and would be something a non time equipped shaman would be capable of doing.</div></div><hr />

Even under the most benign of circumstances, at least 4 or 5 (and usually 7) of my gems are dedicated elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Nice display of our potential dot damage, even if it is fairly theorethical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is (as I mentioned before) just the last of a series that started out from me getting bored on a patch day and trying to figure out how much damage my DoTs actually did (before we could see numbers).<br />
<br />
The purpose of the last run, and the reason I posted here, was the basically constant questions I was getting regarding how much damage the new LDoN DoTs did and how they compared.  It was not meant to show max DPS by DoTs or otherwise. <br />
<br />
I just wanted to show the damage each DoT did, next to each other on one mob.  Oh regarding 9 DoTs, I started out with a disease spell set, got those in, went to the poison/curse set and stayed there.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is as close as I could get a real situation to being theorhetical damage, but it really was more about the DoTs than the damage itself.  Yes, I am using a nice damage modifier.  I did do a run for my own interest without it, and naturally it was the same # each time.  You can recreate that on paper easily enough.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hopefully the people who asked for it got to see it.</div></div><hr />
