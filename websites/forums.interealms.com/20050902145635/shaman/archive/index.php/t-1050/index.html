<br />
I just hope EQ2 woudln't neccessarily mean the end of EQ1's progression.  That would really suck, considering how much I enjoy playing my characters.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If travel is still as mindnumbling slow and boring as it is now then #1 is certainly a negative idea.<br />
<br />
Depending on how #2 and #3 are implemented it might not be so bad.<br />
<br />
You cant really blame them for #4 - twinking has destroyed much of EQ as it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Twinking has kept players in EQ much longer than they would have stayed without it. A great number of players would have quit EQ out of boredom without the ability to twink a new toon. My new characters are my Barb Shaman, and Iksat Monk. No way I would have started those characters from scratch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read through that info posted on Casters Realm about EQ2 and if some of these 'features?!' dont change  I wont buy it.<br />
<br />
Item decay is a waste of players time and resources, the Equipment lvl stuff sounds stolen from DAOC and annoys me, and screwing with banks like that for realism is actually removing half their usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The item's decaying will probably not effect the casual player any more than anyone else, as they are likely to decay from use not from how long you've owned the item. So if you only play a couple of hours a week and an item is designed to decay after 10 hours it'll last you 5 weeks. <br />
<br />
The house thing will be interesting. They promised that in EQ at the start, because I remember reading it in the manual ;)<br />
<br />
I think though I'll be playing SWG and wont be too bothered about EQ2.</div></div><hr />

The current planned Level cap is 100, though it could be extended up to 200 through expansions<br />
<br />
Lol and we thought getting to 60 was bad, I can not imagine how longs its going to take to get to 100 or even 200.  Haha, I dont think EQ2 is going to be made for the casual player just from what I read so far.<br />
<br />
/boggle, you would think they would learn from their mistakes.<br />
<br />
Also, EQ2 is a whole new game, you would think they would get creative and think of different zone/mob names.<br />
<br />
I must say though the Graphics are very nice but then again how many people are going to have the required specs on their PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most MUDs do have item decay, since it means that servers don't get saturated with top-end equipment. In EQ, difficulty of acquisition is the only mechanism to control access to gear, but with item decay, they can afford to make acquiring equipment less timeconsuming. In that way, item decay would actually benefit casual players. Frankly, I would happily accept item decay if the reward is less timesinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The info coming in from EQ2 is probably making Blizzard devs really really happy .. it might be the best thing that could happen to WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EQ is the worlds prettiest mud, that's all it is.  Many of the ideas discussed have worked in muds already.<br />
<br />
They made items very hard to get, but the hardcore players could sell them if they wanted.   This worked mostly ok, until servers started getting so old that you could afford to have a couple of FunGuy tunics &amp; throw them on your twinkie.  Twinking is such an epidemic that it's clear you cannot use difficulty to aquire as a measure.  There was a report out that calculated the depreciation rates of items in EQ and they key cause of it was no item decay.<br />
<br />
What is uber early in the game will eventually be given to twinks and unbalance the low level game.  This is why melee is so much more effective at low levels.  Assuming they get a clue and make items easier to get, item decay will be a good step.    I hate using the word assuming :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Have to agree with Rio that twinking has kept players in the game.  I am actually surprised that Verant would take a step in this direction because it is making them money in the long run.  People liked anti-twink coding in the Warrens/Stonebrunt so much that it was removed.<br />
<br />
As for 200 levels and equipment breakage that is an obvious shot at keeping people playing for eternity, I think I'll pass.  I just hope EQ2 doesn't gimp the regular game that I still enjoy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't see how everquest could come out with another game without fixing the current one?  I see a lot of communities still supporting EQ1, EQ2 would seem foolish to pull out right now.<br />
<br />
But with eq2 comes a new game.  A new style and way of doing things.  I personally am not done experiencing eq1, I still enjoy it very much.  Eq1 is still alive, why they are coming out with the 2nd is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sarita Icestryke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I took it from several sources that EQ2 was to be the console PlayStation 2 release of EQ.  <br />

Sorry, I got confused, thought this board was a community of EQ players, of course we shouldnt have opinions about any pipeline stuff - that would be stupid!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I bet that Sony opens up EQ1 servers to the Playstation market and attempts to move the more powerfully configured PC players to EQ2. <br />
<br />
Based on the screenshots it looks like the SAME FRIGGIN GAME. EQ2 had better be totally new if they want my dollars: new items, new mobs, new zones, new dynamics, etc. <br />
<br />
FWIW, Item decay is going to make casters the only classes for casual players to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If they mimmic DAoC in reguards to the decay system and trivial loot it should be ok.  Items don't just break, they wear down and if you don't fix them then they break.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Skarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Has no one here played a game with item decay?<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone here understands how it works.<br />
<br />
Its BETTER for casual players.  Their weapons wont break that often.  Its not like after a fight you throw it out.  There will be skills to REPAIR the items - it basically introduces an upkeep cost to the economy.  Decay does not mean breakage.  It means maybe after 10 fights, your delay gets 1 tick higher.  Got a sharpening stone?  Don't worry about it.  <br />
<br />
High enders will burn through weapons faster (if they dont tend to them) and need to find the next best toy.<br />
<br />
Everyone will carry various backups.<br />
<br />
Its just a great idea for the game as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Seredith -- opinions are fine. But saying that a game to be released 18 months from now is a bucket of poop that you won't play... extreme, overemotional, immature, reactionary, uninformed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've played on several muds that had item decay and all they did is waste your time. So what if you only gradually lose effectiveness, to keep peak efficiency going you have to keep stopping to mend your armor and sharpen your weapons. On the poorly implemented ones it is even worse, requiring you to go back to town to repair. Also most had a chance for flat out total breakage, not just wear and tear that could be fixed, requiring you to replace the item (aka camp it again).<br />
<br />
All this boils down to is a waste of time in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well, with support for 200 levels in EQ2, it's OBVIOUS that they want you to spend a LONG time in the game. It's sound business -- any game based on a monthly subscription needs to have a slow pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">They are saying this game is 18 months away.  In reality, this will probably be longer than that.  You can bet 75% of the ideas they are talking about will appear in a different form.  You can also bet they use EQ1 to flesh out some of the ideas that they are not sure about.<br />
No sense in getting all wound up about it right now.  It is sure to be different as the release date gets closer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">lol, is a helluva a long time off in the software development cycle.  I'm yet to see a complex software system in the commercial market hit their target date. We easily have over 2 years before it is ready to install and crash to your desktop. 2  - 4 months past that to work out the kinks and actually be playable. Some of the ideas are pretty cool and will require you to pay attention to what you are doing, Tribunal spare us.  Item decay really isn't that much of a biggy. In my short stint in DAoC, which has a reasonable decay implementation, the only times you wore out equipment fast was using stuff that was way outrated for ya. You can fight for a long time before you actually wore a piece of equipment down to a breaking point.  What features make it into the final game are a LONG way off and if you decide you can't deal with them, you won't play.  However, there is a reasonable chance that they will still have a pretty good player base migrate over in time.  Pick the game that suits your style and stop worrying that the games aren't customized to your every whim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If you read the vast majority of boards, the majority of players think that item decay, breakage and the whole bank thing is just dumb implementation.<br />
<br />
The reason EQ does so well is replayability.  taking that away, takes away alot of long term players.<br />
<br />
Realism of item breakage and decay and bankage based upon a fantasy game is dumb.  No matter how its implemented, I hated it in DAoC and AO.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with making tradeskills viable, but item decay and breakage isn't that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I have never been a big fan of item decay every since the M59 days when you had to mend your crap all the time. Granted items were easy to get and there were only so many.<br />

<br />
Assuming that did happen, it would serve him right. Like showing up to kill a dragon without resist gear. You have to make sure your s*** is together before you step onto the battlefield.<br />
<br />
Item decay would really only make sense for player-crafted items. It would be silly for the Kobold King's +5 Vorpal Blade of Unearthly Doom to need reforging/repair. How would the wielder even know how? He doesn't know jack about the sword's history or construction. It should last forever. On the other hand, if you buy a_generic_long_sword_03 from a merchant or player smith, it makes sense to have to maintain it. Does this make sense in terms of game mechanics? Beats me.<br />
<br />
The non-global banks made me think, though. Wouldn't that mean you'd have X times the bank space under a global system, where X is the number of accessible banks in the world? That could come in handy....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">item decay is not a biggy as long as it doesn't lead to item loss, and the items can be repaired indefinietly (Diablo II system, not DAoC or Diablo).  I held on to my CGS For a year, and had to be kicked to give it to a lowbie shm after my shield of band warding.<br />
Level limits on items are fine for me - as a &quot;casual&quot; gamer I rarely had access to uber equipment anyhow.  They will have to work on keeping the ubers happy when they can't go raise a twink.  But throw in some &quot;uber equipment&quot; with lower level cap to drop for the twinkers at high levels, and they are happy.<br />
Non-global banks - stupid idea, now I have to pay a porter to get to the bank to pay the porter?<br />
Houses and NPC guards - will they defend only me or everyone? Can I wall in the dark elfs by putting my village at the Nek/EC zoneline with my guards killing everyone? Otherwise it might be necessary to have lots of guarded village to &quot;strip&quot; of pesky zoning mobs.<br />
Specing your character over time - straight DAoC and a stupid idea.  The only reason I stared a shm was that I wanted sow now. Not in 3 month when I hit 30. By then I camp jboots.<br />
So far the concept as presented has not convinced me as the way to go, lets see what the final product will be (so if they let me import characters I probably give it at least a shot :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hail All,<br />
<br />
It’s amusing to see the reactions people have when there is an announcement of a new Expansion or in this case EQ2 (A new game). Naturally people are going to have mixed emotions, mostly because they don’t know “exactly” what is going to happen.<br />
<br />
I can relate to what a lot of people are saying, we have invested a lot of time and energy into playing EQ1 (As it will now probably be referred), however there is also the natural progression of things to change. <br />
<br />
 Believe me VI is reading the boards and seeing what peoples reactions are, that’s part of the point of announcing it in advance. <br />
<br />
Just to make an assumption here since the Decay deal seems to be stretching out of proportion, it would only seem logical to make the equipment drops more frequent or allows the players the ability to up keep it with some sort of trade skill.<br />
<br />
Certainly these changes are going to appeal to the Role Player, in the case of the Banks not being Global, Houses, Boats and Horses with carts.  As far as leveling, it would seem logical that it would be rather rapid if you can get as high as 200. <br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see what will happen with the Death System, I’m sure this will create a lot of rumors and speculation. Just remember this game is still a year or more away.</div></div><hr />

They are trying to make a skills based system with levels.  Will it work?  Well that will remain to be seen.  Its 18 months and who knows where the online gaming community will be then.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of things that bring something to the camp besides the mindless camping, killing and going after items.  Trade skills makes people talk and hopefully role play.  Well at least it sure did when I was on UO.<br />

<br />
Anti twink (which I do and have mixed feelings myself) is really not anyone's business but the person that did the twinking. <br />
<br />
Trade Skills that have a meaningfull reward is a concept as a Shaman that I just don't get.  Can anyone explain that to me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Guess I have a few things to say about this.  First of all.  All you people concerned about this and that.  The game isn't coming out till October of 2003.  That's over 1 1/2 frickin years away!  I really doubt anything will be like what they think it will be like now when it comes out. In game development, heck, just 1 year is an eternity!<br />
<br />
Secondly, as for 100 - 200 lvls.  Y'know, if it does go that high, I SERIOUSLY doubt it will just be 40 - 140 lvls added on to the current treadmill.  I am betting you'll level much faster, it's just that since there are more levels it'll take just as long.<br />

That's all I have to say.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Housing is brilliant, from a players view (just plain cool, fosters player communities, sense of permanence and physical impact on the world, etc.), a designers view (it opens up a ton of ways to reward players without fubaring game balance by giving house-related rewards rather than +10,000 swords of roXXoring) and especially a corporate view (people will stay in a game forever if they have a house--I know so many people who keep UO accounts they haven't played in years, just logging in to refresh their houses).  Any MMOG designer who does not provide housing should be shot.<br />

Decay is key to a functioning economy if it is done correctly.  It is the key to making the game suck if it is done wrong :)<br />
<br />
Skill based systems--especially ones without sell-back-- invariably blow chunks because they are impossible to balance correctly.  Compared to Diablo2, Asheron's Call, and Anarchy Online, class balance in EQ is complete perfection.  Not clear to me what the case in EQ2 is.<br />
<br />
It better not be zone-based in the way EQ is where each zone is a little diorama.  The best thing about AC and AO is that you can literally go wherever you want and it feels like real geography.  I want to walk around the entire coast of Antonica, and I want to be able to walk to everything I see on the horizon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>msunick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Personally, I can't wait till EQ2 comes out.  Everquest is great, but EQ2 will be so much better they won't even be comparable.  You know it's the truth.  Sure, you put tons and tons of time into EQ1.  But aren't you looking forward to a game that is going to take EQ to the next level?  It's not like it's a completely different game like DAoC, this is Everquest, just way better.  I also don't understand how you can be against level limits for items.  Yeah it's fun to play when you're all twinked out, but that makes it too easy to get to a high level.  I think that when you see a level 60 you should be like 'wow, look at that guy, he's at level 60', but the way Everquest is now, it's really not that big of a deal.  Sure it's gunna be tough saying goodbye to my EQ characters for the last time, it'll be tough until i'm creating my new ones on EQ2.  Let's face it, there is too much wrong with Everquest, too much to just fix.  This time they are gunna do it right.  And to all you out there that say you won't be playing EQ2, YEAH RIGHT.  After you get over the fact that you &quot;lost&quot; all that time playing Everquest, you'll come the realization that you're playing this game for fun.  And EQ2 is going to be just that, fun.  And about all those new games coming out, they'll be cool for awhile, but they won't stand the test of time like Everquest.  You have now been enlightened ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I understand all of your complaints. But if they base the systems off something similar to other games, everything could work..<br />
<br />
I reckon item decay will be like other games (Diablo 2 comes to mind..) Where items have durability.. after a looong while you hafta repair it. Hopefully the best items will be indestructible..<br />
<br />
No twinking? Brilliant! You'll always get that &quot;new-server&quot; feel when you start a low lvl char. No lvl 3 warriors with 400ac, 500hp killing all your spiders.<br />
<br />
The house thing is absolutely brilliant! In UO that was a great aspect, the game sucked but having the house was so cool :) I hope they'll make seperate zones for the housing or something like that. like &quot;ZoneA&quot; has room for a certain number of houses in it, no mobs. In the middle of the zone theres a teleport. Either buy items that port you there or get a wizzie to port you. If its anything like that, ill love it. Heck, just the aspect of having houses is great.<br />
<br />
The bank thing im kinda worried about. If the house has lots of storage, keep your stuff there tho... If you cant get a house for one reason or another, just try keep your stuff for selling in the Trade_zone01 and your stuff you'll need while fighting, near where you're fighting.<br />
<br />
All these posts bagging the game are fine by me, have your opinion. If you say &quot;Bah it suXXors im gonna go back to camp phat luutz&quot; thats fine, just go back to doing that. If you need me, ill be playing eq2 in a few years :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">People who think that item decay ruins the game are a bit silly. There needs to be something worth spending money on at the endgame besides peridots and coffins... If they implement the system correctly (by making items unusable but not broken when they run to 0 durability ala Diablo), item decay could be an excellent economic fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Every new change announced so far seems hostile to casual players. I was hoping that SOE SD would learn from the mistakes of EQ1, and not create a damn game that is built around power gamers, but alas, this is not to be. Every single one of these rule changes is designed to slow down play with tedious downtime. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">item decay can be implemented in several ways:<br />
the sucky annoying daoc way, which has NOTHING to do in a pve game(imagine camping your epic every 2nd week:p)<br />
or you can make them indestructable, but not usable when ruined/too dmg'ed(or make them less useful below a certain %)<br />
or you can make stuff break ONLY if it hits 0%.<br />
or you can make only lower end items have breakage.<br />
<br />
you cant possibly shape a real opinion on a quick release like that 1-2 years before release:)<br />
<br />
different banks seems like a cool idea to me, say, people will be trading in nfp(or nexus or whatever, wherever you'll be bound most often anyway), and you'll have mulebanks all over :) more space=good.<br />
<br />
no twinking gonna hurt them bad tho.<br />
me and alot of others find twinking a good pasttime and without them i'd have quit long ago(57 rogue 46 war 44 bst 20 mnk 16 nec). theres just something fun about knocking low lvl mobs down in 2 hits :p and a break from the higher lvl grind.<br />
<br />
eq as it is has too many limits(stat cap, ac cap, resist cap, mana cap, hell, you name it, it has a cap of some sort and it aint that hard to reach), and isnt coded very well. it was never intended to grow to this size(well hoped prolly, but not planned for).<br />
<br />
mmorpg's HAS to take long to &quot;finish&quot;, or the entire point is gone, go play a single player game if you want your 2 hours a week to ever get you &quot;done&quot;. it depends on how you make it, daoc is a good example on sad execution(BORING lvling, no lootsystem at all, and no endgame to look forward to(the pvp system is/was worse than eq when i quit)) eq is an example of good execution. hoping they can pull it off for eq2 as well.<br />
<br />
this being all in my not so humble opinion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">While obviously we won't really know how these features will work until the game is released, the idea of such features personally turns me off :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>F15E0476</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I don't see why people are gritching about item decay.  Its called smithing u would how that they are smart enough to expand the smith to evaluate weapons and repair them if its needed, same for armor.  Your weapon will most likely not fall apart in the middle of a fight if u check it every time u hit town for food water and such.  Decay won't be to bad in my eyes.  Will help to expand alot of trade skills doing this way.  Another way for trade skill advancment is houses and such if u can decorate them like in UO with stuff that trade skills make.  I see alot of of improvment here already and i would like to see it.  Not limiting Your bank account!!  Being able to stash stuff in your house that only u can accsess.  I personally will prolly switch.  I dunno if i like that way u lv or not, but i dunno if i won't like it till i try it out.  People need to just think of the good effects and not just the bad effect of new things.  Just my opinion though..<br />

See what Im getting at?  The twinking thing being done away with is a godsend to me, as well as to most of my friends.  Let me explain:<br />
<br />
My rl friend plays, and plays more than I do.  We are around the same level range, enjoying our classes, but he begins to pull away.  Because Im a casual player, I get frustrated thinking Ill never catch up....so, I start a twink.  Friend continues to level for a while, then comes and makes a twink with me....neither of us really get anywhere.  Its really a personal character flaw....lol.<br />
<br />
Because Im a casual player and twinking is such a viable option, I have an easy cop out and go straight for the twink.  It would be great if that wasnt the case, I believe.  I think it would force me to get over the unpleasant humps most of our characters have had (like a shaman in their early thirties...ugh) and get to the really fun stuff.  Hell, twinking has gotten me 5 pieces of armor on my shaman I cant even use yet, including the bracer.  Ive had the stuff for two months now, too....I keep going back to something else.  Now its the other account I bought that keeps me from leveling either the shaman or the rogue...LOL.<br />
<br />
Hope this all made sense...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Item decay<br />
<br />
If done correctly it can be a good thing. Slow decay in the hands of an experianced user, Fast decay in the hands of a newby with an overpowered item. You want to keep the Sword of Thwapping godlyness you need to repair it often when you hand it to your nephew.<br />
<br />
Player Housing. <br />
<br />
They could do it in EQ 1 if they wanted to. Simple add a Zone with pre built housing areas, some pre built Housing textures and Building size plot and let people make one that they are willing to spend cash on. Keys would take care of Entry and exit. And Access to a personal Bank vault would allow more storage. (Seperate from the normal bank)<br />
<br />
If Houses are built to the point of saturation in the zone add another Housing Annex. <br />
<br />
You could even charge a rediculous sum and allow a guild to purchase an annex and limit who can build there.<br />
<br />
If you limit certain sized houses to people with a perticular faction title. (you can't buy a keep sized plot until you are a baron, unless you have a special title bestowed upon you by the lords of the realm (GM reward)  <br />
<br />
Please for the love of God I hope they don't allow houses built Willy nilly.  (UO anyone)<br />
<br />
Twinking.<br />
<br />
They should allow Moderate twinking. Twinking lets replayability have some fun to it. But the level 1 with a fungal and Dragon loot should become a thing of the past. <br />
<br />
Just some opinions <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Screw anti-twinking, and screw item decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Item decay is only even a possible problem once you're high level.  You're going to end up replacing your items often while you're levelling anyway, it doesn't really matter if they decay and can be repaired along the way.  EQ already has item decay, it's called destroy everything in your bank every time a new expansion comes out because all of the equipment that drops makes everything before not even worth giving to a twink.<br />
<br />
Short Sword of the Ykesha, anyone?  <br />
<br />
Non global banks would suck, if that's true I hope it's revisited.  <br />
<br />
But if you think you're going to be able to stick playing EQ once EQ2 comes out, think again.  Sony's going to do everything in their power to convince you to switch.  Sure they'll leave the old game servers up and running, but forget about improvement, or even fixing things.  But, the fact is they have no choice.  If they don't put something out there to eventually draw people away form EverQuest, someone else will.  They're just trying to do it on their own terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">&quot;Short Sword of the Ykesha, anyone? &quot;<br />
<br />
Actually with the new AA abilities a SSoY is a very popular item for Dire Carm pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I never saw the use of player housing.  Just seems like another stupid status symbol to me.<br />
<br />
Still, anti-twink measures are the biggest turn-off to me.  Twinking is a major element of fun for me (and I dare say, most other people).<br />
<br />
As far as item decay goes, my question is:  what is the use of even putting it in?  For realism sake?<br />
Unless it is done a la Diablo, where you can just go to a smith and have it fully repaired for a nominal fee, I see it as a big turn-off.<br />
After all, I can't imagine melees (or any other class) being too happy when their uber gear gets broken and unusable after the stress of constant fighting.  But I guess that all depends on how they implement it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">A guildy just brought a great idea up on our message board:<br />
<br />
By naming/presenting the game as EQ2 the game gets the huge recognition that EQ has, but carries along all the baggage of Beta5.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, if it was some random game Verant was dumping out with the same characteristics I think I might just be a bit more excited to try it.   All the preconcieved ideas and things I expect from EQ really trash the idea of EQ2 for me a bit more than they should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with this.  I started over on SZ and I've had more fun than I ever had on any of my twinks on Prexus....  Hell I even got excited when I finally bagged the Glacier Bear 2 years after the first time I did it.  People are just too lazy/afraid to start all over again.<br />
<br />
Twinking has also kept true new players from a fair start imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">You've got a year and a half to wait.  I don't think anything is finalized yet.<br />
<br />
I for one would welcome some sort of item decay, as long as it's not just 'after X hours, your sword disappears'.  If, say, with use, your sword deteriorates from 100% to 0%, and there are skills that can be used to repair it, I don't see a problem with it.  It could add another component to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">My worst feeling is that for the last 12-18 months (or maybe since release) verant has had someone making a fairly important decision with every issue brought to them.  This single person has had the power to choose whether an issue was put into the EQ or EQ2 bin.  So somewhere an eq2 programmer has a stack of 117 notes to fix alchemy on his desk and has been seen leaving therapy screaming 'ALCHEMY IS WORKING AS INTENDED'.<br />
<br />
If this is partially true I can at least hope all the issues I've got with EQ will be fixed in EQ2.<br />
<br />
All the things they listed sound interesting.  Right now their track record of implementing new ideas sucks ass though so I'll be watching this and hoping.  Would be nice to get into the beta on this one and pray that feedback is listened to early and often.</div></div><hr />

And if it runs as bad as luclin does with just the &quot;required&quot; specs, then very few people would be able to play it.<br />
