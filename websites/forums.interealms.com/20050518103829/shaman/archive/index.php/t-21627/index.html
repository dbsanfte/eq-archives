<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, of all the zones Ive been to, Mischief has captured my imagination the most.. I leave for Iraq next Tuesday and would love to explore this zone to the fullest, but cant seem to find my way about in there..I either need a map or is there another way in other then up the invis bridge and into the castle..Ive yet to find my way into an really neat places..Also what sees invis there?...thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only zone that I have ever heard of having such a following:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actually it depends on which version of mischief is on your server. v3 has more see invis mobs in it, whereas v2 doesnt. the quests dont work in v2 either, but its a sweet zone to play in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to the PoM message boards, the only server to not have v2 is Al'Kabor (Mac server).  It still has v1.  No servers have v3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never got to see version 1, but version 3 was great while it lasted.  I never have had so much fun dying in such creative ways.  Being selfishly altruistic in V3 led me to quite a few CR's.  (11 in the 8-10 hours we were there)<br />
<br />
And we were giggling every time.<br />
<br />
I miss that.</div></div><hr />

wrong..the occasional trash mob can also..fell in maze and ran into 2 gorillas that saw thru invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think one of the great things about mischief that makes it so appealing is that the charactors are so cheesy...Laughably so.  The laughter is annoying the mobs look weak, but dont be fooled, and there are a ton of traps.  I remember just the other night we were camped down in the main room and our sk was pulling..I told her not to touch anything and not to take off her leviation...Well, she got tired of trying to &quot;fly&quot; through the zone and clicked it off..Well, ten seconds later we got the OH **** message and yep, she had fallen through a pit trap..Ten seconds after that she hit her first teleport trap thing...Well..Normally Id be mad and just yell at her...But this is mischief!  Its supposed to happen.  For god sakes they have an upside down room and a black and white room here..its too funny to get mad at...Ive died there a bunch of times latelly, but when it boils down to it...Its one of the most fun zones in the game...Sadly enough, informaion on the zone is very difficult to come by and mapping is impossible...So, that being said, if you have any other pertinent info to send me, please do....I dont think people realize there are two items with flowing thought 1 and 2 that drop there and a spell haste IV item...Well, good luck and have a good afternoon...</div></div><hr />
