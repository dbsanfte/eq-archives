<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not a shaman, but I figured this would be the best place to ask.  What is the resist check for slows?  I keep getting told by some that it is MR, while others insist it is DR.  Which is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MR for slowing, but you can cure it with cure disease.<br />
<br />
Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If peeps ask you for a &quot;group DR buff&quot; to resist slows.. ask them what the slow is called next time they are slowed...<br />
Then next time tell them to get a GMR :)<br />
<br />
Having said that, if you are fighting shaman mobs chances are one of them might throw a poison rain AE or DR slow so what he hell cast group DR/PR anyway.<br />
<br />
As for making slows curable by cure disease spells... thats a hell of a lot better than trying to annul it on your melee.<br />
/clicks cure disease earring or pants.<br />
<br />
Was pretty funny when they added the disease counters though. The aggro on slows went through the roof :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Guinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Which slow is the DR slow?  For trials I think it was Tigirs that landed on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Turgurs Line of slows is Magic based (tirgirs, togors, turgurs, tagars, etc).  It checks the magic resistance of targets to see if it will land.  It can be cured by casting cure disease.  To resist these spells, increase your Magic Resistance.<br />
<br />
The DR based slow is Cloud of Grummus or Plague of Insects.<br />
This spell Checks the disease resistance of targets to see if it will land.  It is curable by casting cure disease.  To resist these spells, increase your Disease Resistance.<br />
<br />
There are lots of mob cast DR based slows out there, including Bane of Thule (CT), Slime Mist (TOV), Shrieker Slow (FG) more.  Mob-only slow spells can check against pretty much any resist.  Go to lucy and type in &quot;slow&quot; and you can browse some of them.  I notice Cold based slows, disease base, magic based, poison based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That makes sense, I've noticed DR helps a lot vs shroom slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bought this spell the other day (Disenfecting Aura) and used it when my group was in umbral planes fighting shaman. This spell is a 1 cast cure for slow. Abolish desease takes 3 to 5 casts. This spell also is a 1 cast cure for poison and desease dots. At least the ones the shamans cast in umbral planes. Suprisingly useful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shroom proc is a disease based slow, as is the stun.</div></div><hr />

You sure you are casting abolish disease and not some weaker cure? The abolish disease click on my pants has cured every single slow i have been faced with in one cast, including the turgur's from the Shojen in Umbral.</div></div><hr />

 Abolish Disease  Detail | History | Raw Data  <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Disease Counter by 36 <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
I'm pretty sure removing 36 counters is going to remove any slow in the game.  Disinfecting aura removes 20 poison counter and 20 disease counters btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont have the lower lvl spells in my spell book. I used disinfecting aura cause it takes up 1 spell slot and cures slows, poison and desease dots. I have used aboloish desease in the past and it never was a 1 shot cure. I never used it in umbral planes though. Only used disinfecting aura.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hm.  I think Abolish used to remove a lot less than 36 counters, didn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hunt quite a lot with small guild groups in Umbral and Seb, never had clicky cure disease from legs fail to remove a turgurs line slow yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Abolish Disease always removed 36 counters.<br />
<br />
Lexa, you must be doing something wrong (you sure have Abolish Disease memmed and not Counteract or Cure Disease?) because Abolish Disease is the stronger cure then Disenfecting Aura.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always had the idea that it removed 27 disease counters and - thought i read it somewhere a long time ago... Not until i checked lucy in august some time this year i found out that it was 36...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If so, I did not have abolish desease. My point is (unless you have clicky legs) in many hi lvl zones, sitting to swap spells isnt doable. Disinfecting aura cures slows, desease and poison dots. It takes up 1 spell slot and is very useful when finghting any kind of shaman mob or slowing enchanters.</div></div><hr />
