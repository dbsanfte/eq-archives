<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Actually I was reading about how the shaman/wizzy combo is good when a wizzy is quading. It is kind of tricky at first but it is doable.<br />
The way to do it is to run in front of the wizzy and when the wizzy stops is to keep running and stop then cast your rain on the wizzy, which by this time has casted his AE and is moving again and by which time the mobs have moved into your rain and get hit by at least 2 if not all 3 waves. The only problem is the resist on the mobs which i've found isn't that bad depending on the mob your fighting. Duoing with a wizzy i've found can be very good thing and you get to do something challening and fun at the same time.<br />
