<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">point has been made , truth has been realized and presented .<br />
Continuing with him or anyone else on that level simply eggs it on. Thats all and his lil minions are around for , they know they wrong , but like to push our buttons.<br />
<br />
I think its time to end it and just ignore him.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree.  I haven't posted much on this because everyone else has posted my feelings before I could.  Personally I think he's a moron.  Other's feel the same way and have stated that.  Just let him talk all the crap he wants and move on.  If he doesn't get feedback hopefully he'll do something other then make worthless graphs.  Otherwise let's just start a thread with our own graphs.  I can use the new fisher price paint with numbers and make some truely uber graphs with it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Forket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think most people realize he's the villiage idiot of EQ, but unfortunately Verant has a record of giving him an inordinate amount of influence over their nerfage instead of doing their own research. <br />
<br />
On other words, we know he's a jackass, but we're afriad VI will listen to his jackassage, so we need to be especially loud in exposing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Forket hit the nail on the head.  We all seen the flaws in his test but VI most likely will not when it comes around to them, so people being loud is not such a bad thing in this situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only thing Thott really did was remind folks that a good shaman can make a good group a great group.  Anybody with a brain can see the flaws.  Yes, in an ideal world, we're godlike.<br />
<br />
But then, if you change the mobs to undead, clerics are godlike damage dealers.<br />
<br />
Throw in a dire charmed nasty animal, and druids are even more frighteningly powerful than before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh. See, now someone explaines finally what all the anti-Thott stuff was about. I didn't get it. Now I do. So the whole bit is ppl are afraid he's going to have the shaman nerfed? Okay. See, that I don't want. Nerf the shaman and I have to play my stinky necromancer again. Yuk!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everyone is pretty certain I want to get shamans nerfed, but that's not why I created the comparison.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to &quot;get something nerfed&quot;, I would email the developers.  I wouldn't need to go through all the effort of creating a bunch of graphs, writing it all up, organizing it on a web page, and distributing links to related messageboards.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't need to get flamed by the same shamans over and over again in every thread on every board related to the comparison.<br />
<br />
While I had many reasons for doing it, the only one shaman related was that perhaps I could show shaman that their class really doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
My intended audience was priests and people that like to group with priests - not SOE.<br />

It's something more to the tune of &quot;I don't like Thott&quot;. Yeah, I'm sure I could justify my feelings based on his sk(r)ewed data... but I think i'll just go with gut instinct. I don't like Thott. I'm judging him. I haven't even read all his explainations nor have I given him the benifit of the doubt. I'm being totally superficial.<br />

We have been told here numerous times that VI *does* read these boards, and we know for a FACT they read the grove. Thus, posting supposedly factual data along with claims of unbalance by yourself is indirectly a way of alerting VI. It's all over the boards, they've seen it already. Now we wait to see if you get what you wanted Thott.<br />

Imagine the time savings had you not replied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This line was so laughable I had to make it my first response on this board.<br />
<br />
If you actualy read this board Thott you would realize that shamans were NOT of the opinion that they sucked.  <br />
<br />
The ONLY thing your graph represented was completely slanted data that now has the entire EQ community screaming for a nerf.  You said yourself in your graph disclaimer that most people would not read the info and would just look at the graphs so you KNEW this woudl happen.  Congratulations, you have accomplished your true goal wether you admit to it or not.<br />
<br />
You say you had many reasons for for doing the graph which are not even related to shamans, what are those reasons?  Assuming of course those reasons DO exist and this line is just not your poor attempt at trying to save face.<br />
<br />
If you want to show a class that they do not suck, make a slanted graph about druids, they are the ones that are constantly complaining that they suck and need more and more upgrades.  For that one, you might not even have to slant the info as much considering the upgrades they have recieved lately.  NO, I'm not saying they should eb nerfed, but they are the ones that are constantly complaining about their class, so why not make them try to feel better.<br />
<br />
Anyone with half a brain that actualy knows how to read and see what you have done with the graph or has ever played a shaman knows that it is completely worthless but we all unfortunately know there are too many of these idiots reading the various boards you posted on.<br />

PS........As you can see from the server I'm on, I know who you are in relation to the EQ world.  I have in game friends in your guild and RL friends in AL.  I am perfectly well aware that you are the leader of arguably the strongest guild in the game but that does not make your graph any more true.  Go out and make yourself a shaman character, DO NOT get help from your uber guild in the form of power leveling or gear or spells and then actualy try doing what you propose is possible with your graphs.  Yes, I know it will take a long time to level and guess what, it will take even LONGER to get the AA abilities, gear and spells that you give to the shaman in the so called tests you have done.  Even IF you do get all that gear and all those abilities, you STILL will not be able to do what your graphs say are possible.</div></div><hr />
