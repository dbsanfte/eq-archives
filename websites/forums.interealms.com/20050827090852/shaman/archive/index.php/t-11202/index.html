he already been knocked off the shaman hitlist ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think we will ever see this guy die to a shaman. He's about as resistant as Telk or Gozz. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's been soloed by an enc, but not a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well he didnt die to a shaman today :(<br />
<br />
I dunno if my resists arent high enough , but that stun ripped right through me. I put up a good fight , but in the end i was just interupted too much. Maybe when i can cross refrence that stun to a resist and get high enought o resisted it. all his other stuff i was resisting , i think it was a matter of outlasting him after that .  Perhaps another day ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe around 300 you resist him 100%.  Be careful though, he can load two weapons and be a complete assbeater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/cheer Litgruv<br />
<br />
You'll get him next time ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not sure how fast his regen is . . . don't think it's too fast.  His hps are questionable . . I think he has a few of em, over 50k I'm rather sure.  So you need to melee him down with dog or whatever however long that takes.  Epic can probably stick.  Cold nukes I think also stick.  <br />
<br />
I was killing elysians in UP today for a druid friend of mine, solo.  Those resist totally PR and DR spells.  So it was all nukes and epic and dog.  They still died in about 4 minutes, tho they have around 24k hps.  I was usually close to FM at the end of the fights, had KEI and was riding a horse while chaining Velium Strike and Torpor now and then.  Dog was kickin some ass with Feral Avatar and SLTW.  <br />
<br />
Based on that, if I get a necro buff, use my own tribunal buff, I should be about 300 PR and able to resist every stun.  Now, assuming I find him up I'll give it a try.  I think it's possible if slow lands reasonably fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chance of landing slow, 1% at best.  You can probably skip DMF and still resist a solid 95%+ of the stuns.  Wuoshi seems like his fear lands more than the other kunarks but it isnt that bad at 250+.<br />
<br />
All of the kunark (yeah I know but wuoshi is the exact same thing) dragons are extremely resistant to spells.  Theres almost no point to us nuking them (except cold on talendor).  You can do some piddly damage to sev/wuoshi with cold and slight damage to gorenaire with poison but overall it's far from worth it.<br />
<br />
The only chance I see is rabid bear with a solid 400 damage lure proc weapon (and praying you don't get feared and lose rabid) and a damage shield potion.  Then you simply need to survive long enough for him to die to your face, weapon and dog.  You'll have to hope for a few channels here and there but his damage is not that extreme but it should drain you decently fast.<br />
<br />
P.S. if he's duel wielding weapons, give up and click the lizard blood right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok , so the stun is poison based eh ? i can get over 300+ on that , if i can get that taken care of , Quiescence tanking will become a more viable option. Didnt have a chance to go again at him and try anything new cause the guild taking him down were kind enough ( and baffled enough) to let me try it once. Next time ill get Vitrue and c5 and full buffs and try it that way , if it works out well , i can always come back and try him truly solo ;)<br />
<br />
Actualy had some nice drops , dropped alot of spells and a Claw of Luclin or whatever its called. Definetly more of a challange them yeldema  /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will eat my computer if you can solo him. If you can't land slow, how the heck are you gonna survive? My guess is you can get him to about 99%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how low did you get him to? care to link your magelo profile? sounds like a fun challenge!</div></div><hr />

Small point, but he has been solo'd already by an enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was hitting me for  150-300ish . i can negate that IF i can slow him. maybe this isnt a mob you wanna do alot cause you die many times , like the enchanter , but if you can slow him. i think he can be  done. Plus i think his melee  output is based on what he is armed with. I notice he was piercing me in 1 hand , but not hitting me with a pierce bolth  times if i remember right.<br />
<br />
so maybe alot of it depends on the loot he is spawning with,<br />
<br />
Guess we will know in a few days when he spawns again and i try him again ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hmmm about 25pp per stinging wort potion (assuming you farm 800 IG toes yourself for free) a mere 200k to solo a mob you may get 100k of loot off of if youre lucky.<br />
But obviously the point isnt for a cash cow its bragging rights , an ench has done him probably quite a few enchies by now (hello SOE ya hear that enchanters soloing dragons !!! lol jk) <br />
As was stated before he is nearly immune to slow at least turgurs. From what i recall we did him several times back in the velious heydays and with malo / tash / oos he bounced slow all day long. I dont think i ever did try to POI him though so maybe with MD and grummus you have a shot , relying on turgurs to land though I honestly think youll just be wasting your time and xp.<br />

Peace love and geese<br />

Tolstoy from Legions of Darkness on Innoruuk solo'd wushi shortly after Test of Tactics was over.  Level 60 warrior at the time with a **** load of shaman potions :) <br />
<br />
<br />
*laugh*<br />
<br />
Tolstoy never solo'd wuoshi, he tried, he got put down like a little bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Be careful though, he can load two weapons and be a complete assbeater. <br />
<br />
This... is an understatement.  The first time I got to tank him after the patch where dragons started dual wielding, I was at my bind point before I could adequately comprehend what &quot;pierce, pierce, slash, slash, bash&quot; meant.  <br />
<br />
He's still a joke of a dragon, but he's a joke with a surprise now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Forget landing Grummus/Turgurs on Woushi, his resists are basically the same as old Tunare, and kunark dragons, you will land malos and insid decay, thats it, everything else you cast WILL be resisted unless you are incredibly lucky.<br />
<br />
The only strategy really is to just keep yourself alive tanking him and hope dogdog can chip him down fast enough.  With a ton of stinging wart, maxed avoidance/channeling/mitigation/healing aa's and very nice gear it might be dooable, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've been able to slow wuoshi pretty much every time I've killed him with a raid. Standard Malo/Tash-&gt;Malosini  makes it doable. He is resistant, yes... but not immune.</div></div><hr />

hmmm about 25pp per stinging wort potion (assuming you farm 800 IG toes yourself for free) a mere 200k to solo a mob you may get 100k of loot off of if youre lucky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi yea ummm correct e if im wrong but 800 X 25 = 20k.  so 100k worth of loot == nice profit :)<br />
<br />
But yea it about saying UMMM wuoshi yea i soloed that MOFO.  Now if i can only get the guts to try it.  Actually im just waiting for my ATH Neck and Lunar fungi then I should be a GO</div></div><hr />
