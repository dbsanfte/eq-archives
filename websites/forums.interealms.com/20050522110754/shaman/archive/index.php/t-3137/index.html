<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brothers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I did a search on clarity and  was trying to find out the duration of those potions last but no posts that I read from the searchs mentioned it.<br />
<br />
I have been working on Grow potions to get my alchemy up and had spent 700p the other nite only to get 3 points up in skill, I am currently at 105 for Alchemy at lvl 55 and as you can see I have not worked on Alchemy in ages :D <br />
<br />
I am trying to get my skill up so that I can make a couple stacks of the Greater Regen potions, those potions rule and stack with Regrowth and Fungi but come at a cost. that would sure convert alot of HP to mana when really needed in tight situations, and I also wouldnt mind makin the clarity potions for self as I have heard they stack with enchanter mind buffs<br />
<br />
does anyone have any idea what the duration is on the clarity potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont remember how long they last, but i can tell you for certain that it is nowhere near long enough for the cost of these potions. Has been awhile but I seem to remember them costing about 140pp or so to make, i may be wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are not worth the coin to make, unless you have a ton of money burning a hole in your kilt :-p  I have max skill (180) and buffed charisma well over the 112 or so cap - over that, herb prices don't get cheaper.  I want to say the success rate is about 40 percent, but since I can't afford to make 100 or more of them to do a more accurate percentage test, that is very approximate (although I probably have made close to 10 ten chargers in total since I maxed out skill, never more than one at once, and I have not written down and tracked my exact success rate - but 40 percent is close enough).  It appears to run me about (about being the key word heh) 1500pp per successful 10 charger.  And they are not clarity - the lesser one is breeze (2 mana per tick), and the greater one is 3 mana per tick.  I have only ever made the greater one.<br />
<br />
Now, for the duration - here it comes, it sucks - 15 MINUTES!!!  Man, nothing like making a trade skill recipee worthless.  3 mana per tick for 15min at an approx cost of 150pp per drink heh.  Again, only time I have made them is when I had about 1500pp laying around and nothing better to spend it on, and then I used them when soloing.  I have never sold any, no one wants to pay what it costs.  As 1500 is very approx (one successfull 10 charger might run you 1200, the next 1700) and you want to profit, really 2k per 10 charger would be minimum retail sale price to someone I didn't know.  Who is going to pay that?  That's right, basically no one.  So, the moral of the story - they are not even worth making, unless you are rich and they are for soloing.  Even then, it is questionable imo.  Hope this helps.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brothers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank You for the info guys, it was just what i wanted answered. 15min per potion aint that long, considering I can get KEI from friend most of time so with that in mind I guess i wont be making them right away. but I am gonna stock up on the Greater Regen cant go wrong there :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
