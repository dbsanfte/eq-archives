I have been reduced to using velium weapons, but given the hp on most mobs that I am camping these days, the proc is basically insignificant.<br />
<br />
So, any suggestions on relatively cheap PAWs with a proc that is worthwhile (well, better than velium weapons'), that are likely to be available in the Bazaar?</div></div><hr />

Mage summoned weapons. Sometimes come up empty on the search but searching even just &quot;summ&quot; or &quot;summoned&quot; will show you if any for sale. Some hp boost to the pup and nice proc. Belt and mask too if you want to get those also. With a few mages selling them can get pretty cheap. <br />
<br />
   Non summoned i tend to just use whatever ive collected going through loy or vek's and just give those to pup, Also sometimes the vendors in bazaar will have the cheap weapons people sell off and can collect those also. Other than that i'm not to sure what the weapon of choice is.<br />

&quot;Mage summoned weapons&quot;<br />
Blade of Walnan magic proc<br />
Hand of Ixiblat fire proc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">indeed.  Get him one of each and watch the carnage.<br />
I usually just ask a local mage for em :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another useful trick - If your guild is short on mages like mine when I do find a mage to summon a pet kit for me I ask for 4 or 5 sets(weapons, belt, muzzle). I then put the extras in a summoned bag or my foldable bearskin potion bag. Go to the arena, bind nearby and have someone kill ya. Now loot your corpse of all but the bag of pet stuff. Now you have a ready standby when you can't find a mage. Just be sure to check the corpse periodically and repeat the process if it is due to poof soon.<br />
<br />
Of course this is all theoretical since everyon knows that pets can't use items.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dunwut, good strategy, but one minor variation - clear your inventory before getting the 4-5 sets of weaps, so as to leave each set in a SEPERATE summoned bag on the corpse.  Then you can loot the bags one at a time from the corpse as you need them.<br />
<br />
If you find it too much trouble to clear your inventory, just duel, die, pick up the pet kits without looting corpse, duel and die again, loot the first corpse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do like the mage summoned as well, although on my 55 lvl pet it doesn't proc the weapons. The extra hp is nice, and I haven't noticed any difference in damage with the muzzle after I haste my pet, has anyone parsed it? If I can't get a mage to summon weapons I just buy a bunch of shiv's or rusty's anything else really seems to be too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get the Fists instead of the Swords.... The fists will proc even for the 34 puppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I happen to have a mage around I'll ask them otherwise I just go with the eitchaka's (sp) aka off hand claws or chill daggers. They are both off hand only weapons which means 1 of them is all you need. Last time I was in shadeweavers one of the vendors had a bunch of the claws for sale. I bought like 20 of them and suck them on a mule and dig a few off as needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious Tar, why use Chill Daggers instead of just rusty daggers?  I can see the Lariat because of the stun proc...am I missing something about the daggers?<br />
