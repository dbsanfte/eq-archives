I look like a bright colorful clown running around. All other characters are melee based, so the shammy gear is new to me. Any suggestions to upgrade my equipment as well as a better visual look would be appreciated. I am not to terribly concerned with my visual look, but what I look like currently is really pathetic.<br />

Get used to the feeling of looking like a clown, that's how you know you're Uber.  The goofier you look the more Uber you are.</div></div><hr />
