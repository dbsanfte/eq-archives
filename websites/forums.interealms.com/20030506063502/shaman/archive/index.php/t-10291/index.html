<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I going insane, or is anyone else considering bagging their Spear of Fate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=748) full time for a Ceramic Gavel of Justice (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17499)?<br />
<br />
I am not speaking to you vexthal/elemental planes people who bagged your epics long ago anyway and have access to gear with lots of stats AND great focus effects. I am speaking to people like me trying to make tough decisions BETWEEN stats and focus effects.<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency 4 has to be one of the very best focus effects for Shamans. Mana savings of 25% on Turgur's, Malo/Malosinia, all DoTs, Roots, etc.<br />
<br />
Here is my profile - I use Allakhazam instead of Magelo, because my browser at work can not handle Magelo.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=138643<br />
<br />
I have been using an Obulus Death Shroud (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1059) for mana savings, but ODS is starting to become useless now that I am level 65 and starting to fill up my spellbook.<br />
<br />
Now, I could put the Ceramic Gavel in RANGE, but that would displace my Wicked Bone Atlatl (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17164), and I have come to love Haste of Mithaniel for quicker Torpor and Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I would rather part with my Spear of Fate from primary than my Wicked Bone Atlatl from range. Spear of Fate has slightly better stats than Wicked Bone Atlatl, but Haste of Mithaniel makes that up and more. I can always swap in the epic to click a DoT, and then put it away again.<br />
<br />
I don't see myself getting the Shield from Grummus any time soon, since our guild has just started doing mobs like Derakor the Vindicator.<br />
<br />
Anyone else struggling with this? Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I wouldn't bag it for that. with SOF you get 10 to all resists plus mana plus wisdom plus hps. Mana savings is all well and good but how often as a Shaman have you been oom? If you are like me I would venture to guess none. By the way according to the link I clicked the gavel is primary only so no range option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ceramic Gavel was changed in one of the patches since it went into Alla - it is now RANGE / PRIMARY.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found the Ceramic Skull of Decay (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16785) to be the ultimate range item in PoP.  The 2.5 sec you shave of the malo/turgurs combo can make all the difference in T2 and up.  If the mob doesn't get slowed fast (even partially) the 20% savings on my heal time doesn't make any difference in the outcome of the fight.<br />
I hope all the ceramic pop items get added to the new charm slot. That would be a nice place to put those focus and not much else items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">keep the spear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The hp is better then the focus effect imo. Not sure if you have Cann V or not, but if/once you have that, mana problems almost never exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">spear a ToB for me.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt give either up for that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love Affliction Haste also. I currently wear a Circlet of Falinkan (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6452) as my head item.<br />
<br />
Malo and Turgur's are the spells I really care about casting faster, and Affliction Haste III affects them both. Maybe if I get Malos and find myself using Malosinia fairly often I will wish I had an Affliction Haste IV item, but so far it has not been an issue.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 Shaman with Canni V, Torpor, Malo, etc. So, I basically never have mana problems either.<br />
<br />
However - before you say that the spear is better - consider this example.<br />
<br />
I joined a caves group in PoV this weekend to grind out a few aas. Our group was in the back caves pulling like mad. We were clearing the entire back cave, the corrodors, and pulling from the front caves too. A group was set up just outside the caves pulling from within also. We were having to compete with the other group for spawns, so needed to kill and pull as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Is the Spear of Fate better in primary in this situation? The epic DoT is much too slow to use here - would be time wasted for very little damage. The Spear's 10 to all resists were mentioned - but the mobs here are pretty much pure melee, so resists are not important. Spear of Fate has 20 Wisdom and 70 mana. That is nice, but my wisdom is mid 200s even without it - so not that big a deal. Spear of Fate has 30 hp, 10 Stamina - so something like 48 hit points (since my stamina is over 255). Now 48 HP is nothing to sneeze at - but I will still have close to 4600 hp buffed while holding the Gavel. I will be fine to Canni5 nonstop.<br />
<br />
Now consider the Gavel. It has no relevant stats, but saves me 25% of the mana on every Malo, Turgur's, Root, and DoT. That means I spend the same mana killing 4 Fungusfiends while holding the Gavel as I spend killing 3 Fungusfiends holding the spear. Kill 3 Fungusfiends - and the 4th one is FREE!<br />
<br />
In a situation where you are trying to maximize kill speed, that can't be beat. It means I spend less time Cannibalizing and more time adding DPS or pulling for my group to make sure we have nonstop action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why not get cog encrusted epaulets with haste of mithaniel focus and put the gavel in the range?  Manaetic Prototypes really arent that hard for a vindi-capable guild.</div></div><hr />

Well, I think this thread is providing me the motivation to polish off Pottery.  I've been 218-ish for far too long. :)<br />
<br />
Even if used only situationally, I'd like our top 3 shaman to have these (I'm #2 now), and maybe a few other classes in my family  would like them too.<br />
<br />
Star Ruby Encrusted Steins anyone?  I'll be making them by cubic bear-load soon. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well Ximix that may be true, but I have yet to have a group outpull my mana regen. They just can't pull fast enough or there is nothing left to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The answer to your question is yes, put your SoF in the bag while you're doing PoV, for the reasons that you outlined earlier.  It seems well thought out and you probably will do better with that happening.  As far as your range slot goes, I'd say get three AA and Bag The Bone.  Put that 3 AA into QB1 and you won't notice the -5% speed you get on Torpor, etc.  Yes, they do stack, but I'd put having a stable equipment base above that extra 15% buff haste at this time....   Yes, QB3 costs a massive 18AA total, but even the 9AA of QB2 is FANTASTIC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Affliction efficiency is definitely a nice focus for shaman. Personally I've got a talisman of evasion with affliction efficiency 3 which covers most of what i used to cast. I have now picked up all my new dots, malos and malosinia now. I'm starting to notice the missing mana savings on those spells.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for a new affliction efficiency item but there aren't any really good options found yet. The stats on the pottery made one just suck badly. I've already bagged my epic for a better item and I don't want to take my CT brain out of my range slot so that really isn't a viable option.<br />
<br />
The grummus shield is descent but I've already got a shield of holy vigor and I'm not big on downgrading my stats altho it is alot less of a loss than the pottery one would be. The other problem is my guild is pretty much done with grummus and I don't think we will ever do him again if we can help it.<br />
<br />
Bracer of darkness out of VT would be great but with 4 other guilds/alliances in VT also and one being a euro guild it's been hard for us to get much of a shot at VT and we're focusing more on getting to the elemental planes anyway.<br />
<br />
Verant seems to have been very stingy with affliction 4 focus items =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haste of Mithaniel is 20% spell haste. Blessing of Reverence from a Cleric is 10% spell haste.<br />
<br />
I have QB1 and QB2. With the Wicked Bone Atlatl and Blessing of Reverence, Torpor is 3.0 seconds. That gets me to the 50% casting time reduction max. I love it lots! No big motivation to get QB3 atm.<br />
<br />
Also, with the Wicked Bone Atlatl and Blessing of Reverence from a cleric, Tnarg's Mending is 2.6 seconds to cast. Shaving that extra second+ off of the casting time of Tnarg's saves my group rezzes and CRs every time I play.<br />
<br />
Now, I could buy QB3 for 9 aa and have a 3.0 second Torpor without Haste of Mithaniel, but I would give up the quicker Tnarg's. Given that there are better things to do with 9 aa anyway - this option does not seem so great.<br />
<br />
Lichenbane said:<br />
<br />
Well Ximix that may be true, but I have yet to have a group outpull my mana regen. They just can't pull fast enough or there is nothing left to pull. <br />
<br />
That's why I pull!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've already taken down my spear most of the time for a few more hps on a primal spear.  as soon as I can get some people to camp the stuff for my gavel of justice I'll be using that most of the time, I only use epic dot in solo/duo, and I usually tank in duos anyways, so I'd probably just throw on another dot for some more aggro and not worry about the spear once I get this, I've got an itraer insignia in range, so that's not going anywhere.  the loss of hps is gonna hurt some, but it'll be worth it I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tnarg's is 450 mana for 1300 HP's.  Torpor/Quiescence is 200 mana for 1200 or 1800/2100, SCRM Focused.  If you can spare the 36/42 secs that Torpor/Quiescence takes, it's the heal to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tnarg's is clearly our &quot;emergency&quot; heal. Torpor/Quiescence or even Kragg's are much better if they are fast enough.<br />
<br />
However, when a paper-thin enchanter gets mez resisted while the cleric is in the middle of casting a Complete Heal, only Tnarg's will do the trick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is one little factor you are missing : Mana saving focus items are not fixed effect. They are variable from 1 to their max. You will only save an average of 13%, so it isn't Kill 3 get the 4th free, it will be closer to Kill 7 and get the 8th free.<br />
<br />
Still good, but not as good as you are expecting.</div></div><hr />

I've seen this mentioned before but don't know where it came from.  Where do you get this info?  Is there a developer message somewhere?  <br />
<br />
Lucy has the following for Affliction Efficiency IV:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3546&amp;source=Live<br />
1:  Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 25% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
<br />
If it said &quot;UP TO&quot; in line 1, I'd have to agree with you, but it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I get it from several souces:<br />
<br />
1)When they were brand new, people using ShowEQ tested them and proved the mana savings is variable using the mana numbers sent from the EQ servers.<br />
<br />
2)I have performed some rather trival but time consuming tests that prove it as well using only the information provided in-game. If you would like to test it for yourself do the following:<br />
<br />
A)Mem a high mana spell (300+ base cost) and have something you can target to cast it on. Pets make good targets for it.<br />
B)Place yourself in a nice safe out of the way location.<br />
C)Remove any flowing thought items and mana regen buffs you have on.<br />
D)Cast the spell from A until you get the insufficient mana message.<br />
E)Turn on logging if you don't normally have it on.<br />
F)STAND there repeatedly casting the spell until you are succesfull. This is the point where the test really starts.<br />
G)Continue standing around. Do not sit. Do not Canny. Do not let anyone cast a mana regen buff on you. Keep trying to cast the spell every second or two untill successful.<br />
H)Repeat G several times - as many as you can stand to do, but at least 3 additional repetitions.<br />
I)Exit EQ and open your log file.<br />
J)Calculate the time-lapse between successful casts.<br />
<br />
If the effect is a constant, the variation in time between casts will be no more than 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
If it is variable, you will find a much more substantial variation. Something on the order of 1 to 2 minutes if you used a 300+ mana spell.<br />
<br />
I have performed this test on Mana Preservation, the Mage Summoned Focus Earrings, and on Summoning Efficiency. I haven't gotten around to doing it with Affliction Efficiency yet, but there is absolutely no reason to believe that it will be any different.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, if you remove all mana saving foci (or at least any that would effect the spells you are testing with) you can use the same exact method to prove that Specialization is a fixed amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it said &quot;UP TO&quot; in line 1, I'd have to agree with you, but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Then you clearly do not understand how Lucy works.<br />
<br />
The spell data files do not contain the text &quot;1: Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 25%&quot;<br />
<br />
They instead have two numbers : 132,25<br />
<br />
From testing it was determined that effect code 132 means &quot;Decrease Spell Mana Cost&quot;, and that the 25 associated with it indicates how much.<br />
<br />
There is nothing at all in the file that indicates whether or not the saving is fixed or variable.<br />
<br />
The people who maintain Lucy chose that particular wording and use the word 'by' when they probably should use the the phrase 'up to'. That doesn't change the absolute undeniable fact that the effect is variable.<br />
<br />
BTW : <br />
Improved Damage IV<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3513&amp;source=Live<br />
1:  Increase Spell Damage by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
4:  Limit: Instant spells only <br />
5:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
6:  Limit: Target(AE PC v1 excluded) <br />
7:  Limit: Target(PB AE excluded) <br />
8:  Limit: Target(Targeted AE excluded) <br />
9:  Limit: Target(Uber Giants excluded) <br />
10:  Limit: Target(Uber Dragons excluded) <br />
<br />
<br />
That also says &quot;by&quot; and not &quot;up to&quot;, but nobody (at least nobody who has ever used an ID item) would claim that the effect isn't variable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've bagged my spear and range items for the ceramic gavel of justice/skull of decay combo. Whenever i feel like soloing i just put in my spear and take out my ooiv =). Both of these items help alot more then the extra hp i get from using my old equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">hehe Ximix, then you are basically just handicapping your mana regen pulling and recouping it with your focus effect. Plus I really mean what I said about nothing to pull, some groups we can get our dps so high there is nothing to pull. But hey, it's about having fun and if you are having fun, then goal achieved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Zyphyr - Interesting claim about the effect being variable. I will need to test it out. The test you laid out seems sound, I may run it both with and without Affliction Efficiency 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't even need to run that test to tell focus items are variable. Just casting the same spells and watching the percents. Cast bane one time and i use 8% of my mana. Cast it next time and i use 5% of my mana. Thats a noticable and significant difference and isn't just display or rounding differences.<br />
<br />
If you want hard numbers his test would be good. You can make them a bit faster by adding some mana regen to the situation but it makes things a bit less accurate.</div></div><hr />
