<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm pretty satisfied with most of my equipment, espescially considering my current level, but was hoping you might be able to make some suggestions on what I can improve.<br />
<br />
I'm not guilded, so this stuff will have to keep my going for some time, as Planar/Velious armor is just not in the cards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Even though you're a troll, I think a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate would give you the best bang for the buck right now. Everything else looks pretty solid especially for your level. Start saving for bigger ticket items like a horse, JBB, fungi, Solstice earring etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a fellow troll, regen has been sastifying. I bought a Polished Tin Mail Shirt for 1,500pp and it's really nice. It has the velious graphics too, if that's your thing. I call my Troll- Battroll! You'll see if you ever get a chance to see it's graphic on a troll.<br />

You can check my sig for some ideas. I think your best bet would be a new tunic and a horse. A horse, if i remember correctly, is equivalent to Flowing Thought 7, and runs for 8,400 platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bamkaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im curious as to how my Gear sums up to my lvl at 55. check it out and tell me how badly it sucks or don't suck. i do have a fungi but kinda wondering if its worth it to use as a sham past 50 anymore. so any help be cool too :)<br />
