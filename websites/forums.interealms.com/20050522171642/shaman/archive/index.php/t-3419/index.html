<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having problems with my new (cheap) horse and sow:<br />
Summon horse works great<br />
clicky sow works great<br />
lose horse (ckick off or zoned into non horse zone) =&gt; sow speed is limited to the &quot;slow horse&quot; speed, requires log to reset<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>grumpeehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i haven't seen any problems with zoning into no horsey zone, but some of the things i have seen (and it may be &quot;working as intended&quot;) <br />
<br />
1. if i forget that i have horse on, then i go invisible... kos mobs will aggro my horse<br />
<br />
2. i get a lot of green (very green) agro because of my horse (my guess is that the horse is green to me, and maybe they consider my horse's level<br />
<br />
3. when i create a horse in an area i'll be traveling back and fort a lot in... it seems to be standing there like an invisible player... i once died in CoM because i created my horse at the zoneline and i managed to take a bit more than i could chew<br />
<br />
... but just my observations, you'll probably jynx me and now i'll be running at jboot speed next time i zone :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With horse models on you run at the horse's speed, which if you got the 8400pp one like me is slower then sow. Now, if you turn horse models off you run at sow speed and still get the added benefits of the horse, and you can do some other stuff too. You also don't have that annoying slow head bobbing start with horse models off too.</div></div><hr />
