<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took a few months off really took like 4 off.   I'm39th shaman about to get latest upgrade to game.  Anyway for my level what are some good spots to hunt solo and grouped for exp and looot looking for both.  Any hints or ideas would be great.  Also what all has changed here latey if anyone kinda bored and wants to give me the low down on game now would love it.  Bythe have velious and kunak exp im a iskar shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">buy luclin and go to dawnshroud, great zone, you could solo there and group as well, loot sucks but xp rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thx getting luclin in morning, hehe kinda odd for me to use that name since lucin is the only server i have ever played on i keep thinking ppl are talking about my server and not a upgrade to game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try hunting in Neb lair.  exp bonus there is pretty  nice, kill the guards they are still blue at 38th to me and soo easy kills.  I tank them personally, and never loose a bub of health, but I'm a little twinked.  So you might want to dot, root etc.</div></div><hr />
