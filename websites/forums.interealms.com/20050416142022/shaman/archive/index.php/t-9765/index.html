<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>starose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello:<br />
i keep getting disconnected after the world load right before the character selection screen.<br />
Do anyone have this problem and is there a fix?<br />
<br />
thanks alot in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have similar problem, but its because a computer virus: <br />
Win32 Nivma E@mm, drain all my memory and crushed the game.<br />
:mad: <br />
Scan virus on your computer might works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hiis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am also having problems with eq at that same exact point.   After choosing the server and hitting the button to get my toon list the game crashes.  <br />
<br />
I get a message that says something like &quot;eqgame.exe has failed and will need to close down&quot; and then I am dumped to the desktop.  Ive tried deleting the file mentioned and getting a new version from the patch process but i still can not play.<br />
<br />
I have scanned for a virus but came up clean. <br />
<br />
Anybody have a solution or ideas what to try next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ecbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just got off a chat with Tech Support. I have an on-board card for my Celeron -- an Intel 82810 E.<br />
<br />
My problem has been the &quot;EQ must quit&quot; error after the server select screen. Now I *DIDN'T* get this error two nights recently when I reloaded the ENTIRE game. But then the next time I tried it crashed again.<br />
<br />
So the tech support guy said I need to delete the eqclient file from my EQ / EQ Trilogy directory. He said &quot;since that video card isn't supported&quot; when the game detects that eqclient file it causes the system to crash. He seemed to think this was a workaround that would work, he said the reason my system operated those two times recently was because there hadn't been an eqclient file after reloading.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope this is helpful. I'm at work so I can't test it now, I'll have to wait 'til tonight...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ecbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&gt;&gt;This time I tried Vinny2003s´suggestions in &gt;&gt;another thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;1. open your eqclient.ini file and look under video for windowedmode=true (or false) make sure it says false.<br />
2. Next look for videomodebits= make sure it equals 16 or less.<br />
3. Make sure your computer is a peak virtual performance. Its in the settings window.<br />
start-settings-control panel-system-advanced-performance options:  Set maximize performance for applications. <br />
4. oh and make sure your eqclient.ini has the line<br />
EQGFX_DX8.DLL in it at the top.&quot;<br />
<br />
SUCCESS!!!!!!!  These changes worked for me last night.  I notice the screen resolution and &quot;look&quot; is a little less lush than before, because I reduced the graphics-enhancing settings a bit, but it works!  I'm going to tweak the look of things tonight.<br />
<br />
So hang in there folks!<br />
<br />
(P.S. I did wonder if the patch about &quot;charms&quot; last night was actually something to do with these issues and SOE just didn't say so...)  :)</div></div><hr />
