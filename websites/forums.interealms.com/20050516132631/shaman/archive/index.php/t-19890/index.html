<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has there ever been an all-shaman guild?  I know you shaman are strong soloers, and you have respectable DPS when they do more than just slow, buff, and heal.  I imagine that an all-shaman group could be pretty darn effective in a variety of different zones, against a variety of different mobs.  Most shaman I know are very proficient and knowledgable about the game.<br />
<br />
I have no real experience playing a shaman.  I play in the all-bard guild, Molto Espressivo, on Firiona Vie.  We started about a year ago off the EQDiva boards, and are doing pretty well.  There's an all-beastlord guild there too, Legacy of Sha.  We're getting acquainted with them.<br />
<br />
Would there be any interest in starting an all-shaman guild? I'd certainly love to see the single-class guild community on FV expand.  I came back to EQ to play with Molto Espressivo, and I've loved it; the comraderie, the mutual coaching, the thrill of finding new and exciting ways to take down mobs, and the handing-down of gear make for a neat experience.<br />
<br />
If any of you are interested in starting up such a guild, I'd be happy to help you out any way I can.</div></div><hr />

We can put out some okay damage over a very long period of time but Damage per Second is not something that comes to mind when I think of Shaman.  A team of Shaman may be able do something impressive with a Slowable, rootable high hitpoint mob, but more than a couple of mitigating, unrootable mobs would wipe out a group of Shaman in short order.<br />
<br />
I could see how a Beastlord guild could go pretty far and a Bard guild but I think Shaman would be only marginally stronger than a Wizard guild.<br />
<br />
I would be more interested in an all Barbarian guild.<br />
<br />
Cool idea though</div></div><hr />

Heh, Even we bards have to shy away from some mobs.  <br />
<br />
Regards to your DPS, I had heard that with your DoTs (especially since DoTs stack these days), melee, and pet damage, you could have some fairly decent DPS.  I've played a shaman to level 2; I have virtually no first-hand knowledge of your class, merely an appreciation of it and the people that play it.<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.  There is an alliance on FV called Northern Elite or something similar that allows only Barbarians and humans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you're talking feasibility I think you're really talking more about a type of player than a type of class<br />
<br />
because it's really not a question of &quot;is a-shaman class feasible.&quot;  clearly, if you're talking about playing fair and tackling appropriate level targets it's absolutely not.  shaman lack dps, and even healing<br />
<br />
however if you're willing to exploit MUDflation, and able to load the guild up with ppl who can get excited about beating down on lower level mobs with higher level gear and AA then I'd say high SOV, choice mid-SoL targets are doable.  it's like soloing trak with a druid or doing an easy LDON with all shaman or necros... trivial encounters can be done with anyone but doesn't really say anything about those classes per se<br />
<br />
but then again it's the same as starting a &quot;our rangers and rogues fight one handed guild&quot; or &quot;no cleric just drOod&quot; guild or other gimick-based guild.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you had to go with one class only, the most fun and most successfull would be an all necro guild or a all-our-girls-go-topless amazon paladin guild.  shaman are somewhere south of those and mages</div></div><hr />

When Molto started, people made the same points about us as an all-bard guild.  Not enough DPS, no healing.  It has been no problem for us, and we have been able to take down a number of encounters that most people only like to do with a &quot;balanced&quot; group.  <br />
<br />
In regards to the cutting edge raiding content, of course it takes cooperation with other classes.  That's why Molto has a good number of raiding partnerships and alliances, why we're reaching out to Legacy of Sha, the all-BL guild, and why I would so dearly love to see shaman, who I've always regarded as being a very resourceful and versatile class, giving this kind of thing a crack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, in an all shaman guild, your aggro becomes largely irrelevant. You're just pulling aggro off another shaman, not off a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>FeroceFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">One more thing regarding the shaman's lack of healing.<br />
<br />
This is significant in groups where the shaman is the healer and slower, or just the healer.  In an all-shaman group, however, you have 6 guys who can cast a heal.  You can also get regen going.  <br />
<br />
I know there would be challenges to an all-shaman group, but I don't think healing would be at all.<br />
<br />
In regards to the comment made about rezzes: It's really not hard at all to pick up a rez these days.  Molto has gotten along fine picking up the odd rez now and then, and a couple of us have some bot clerics for such eventualities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">one or 2 epic clerics for res, one mgb capable chanter/druid for crack and I can see a pile of shaman dropping some big mobs, I would bet they could drop seru easy. think about it, 40 shaman all casting Ulthor+pox, the mt and rt are both stacking poison dots for agro with the rt using one less...I guess the real question is &quot;is dot stacking infinite?&quot; Could you really stack 40 Breathe of Ulthors on one mob? if so the dps would really be pretty damn sick.<br />
BoS+Pox+Plauge? that would be about 300-400 per tick, toss in all those epics...hmmm nice idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't misunderstand.  It's not impossible, not would it be impossible to drop many raid level mobs--just not any biggies.<br />
<br />
Shaman do have decent DoTs, however, there is the problem with only 30 debuffs/DoTs on a mob.  Consider--Malos, Slow, and probably cripple (to reduce rampages).  That leaves 27 spots for DoTs.  Let's assume you can land 27 Banes (probably needing about 50 shaman here).  Assuming everyone had some kind of DoT focus, that's probably about 2100/tic in DoTs.  On a raid level mob, figure you'll need at least 2 shaman healing every second, so tie up probably 20 for a reasonable heal chain (2 shaman healing at the same time, 10 shaman 'groups' in chain).<br />
<br />
That still leaves about 30 shaman to nuke.  Figure an average of 1100/nuke with focus x 30 with a recast of (7.8+2.2=10) for an additional 3300 dps.<br />
<br />
There aren't that many mobs big mobs that you can reasonably take down with all of 5400dps with a 6400hp (self-buffed) shaman as a main tank.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that as I think about it, the healing will probably require 3 shaman healing at once.  That will drop the dps to probably 4300 or so and prolong fights.  You might be able to clear a chunk of NToV.<br />
<br />
Pets are possible, of course, but they'd get eaten by any AEs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think there is a limited number of debuff slots per mob, though, so even there the stacking is limited... except for DD and dogdog...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A fun idea, but I think it'd be an awfully hard one to implement.  If you could find a group of shammies that just wanted to go have some fun, and weren't worried about being &quot;uber&quot;, then you could do it and go kick some butt on the old world mobs, but past that, you'd start having issues.  <br />
<br />
You can only stack as many dots as the mob has buff slots for, and you'd need a LOT of healers to keep someone up while &quot;tanking&quot; hehe.<br />

Never been an issue for us.  We have a strict hand-me-down policy, which is helped quite a bit by the lack of NO-DROP items.  We also raid with other guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS is not the issue - tanking and healing is. The question is would those Shaman last the entire 8 minutes. I'm guessing no - our healing simply isn't good enough to keep us alive for very long. The mobs you could take down would be very limited, and I personally have no interest in spending all my raid time focusing on content that's 3 years old or more. But then again, most of the people I know who play on FV are not interested in raiding very much, so that's probably something that would appeal to the audience of that server.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if FV has a community board that everyone flocks too, but I think that if you were looking to start an all Shaman guild, that would be a better place to start than here.<br />

<br />
Don't mean to nitpick, but I'm going to anyway. The all shaman guild you refer to was called 'The Shamans of Justics'. It was for barbarian shamans only. I lead the guild myself for almost a year. Unity of Justice was a guild made up of 2 of the officers that wanted to let all class/races in.<br />
<br />
The guild WAS alot of fun, and I remember doing 3-4 shaman groups in permafrost all the time, which was awesome. The guild never made it past the 'newbie' stage however. If anyone ever leveld past 20-30 they just left and joined a real guild. =P</div></div><hr />
