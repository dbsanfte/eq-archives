<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's talkin about the 34 pet.  Basically, he does a substantial amount of damage if used properly.  He won't outdamage you, and his dps is not very impressive, but its like a free dot.  His hps and AC are awful though so you need to tank for him to use him.   If you are accustomed to rooting  and dotting, you will have to adjust your methods to get full use of the pet.  For comparison, think SK pet, give or take depending on levels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 34, and the 39 pet, a decently buffed dogdog will be able to hit a mob often enough to crank out a vaguely respectable amount of damage.  Make sure hes facing the back of a mob.<br />
<br />
Buy mage toys.  At least a belt, and the muzzle.  The strength from the belt, and the haste the muzzle gives, makes a big difference.  Not to mention the 250-500 extra hp (depending on which if you get the belt, or girdle) actually makes him somewhat beefy.<br />
<br />
With toys (The fists of ix mage weapon procs for our level 34 pet, but other weapons dont) the pet is actually pretty good at level 34/39/44.<br />
<br />
It gets harder and harder for dogdog to hit anything reliably enough at the higher levels.  If it COULD hit, it would put out something resembling DPS.<br />
<br />
You'll like the pet at 34, even without toys.  Toys make it alot better, though.   ALWAYS buff str (for atk), tailsman, health (for the few hits you'll want it to tank to hold agro while you dot/slow), and quickness.  If you have the mage-summoned fists, buff dex too.  If you have the full gear setup, you might as well throw in agility and the AC buff.  Trust me - He can tank pretty well in that situation at that level.  <br />

Granted, I'm not too certain of SK pets since they never seem to bother bringing them out, but when I duo with a SK friend of mine, he'll get his pet out for a little extra damage, and it cons green to me, ours con dark blue (level 58 I believe-SK pet having to be 44 or lower to con green). I'm curious as to how the SK pet better than shaman pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SK Pet hits for 55 (I think), innately quads, procs a tap for 45ish damage (goes off a lot). It also has more hit points (2100ish versus 2300ish).<br />
<br />
Invoke Death is the same pet Necros get at 49.<br />
<br />
As far as dogdog is concerned... Blazzax's AE takes him from full health to enrage :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grizlor is correct.  The highest level SK pet is the lvl 49 necro pet.  The lvl 49 Necro pet is the one that my bro's necro used damn near exclusively until 60.  It's considered the &quot;Tank&quot; pet.  It deals okay damage but has high innate defense and such, something our pet cant touch.<br />
<br />
I did run a test with my bro on this a long while ago, I just dont remember the exact results :)  I'm pretty sure that our 61 pet could smoke the Rogue/Monk necro pets that are the lvl 53/56 pets.  But the 49 pet beat mine.  Dont even try the 59/61 Necro pets they CRUSH ours... and the lvl 65 pet I'm sure you can guess where this is going.  I think my dog fully buffed up vs his unbuffed 65 pet took roughly 30 seconds and that is only because 10 seconds of it was when my doggy was enraged and repost every attack.  OH and because it got to repo every attack for 10 seconds it then brought the Necro pet down to ~80%.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the numbers are even more outrageous with Mage pets.  Now that I think about it... I'll probably log on my buddies 65 mage and try out different duels.  It's kinda funny to see pets smoke each other... then I cry because it's my dk blue pet losing to a green SK pet :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oddly enough, this topic came up in /gu last night and a SK in our guild tried to say SHM pets are better than his.  So between LDON mission while resting we did a little parsing.  Chutoi's pet did 5.4dps to me and the SK's pet did 8.8dps (only 5 mins each).  Both were unbuffed and unequipped.  Obviously, the conditions were far from real combat and the gap would narrow significantly if the shaman pet were given weapons, but its pretty telling that the SK pet did about 50% more damage then the SHM pet.  Having to carry weapons or bum off mages is a stupid penatly to get even halfway decent dps from dogdog.</div></div><hr />

It seems obvious from all this discussion lately that spirit pets are very weak defensively, and must really, from a design standpoint (and fully hasted, etc), meant to be a mild offenseive and not at all a defensive tool.</div></div><hr />

yep that say it all):<br />
yes our &quot;dogdog&quot; would much rather curl up by a warm fire and sleep, but should someone attack us, it will bark loudly at it to scare it off.. if that fails it will valiantly try to bark some more  and bite off the mobs ankles! (mind it doesnt manage to hit that often it`s not an dextreous as it was)<br />
<br />
i want to know where that viscous spirit wolf is? huh? huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's been strongly argued that we're not a pet class.  This has largely been subsumed in the argument that we're currently doomed to become a bunch of unwanted, weaklings as we reach 65.  Since so much else needs fixing for the level 65 raiding Shaman, apparently asking SOE to throw Dogdog a bone should be a low priority.<br />
<br />
From reading about all the fun many Shaman have had with Dogdog and Project Alpha on this board, I can see where some developers at SOE might have gotten the idea that Shaman would be pleased with improvements to our pet.  I will certainly welcome any they make.  I'd love to be able to have Dogdog get group buffs, but that seems more appropriate as an early, easy AA rather than  an expensive later one.  Especially since uber Shaman don't want it.  The way I play I'd get it before many others if it weren't going to take an absurd number of points.<br />
<br />
I didn't find our level 39 pet very useful.  However, the level 44 and 55 pets have been awesome up to about level 59.  Given a dagger of dropping (procs weaken) or gnoll hide lariat (procs stun) along with a shiv, broken bottle, or other free weapon they have notably improved my enjoyment of EQ.  While duoing or soloing the pet has sped up my game-play significantly and averted the frustration and wasted time of dying many times.  I've never cared how much damage he was capable of compared to some other class.  I've been pleased he's tougher than the Druids' little Booboo.  I've been overjoyed that he's controllable.  Having a defensive only pet as an Enchanter would drive me crazy.<br />
<br />
At 60, my level 55 pet is not worth much.  He can't handle even temporary agro and so has become a poor DoT that needs healing and calling back as often as not.  I'm anxious to see if the level 61 pet is as relevant to my level as the new pet was at 55.  It sounds like he'll be good for at least the month or so it'll probably take me to get to 65.  I can see where he'd be irrelevant to folks who group a lot, but then so am I.  So be it.  At 65 I'll be getting the &quot;Spirit Call&quot; and &quot;Suspended Minion&quot; AAs right after &quot;Canni5&quot; and &quot;MGB.&quot;   Duoing and soloing with three uncontrolled pets sounds a lot more fun than most of the post-65 grouping and raiding I've heard described.  Fun is what playing the game is all about and for me pets have been fun, raiding has not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">61 pet has one major thing going for him, he can ENRAGE!!! That's really his best use, as a distraction enabling the shaman to either 1) control the mob in question, or 2) make a hasty exit.  <br />
<br />
Mostly I use the dog as a way to buy time to cast spells to control the mobs.  His DPS isn't very good, bout 32 DPS hasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">61 pet is nice.  With Focus/Regen/Ancestral Guard/SLTW/Avatar and a pair of rusties he can add tank xp mobs without too much fuss.  Add Aego/Virtue to that and he can tank down BoT giants with you healing/dotting/raining.  It's not the fastest way, for sure, but it's fun if you're bored or just want to sit on your horse and not tank yourself.  :)<br />
<br />
Cripple seems to make a noticable difference in his performance too, moreso than it seems to when you have a real toon tanking.  No data to back that up though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some points about the pets.<br />
<br />
-- I dueled the pet I get at 61 (true Spirit) against the pet my brother (mage) got at 61. Dogdog got beaten badly. We did this with both pets buffed and with both pets unbuffed. Our pets are no match for mage pets but I never expected him to be a match for a mage pet.<br />
<br />
-- I solo some in tier 1 PoP (boring) and the True Spirit pet is able to tank long enough for me to slow the critter. After the mob is slowed he can tank well enough if I throw him a Quiscence or two and that is good enough for my purposes. I tank some or most of the time when soloing.<br />
<br />
-- In LDoN he gives me a method of contributing DPS while I am still slowing mobs. It isn't a ton of DPS but it is something.<br />
<br />
-- In BoT, he pushes the mobs aroound a lot. I do not like that at all but I am able to deal with it.<br />
<br />
-- I would like AA in GoD that improve the pet if they are cheap and reasonably useful. Innate DW would be cool, and/or an innate proc. Anything hat adds DPS really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just thinking out loud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then buff your dog.  A lot.  Have a cleric Virtue it.  Poof!  He's an add-tank.  Stack Soul, Diaku, and Avatar for maximum atk and dogdog becomes noticably less whiff-prone and quads a fair bit also.  Again, crippling the mobs helps.<br />
<br />
  But no, if you just use him as he's formed, he's a 180 a tic dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">61 pet with no buff is not where near a 180 dot, at best his about 13 dps, there parses somewhere on the board, at best fully buffed 2 weapons i believe he get to 45 ish dps. btw i was counting that they are good when buffed and given weapons:) the unbuffed pet sucks at damage. and fully buffed i think he has 3k hp? that doesnt last long due to the bad ac/mitagation that our pets have and is not way an add on tank. more a few sec to escape possibly.<br />
<br />
13*6(tick) =78<br />
45*6 =270.<br />
<br />
however those amounts are greatly reduced on elemental planes mobs and hard ldon, pet missed alot and doesnt hit very high often. though pet is still ok in bot level planes, ldon easy and lower planes<br />

<br />
Hi all,<br />
<br />
Not to beat a dead horse, but how can the SK pet be better than our lvl 61 pet, when ours is level 58 and the SK pet is level 44?  I've read that we have a problem with our dog missing quite a bit on higher level mobs, such as in PoP, so how effective is the SK pet?  I would think as a level 44 he would not hit anything.  Even with his 30? or so  hitpoint lifetap (based on info on the necro boards) I would think our pet, with weps, would also dual and double, while hiting harder, for 59 or 60, vs. the SK pet that hits for 55.  I understand that the SK pet may have 10% or so more hp, but even then, I would think the pets are fairly close in dps and survivability.  However, due to the level difference, I would think the shaman pet would be more useful at the higher levels.  <br />
<br />
If this is not so, then please tell me what I'm missing, I'm only level 56, so have not experienced this first hand.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Would be interesting if you buffed both pets to fighting config, such as giving shammy pet weps and usual shaman buffs, and giving the SK pet usual SK pet buffs.  Would be more of a real world test.<br />

shaman pets have a higher potential though. if you give both pets mage weapons and all buffs available by their owner, the shaman pet will most likely win pretty easily. its hard to say i wouldn't sacrifice that potential for the convenience of not having to do all that though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That really answers the first question.  No doubt our pet is even weaker than I suspected by just comparing the stats.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">yep, it puts our pet effectively below the sk pet. the sk pet wont enrage though, the main reason i think was described above which is that the necro 49 pet was amazing and sk get it.<br />
i would imagine that the sk pet has about the same success as our own pet when when fully buffed.<br />
<br />
i think we should get a pet at 65,  based of <br />

That really answers the first question.  No doubt our pet is even weaker than I suspected by just comparing the stats.<br />

<br />
that's the thing. head to head combat between pets doesn't really do much other than show you which has a better combination of damage and durability, but in time you're going to care a lot more about the damage and a lot less about the durability, because neither one will be durable anyway.<br />
<br />
there are only 2 things that will affect a pet's accuracy in combat, attack rating and level, and shaman pets have a huge advantage over sk pets in both areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">shaman pets have a higher potential though. if you give both pets mage weapons and all buffs available by their owner, the shaman pet will most likely win pretty easily. its hard to say i wouldn't sacrifice that potential for the convenience of not having to do all that though.<br />
<br />
I don't think it would win too easily, but it would win.  Dogdog was barely winning with haste/focus/FA/weapons versus an only hasted Joey.  Also, I was *not* using augmentation of death (was having shm sltw the sk pet), because my lazy twink sk doesn't have it... aug of death gives Str, AC, and 65% haste.  It is likely Joey with aug of death vs. fully buffed, armed dogdog is DEAD EVEN or even very slightly in Little Joey's favor.<br />
<br />
Adding mage weapons with dogdog's higher dex from fa/focus should result in him winning by a larger margin.  But I don't think it would be that crazy (winning at 20% probably).  I'll get augmentation of death and some mage weapons and try these configurations.  More in a bit...<br />

I tend to have to pet up 2 or 3 times in a given LDoN since we rarely have mez power and sometimes dog dog just has to eat an add while I get everything slowed.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I spend a few hundred mana for a small amount of free extra DPS throughout the adventure, and maybe the ability to offtank an extra mob for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Since unlike a DoT, dog dog does damage as long as you keep him, he's probably our greatest source of damage per mana if you are smart about keeping him safe.  If not, at least I don't waste a lot of mana buffing him.</div></div><hr />

OK, so what is the answer to this question?  Is the SK pet as big an asset in the higher level zones as our dog?  Or does he miss a lot more due to his lower level?  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Spetsnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Grizlor is correct.  The highest level SK pet is the lvl 49 necro pet.  The lvl 49 Necro pet is the one that my bro's necro used damn near exclusively until 60.  It's considered the &quot;Tank&quot; pet.  It deals okay damage but has high innate defense and such, something our pet cant touch.<br />
<br />
I did run a test with my bro on this a long while ago, I just dont remember the exact results :)  I'm pretty sure that our 61 pet could smoke the Rogue/Monk necro pets that are the lvl 53/56 pets.  But the 49 pet beat mine.  Dont even try the 59/61 Necro pets they CRUSH ours... and the lvl 65 pet I'm sure you can guess where this is going.  I think my dog fully buffed up vs his unbuffed 65 pet took roughly 30 seconds and that is only because 10 seconds of it was when my doggy was enraged and repost every attack.  OH and because it got to repo every attack for 10 seconds it then brought the Necro pet down to ~80%.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the numbers are even more outrageous with Mage pets.  Now that I think about it... I'll probably log on my buddies 65 mage and try out different duels.  It's kinda funny to see pets smoke each other... then I cry because it's my dk blue pet losing to a green SK pet :/<br />
<br />
Tried this tonight with the level 49 Necro Warrior pet - neither pet had any weapons.<br />
<br />
Dogdog (buffed with Ferine, Focus, SLTW)<br />
Boney (buffed with Augmentation of Death)<br />
<br />
Boney won 4 out of 4 and the only reason it was close was down to Enrage.  Adding Replenishment might have negated some of the damage taken from lifetaps and swung the fights in favour of the puppy.  Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most shadowknights don't have the /pet hold AA trained, are pullers for a group or reponsible for tanking adds where controlling a pet becomes difficult.  Some are just plain unfamiliar with the proper and effective use of their pet.<br />
<br />
It's the level 49 necro pet.  The pinnacle of necromancer pets before Kunark was released.  It weighs in at 2350HPs, has excellent innate attack and defensive skills and frequently procs a 45 pt lifetap.  It also laughs while bludgeoning things to death with it's fists.  Quad attacks by default for 55 a hit, alternates kick and bash, you get the idea.  This pet is also a serious undercon and with just Augmentation of Death it averages 35+ DPS on golems in PoV.  Add in mask, fists/swords and belt + focus/diaku/FA and that average goes up signifigantly.<br />
<br />
Our pet, on the other hand, is a companion summoned from the spirit world to assist us in our travels and adventures.  From an RP standpoint it was never meant to be a killing machine and simply will not be superior to an int caster's undead pet that used to destroy level 50 warriors pre-kunark and regularly went on rampages through Sol B (prior to the change to pet aggro).  At least it won't be &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now if you're asking if our pets can match the DPS of the 49 nec/64 sk pet, well yes.  A dual weilding dogdog with haste mask, belt, 2 fists/swords and SLTW/Focus/Diaku/FA can indeed reach 35+ DPS on golems in PoV as well.  It'll even exceed the SK pet's HPs at this point, though still inferior in dmg mitigation and avoidance.  It just comes with the costly price of all that gear and buffage.<br />
<br />
In addition, VI publicly stated that they modified pet attack ratings to remain fairly consistent for a wide range of mob levels, excluding certain mobs that are designed with very high AC or certain melee immunities.  No way in hell I'm looking it up since it was a long time ago.  Take my word or leave it, doesn't matter to me.<br />
<br />
I'm glad we have a pet and I don't concern myself on whether it's better or worse than someone else's, only that it suits my needs, which it does.  As someone stated earlier, it's fully controllable plus we can buff it, haste it, pet it and make it stand up and sit down (hump) on the corpse of that jerk that trained me in HoH earlier today.<br />
<br />
That alone is priceless.<br />

It's not how big their pet is that matters, it's how it's used. (had to say it)<br />

Just happened to duel a sk the other night, and our pet whooped on his pet. I asked if he used augmentation of death, he said he hadn't so he tried it again with that used. My pet was bufed with Focus, Wrulan, Ancestral Guard, Diaku, and SLTW and two rusty daggers. First time, pet was at maybe 75% when his died. Second time, with aug of death, pet was at about 35-40%. <br />
<br />
Just to see if it wasn't a fluke, we tried it a bunch more times, and EVERY time our pet whooped up on the SK pet. So, I'm not sure if anything was changed since the poster originally did his testing, but that is no longer the case, shaman pets are clearly better than SK.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm ready to send a thank you letter to SOE for our pets being able to whip on a green con, but thought I'd share :)<br />

Well, I do not know of any shaman who doesn't give pet two weapons (except when you run out), I kind of take the dual wield as given with regard to our pets, and honestly think any kinds of testing should always include the usage of weapons for the purposes of a complete testing. As far as the addition of an off hand attack by giving pet two weapons, I still don't think that alone would make such a big difference in the outcome, maybe the prior poster is right with regard to the change in pets. I'll try some more when i get a chance, and try all combinations of weapons and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">well, how many times have you grouped with a 65 SK? And how many times have you seen them have their pet out? That should answer your question on the effectiveness of their pets.<br />
<br />
As said, most SKs consider the pet a difficult pain, especially if pulling.<br />
<br />
To put things into perspective, I had done some parsing to see how effective &quot;battle clerics&quot; really are.  Here's the numbers I got:<br />
<br />
65 SK - offensive AA: CF1, SotK1, KA1, SCF3, using a WMBS, 1300ATK, fully shaman buffed: 110k damage<br />
55 paladin - no AA, unknown ATK, using a scepter of lightning: 55k damage<br />
58 cleric - evoc specialized, SCF1, using cleric hammer, let shaman heal and spent mana nuking: 45K damage (don't ask.  just don't ask.)<br />
SK pet - 37K damage<br />
dog dog - 16K damage<br />
<br />
Everyone had SLtW on them, and I'm pretty sure this was after the pet changes.<br />
<br />
Parse was done at Hobgoblins in PoN (upper 50s mobs).<br />
<br />
The thing I focused on is that the SK pet is a ~30percent increase in DPS for the SK.  I'm not sure if that reflects poorly on SK DPS output or well on the pet.  Most of the SKs mana was burned on lifetaps since the cleric was busy DPSing, instead of spears.<br />
<br />
I've been alphaing the pet more lately, and I believe that pushes the damage up to about 2/3rds of little Joey.  I never bother to avatar, focus and diaku the pet - unless I'm in a LDoN where I use dogdog to time avatar since no one ever calls for avatar refreshes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">As far as the addition of an off hand attack by giving pet two weapons, I still don't think that alone would make such a big difference in the outcome...<br />
<br />
Taken from the other thread regarding pets on the Crucible:<br />
<br />
22.9 DPS; 1.04 SPS; 37.9 ave hit -- SLTW<br />
33.5 DPS; 1.59 SPS; 37.4 ave hit -- SLTW + dual wield (two rusty weapons)<br />
<br />
The 2 weapons definetly made the biggest difference. The rest is a result of AC buff and agility which the first poster didn't use either.</div></div><hr />

Would be interesting if you buffed both pets to fighting config, such as giving shammy pet weps and usual shaman buffs, and giving the SK pet usual SK pet buffs.  Would be more of a real world test.<br />

I think that unbuffed pet is real world test (except for haste) in the 65 world.  Give puppy anything else and you will be upset when he gets wasted in 4 seconds if he ever gets agro or enrage.  And for the person who mentioned that fully buffed puppy can tank experience mobs at 65, lol...I suppose for those 4 seconds he does ok.<br />
<br />
Anyway, come on...highest level puppy is when properly applied a long lasting dot that does about 15 dps hasted (22 dps stated above is probably not realistic in upper tier mobs) and can perhaps provide a few seconds to high tail it out of a bad situation.  Now is that all bad, I don't think so since I use puppy a lot.  BUT..I would like to see puppy get  innate dual wield and better attack so he could actually be able to hit something.  At the end of the day I believe that it would not be unbalanced if puppy did 30-50 dps since shaman damage in short fights is clearly lacking.<br />
<br />
As far as puppy being fragile I think thats fine, it is a situational weapon and not a tank.  My guess is that the upcoming expansion puppy will do exactly this type of damage but that is giving Sony more credit than they probably deserve based on history. We should probably do a poll of 65 shamans who fight in hard LDON or BOT and higher type zones and ask how many give puppy 2 weapons.  Maybe I am smoking dope but I suspect the grouping shaman that take the time to buff up puppy (excluding haste) including giving weapons is just about 0%.  Obviously the soloing shaman has more motivation to buff up puppy.<br />

I bind at Wayfarer's camps and use Spiritstone to ghetto-gate out afterwards - the short run from the spot you get dumped at to the PoK book is generally enough to harvest sufficient rusties along the way to replace any used.<br />
<br />
I buff pet with Focus and SLTW and ask cleric or druid to add Pot9 or Virt as well. I also use dogdog as Ferine Avatar timer. The point of the buffs isn't presupposing dogdog will then be able to tank - I know pet is fragile, nevertheless, dogdog with Focus and Virtue will tank an unslowed LDoN mob for about 10 or 15 seconds, and in situations when it has all turned to custard, the extra few seconds that dogdog buys is pretty much the difference between a close shave and a &quot;loading...please wait&quot;.<br />

/agree.<br />
<br />
In non PoP zones Scooby tanks fine for farming with Q in Seb/Droga/Acrylia. In PoP zones where he can't tank then I was either (a) soloing with root/dot and kept him suspended via SM2 as a contingency (b) grouping where I used him as extra DPS even if it is fairly pathetic. Back when pets would aggro mobs so easily there was a good cause for skipping pet in dungeons but with the pet aggro changes I almost always have him up in groups.<br />
<br />
Would be nice though if our pet could innately dual wield to avoid carrying the rusties around. :)</div></div><hr />
