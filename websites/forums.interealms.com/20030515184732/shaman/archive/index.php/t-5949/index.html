<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone written a strategy on how to kill either Fright, Terror, and Dread?<br />
<br />
I went in their on the weekend with my guild and the whole three of em were up. Yet no-one seem to know how to pull these guys. Anytime someone tried they died from the DT. CT was up at the same time so not sure if that had anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking for a PoF map with the locations marked, has anyone done one of these?<br />
<br />
Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The DT takes a bit to recycle.  Select a random DT sacrifice and throw them at the boss, they get DTed. Then your raid force has  time before the DT recycles to pull the golem.  I'm sorry I don't remember the exact time of the DT cycle, but a minute sounds about right.<br />
<br />
PS The DT sacrifice (preferably gnome!) gets extra points if they can think of something witty to shout right before they get DTed.<br />
<br />
sacrifice shouts, What's the greek word for oral pleasure?<br />
Fright shouts, CARATHOS!<br />
<br />
Trust me, when doing Sky, it's the only fun part of the whole trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hate to correct you Gloriana but you meant Fear right? :)<br />
<br />
Sacrifice one for the team my suggestion would be a ranger...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, I meant Sky. Once you get up to Island 5, it's DT city in Sky.  Especially if you start farming spiroc blades, if you think 2-3 deaths per Spiroc Lord, 10 lords killed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ridgey Didge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ummm, I know about the DT's. But I need info on what area/s you clear and where do you pull these too?<br />
<br />
Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the days of sacrificing rangers are over.<br />
<br />
Our ranger with Archery Mastery3 can out damage anyone around heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
The golems are hard to pull, I have only killed them once and our monks died a bunch of times trying to figure out how to kill them.  One tactic we used was send in my low level bot druid and take a DT and then pull.  I believe you have 30 seconds between Death Touches.  <br />
<br />
here is a map for you.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/fearplane1.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically we cleared the majority of the plane from the usual camp (turn left and run to the wall as you come out of portal).   Then we moved past the buildings marked a, c, d  to around -1380, 0  on this map and killed the golems.  Dunno if this is a very good way or not heh.</div></div><hr />

Buahaaaaa!!!!!<br />
<br />
oh man...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We always sacrificed dr00ds to the DT. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i like the sound they make when they go pop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the Fear raid I went to, we killed all 3 golems with relative ease.  First send someone as a sacrifice to take the initial DT, then have someone pull it, the 2 amy knights will come too, you can have a chanter charm them.  Two out of three of them DT, the one that doesn't DT AE nukes and dispells 1 buff.</div></div><hr />
