<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was going to post this in response to another thread, but when I actually saw the numbers my mind just . . .  :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
Our real problem is not necessarily in our blast heal, but in our &quot;Complete&quot; heal.<br />
<br />
Our blast heal falls right within the percentages that &quot;Spell Guy&quot; says we should.  The whole 100/64/47 thing.  Whether or not that is where we should be is not relevant.  The spells are &quot;correct&quot; for those numbers.<br />
<br />
However, our &quot;Complete&quot; heal does NOT follow this formula.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric CH = 7500 HP<br />
<br />
Druid CH = 4680 HP<br />
<br />
Shaman CH = 1950 HP<br />
<br />
<br />
This comes out to a 100/62.4/26 division.<br />
<br />
***?  Someone got screwed . . . let me see . . . who was it?  Oh, right, Shaman.<br />
<br />
If you follow the math that all the other heals follow, Mending of Kragg should heal 3525 HP of damage.  Somewhere along the line we lost 1575 HP worth of healing.  Thats a HUGE amount.  <br />
<br />
Somebody explain that to me . . . please?<br />
<br />
Look, we can argue the percentages all we want, but, I think we should first insist that the percentages become consistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I and many people have said before forget about ch and the ch wanna be spells. They are out dated and becoming useless. Ask a cleric what spell they use when they are in GoD doing the trials. Answer is gonna be supernal or holy light for most of them. You simply can't spend 10 seconds casting a spell vs 3.75 or less with spell haste. With max spell haste thats down to 2.25 seconds and less than a quarter of the cast time of ch for clerics. They could give us a 3525hp ch spell and it wouldn't make a damm bit of difference in the situations where we need healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree. Atleast for the shaman, the CHeal is dead. Let it go.<br />
<br />
However i do agree on the percentages being F'd.<br />
<br />
I think its becoming a redundent theme in alot of posts and replies lately. Pehaps a issue all shaman are settling on ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman CH is totally useless no matter how you view it.<br />
<br />
-First , if we have time to CH, that would mean our HoT has time to work .  Which one would you rather cast ?<br />
<br />
-Second, do you know how many other things a shaman can do in those 10 seconds. (I can personally cast 2 spells and one clicky in that time).<br />
<br />
-Third, if i wanted to stand there for all that time just to heal someone, I would have been a Cleric.<br />
<br />
-Fourth, shaman have the mana recovery to where we dont need a high efficient instant heal. (2 regular heals are much better, due to focus effects and the chance to critical).<br />
<br />
<br />
I seriously do not know why they even considered giveing shaman CH, even if it would be like a 3k heal.   I would still rather cast HoT, this way i can do other stuff as well.  And if it doesnt seem like the HoT is enough, il throw in a quick spot heal to help the HoT spell.<br />
<br />
I did not pick this class to be main healer in group anyhow, unless there was no choice.  I personally like the idea of assisting the main healer, upon choice.  CH just seems to make it so you are the main healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The druid 5k heal is also 600 mana, not 400 like the other CH type spells. Efficiency wise it isn't much of an upgrade compared to a druid's 3k heal. How often would you use a 4k, 600 mana, 10 second heal?</div></div><hr />
