<br />
supprisingly they are all blue( 60-70% light blue)  to a 56 ogre  BUT poor exp compared to hhk, and a whole lot more fun!!<br />
<br />
These guards are paladins so u have to kill em twice cos they LOH, and they got high reists  so they are a challenge!  they drop and ave of 25 pp per kill  (2h fine steel and minor stuff)  some drop 2 weapons at once.<br />
<br />
