<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am relatively new to these forums, but am looking for some advice on possible equipment upgrades to try for as i level up over the next 10 or so levels<br />
<br />
I am currently level 35, and a Barbarian.<br />
<br />
Here is my Magelo Profile:<br />

<br />
<br />
Any upgrades that can be acquired through xp groups or mini-raids would be suitable, or any that can be bought for a resonable amount - I have a relatively steady (though small) income from tradeskills :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, its been said before and will be said again...<br />
1) Go for AC and Hp rather than wis (search the forum for more info on this, but trust the community on this one)<br />
2) Search the forum for threads on equipment.<br />
<br />
Having done the standard response, here's some more concrete advice:<br />
Jaundiced bone arms would be great, 350pp. <br />
Totemic helm (quest, costs 160pp) or Jaundiced helm (350pp)<br />
Rings: Replace with 6ac 65hp (velium fire wedding rings, 800pp for a pair, jeweller made). Keep the wis ones for tradeskills.<br />
Polished bone bracelet - helps your dots, not sure on cost<br />
<br />
If you've still got cash to spend:<br />
Sarnak Battle shield 1kpp<br />
Iksar Ceremonial bp (regen bp) 5kpp (very very nice item)<br />
Jaundiced bone boots (detecting a trend here? :))<br />
Crystal spider eyes<br />
<br />
An important thing at your level is to start working on defence, and try to keep it maxed. Later on you will get a lot of aggro from slowing, and its important then to have a high ac. Working on defence at 35 is a lot easier than at 55.<br />
<br />
Once you've got totemic there's not a lot of stuff you can quest - just keep working on xp and cash will come in eventually. The geos in crystal caverns are a good farming spot if you take a strong group of friends with you.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just saw your &quot;soloing&quot; profile with totemic arms - jb arms are still an upgrade but not quite so important with totemic :) Really, I'd keep the totemic on all the time and sell that armband, 0ac on arms is not good, grouped or solo!</div></div><hr />
