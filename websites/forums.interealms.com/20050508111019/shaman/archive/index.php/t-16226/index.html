<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So there isn't a way to chose an adventure with no time limit yet it is harder? This expansion sounded like it was heaven sent for casual gamers that are only on for 3 hours or so then log. Reading the threads on this from here and other boards it sounds more like a power-gamer expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah was supposed to be poll: messed it up.</div></div><hr />

But what they need to do is make sure the time limit isn't geared toward level 30's with SoD's and fungi tunics - which is what every nimrod in beta seemed to do.  *snort*<br />
<br />
Sony beta testing is about as fair and balanced as Fox's news reporting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get rid of the time limit.  Period.<br />

Or at least, provide a different path with harder mobs but no time limit, so that a group can use skill instead of mindless mob bashing.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The people controlling the beta test ran tests on the dungeons with various level differences. They didn't use just one set level range the entire time.<br />
<br />
I would think that the dungeons are oriented more toward the average player in terms of how much of a challenge it offered.<br />
<br />
The ones I tested when grouped with characters that had above average equipment were not that difficult. I would like to think that they will tweak the difficulty before September 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would like a choice.  Either have time limited versions yielding more points or make the non time versions a bit harder.<br />
<br />
Either that or have the number of points you get for the adventure reduce every 15 mins over the time limit you go or something. Even then I wouldnt want it but would at least be a bit better.<br />
<br />
P.S. Poll options made more sense with the title: Should the time limit remain on LDoN dungeons</div></div><hr />

Remove the time limits, or give additional bonuses the faster you do them.  Thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did play a few adventures in beta. Didn't like the timer at all. It is to early for me to tell though. I need to get my regular guildies down there before I know if it is as bad as I think it is. For one I would like to se better scaling of the adventures. As it is now the time is probably good for a well equiped member of a raiding guild) person. That again leaves us casual small guild players in the dust. The toons you got by betabufing in the test were WAY better equiped than we are in my guild.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see:<br />
- Better scaling of adventures to the group composition.<br />
- A choice of easy added to normal and hard.<br />
- Probably more xp given. I have a feeling that the dungeons will be pretty empty of lvl 65 players after a while. Most will still prefer the xp in PoP. This one is pure speculation.<br />
<br />
If I had to vote I'd say choices.<br />

Good point: after 15minutes in an instance a corpse ought to appear at a GY outside where it could be ressed.  The player could then get back inside the instance and, with no respawns in the way, return to his group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been playing with a copy of my live Shaman on beta, and I'll admit that sadly the betabuff has much better equipment than my copy, like about 1k more hp, 100 more ac, and quite a bit more mana. I played with a betabuff 65 shaman till they copied mine over, and I felt weak with my live copy when it first arrived, but once I got over that fact, I was able to do just fine and the difficulty seemed about right.<br />
<br />
I have won about 15 adventures, and lost 4 for various reasons, mostly when one or two members would leave during the adventure, or go ld and not return. I think this will be the biggest problem with LDon, trying to keep 6 people together while getting an adventure, traveling to the entrance, and making it through the thing without someone leaving. <br />
<br />
I have had fun during the beta, and haven't logged in my live guy since I started playing it, if that tells you anything about the fun factor. The 64 bane spell is awesome too, and will be a welcome addition for places like veksar where poison and disease dots are worthless. Resists are pretty low with them also, as I never bother debuffing before slows in these dungeons, and have had very few resists. I just hope it doesn't cost a thousand adventure points to buy them, since my first goal on live will be to aquire the level 64 bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What is the purpose of the time limit?  That's a question I'd like to hear the answer to.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think there's another alternative.  Instead of having an all or none award, how about a graded reward?  If you complete the quest in 90 min, you get 100% of the points, if you take 2 hours, you get 75% of the points, etc.<br />
<br />
That would solve the problem of spending 91 min on a quest and coming away with nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think a time limit is fine when applied to specific quests etc, but when every instance has the limit I'm not sure what to think anymore about this expansion.  Sounded like it was just the thing EQ needed but with the time limits I fear the power gamer mentality easily taking over in this expansion and casual players are once again pretty much SoL (not to mention groups leaving out some classes because of efficency in time etc).  Guess I'll find out first hand next week though how these limits effect the enjoyment at least for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Overall, I liked the time limit concept. I think on some of the events, like the rescue ones in particular, that the time should be the time to get to the person/mob because getting them back to the entrance through empty rooms is trivial but annoying because they're so slow. Also, as I didn't bother with the level 65 content (since everyone else was :p) I don't know how much prep time would be needed for the final mobs on assassination runs, again, setting the timer to get to the mob then maybe a third timer starts to give you time to prep and kill would be nice.<br />
<br />
I played mostly with the lower level content, level 30s - 55. The biggest stumbling block for each failure was either link deaths or mana regen, both of which are affected by the time limit. <br />
<br />
Honestly, it's hard to gauge really how difficult the lower end stuff was as people were using the shared bank slot liberally. As far as I know, I only tried 2 adventures with lower characters that weren't &quot;twinked&quot; with insane gear, both were failures due to mana/time. <br />
<br />
I really have enjoyed playing LDoN in Beta but I still won't be buying it. I'll wait and see how getting groups going on normal servers, without the ability to create what you need, goes.</div></div><hr />

The time limit doesn't lower the requirement for a res'r, it makes it almost required. You don't have time for someone to run back 4 zones to get to the dungeon, you need them back right away. How else are you going to do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fairly certain that the timer is to prevent dungeons from being  inaccessible due to a particular personality type.</div></div><hr />

Graveyards reduce the stranglehold on clerics, but this timer concept<br />
seems to INCREASE it. Sure, you can bind outside and run back in, <br />
but that takes time (zoning twice, trying to find your group, looting<br />
the corpse and rebuffing). All the while, the clock's running against<br />
you. Seems like a death means certain failure. Gotta have a cleric for<br />
their fast heals.<br />
<br />
I was going to order it and start downloading it this weekend. However<br />
after the reports on this timer, I don't think I will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Death isn't necessarily certain failure but it can be a pain. Maybe it was just me but it seemed that some themes were less forgiving then others (or maybe it was just the groups I was with at the time). Link deaths were the biggest problem with my adventures, people going LD 3 or 4 times per adventure pretty much meant leave them behind and they can catch up or fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bind outside? run in and go.<br />
<br />
Works for casters fine, melee can have up to a three zone run from soul binder though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I voted for choice, but really it probably just needs to be tweaked to be longer and that would be alright. In theory a time limit is a good and neccessary (due to hardware/griefers) thing, when you're staring at 45 minutes left and you've already had to stop twice for someone to answer the door/phone/baby/spouse/etc I think its sounding too short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, I think time limits are an important part of the instancing technology.<br />
<br />
You can't create these new instances permanently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i think that imposinga timelimit takes away from the idea behindthe expasion. This isnt quite &quot;getting back to basics&quot;. You cantgo in and explore and have fun on your own time, its a race.<br />
<br />
On the other hand by putting a timelimit on your really easing the server stress and thats never a bad thing, atleast untill we get unlimited bandwidth for everyone and lag because a myth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">just to follow up.  I personally /feedback a number of times in beta that the time limit should be increased.  It was originally 60 mins.  ?laugh.<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble meeting the timer, try the collection type adventure (collect 30 pretty trinkets, or whatever) and go from there.  I managed to pass one of those with a cleric that said &quot;oom&quot; within 10 mins of starting the adventure.  From which point I did the majority of the healing.  This person never cast complete heal the entire time we were there, only remedy and elixir.<br />
<br />
We had a pretty major wipe, all but me and the necro.   THe necro was trying to do the CC but the SK wasn't smart enough to figure out which mobs were not undead and kill them first.  I don't think the ranger had a char over level 20 on live server because he didn't understand what assist was.  The SK routinely sat down to med and left me to do the tanking....<br />
<br />
and we still managed to succeed with 5 mins to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok, I'll explain why I think that a timed endeaver is less cleric reliant.  Because you don't need, nor is it a good itea to get your rez during the event   Just sprint back in and don't fully loot your corpse after you sprint in.  This has the advantage of you still keeping your health and mana (versus a rez).<br />
<br />
Your corpse will pop to graveyard and you will still have some time on it for the rez when you are done with the event.<br />
<br />
If there was no timer then most groups would prefer the convenience of having a cleric in group instead of waiting 15-20 min for their group mate to return fully rezed from another cleric in the graveyard.<br />
<br />
Am I wrong about this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh, I think time limits are an important part of the instancing technology.<br />
<br />
You can't create these new instances permanently.<br />
<br />
No they cant be permanent, but they could use the following logic:<br />
<br />
1.  An instance shuts down after (say) 5 minutes with no character or corpse inside it.<br />
<br />
2.  Corpses in an instance are moved to the GY outside the instance after 15 minutes (ie. same time length as PoP uses).<br />
<br />
3.  Instances shut down automatically after (say) 3 hours if not already shut down by rule (1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">3.  Instances shut down automatically after (say) 3 hours if not already shut down by rule (1).<br />
<br />
<br />
3 hours is still a timer.  Why not say you want the timer increased to 3 hours instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">For those of you not in beta, the time limit needs to stay. There are collection adventures where if there was no time limit, then you could just farm all afternoon with some friends and would always win. The assassination ones are the same, you could slowly move in, die a few times, and still win. They're supposed to be challenging, thats what people dont understand, this is still a game, if you want to pay for your gear, www.ebay.com has a good selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think of it this way, the time limit is a way for them to &quot;tune&quot; the encounter. If there was no limit, then yes any group at any time COULD always pick hardest difficulty and always win it. <br />
<br />
Why wouldn't you? You can plod along, rez from scewups, split,lull, single pull, hit traps and wait, run back the way you came and kite in a non-mob area...etc..etc..<br />
Seems like the time limits are a necessary evil.<br />
<br />
On an aside note, can anyone confirm that partial adventure points CAN be gotten even for a failed timed event. Several people have stated as such, which sounds fair. The better you do the more points you score.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I was going to check the partial points this weekend hopefully. I don't remember getting them when I finished a rescue quest late but I was also not looking for them. That was last week sometime though, it might have changed. I just really don't remember my little Cleric having any points until she actually won an adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Time limits are just one artificial way of putting a constraint on things. I just happen to think that the way it is done is the wrong way of doing it. It is also probably the easiest to implement.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind it so much if they had put in a way to balance the encounters based on who enters them. I do not know what they used as an average group when they balanced things. I'm pretty sure the group is a good bit better equiped than we are in my guild.<br />
<br />
There is no way to change what they have done in regards to the time limit. Adjusting the time limit upwards will just make it way to easy for the well equiped group. Removing the time limit is not an option at this point in time.<br />
<br />
What they could do is:<br />
- To improve the balance thing. I seem to recall that they claimed the adventures would be balanced towards the group going in. In my experience this is not the case. I doubt this is feasable(sp?) at this point in time.<br />
- Add another level of difficulty. Lets call it easy. This would be tuned to less than ideal groups or those with less than stellar equipment. It would of course give less rewards. This one I think they could do. It is not the way I like things to be, but it would solve the major complaint I have in that it looks like me and my friends would have to hard a time.<br />
<br />
I don't want to trivialise(sp?) the adventures. But I do think that any group should expect at least a 50/50 chance of success.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Someone please clarify for me please:<br />
If you &quot;fail&quot; the event because of the timer, you still get:<br />
a) xp from the mobs you killed<br />
b) all the loot including drops from Named Mobs<br />
<br />
pretty much the same stuff you get anywhere else in Norrath.  <br />
<br />
I personally think it's a *good* thing that people dont win every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You do keep any exp/loot you've gotten if you fail. I have never gotten partial points on a failure before and last time I did fail the target mob immediately despawned making it impossible to finish even late. Not sure if they changed this recently. <br />
<br />
As far as res'n people in, you really don't lose much time at all by resing in a melee class, you still have to rebuff them if they run in and they don't have to worry about mana. These are the same ones that have the furthest to go if they die without a res available. I still say its not a big deal for casters that can bind right outside and are better of not getting rez'd, but for melee getting the res makes it a lot faster to get back up and running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was on beta this weekend and I have to agree that the timer was one of my biggest problems. I was puller in all the groups I did (as a monk and pally) and in several different levels. I chain pulled furiously and won 1 of the 3 adventures. There was no time to explore the things I saw or wanted to explore if I wanted a chance to win.<br />
<br />
While I agree it shouldn't be easy to win, winning shouldn't be primarily based on speed of kills to the extent that you can do nothing but chain pull for 90 min. I also would have liked to have seen different time limits. Maybe 60, 90 and 120 minute adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Someone please clarify for me please:<br />

<br />

<br />
a) True. Although xp is not as good as in other places<br />
b) True.<br />
<br />
Your conclusion is correct.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
Give me a group of lvl 65:s from a raiding guild (say a guild that is close to elemental). Let group be Healer, CC and 4 DPS. They will succeed 95% of the tries on normal. So there really is no challenge.<br />
<br />
Give me a group of 5 from a cassual guild. Say a Shaman, Cleric a monk a warrior and a druid. They will strugle and may only pass if they are lucky. So for this group there is no incentive. They should go to Droga if they want a crawl or to BoT if they want xp. Both would be a lot better than LDoN.<br />
<br />
Now, I agree that I'm comparing aples and oranges in a way. But I do think that it is the reward that should be adjusted to the composition of the group. Not the chance of succeeding.<br />
<br />
If my examples above are correct we again get an expansion that only caters to the people in raiding guilds. Be it on a different level than PoP.<br />
<br />
/Merry, who really should stop posting about this since I'm basing it on my to limited experience in beta so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Cant say for sure.  I think I would need to actually do one or two before I can form an opinion.</div></div><hr />

Adding an &quot;easy&quot; option would probably be the easiest (:)) fix for them to impliment. If they want the expansion to draw in new players, you shouldn't have to have uber gear to finish them - I wonder if they've tried level appropriate content with a &quot;/testbuff&quot; group of 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I voted for a choice.<br />
<br />
Though I understand Sony's point of view, I also remember Scott Hartsman basically bragging that this system is so great that it's easy to add more capacity if the need arises. If that's the case, let folks decide whether they want a timed adventure or a proceed at your own pace one. I don't have a problem with folks who want to take it slow.....as long as it doesn't negatively impact folks who don't mind &quot;getting a move on&quot; (so to speak).<br />
<br />
<br />
And IMO it should go without saying that the point rewards should be much higher for timed adventures than they are for freestyle ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Myst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">One item that seems to keep coming up is the fact that none casters have to run from 3 or more zones away if they are not rezzed.  It seems a pretty simple fix to make the grave yard a small city type area (like the gypsy camp in NK) and let the casters in the group bind them there.  <br />
I havn't experienced LDoN yet so I can't really comment on the timers but If you have all day to complete one then why should you get a reward?  Someone eariler posted that the time limit was 60minutes, obviously they are tweeking them since they are now 90.<br />
I am also going to assume that like everything else SOE will be watching the encounters and if more than 50% of the available instances are sitting idle 2 weeks after release they will probably fix them...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Give me a group of lvl 65:s from a raiding guild (say a guild that is close to elemental). Let group be Healer, CC and 4 DPS. They will succeed 95% of the tries on normal. So there really is no challenge.<br />
<br />
True. No need to designate it as &quot;raiding guild&quot;, either. Simply being level 65 and not dressed in maged summoned armor gives you a decent chance.<br />
<br />
Give me a group of 5 from a cassual guild. Say a Shaman, Cleric a monk a warrior and a druid. They will strugle and may only pass if they are lucky. So for this group there is no incentive. They should go to Droga if they want a crawl or to BoT if they want xp. Both would be a lot better than LDoN.<br />
<br />
Not true. The only real thing luck has to do with it is hoping you don't take a BIG wrong turn. I've only seen this happen in one of the Rujarkan dungeons, and only once. It's also quite possible to gimp an assassination encounter - Kill until the encounter mob spawns, invis, run to him, and gank. If a Ranger / Cleric / SK / Bard can win these things with the bard being the cleric's bot and the SK's main being a level 35 Wizard, your group can, too. Just pick &quot;normal&quot; difficulty.<br />
<br />
If my examples above are correct we again get an expansion that only caters to the people in raiding guilds. Be it on a different level than PoP.<br />
<br />
No, but it's likely to favor higher-level players. Dawnshroud will still remain the &quot;fast track&quot; for 25 - 55...</div></div><hr />

Or shall we casual players start pressurising for it to be extended to the raids the ubers do: 90 minutes or that mob despawns?  Kill it first time, or you've failied?<br />

The LDoN timer is equivalent to getting one shot only at killing a raid mob.  The ubers would complain about that.  I smell some hypocrisy here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">One item that seems to keep coming up is the fact that none casters have to run from 3 or more zones away if they are not rezzed.

Melee can bind at each Wayfarer camp. There are soulbinders there (though they were non-functional last time I tried them) so the run really isn't that bad (particularly for the Miragul's adventures).</div></div><hr />

Best opinion yet, but the problem with this is the powergamers will get all the nice stuff real fast and SoE will nerf the points just in time to screw the casual gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I can only assume that The Hyena Shaman and I played in different betas. I doubt that the group of 5 that I picked as the lower end guild group in my example would be able to put out 225 DPS every single second of a 90 minute adventure if they came from my guild. That is not 225 DPS on every mob. It has to be done so that as soon as one mob is dead you start doing 225 DPS on next mob. Either that or if there is a puase you have to do more. That is what it takes to kill 80 15k hp mobs in 90 minutes. 80 mobs is what we needed to kill to get the items in one of the adventures we did. <br />
<br />
When we tried a group of 4 (Shaman, Cleric, Warrior and Enchanter) we had collected 50% of the items when time ran out. We did not use charm which would have helped a lot. We were not at 100% efficiency. We just wanted to see if the adventures scaled or not.<br />
<br />
Levels does not make this easy. Equipment and/or the 'correct' classes does.<br />

I was thinking the same thing when I read his line about any 65 in mage summoned gear making it through these. <br />
<br />
If that was the case then anyone should have been able to win with a group of the newb 65's that were running around everywhere. <br />
<br />
Frankly in my expereince getting one person in your group that didn't know what they were doing almost completley ruined your chances.<br />
<br />
Best opinion yet, but the problem with this is the powergamers will get all the nice stuff real fast and SoE will nerf the points just in time to screw the casual gamers.  <br />
<br />
Theres nothing to stop EP equiped people from blitzing through 3-4 normal adventures now in the time it takes to do one hard aventure and racking up the points ultra fast anyways. Its going to take your average 65 near the entire time to finish the normal dungeons if they finish at all. A group will all high end gear can probably finish most of the normal ones in under half an hour which I see the ones that just want to earn points doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't complain if we failed because of a timer... it just means we need to get better at the raid.<br />
<br />
I expect to fail on the raid level dungeons. It takes some tries to learn and beat the challenges.<br />
<br />
I'd be very disappointed if we walked in the first try and won it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">A time limit is necessary for technical reasons (instancing engine) and also for gameplay reasons.  The objective is to appeal to the casual gamer who doesn't have 6-7 hours to spend.  A 90-minute timed quest is about right for me and a lot of other people who play 2-3 hours a night.  Get your group together, go do it.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with regular EQ is that if you set out to do something it's open-ended.  Got shards for half your group in Fungus Grove?  Let's stay around until we get all of them.  3 hours later, you're still waiting and trying to decide whether to call in sick to work tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Having a timer means that game is OVER after 90 minutes.  You might have failed, you might have succeeded, but it's OVER.  Hardcore gamers can try again right away, casual gamers will go to bed and try again tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Time limits are such an integral part of the LDON concept...  You go in, you accomplish, you leave.  Its not a hang out and farm a camp type of experience.<br />
<br />
In some dungeons you feel the time pressure... you are racing the clock.  In others you have more than enough time to explore along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't this a statement of the obvious?<br />
<br />
But why does it have to be?<br />
<br />
I think a lot of us wanted the ability to do an old fashioned dungeon crawl, but with instancing so we could do away with camp checks, other peoples trains etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Now is it 'impossible' to accomodate that in LDoN.<br />
<br />
You may want a race against time: you can have it.  Why can't those that don't want it also have their wishes catered for?<br />
<br />
Its not a hang out and farm a camp type of experience.<br />
<br />
I too don't want to sit in a single box, waiting for a respawn.  I want to work my way through a dungeon from start to end.  That does not necessitate a timer: I can't even imagine why you seem to think it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Having a timer means that game is OVER after 90 minutes.

<br />
Hardcore gamers with their uber gear obtained from zerg raids will have succeeded with ease.  Casual gamers with their third-rate gear will have failed.  And the same the next day too.  The timers magnify the difference between well equipped and badly equipped players.  Only those people who take their gear for granted could fail to see that.<br />
<br />
From Kunark through to PoP expansions became increasingly guild orientated.  Casual gamers got left out in the cold by PoP.  Now SOE have given us an expansion that they claimed was targeted at casual gamers.  Well they missed by a mile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">As I said above...<br />
<br />
YOU DO NOT FEEL THE TIME PRESSURE IN ALL OF THE ADVENTURES.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you can complete several of them in half the allotted time with a poorly equiped team that doesnt know their classes well.  I say this from personal experience.<br />
<br />
As for why time limits at all: Technical reasons.  Each instance takes up resources on the server.  Sure they say they put in a big enough server to cover all they expect to be active at once.. but if instances could last forever then that number would have to be higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">3 hours is still a timer.  Why not say you want the timer increased to 3 hours instead?<br />
<br />
Uh ok.  How about increasing the time limit to one which has no impact on the chances of a party successfully completing a mission, say 3 hours?<br />
<br />
I was trying to construct a poll: I think 'remove the timer' and the above are effectively the same, or do we have to quibble over semantics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Luggal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I thought one of the original marketing tags for LDoN mentioned something about &quot;dungeon crawls&quot;. Having to play beat the clock is the exact opposite of a crawl. I haven't played the beta, but I voted choice - I think a time limit should apply only to certain adventures, while others should cater to those that wish to explore.<br />
<br />
At least it's new content. They've added AA's to keep us interested. Now they've added the ability to Augment our gear. Maybe next they'll add the ability to use earned points to augment the client so that it it will run decent without having to sacrifice detail. Wonder what's next...</div></div><hr />
