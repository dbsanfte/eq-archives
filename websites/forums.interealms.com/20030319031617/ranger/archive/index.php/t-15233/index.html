<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Grettings all!  Like many players, whenever I am medding up or between things, I practice my skills.  One of the skills I practice is forage.  The thing is - forage seems to increase *really* slowly for me, and the re-use time seems insanly long.<br />
<br />
I'm level 29, and I've been practicing forage for over 20 levels now, but it's still only 40 or so.  As a skill forage hasn't actually increased for me for last two levels (many hours of game time).  Hell, I haven't actually foraged anything succesfully for days now.<br />
<br />
It's fair driving me to distraction! :eek: <br />
<br />
Can anybody give me advice about how I could improve things.  I don't mind if it means I have to take a break from normal questing to specifically work on foraging.  I haven't tried that yet because of the aformentioned re-use time (seems like 3 or 4 minutes).<br />
<br />
In a word: help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SolipsisSaVatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bring up your options by pressing alt+o<br />
<br />
set your keyboard so that an unused key will activate your 3rd and 4th hotkeys.<br />
<br />
put kick in your 3rd hotkey and forage in your 4th.<br />
<br />
Now everytime you kick in a fight you should attempt a forage.<br />
It will say &quot; you cannot forage during battle&quot; but I raised my skill from a measly 20 to over 100 in a couple weeks by doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Legran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At work now so I can't give specific instructions (they are here somewhere else on the board),<br />
but your sense heading skill and foraging skill can stay maxed out by mapping your top two hot bank buttons to the keys you use to turn left and right.<br />
In the options screen I map my left turn key to the #1 hot bank slot and my right turn key to the #2 hot bank slot.<br />
Place sense heading in #1 slot and Forage in #2 slot.<br />
Every time you try to turn you will forage and sense heading.<br />
<br />
On a related note -- this CAN get you killed.  <br />
I was hanging out in PoI lfg and foraging crap when .... &quot;TRAIN big one coming zone out now&quot;.  Of course I ignored it because I wanted to see just how big it was.  **** its like 20 robots ... I am so out of here.  Of course forage refreshed at just the wrong time and a phosphorescent goo wound up on my cursor.  I didn't notice and I click on the exit pyramid at about the same time the robots notice me.   &quot;would you like to drop your phosphorescent goo on the ground?&quot;  ... NOOOO I'd like to zone out of this #$@%#$ing death trap!!!!  Too late your dead.  Hooray for all the clicky stick clerics that hang out around the PoI exit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Goodness - I sure hope nothing like that ever happens to me!<br />
<br />
I didn't realise you could do that button mapping thing - I will definitely set that up when I am next on.  Many thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Binding forage to kick used to work, but now forage isn't even activated while you're attacking.  So if you hit the button, you just get a message saying &quot;you can't forage while attacking&quot; and the button isn't depressed.  So, I doubt that little trick works anymore, unfortunately.  Forage isn't really something to worry about.  Just keep hitting it whenever it pops up, and eventually it'll go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Link it (and sense heading) to your movement keys and it will max in no time. To prevent the above scenario,when you are fighting just move your forage to a different location and keep that hotkey spot empty until you are ready to keep foraging.<br />
<br />
It works, it can be inconvenient but you will learn to get around that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope...sure doesn't. You can't skill up while sitting/medding anymore, either.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which patch this little adjustment came with, but it's fairly recent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another tip: if you get into the situation where you have something on the cursor, there is another command most people forget about: Use Screen Center. This activates whatever you are facing head-on.<br />
<br />
So in that previous example when you click on the pyramid and get a drop dialog, just hit the key for use screen center and you will activate it. I have it mapped the space bar and use it a lot (e.g. when I successfully forage when leaving a store, click on the door, hit space bar to open, and then clear dialog while I am moving on).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kundow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Legran <br />

Place sense heading in #1 slot and Forage in #2 slot.<br />
Every time you try to turn you will forage and sense heading.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did this a while back, except for slot #8 and #9, and I hit 200 Forage the other day.  Finally, at level 47.<br />
<br />
Still can't get Oak Bark though. :(<br />
<br />
As for the death thing Legran mentioned, I just have quick drop on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, as a follow up, I mapped Forage and Sense Heading to my left/right cursor keys.  Works a treat.  In fact, although forage isn't exactly shooting up, I am foraging enough that I don't need to buy food anymore.  Very cool indeed!</div></div><hr />
