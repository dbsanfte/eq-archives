<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nihnyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally got back into EQ. Now i gotta find some ppl to group with. Damn everytime i go to zone from Ocean of Tears to FP it dissconnects me. it is the most annoying thing. i wanna be in this guild. so this guild IS in the Veeshan server right?<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>razma taz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Veeshan?  Nope.. we are on Druzzil Ro, come look us up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question:  Why do you want to join us if you have to question what server we're on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like how Coatie thinks:)<br />
<br />
Now if I can only get that rediculous Xunil guy to die and will his half of the house to me, I might have something working here... :D<br />
<br />
By the way, I think I'm going to send Furor a tell asking if I can loot the next Tormax kill, since I have a newbie on the Bristlebane server who could use some phat stuff :D<br />
<br />
(pardon me - goofy mood tonight :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nihnyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went on a search engine looking for Veeshan server guilds and this one came up. AHHHH!! well then i'll go try to join the Honorable knights. Damn.  Or was a EQ top 100? i think it was that, it said something like &quot; a wonderful Veeshan server guild&quot; . Hell i dunno. This guild looked so good arrgghh. <br />
Ok if the minimum req for EQ have 32 megs of RAM (which is all i have), then why do i always dissconnect while zoning between ocean of tears and FP??. i'm stuck on that damn ship and always find myself coming up to Brother Island. Is it true that theres a 50+ npc on there that attacks? thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With very little ram and a slow disk drive, you wil ltake so long to zone that sometimes you will miss a zopne or disconnect all together. Upgrade to 128mb minimum. Memory is cheap.<br />
<br />
Also as in any guild, if you want to join them group with them for a while. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Perhaps before making a decision on the guild you would like to join, check out their website, read their charter (if the have one), any posted policies, and find out the recruiting process.<br />
We take our family here seriously and do not have what many consider &quot;open recruiting&quot; where we blindly invite people along with no reference.<br />
Our recruiting process is long and involved but for those that are here, we all believe it was worth the wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">...however, if Burned Woods is in OOT this week you can hop on that zone and hope it goes near Freeport next week...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Didnt the zone connection map list Burned woods next to Iceclad ocean this week?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thats NEXT week Ransure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ransure, you KNOW that this week is OOT-Temple of Veeshan week!  And Burned Woods connects to Kaladim this week.  I mean, come on!<br />
<br />
Amarin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL JLove :) I don't think Xunie would agree to that ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think it's nice that you would like to join us, and if your really serious, read about us and know what server we lie on before you post intent to join us ;).  However, if you just did a search for Veeshan guilds and want to join the first &quot;good looking guild&quot; out there... Might wanna rethink that (not saying we're not good -- we're the best and everyone knows that :D)...  Do you know what this guild is about, do you know what we stand for, have you EVER encountered a Keeper in game and grouped/said hi/talked to them?<br />
<br />
I do NOT mean to sound cold (all you KoE know me, and know i'm not a cold person).. but joining a guild is more than doing a search on a search engine.  It's about building friendships that last, and trusting one another to fight next to them.<br />
<br />
As with any new face that pops up, I welcome you to our site and forum, and encourage you to research a bit more about us, group with us, and prove to us that you are Keeper material.  I suppose it would be a bit more encouraging if you knew for sure what server we are on ;)<br />
<br />
Oh btw, you're ALL wrong.  Sleepers Tomb is the next zone out of OOT and Freeport now will be on Odus.  Verant said that whoever is stuck in OOT and can't zone into &quot;freeport&quot; is actually going to be zoned into Sleeper's Tomb and have their character deleted immedately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BW in Iceclad?  That ought to put out the fires pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I zoned into OOT from Halas last night, but Lord British killed me due to a little scuffle I had with Iolo, so be careful if you have bad Avatar faction there.  Now I'm stuck naked in Camelot Hills at the Omni fort.  Man am I gonna have a hard time getting back to my body.<br />
<br />
Oh well time to go for class.  See you all tomorrow ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I did this search on Veeshan guilds and found KoE, but then I lost it.  Actually I think I was on Veeshan server, but I'm not sure cause I can't find that anymore either...um..Burning Woods you say?  Is that a MOB near Freeport?<br />
<br />
Oh well, nm ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nihnyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did read the charter and read the recruiting policie in the closed forum... i was just SAYING that i wanted to join. the reason i was trying to make sure about the server thing was so that i could group with KoE members. i even printed off the roster so i could try to give tells to members and find out where they were and things like that. but now that i know its not on Veeshan i'll be on my way. well maybe i'll chat in MB since i've already started doing that ;). Thanks for not flaming me...happens a lot on MB sometimes. and btw whats a mob? i'm a noob, well i've had eq for almost a year now but haven't played it all the time, if u've read my story that i posted on this- its called please readQ or something like that. anyways thanks again for being nice to me. i bid u all good luck in future adventuring and guild battles if you do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am glad you are interested in Keepers of the Elements.    We are a very open guild to people but this does not mean we allow anyone to join.  Our recruiting process is long at best.  Personally, it took me two months to be accepted into the guild even having some Very close friends as members.  <br />
<br />
Before you look into any guild in Everquest, I urge you to play the game more.  KoE is a guild primarily of long term players, tho this does not mean we will not recruit those of low level it will hinder your hope of joining.  I honestly cannot think of a member offhand in which their primary character is not at least level 50 or close.  Finding members to group with to vouch for playing skills would be extremely difficult as the low end game isn't a good guideline.  Finding members in general to group with to show who you are would not be easy either as most of us are high level.  We do not have a level limit for recruitment, but in all honesty those of low level would probably not fit into this family.  <br />
<br />
Play the game, get to know people in all guilds before you decide which is right for you.  KoE is a wonderful guild, but it's not for everyone...nor do I feel that you really know who we are just by visiting our website.  Do not let this discourage you from KoE, just learn more about the guild before you make such a decision about us.  Never know...might get to know ppl like Coatie and get scared off :eek:  hehe jk :D</div></div><hr />
