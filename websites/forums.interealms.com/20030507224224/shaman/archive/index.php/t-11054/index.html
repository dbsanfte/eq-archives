<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have a guildie that is willing to donate to me some arctic wyvren stuff.  He has the supplies and just needs to know what to make.  I'm having trouble knowing what to ask for though.<br />
<br />
I think the bracer is a slam dunk over my Jarsath Scale Wrist Guards.  The net upgrade is -1AC +6STR +5STA +1WIS +3CR.  For the wis and sta I like the arctic wyvren.<br />
<br />
Thinking about the cap over my Jaundiced Bone Helm which would net -9AC +10WIS.  I know the general rule is AC&gt;Wis, but my Wis is really in the crapper so this is tempting.  Besides, I really don't solo that much and AC is just for when I draw aggro and have to wait a bit for the warrior to taunt it back.  Is this an occasion to break the rules?  I could keep the JBH in a bag for when I need to &quot;tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sleeves would net -10AC +8STR +6STA.  Its the STA that is attractive here since I haven't maxed STA yet.  I know that HP&gt;AC, so this would imply to me that STA&gt;AC... but I'm not sure about this particular instance.<br />
<br />
And the weird one... the collar.  I would be netting -1AC +8STA -10mana -2FR/MR/CR -10DR/PR.  My idea here is that the 8STA would outweigh the 1ac/10mana until I max out STA.  I would keep the current one for resist gear.<br />
<br />
All the rest seems to be worse than what I have.   As you can see from magelo I only have 266pp to my name so these hand outs are as good as I can get right now - LOL!  I was thinking about selling Di'Zok Begirding and getting a Velium Fire Wedding Ring - but that is off topic.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I have a lot of similar gear, and i wear the bracer (that's a no brainer with your gear and finances!) and the collar too. Personally, i prefer the AW collar to yours, but it's just a matter of preference really - there is little between them.<br />
<br />
And do something about that awful ring, and your earrings too :)<br />
