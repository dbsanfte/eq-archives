<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do you like it there?  A few good friends of mine recently started there, so I was thinking about maybe popping over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I moved there awhile back and I enjoy it alot. The low population is what I like the most. I haven't hit 50 yet with my new shaman and haven't joined a guild yet, so I can't comment on the high level guild situations (one of my reasons for leaving Rodcet).<br />
It was really fun starting completely over without really being able to twink (my friends started new with me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aojo Gnab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been on FV for what seems like forever.  I have a tendency to reroll a lot so I have never gotten a character over 40 and have never been in a guild so take this information for what you will.<br />
<br />
I love it here!  Most of the people I know who have other characters on other servers (since only one character on FV) can't play on those other servers anymore.  Too much spam in the air and I agree.<br />
<br />
It does have a low population.  I was in WW the other night hunting those big orange gorrila things, and was the only one in the zone for at least an hour and half.  I do play late at night though.<br />
<br />
Every problem that you experience on your home server is here, too.  This is not some island paradise, but with the lower numbers there are less of them.<br />
<br />
It does say roleplay preffered, but in my experience most people don't, but the ones that do take it seriously.  There is a large backlash against &quot;Roleplay Nazis&quot; currently going on, and even the roleplayers think they may have gone to far. <br />
<br />
I think the low population is the big thing.  If you wanted to completely avoid people it would be very easy.  Avoid Crushbone, PC, Highhold Keep,  and you could never see another soul.  Because of this, I think soloing classes do very well.  But stick to high traffic areas and you can group as well.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... seemed like a simple enough question Mojo, sorry I took it too far.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I liked the grouping restrictions from a &quot;makes sense and adds flavour&quot; perspective but I absolutely hated the language system.<br />
I didn't know anyone else on the server, was a DE Shadowknight and the combination of low server population/empty zones + not being able to talk to anyone else but Dark Elves (and dark races as a whole seemed scarce) spoilt it for me.<br />
I hate the average Joe Ooc but even I need some mmo in my mmorpg.<br />
<br />
That was a good 6-8 months ago though so a lot could (and probably has) changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i love FV..only think that you have to watch out for sometimes is the Trivial Loot code..it can get interesting sometimes..but there are ways around it. Not sure what backlash for RPing someone else mentioned is as i have seen nothing like that really. You learn what guilds RP always and simple speak to them in that way and you are fine. Yes we have the same problems but the server has a MUCH better family feel for me with my Guild as you know who everyone is with the one character per account thing..i say give it a go and see how you like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maisri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been playing there since the day the server went live.  Until a few days ago, I was a warrior, now I'm a shaman.<br />
<br />
The server's great, in my opinion, for the roleplay, for the low population, for the sheer variety of people there.<br />
<br />
In the lower levels, I've noticed a few morons, but really, the staple folks on the server are great, and mature(for the most part*grin*).<br />
<br />
The mix of RPer, casual gamer, and powergamer, is pretty equal, and we all manage to coexist pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd recommend it to anyone, really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I needed a break from raiding I went and made a baby cleric on FV.  I have been taking her all the places Ariene never got to go as she grew up (Unrest, Mistmoore, Guk, the oldworld dungeons).  I absolutely love it on FV.  Thera is 34 now and although I could never totally give up all the friends I have on Bristlebane to move full time I play on FV 1-3x per week.  <br />
<br />
There are no longer any grouping restrictions/penalties although a lot of people choose not to group with people of the oposite alignment.  If you play peek hours there will be people around but never crowded.  If you play odd hours you will find zones totally empty.  There are only two guilds that are doing high end content (that I know of) and although they clash sometimes it seems a LOT more amiable than what I'm used to on BB.  <br />
<br />
I would recommend trying it.  At worst you waste a few hours/days on a new character and then quit playing him.  Alternately you made find it is the perfect server for you and you fit right in.  Seems worth trying.  :)<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the server board if you want to get a bit of a feel for it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Been on FV since the day it started.  I really enjoy it.  As said there is no longer the grouping restrications or the XP penalities.  There is still languges but it takes about 20 min and somone who speaks human and you are set.  Also is TLC which is kinda interesting.  isnt horrible, you learn to live with it and not really bother you.<br />
<br />
I am also an officer in one of the top guilds on FV, we are getting very close to the elementals.  There are very limited downsides, i think the only one i can think of is one char per account, but that is personal opinion.<br />
<br />
Feel free to send me an interserver tell if wanna :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FV has changed alot since it first started.  It has much of a blue server ruleset no with a couple distinctions:<br />
<br />
TLC- Despite what people may think this rule is terriffic.  No more finally getting a group of 20's together to go to Runnyeye just to find a level 55 tearing apart the third level.  It basically serves as a &quot;no farming&quot; rule.  It does pose some difficulties with quests like Stormfeather but you can use the /raid feature to bypass TLC.<br />
<br />
Virtually No &quot;No Drop&quot; items-  I ventured back to Drinal the other day and was completely frustrated having to destroy all those damn &quot;no drop&quot; quest pieces.  Ever get a group together to go to the Howling Stones just to find out the cleric doesn't have a key?  No problem on FV.  You can pass down your Hate BP to others, sell it on the market, or keep it in the bank for a rainy day.  Primal is even tradeable.<br />
<br />
No &quot;Common&quot; Language-  It is a real pain at first.  The three standard languages that everyone learns is human, elvish, and tier dal.  My guildmates keep trying to teach me that filthy &quot;halfling&quot; dialect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bind Rule&quot; Restrictions -  This is a major annoyance for me and I have no idea how this lends to roleplay.  Casters are limited to meele bind restrictions.  It sucks not being able to bind a cleric in an opportune location.<br />
<br />
&quot;One Character Rule&quot;-  Thanks Sony for making me buy another account.<br />
Every shaman needs a twinked monk.<br />
<br />
Overall I think FV displays some of the most mature people of any server I've played on.  Yes there are always going to be idiots but I must say the &quot;dood&quot; population on FV is among the lowest. <br />
<br />
Roleplaying is hit or miss. I didn't chose this server for roleplaying reasons.  I ended up choosing this server because a group of us from a popular board wanted to start characters from scratch on a new server and raid once a week.  Well a core of us started playing on FV more than our regular servers.  I'm fulltime now though once in a while I miss my friends back on Drinal. /em waves to Wolfish, Shminka, Nivis, and all the others.<br />

Twinked ranger work too :)<br />

I'm like Thraall (but sexier) in the other top guild of the server send me a tell if you want information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well i have a barb warrior on there named Groovin if anyone wants to say hi ;).  so far the language thing is horrible...i can't talk to hardly anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FV is cool.<br />
I went there as I was fed up with the neverending twinking and never RPing (not that I only want RP, but I like to see something else than &quot;Ph4t Lewts&quot; :)) and I made a shaman on FV (after testing out a necro up to 15, didn't like the NON IN TEH FACE realation necro tend to have with NPC they hunt).<br />
This place is cool. TLC is cool (though there are several ways to bypass it, high level tend to not farm places where you hunt in your 20's...<br />
<br />
Message pour Griffe : j'ai eu ma tear ce week-end :) par contre le test of Patience a merdé (cf. message par rapport à Ooglyn sur ce mesasge board). Faut que je résolve ça pis on n'aura plus que The Hole et les 2 derniers fight à faire :). J'arrive sexy shamy, bientôt tu seras plus la seule shamy epiquifiée franco :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iceborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thraall, Griffe, stop lying to the blue server folks. FV is a terrible server. The people are unfriendly, the game play sucks, it is unstable too. The server crashes every 5 to 10 minutes. Everything you dislike in EQ is running rampant on FV. Save yourself, save a friend, stay away from FV. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FV has its positives and negatives like any server but I think the positives far outweigh the negatives. You will have to deal with a lower server population but that means that if you decide to join a raiding guild, the mid-high end is wide open. There are about 5-6 Tier 2-3 guilds out there right now and 2 VT capable guilds who usually are not interested in farming lower tier mobs. The server has a relatively more mature player-base than other servers I have played on and the community is generally welcoming as long as newcomers who wish to raid don&#8217;t spit on those who wish to roleplay and vice versa. I feel that there is actually a good proportion of Shamans on FV &#8211; meaning that groups can usually find a shaman if they are looking for one. You may have a hard time finding some high-end gear and spells &#8211; the lower population plays into this. I made the switch to FV from Torv after I took a long break and came back to find my old guild disbanded and haven&#8217;t looked back.<br />
