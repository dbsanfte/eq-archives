<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Legan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any place to fear kite at 61? PoJ is pretty much all light blue, in PoD I get too many adds, PoN too many resists.  I have PoS/PoV, BoT flag, and epics.  I've been trying to bow kite frogs in PoS but it takes too damn long.<br />
<br />
 Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go back to POJ down by the jail (to left). Pestilence rats are still sometimes blue although many are LB. Track down the hard blues. Least with the ZEM in poj the AA exp still flows along at a decent rate even with a mix of Light Blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Diseased rats, at the PoD zone in, just to the left of the zone &quot;platform&quot; and graveyard.  You can pull back to the corner, pathing will keep them pretty much in reach, and fear kite easily right there.  Spawn rate on the rats will keep you pretty much in constant action without too much downtime; with KEI you can toss in some nukes and keep things moving quite steadily.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you will get a low level group to the left of the zone as it widens out; talking to them and asking that they let the diseased rats pass to you and you will assist on anything they get in too deep fighting resolves that quite well.<br />
<br />
Avoid the rare Feeble rat and the swamp rats; Feeble rats do not root or snare and both of those resist fear quite enough to make them not worth the attempt.  Diseased are dark blue at 60, about 2% aa per kill, and slow enough to outrun if things get too difficult.  You are also very close to the zone if you are LFG, and able to meet up in PoT in a minute or less after finishing your current victim.</div></div><hr />
