<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are phase Spiders Duo-able with a 55 ranger and a 44 Druid.. How bout a 55 Ranger 55 Wizard or even a 55 ranger 55 wizard and a 44 druid?<br />
<br />
My guild went there lastnight and I had a lot of fun... IT was our 1st time there and only ONE person had been there once before. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt mind goin there to get a PSC or two and was wondering if Just a few  of us can do the Zone in Spiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Phase spiders are level 49, 50, and 51. Given their hitpoints, the fact that they can &quot;phase&quot; teleport you to random locations thus bringing possible adds, and the damage they deal during combat, I don't personally believe that a 44 druid and a 55 ranger could do these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pisaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So... ya wanna fight phase spiders... hehe... worried about phasing... hehe, fight right in front of the portal.. wizard friend that solos there taught me this... if you are right in front of the portal, they phase you at the portal and ya only move about 2 feet. But you have to be right there, safer that way and zone is rigth there if you fail...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roydal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmmm 55 Ranger and Wizzy could do it with some mad kiting I guess.  44 druid won't be able to keep you up tanking though.<br />
<br />
I've killed my fair share just bow kiting, its quite effective.  If you have access to a Tolans Bracer, give it a whirl ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jerard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can you leave this zone the same way you enter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aegien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jackpanel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snare the spider and flame lick kite it in circles while the druid and/or wizzie nuke/DoT it to death.  It may take a while with just the 44 druid though, so getting another melee class would really help.</div></div><hr />
