<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kedawen</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hunting in WW tonight and took a shot I didnt really expect to work, and got the too far above/below message, but the arrow went on and hit the target. <br />
<br />
To further test, I fought a rhino to a standstill right outside the tunnel to SG, then went on top of the tunnel, and was able to hit it, getting the above/below message every time.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see this, or is it a &quot;feature&quot; in WW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a bug. If you bring down exp mobs with it, you are exploiting. Yes they know about and yes its being worked on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kedawen</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh, figured it was, I wasn't using it, just noticed the altitude effect.<br />
<br />
I see the other bug report now too, 4 minutes after I posted mine  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiluvas</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few archery bugs, while hunting today it seemed like range wasn't being taken into calculations, I was able to hit stuff with arrows across the zone.  I would shoot them, yet I'd be so far away that they'd &quot;forget&quot; about me and run away.  Was... interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buadyen</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that line-of-sight isn't working. I was able to turn my back on a mob and still fire (and watched my arrows try to curve around to hit the mob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevastian01</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like they are working on some new line of sight code. WHEEE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw this last night. Kinda made me wish I brought my Underfoot Bow with me to the raid when I was standing on a ledge that was a bit too high. I would have loved to see how the hits would have come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I confess, I gave into the temptation to try this bug out.<br />
<br />
The results:  11k damage to Ikatiar the Venom in SEVENTEEN SECONDS, and one summoned and very dead warder.<br />
<br />
I'm too much of a goody two-shoes to do it again, but haha, sure was fun.  Plus I take this as an indication VI is trying to fix some of the crappy problems with archery and it would be pretty ungrateful to sploit them for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gersh Asha'man</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah had to give in to temptation, hell I logged Gersh in after months of inactivity just to see this for myself. Oh BTW using your mini gun and trueshot a ranger can kill a WW dragon solo. <br />
<br />
Shame it can't be done yet without a bug feh.<br />
<br />
Was fun while it lasted.<br />
<br />
P.S. Not ganna comment on how many rangers I saw setting up shop on large hills in ME, WW, CS, etc and letting loose a barrage of arrows at anything that moved. For such a insanely overbalancing bug Verant has been quite slow to react.</div></div><hr />
