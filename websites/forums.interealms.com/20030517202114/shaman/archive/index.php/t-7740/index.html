<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!  It's been said over and over again how good the xp is hunting Nathyan (sp) guards.  I've already trashed my faction with the normal Katta guards and I'm curious which would give better xp, and would it be possible to hunt the Nathyan guards with my faction.  I do have JBB, but no fungi or epic.<br />

<br />
I recommend doing the short guards in the tunnels near Twilight Sea zone in.  At 55 getting singles will be a good thing, and these guards aggron on a line of sight.  The layout there makes it easy to get them one at a time, if you keep an eye on the timer for the two roamers to repop.<br />
<br />
At 55 you can still root and rot two (doggie will probably die), but get a third and i suggest a run to the zone, which is not far.<br />
<br />
zone in from twilight, invis up, and go right.  when you get to the end of the walkway, about to enter the tunnel, make your camp.<br />
<br />
running in you will probably see the human roamer, who starts at zone in and roams to your camp.<br />
<br />
inside the tummel are two guards to your right - ease up so you can see only one, and pull with slow.  The other roamer pops right there, also, so it helps if he is there to be pulled first.<br />
<br />
past those two static guards there is a room to your left with Berk Thurstone.  same as the guards.<br />
<br />
past Berk the tunnel turns left - you can see a pool in the tunnel.  Tack and Rowl Shieldstone are on either side of the pool  If you have the first few spawns under control, you can pull these guys the same way as the first pair, by getting one in line of sight.<br />
<br />
My apologies to whoever first posted this information - I have hunted this spot from 56 through 59 with great exp and nice plat, following the guide posted on this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your already bad faction with katta guards would make it hard. <br />
At nathyns 'house' spawn 2 guards at the door.. and a dire wolf either side of them..<br />
<br />
Outside in the 'hallway' spawn 3 katta faction guards and a small walk off in either direction is another guard (heading down bank ramp) and 2 in the pull area (where most pull the nathyn guards/wolf to kill) is another 2 guards at the shops door.<br />
<br />
Unless you wanted to raise faction back up killing the vampyres., in Tenb mountains.. slowly at that.. you probably can't do the naythan guards without major hassles (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can always Invis and run up to Nathyn's house.<br />
<br />
the dire wolf guards see thru invis but their agro radius is very small so you can run by.  I set up shop behind Nathyn's house and to the side.  You can pull the two guards and two wolf guards and even pull from inside waiting for repops.<br />
<br />
Alpha dog can pretty much solo a dire wolf and the guards hp totals are laughable.<br />
<br />
good steady exp and no worrying about roamers at all.<br />
<br />
