Try getting a partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have only killed one GW and that was in a group of 4. they are quite easy if you have a decent partner.<br />
<br />
if you actually want to solo them, i assume that employing the strats of the monk that soloed naggy would work. He used stinging wart potions and other droppable heal items to keep himself alive.  Use free damage then to whittle him down. GW have about 30k hps.<br />
<br />
Too much investment for the slim chance that you get will actually get a decent spell to drop IMHO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't try it without being lvl 60 with torpor, but if you want to try it, the strategy used is..<br />
<br />
get pet up, and fully buff him and you, max hp/ac on both of ya. Find your guardian wurm, and pull with malosini. pray it sticks first cast. drag it back to your pull spot, being careful not to agro anything. use immobilize to stop him in his tracks. slow him and cripple(optional). cast paralyzing earth on em to make that root last longer, and get fm again. cast epic on him(if ya have it), then stack ebolt/plague/bane on him and sic pet. stoc the pet, and keep him stoic'd. if root wears off, reapply it so that it's your pet tankin, and not you. keep your pet healed and reapply dots as needed.<br />
<br />
Chances are you'll run oom very quick healing, so be sure to keep some major dots on the gw(which will also run you oom, but he has to die fast).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My advice is save yourself a lot of time and headahce, and start farming places like seb for cash then buy torpor.  Otherwise, get a partner and settle in for the long haul.</div></div><hr />
