<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately anytime my computer accesses the disk drive it takes an unreasonable amount of time. This happens with all my applications and not just EQ, but it is more pronounced with EQ especially when logging in, zoning, and even camping.<br />
<br />
Here are specs:<br />
<br />
Athlon 1500 XP<br />
Windows XP<br />
512 DDR<br />
Leadtek Titatium II Geforce 3<br />
<br />
I have a network of 2 home computers with a Linksys router. The other computer, a PII 233, has had no change in performance.<br />
<br />
I have scanned for viruses (none) and defragged. Neither improved performance.<br />
<br />
When I check to see if any other processes are running using Ctrl-alt-del I do not see anything out of the ordinary, but maybe I'm not looking for the right thing.<br />
<br />
Don't know where to go from here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also if anyone knows of a website that offers help with questions like this, please post it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are your power management settings set too aggressively?  If the hard drive is being powered down to sleep mode every five minutes, that could cause a delay.<br />
<br />
Is it possible you have DMA enabled in the BIOS/OS but not on your hardware?  I believe this can cause timeouts on each hard drive access.<br />
<br />
Just a couple thoughts off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It could just be that your hard drive has gone bad. I've seen this happen numerous times.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do is download and run the diagnostic tools from your hard drive manufacturer. Western Digital has one called Data Lifeguard. The Seagate diagnostic is called Seatools. Both of these programs can test the drive for faulty hardware problems.<br />
<br />
About 3 weeks ago I helped a friend put a new hard drive in his system. It was booting unbelievably slow, loading games slow, etc etc. Cost him about $80 for a new hard drive and now he's good to go.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice.<br />
<br />
I checked power and DMA settings, both were ok.<br />
<br />
I downloaded a diagnostic program from Maxtor and it found nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
I downloaded AdAware and eliminated sneaky info gathering programs.<br />
<br />
It may be that the drive is not actually spinning during the slowdown times, but the access light is on. I do not know if this is significant or not.<br />
<br />
I will try an optimization analyzing program tonight. If that does not work I'm starting to think that maybe reinstalling XP might be the next step followed by a new harddrive.<br />
<br />
I hate this kind of stuff.:(</div></div><hr />
