<br />
Well, I'm convinced I'm going to get to 60. I have my eyes on Torpor. Now, I got a PC of 50k on Luclin server. Sure we all know it's a really, REALLY nice heal spell. Is that really what it goes for? Geeze, KEI is cheaper at 35k or so on the same server :)<br />
<br />
Help me out! Thanks!</div></div><hr />

... Sounds about right ...<br />

On E'Ci I've seen shamans auc. after Torpor Offering Hiero Cloak and 40k ...<br />
<br />
If you have the Friends to do the Shield of Bane Warding you might start to want to do that ... On E'Ci that shield sells for between 35 to 45k ....<br />

Just a few observations ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as Torpor being more expensive than KEI, well, that's because KEI (and the majority of the other 60 SoL spells are pretty common).  It's nice to see that Verant never made the &quot;rare Kunark spell syndrome&quot; mistake again, both SoV and SoL spells are fairly easy to get (componentless lev/invis and group acumen excepted).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most I paid for a spell was 900pp for Voice.<br />
<br />
Full spell book other than Levitation and Enduring Breath - just haven't bothered camping them, hardly use the regular versions anyway.<br />
<br />
But... I've seen Torpor go in the 35k range on Brell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just bought Torpor on Vazaelle for 15k this weekend.  I am now broke and had to send my horse to the glue factory to come up witht he cash but it is well worth it.<br />
<br />
Now I have Malo and Torpor in the bank waiting for me,  cant wait to get to 60. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I paid 5k for Malo, average price 20-40k, Torpor I seen sell twice before it pick this copy up, once for 5k and the second time for 20k but the 20k person just started looking for bids so I am not sure how high it went.</div></div><hr />

I do however, see a LOT of people trying to buy it. The server auction channel has about 10 &quot;regulars&quot; who seek both malo and torpor.<br />
<br />
Chottal dropped pox, tigir's (Yet to scribe, going to see if anyone else in guild wants it, cause I don't). Gore dropped malo, Sontalak dropped torpor, all within the space of 3 weeks. I don't know how I functioned in the 5 months of being 60 prior to this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Karana Prices<br />
<br />
Torpor - 7k<br />
Malo - 10k<br />
<br />
I wouldnt pay anymore than this, maybe a little more for malo but not much.  All you people paying 30-60k+ for it are just nuts....<br />
<br />
Paying over the odds for spells is becoming a pain now, why?  Because sellers know that they can make shaman who need the spells bargain against each other till the price becomes stupid.<br />
<br />
What I say is we should all stick together, set a price for the spell and pay no more for it, soon when the sellers cant actually sell the spells they will drop in price to a reasonable price.  The reason they have become so expensive is because there is always one shaman willing to pay any price for it, so it then becomes the norm to charge that price and the other shaman suffer because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The scrolls are just flat out rare on xev. Personally I feel the same way, I wont pay more than 5k for any friggin spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It is sad, how Verant made the spells drop off some high level mobs, thus opening the possibilities to get the greedy little fingers of the greey people on the spells, what they cannot ever use (and doubt any player would create a shaman char only because they got their greedy little fingers on the lvl 60 shaman spell), and then charge the people, who need and could use these spells, some astronomical sums. Nevermind the fact that the person, who needs this spell, could perhaps at some other day save the scrawny butt of that greedy little person with that spell, perhaps the life of the whole group.<br />
<br />
I try to get the spells I need on my own, but naturally I can't get them all. I have a long memory though, and I will remember those, who tried to rip me off. One day their worthless lives will be in my hands, and they can be saved by these very same spells, with what they tried to rip me off. Now, I am not a vengeful person, but I will watch how their shrivel and wither and die, and not use that spell on them. Call it a lesson. I only seek those spells to benefit those, whom I am with, not to be some &quot;uber&quot; shaman with &quot;zoomy&quot; spell effects. If these ignorant ones fail to see and understand that, they will understand the &quot;Loading, please wait...&quot; screen.<br />
<br />
Eh.. Oops.. Maybe I should have created the iksar shaman instead..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">God I need to move to another server hehe. Torpor on Drinal runs 75 - 100k still. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Say someone auc for torpor this weekend offering 75K. I go tmine when i was lvl 53 off Serevilous and Malo from guild. There is a few spells i need but i wont pay for a spell at any time. I do sympathize though with lvl 60 shamans with out torpor or malo. Those spells define our class and increase our worth to a raid. I know on raids with mobs like Arch Lich, shamans heal casters with torpor so the clerics and druids are free to maintain the melees.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely my favorite spell in the game to this point.<br />
<br />

How did you get malo and pox to drop of sontalak?  Sontalak is a Velious mob and malo/pox is a kunark spell.  I've never seen velious drops off kunark mobs or vice versa... :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">For some reason, Klandicar and Sontalak drop high level Kunark spells.  Of course, never any good ones for us, if I get one more copy of Mala off Klandicar I will scream!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Not sure how much I paid exactly. Traded a cobalt bp for torpor and a lot of other stuff.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Hoeju</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Luclin just has too many Shaman hitting 60 at once right now.  A few months ago a friend of mine bought Torpor for 5k and it took him a few days to find a buyer at 9k since I told him I did not need it yet.  I was only level 50 at the time.  I think Malo is more rare than Torpor and Pox and Voice are even rarer.  Torpor is the most useful tho and all the WTB in the auction channel are going to make sellers ask for more when they get one.  Best way to get it cheap is to camp the Emperor and wait for a WTS instead of spamming WTB for 50k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I looted Torpor from emperor in seb at 59 and at 60 I looted from him Torpor AND Malo in 2 pop in a row<br />
I got pox from a GW and tigir / BoN / VoB from juggs<br />
only spell I bought is group focus fo 12k on bertoxx (saw auction for 20k on that spell)<br />
I think Malo is still around 50k on bertoxx and Torpor is around 30k.. well at least it's the last auction I saw.<br />

I m running one of the spell mule of my guild. I have 160 spell. I have 1 greater bear, 2 talisman of brute and 2 focus and 1 tigir.. that's all..

<br />
I bought Pox for 10k and got torpor from guild and looted the rest.<br />
<br />
Normal for torpor appears to be 80-100.<br />
<br />
Malo varies more 50-70 was normal but for some reason lately it seems to be 100-200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Jesus!  Some of these prices are unbelievable. :(<br />
<br />
I mean I think 20k is extreme /sigh<br />
<br />
You know you cant blame these people selling the scrolls this high either because WE Shamans are the reason it is so high, the Rich pay whatever price the seller is asking for.<br />
<br />
Example, 3 months ago I remember this shaman posting on the server board the following.<br />
<br />
WTB Shaman Spells Torpor, Malo and Tigirs.  Paying Extremely well, I have lots and lots of platinum and nothing better to do with it people, sell me these damn spells.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine who was saving Torpor for himself for when he hit 60, replied to his post stating of course he had Torpor (He needed the cash and was only 37 at the time, a retired friend of his gave the scroll to him).  <br />
<br />
A couple of days later when I saw him on I gave him a tell asking what did soandso pay for the spell out of curiousosity.  He told me he was very hesitant to sell until soandso put 200k in his trade window.  <br />
<br />
My freaking jaw dropped after I heard that /sigh,  on the other hand my friend was very happy, he doesnt even play his shaman anymore. :(<br />
<br />
So its hard to blame either of the participants.  On one side the Shamans want their spells and will pay whatever to get them, on the other side the Sellers know this and take advantage of the opportunity, do you blame them?<br />
<br />
Only one to blame is Verant I suppose for making the Scrolls ultra Rare. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Do I regret paying the 10kpp? Nope, for I had no way of predicting the good fortune we have had with rare spells off kunark dragons.</div></div><hr />
