<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The shaman in my guild were discussing this a bit.  <br />
<br />
Questions were:<br />
1.  Is the effect mgb'able?<br />
2.  Why didn't they make this click from inventory?<br />
3.  Why isn't this item buffer in terms of stats?<br />
4.  Why is the focus aggro reduction when most shaman manage aggro fine (except for annoying poison dots) anyways?<br />
<br />
If you have a TA, are you really going to equip this item?  Ok, well not many have a TA yet.. myself included, but its only a matter of time (pun intended).<br />
<br />
Now, I could understand this items stat level if it were even remotely possible to get this item without a raid force... but (correct me if I'm wrong) its not.  <br />
<br />
From what I hear, the wizard epic 1.5 took 37 folks from a tacvi level guild to take out the end boss for that epic.  4k dd and 2k unresistable mana drain.  Ouch.  <br />
<br />
If the shaman end boss is similar... Whats so great about a group heal that increases melee crit damage?  If its mgb'able, well, that might be nicer, but like I said, thats an unanswered question for me right now.<br />
<br />
In addition, if its true that these end bosses for the epics are quite tough... why are the stats barely basically quarm gear level?  Granted, if the epic 2.0 is 250hp/mana, thats approaching Tacvi, but still.... Tacvi is even one expansion behind the epics.  Guess I just expected more from an item with a very long quest and raid level mobs.  Serious raid level mobs no doubt.<br />
<br />
And in terms of the focus.... jeez.  Don't we have AA's that handle this?  And weren't those AA's (slight of hand) removed from Oow because the developers said that they had little or no effect?   I would have much rather seen a uber heal focus... or perhaps a % increase alteration, or perhaps a focus for detrimental spells similar to the eq time bp.., or just about anything except an aggro decreaser.<br />
<br />
And given that the primary slot will either be filled with TA, or the next expansion's uber weaponX (or this one if you count tacvi+), why work so hard for a weapon who's effect you won't use because its not equipped in 3-6 months?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">reguardless of it being able to be clicked from the inventory or it being mgb'able this is a great great item, and i believe and am pretty sue taht this is the 1.5 epic, do not think anyone is anywhere near finishing 2.0 yet.  I think this is a great item, not better than a time's antithesis but this is still an awesome item, im currently working on epic cannot wait to get it done to receive this piece of gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I have a TA and I'm still going for this item. It has more hp and mana, and I think it looks cool =p Sure the effects aren't super uber, but its only 1.5, 2.0 will be a bit better. I think it will be MGB'able because as a friend pointed out today, clickies are now /tgb able. If you want to check take out a Primal Cudgel if you have one. You used to not be able to cast on others outside your group, and now you can click on whoever you feel like.<br />
<br />
As for the difficulty, I've used a max of 5 people, 1 or 2 boxing usually, but never more then 5 to do all the parts up to the swarmfiend in UP. I wouldn't say its very hard at all. On the other hand we tried to help a guildie with the wiz guy in SD today and got owned with about 20 time geared people. I can't believe the difference in difficulty in ours and theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, that is the 1.5 version.<br />
<br />
I like the click effect just for the Group HoT. That and the AA ability make for a nice combination of additional healing options.<br />
<br />
Going to see what it does for casters/melee in the near future. It isn't a godly right click, but I think it's nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting. how hard is 1.5. Im tempted to attempt it before my account runs out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those of us with TAs might have to download some of the bard custom UI hotboxes with bag slots to make hot-swapping weapons easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regardless of the stats or the effect ... it's a CAT's head on a stick.  Imagine it in the hands of an ogre or troll ... crickets huh?  I wonder if it means that if you beat someone over the head with it that they get ***** whipped. ;)<br />
<br />
The effect sounds nice and of course, the stats are standard (meaning equal or balanced).<br />
<br />
EDIT: filtered ... LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are several people here at the Crucible that have solved the quest and are weilding the 1.5 epic.<br />
<br />
Check in the quests forums, can't miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't forsee using the 1.5...ever. The clicky would be ok if not a 10min recast.  The stats are just barely higher than TA, so its not even worth it for that.  I see the 1.5 as a means to an end...the 2.0 should have much better stats..I hope. Otherwise its TA for life.<br />
<br />
I think they shoulda realized that most shaman who have the TA won't ever replace it.  So the epic shoulda been offhand equipable or have clicky balance of nihil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would imagine that for those Shaman wielding the TA - that Epic 2.0 is for you.<br />
<br />
Were I a betting man, Epic 1.5 is going to be doable by the casual player.  However, 2.0 is going to be MUCH harder (Hopefully in MOB strength and NOT sit-at-spawn-roulette) and the reward much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Regardless of the stats or the effect ... it's a CAT's head on a stick.  Imagine it in the hands of an ogre or troll ... crickets huh?  <br />
This is a semi-sticking point with me, actually. Epic 1.0 was decent looking for a troll. Then I went to Winterstorm spear, which was also OK (who doesnt like the Spear look, eh). After that, I was in VT, but decided to skip the maces in there because they all looked too &quot;vanilla&quot;. I held out, and was rewarded with the first Sharkspine in the guild. Now THAT is a troll weapon if I ever saw one. Sitting on my green lizard, in my green chain, with green eyes and green skin, I am the definition of a Troll. Now they are offering me this . . . cat thing. <br />
<br />
ALTERNATE EPIC GRAPHICS!! My next rant! Who's with me! (I just KNOW all you Kitty shaman are bugged about it!)</div></div><hr />

I was unable to get Group Primal Essence from my Primal Cudgel to stick on anyone outside of group Thursday (or ever). Even though it's &quot;groupV2&quot; just like Talisman of the Diaku.<br />
<br />
Yes, /tgb on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You guys are thinking of it wrong don't you freaks roleplay? If you're an ogre you don't take a ****ing ogre head and stick it on your staff.. you take a GD cats head and mount it on your staff and beat people silly with it... <br />
<br />
The only people I see having issues with this staff are kats.. why would you do that to your own race?<br />
<br />
On top of that, clerics getting their epic as a shield and us getting it as primary is BOGUS. Clerics are already the most wanted class in the game, throw us a GD bone.. make it a helm or some other piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lol Helm... hahah that would be quality!<br />
<br />
but something with pointy horns please, and a particle effect :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The click stacks with our AA Group heal.<br />
<br />
The click is also situationally useful.<br />

I don't mind having a 400-700+ per tick healing ability every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

everquest is not an rpg, it may have been one way back when i dont know.  but i have seen no elements of role playing in the time i have been on norrath</div></div><hr />

It also stacks with our reg Q/BoT/SS HoTs so that in itself makes it pretty damn nice to throw up if you are in trouble.  Was soloing a bit in qvic when I ran into some rogue kyv being a pain and stuck them both on me and got myself healed back up pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoops, nevermind. Put it on peeps this weekend; just couldn't get it on my dog. Not worth 20 AAs, I don't suppose - especially with Virtue not requiring a component any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Epic 1.5 is extremely useful.  It and ancestral aid have already been completely assimilated into my playstyle.  I don't know why they didn't make it so you could use it and TA both, just seems like a basic oversight on their part.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, you can switch epic in and out every 10 mins (annoying).  Epic has already become another totally incorporated, incredibly useful ability like VP, ancestral aid, canni5.... the extremely fast cast makes it very useful for lots of situations.  Really beefs you up as main healer/slower (go to slow, gets resisted, toss off the epic to help w/healing till you get mob slowed, go to slow again etc.)  It stacks with ancestral aid, also, which is really nice.<br />
<br />
Also, compared to other epic 1.5's, it's one of the easiest to complete.  Nothing needs more than a group of Time-equipped players, and only the Swarmfiend needs 2 groups of casual players.<br />
<br />
One complaint I have is about aggro reduction in general.  I have just never seen it work.  SCS, the epic, whatever, it just doesn't seem to do anything.  If I do a poison dot with a pickup warrior, I take aggro; nothing has ever changed that.  Just seems like a totally useless focus to me.  I would much rather it gave increased dot dmg, or increased healing, or something new like that.<br />
<br />
I give the group heal an A+ and the focus a D- =)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hey Chifari, after the patch on Wednesday the shaman epic (and other epics) will be useable from inventory. No annoying switching :)<br />
<br />
Zajeer-Dev wrote: After this next live patch, all epics will be usable for inventory. So if you're more of the one-hander type knight, then you can still have some effectiveness out of your epic (by being able to click it from inventory) and still use a 1hander and shield.</div></div><hr />
