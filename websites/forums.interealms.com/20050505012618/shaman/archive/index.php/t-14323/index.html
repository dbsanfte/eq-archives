I cannot find an exp group anymore that isn't full of total idiots. I cannot find a good solo spot anymore because it's full of every druid on the server that's of minimum level. I cannot zone into bot without mobs sitting at zone. It's complete chaos.<br />
<br />
The charm was nice. The AAs were nice. Several other things were ok.<br />
<br />
Things have been really buggy though =/</div></div><hr />

Its been this way on Torv for a while anways, now its just a tad bit worse. Actually BoTs about the same, it really couldn't get much worse then it already was. <br />
<br />
Since the second day I had my BoT flag, I will not zone into that zone uninvised unless I've already talked to someone waiting on the other side. <br />
<br />
On that note, I'll be huddeled in the corner of the pit in tactics if someone needs me. Unless of course I get kicked out by uber_guild_03 when that stupid rallos event screws the whole zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't call it THE best, but it's up there.<br />
<br />
On Saryrn, sub-60's were already everywhere anyway. Let's face it, it's NOT hard for a bunch of level 65's to pull a 45 through hte trials, and do the farming for them in PoS for BoT access. And does anyone really, truely care that Torment is now open?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heck, I got access to a couple new zones to explore, AND the servers were up on time with easy log in.  IMO, definately the best.   Just being done on time ranks it as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only difference in BoT now is guilds that didnt work hard to flag there members (unlike mine where you were BoT flagged asap) can now farm the towers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's what happened last night.<br />
<br />
I got done raiding and went and watched a movie.  Logged back in around 3am.  Most of my guild is asleep, and no one needs me.  Don't feel like soloing, so I go to pov.<br />
<br />
/shout 65 shaman LFG<br />
<br />
Waited like 20 seconds and got no response, which is a long time vs. the usual time it takes me to get a group.<br />
<br />
/w shaman<br />
<br />
59 Luminary Newbass01<br />
56 Luminary Newbass02 <br />
65 Prophet Skitzoid Vah Shir &lt;Darkblood&gt; LFG<br />
65 Prophet Jinhiem Barbarian &lt;Triadica&gt; LFG<br />
<br />
W-T-F??!?!?!<br />
<br />
I ran and looked at all the camps, and sure enough, the two sub-60 shamans were in groups.  I checked bot, tactics, and hoh with no luck, so I went back to pov and read forums while shouting LFG every few minutes.  An hour later, a spot opened up in the group w/ the 56, and they had me come take his spot.  So we had a 65 shaman and a 56 shaman in the same group.  The 56 shaman went afk for half an hour and no one noticed.  On top of that, the mage was 58 and the wizard was 59.  Through no small effort on my part, no one died while I was in the group - we killed slow as hell though.<br />
<br />
So lets sum it up:<br />
<br />
1) All the spots in groups where I would usually be were instead taken by lower-level shamans who, in all honesty, are worthless and about 1/10 as effective as I am.<br />
2) Because of the above fact, I sat LFG for an hour, which is probably the longest I have sat LFG for a long time.<br />
3) When I finally did get a group, a full 1/2 of the group was sub-60 and doing a pisspoor job.  A level 58 wizard or mage is WORTHLESS in my eyes.  They were actually pretty cool guys, but they were just in over their heads.  Basically, I was powerleveling them, because without me the group wouldn't have stood a chance.<br />
<br />
Normally I would have just left, but I was needed something to do and was sick of LFGing, so I just dealt with it.  You can rest assured, though, once the lowbies started to leave the group, their replacements were always 63+.  I will NEVER invite anyone under 60 to group with me again.  If there is just one , maybe two &lt;60 in a group when I join, I will deal with it, but I will not let them join me.  It is just too frustrating to me to work so hard to have a strong, powerful character just to have all of my abilities be used picking up the slack for other people that just aren't coming close to pulling their weight.<br />
<br />
Screw them for taking off flags, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It was a good patch as far as execution, yes.<br />
But I have found myself in more situations like Jin than ever.  I admit we were a bit spoiled as far as being snatched up for groups so quickly, but damnit, I hate going to bot, doing a /who, seeing 19 people...then doing a / sham and seeing Thlayli lvl 65, no0b lvl 58, no0b lvl 59 and bot lvl 64. ....then sitting around waiting for an hour before I even get an offer.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I will never take a toon below the lvl that they will be useful in the zone into my group.  I was bot flagged at 61, and it was HARD! I stayed out unless a guild group needed me.<br />
<br />
Bah. I guess people will learn in time :/<br />
<br />
One other thing....someone tell me why they put Talisman of the Boar under strength buffs in the new spell selector thingy??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i'm a lil mixed over it, i don't like them removing flags, but, they didn't exactally mess up the rewards to much, i like the charm, the aa's were a lil meh.  and i have my tactics flag so i can hide in there.<br />
<br />
on the plus side /camp desktop works again (woot!!). and little easier to get guildies into groups.  <br />
<br />
all in all i'm fairly pleased with the patch, but time will tell how bad the floodgates have really been opened.<br />
<br />
(ps i havn't zoned into bot since the patch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm interesting to see others' flag removal stories.  Hasn't been too bad on TM from what I've seen, but a guildmate said that the now open planes will probably be hectic at first but will level out fairly quickly as lower level folks will begin to see that they just aren't ready for them yet.<br />
<br />

Im 56 atm, on my shaman.  I started fresh on my new server and play with RL friends.   Our group average is about 56 thus far.  We know what we are doing having come from another server.  I'm willing to bet my group can handle any normal xp spot in the newly opened planes.  It's very stereo typical to think everyone below 65 is retarted, which is pretty much the jist of this thread.<br />
<br />
Flags?  It's the most retarted ****ing idea i've ever seen in my life.( the whole idea in general. ) Keeping eachother away from guild mates and friends. They should remove them all!!  But then the ubers would piss and moan cause they dont have a private playground anymore.  <br />
Flags are why i quit my previous char, server, and guild.  I work alot and fell behind very quickly.  I had people in my guild botting me for some flags, but i really shouldnt have to.<br />
<br />
Down with your uber attitude and the flags i say...<br />
<br />
Edit: one more thing, watch out cause our full group +some are coming to the planes, and we dont want your 60+ ass hording all our xp.</div></div><hr />

Care to elaborate?  Because i am the exact opposite of what This thread suggests.  Although you probably can't considering there was obiously no thought into that post.<br />
<br />
Flags are a touchy issue for me, if you have something to add besides that remark that could mean 5 different things, feel free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/agree Sionnach.<br />
<br />
It's not that you're a bad player, it's that you're missing several things that would make you far more effective in the group.  Topor, Malo, Kraggs, resists...   Are you going to be doing backup healings with Sup Heal?  If so, I feel sorry for your group.   Nothing &quot;elitist&quot; about that, I just think the mobs have you very much outclassed.<br />
<br />
I've had my wizzy flagged for PoV/PoS since 46 (we were bored one day) but I've never seriously thought about going in there LFG even though he's 54 now.</div></div><hr />

People with flags were rewarded very VERY nicely. Those who don't have the time to get flags or were left behind from a group of friends now have somewhere to lvl instead of a being so confined to such a little ammount of zones and can play in some more content that they paid for when they bought PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually think it would be fun to see your group try and handle even the easy stuff I solo. Simply because you would die so fast you wouldn't know what hit you. I don't care how skillful you are if your entire party is mid 50's you just don't have the tools to handle a 60+ mob that hits for anywhere from 600 to 1000+ a pop and survive. Your tank doesn't have the hps. You don't have a prayer of landing a spell on them with the level difference and no malo/malos. You cleric couldn't heal fast enough to have a prayer. This has nothing to do with your skill and everything to do with your level.<br />
<br />

<br />
Down with your uber attitude and the flags i say...<br />
<br />
Your the one coming in here with the attitude. A level 56 shaman really has no place in a group in PoV. I was in PoV the first week pop was released and it was hard as hell with a group of 60's but very rewarding. A level 56 anything is going to be facing only mobs that are red to them. A lvl 56 shaman isn't going to have malo(s) to debuff with so they are going to have to hope they can land a malosini or a slow with out it. Not to mention that the mobs quad and hit for more per hit than a 56 shaman could heal with a single heal. They most definitely aren't carrying thier part of the load simply because they don't have the tools to do so because they don't have the level.<br />
<br />
Edit: one more thing, watch out cause our full group +some are coming to the planes, and we dont want your 60+ ass hording all our xp.<br />
I could careless if your coming to the planes cause you can't even zone into the zones I hunt in still and even if you could it would be comical to watch you get eaten by the mobs the instant they looked at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When i was lvl 60 i got flagged for PoV/PoS<br />
didnt have torpor or malo if a caster started getting beat on then there was nothing i could do about it i had kraggs which is 2k heal with 10 sec cast, caster would be dead before it hit, or chloroblast which only healed for 428 which doesnt even cover a max hit off pov mobs<br />
also when a mob was inc i would bounce 2-6 malosini's before i could get it slowed <br />
<br />
something else i have noticed is they have toned pov mobs way down on resist and atk <br />
when i was first flagged most of the zone enraged now not much does<br />
<br />
i have gone to pov bot now and they are mad houses theres trains every 5 mins and its not just the &lt;65 i see alot of lvl 65's in bot that are total morons <br />
<br />
i dont like grping with anyone in bot who doesnt have at least there 2nd aa tittle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">More good fixes than screwed up ones, although my guild has experienced raid forming problems for some reason tonight.  Group xp seems to be a bit better but haven't done alot of group xp to put a definite yes/no on it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've grouped in PoV with my 61 necro, and have to say that a group of mid 50's toons are gonna get owned. Stay in tier 1, or go to OS and farm money/gear and level up, then Head to tier 2. My rangers almost 55, and once he dings some friends are willing to power me up in tier 2, but if I'm a liability they are gonna send me back where i came from. I wouldn't want a group of people less than 60 in their, and I wouldn't want to group my ranger with strangers, its not fair to expect people to level you up when you don't know them and can't provide much to the group. Probably any class but ranger would be hard to allow unless its a pet class where they can do damage without having to worry about getting eaten. I'm just gonna sit back and pling arrows at stuff, basically filling in the 6th slot in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">People like Cabe are the reason pov sucks now.  I have nothing against lower levels peeps, its just the lower level peeps that DO NOT GRASP THE FACT THAT BEING LEVEL 56 MAKES THEM USELESS IN POV that piss me off and afraid to go there any more.  If you honestly think that you, at 56, are anywhere CLOSE to being as powerful as I am at 65 w/ 160aa, you are beyond clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Put me down as one of those that really likes this patch. I think they did a good job with the rewards, good enough that some friends of mine are already talking about picking up flags they missed just so they can get a better charm. <br />
  I also like the flag removal. I've got too many friends that have managed to make it to 60+ but don't play enough any more to get their flags. The places I can now hunt with them just increased dramatically. <br />
I rarely do pickup groups, and when I do I start my own so the influx of lvl 50s in tier 2 doesn't bother me. As for the horror stories mentioned above, DUH! Anyone trying to do pickup groups in PoV over the next two weeks is either a masochist or just looking for something to bitch about. It was predictable, PoV is the only tier 2 zone that anyone under 60 stands a remote chance in of surviving so the influx of lower lvls was a given. I won't mind grouping there with a mid 50s friend to get them some quick exp but I certainly won't be back in PoV for a pickup group anytime soon. The place was a cesspool even before this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It doesnt change the fact that the flag system is crap. <br />
<br />
The point i'm trying to make is i should be able to go there regardless of my level / status of my guild.  And not be left behind for that matter.<br />
<br />
My other point was to say not everyone below 60 is a retard zone trainer.  If my friends and i decided for some reason to try some of the unflagged zones, we would probably wipe ya, but not killing people at the zone ect..  Theres nothing wrong with a little challenge :)<br />
<br />
As for the stay out cause were coming through remark, i'm being sarcastic.......<br />
<br />
I dont plan on hunting in pop at all for quite awhile. ;)  I know my point was a little stretched, but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually I think the flag system is a very good idea, the way it was implemented was not.<br />
<br />
I think the reason why a lot of people are a bit anal is because between 56 and 60 shamans obtain a lot of power.  PoV/PoS was designed for the 60+ game and because of that the mobs hit faster and harder.  You could be the best shaman in world with awesome gear but at level 56 there is no way you can contribute effectively to a group.  Personally, I think that they shouldve made the minimum level for PoV/PoS etc. level 59.  At that level mobs are still red to a shaman but they can be slowed if you are careful.  Plus you have kraggs which does make a decent backup heal even for tier two. I actually ended up getting a PoV WW group at lvl 59 and managed to hold my own very nicely.  I still have a SS of the kill that gave me level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think getting rid of the flags was an excellent idea.  There just needs to be some time for those in that 55-58ish range to get crunched a few times and look elsewhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thank God they had long key flags to get into Lower Guk pre-Kunark, it really sucked that I could never get a King or Lord camp, because they were full of lvl 29 shamans.  Or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my favorite patch ever, because my server has crashed 5 times since it came out, actually giving people who aren't from Europe a decent shot at Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I tried duoing in Valor with my then 55 ranger and I made it through my first (and only) fight ok, but it was nowhere near mana efficient.  This was against a larva, BTW.<br />
<br />
Then agian, I am still lacking both Torpor and Quiescence so those may make a difference.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if I had that much trouble with one of the zone's weaker mobs using a 65 shaman and a 55 ranger with above average equipment for his level, then I could see where a group of mid-50s would have problems.  They could do it, but they would have tons of downtime. <br />
The way I see it tho is that the flag removal was more for the individual than the group.  <br />
What I would say is the ideal situation for a mid 50 to look for in a Teir 2 group, is to try to join one that has a post 60 representative of your class, where you join as back-up for him/her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Good patch.<br />
<br />
Saving spell sets: Awesome<br />
Right click spell memorization: Awsome<br />
PoP Flag Reward: Pretty good<br />
Veksar: Freaking Awesome<br />
Group Exp change: Not bad<br />
<br />
For all of you looking for AA exp, put together a group and go to Veksar. Exp isn't that great near the zone in but once you get past the water tunnel mobs turn dark blue. Once you get close to the theater the mobs are all dark blue at 65. A group of 65's can kill them ALOT faster than PoP mobs, and there are enough of them to keep AA exp on par with PoV or BoT. Mob levels start at around 57 in this area and go up to 63 past it. Great place for AA, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">More flames plz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Two issues are clear.<br />
<br />
(1) Flagging sux.<br />
<br />
(2) You are not effective if you are below lvl 60 (as a shaman) and does not have malo in PoV.  Without malo, your slow may get resisted a lot.  And while you are maloing and slowing, your cleric needs to heal your MT a bit.<br />
<br />
People are arguing out of context.  Nothing to do with skills or elitist attitude.  It is obvious you don't go to raid in ToV at lvl 30.<br />
<br />
To be honest, even a bunch of lvl 63+, with low AA and so so gears, would wipe fast in PoV if two or more mobs are pulled.  I have seen this many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Jin is flat out 100% right, IMHO. I, at 65, sat LFG in PoV for a long time and from time to time would do camp checks to see if any were open so I could grab some friends and go there.

<br />
I'm going to go pry my eyeballs out with a rusty spoon now, later.<br />
<br />
ANYONE below 60 (minus a cleric, maybe) can not do jacksquat in PoV, plain and simple. You will go /anon and /role, and if the group isn't smart enough to ask you of your level, you will leech exp off of them. There is NO other way to put it. Cabe, Jin (in a duel) could eat through you in about 15 seconds flat. You are NOT capable of fighting in PoV yet, sorry. You and your friends are (IMHO) doing one thing by going there and fighting when you're not level 60+, taking up a camp where a group could actually be functioning efficiently. I'm pissed on a few different levels here, I just wish there was an idiot test which denied access to these zones to some people.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a new charm and some free AAs never hurt either :D.</div></div><hr />

I've just checked your magello.  You really don't know much about EQ if you think your gear is below average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I've had similar experiences in PoV. Before the change, I was usually the lowest in the group (at 61), and worried I wasn't pulling my weight. Since, I've been in groups with 56 and 58 clerics. The 56 did okay at Outer Caves, with an SK single pulling, but the 58 couldn't hack it at DG when we got a two pull.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound snobbish about it, since I only recently got flagged myself, but I haven't liked PoV since the change - too many 55-60s not only looking for groups, but getting in them.<br />
<br />
One below 60 person in a group can be carried, just as they can be carried through the trials, but more than one means the group is slow, and if anything goes slightly wrong, it's much more likely to end in a wipeout.<br />
<br />
Since a few bad groups, I'm now spending more time in PoN and PoD and turning off AA to get to 62 soon, so I too can be one of the lower levels in over my head, in tier 3. :)</div></div><hr />

p.s. Cabe, although you said you were just joking you are a tard... yes go exploring and then leave you can't handle it I guarantee you.    <br />
<br />
This would be the equivalent of a bunch of mid 40s invading KC and thinking they could handle the mobs.... laff<br />
<br />
I too have seen this crap, I just think it's funny... I join a group and they have like  a 57 enchanter... i'm like *** do you think you are gonna do?   G'luck on that mez bro...   I'm like looks like i'm hasting as my haste is better than his lol.... C2 anyone?  ... no sorry we all have kei but thanks.<br />
<br />
I just rag on the low guys but like Jin i'm not gonna stay in a group where the melee are below 60 doing less damage than my lvl 58 wolf pet or while the casters are a liability.   Also Cabe, most people won't leave , they will try and try to get a group so they can get phat exp instead of going to PoD or PoJ where they can actually fight the mobs and pull their weight and level like we all did.<br />
<br />
Also to you who say the flags are so hard to get.... yes I too was pissed I couldn't get my pos/pov flag forever... so instead of crying I just went to PoD and started soloing or duo'ing the ccy camps.  I was there till I got lvl 63 and then FINALLY I got pos/pov flagged.   I think it's lame that you need the right combo cookie cutter group to pass the trial of execution...   EG AE group or just bunch of 65s with hella l33t dps...    They should make a solo option viable perhaps or a long ass quest so you could get into those zones, i don't think you should just be handed access as even getting the keys for BoT and stuff isn't even that hard and can be done with one group, give me a break you whiny ass bitches, seriously....lol<br />
<br />
This new patch has reminded me of the ol... don't like the group... /g laaaaaaag    ...  /q<br />
<br />
I usually give the new guys some tiips...stay for a bit to get them rolling and to remind me how much the exp sucks and how much of a liability they are and then I let them know honestly that exp sucks and that I need to head for better waters.<br />
<br />
I agree that no one below 60 should be in pos/pov and if they are they better be a cleric :-D<br />

You are a moron.  There is no very very to it.  For those that spent many many hours helping people get flagged, the reward is far from worth it.  Nothing to complain about, but you cant say its worth it.  For those that got dragged up to trials and pushed through and have maybe a total time of 1 hr in zones like PoJ, it was very nice reward.<br />
<br />
How about those in guilds that did events to get people flagged, over and over and over?  Time involved for the reward given still does not match.  How about those that spent 30+ hours camping a charm in LoY?  You know, the ones not in an uber guild, that will probably only see the flags from quests.  Worth it to them too?<br />
<br />
I like the charm.  The AA's help too.  But before you can say its very VERY nice, you need to get a clue and wake up and smell what you are shoveling.<br />
<br />
If a 56 can get a group in PoV/PoS/BoT ... more power to them.  People are stupid and will group about anyone these days.  Last time I joined a pickup group was when my shaman was level 29 I think.

<br />
W-T-F??!?!?!<br />
<br />
I ran and looked at all the camps, and sure enough, the two sub-60 shamans were in groups.  ...<br />
<br />
So lets sum it up:<br />
<br />
1) All the spots in groups where I would usually be were instead taken by lower-level shamans who, in all honesty, are worthless and about 1/10 as effective as I am.<br />
2) Because of the above fact, I sat LFG for an hour, which is probably the longest I have sat LFG for a long time.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
<br />
I wonder if you realize how arrogant this sounds, Jin?  Not saying it is inaccurate, but jeez this tone isnt the best thing for the shaman community on this board.<br />
<br />
If the sub-60 shaman were completely incapable of holding the camps, then why weren't the camps open, with the former occupants all dead and standing naked in the nexus waiting for a CR?<br />
<br />
I disagree with the idea that 65's for whom PoV and PoS should be a fairly relaxing grind, should object if a group of high 50's really tries to push themselves and take on a camp there.  If they quickly wipe, the camp will be open again soon enough.  If they can struggle and hold the camp and survive the challenge, more power to them.<br />
<br />
As long as people do not mislead by going /anon to hide their level, I think this is all a good thing by letting the difficulty of the zone itself regulate who decides to hunt there.</div></div><hr />

Why the **** do people have to be so arrogent to belive that a level 65 is a better person than a level 56.  Why is the level 56 an ******* for wanting to go places? People who make comments like this (if I ever pick up grouped anymore) Would get the boot faster than the time it took thier prickish ass to type that comment. <br />
<br />
I was told You cant tank, Sit down and heal. Then I tanked in front of them. (4 and a half years ago) I was told Shaman need wisdom gear. (As I bought HP gear 4 years ago.) I was told a shaman cant Fight toe to toe with a hill giant. (As I brought my friend over and Did so in front of him at level 34) 4 years ago.  I was told Your **** guild will never accomplish anything. (Now we are crawling tactics, not looking for the most efficent xp But instead what is down this way.... Oh wait with a couple level 56's and amazingly a level 57 dorf warrior tanked just fine last night.And he has no uber gear ) I was told All sorts of things, included you cant effect this mobs in seblis the first few weeks of kunark. (Level 44 and I tanked the damn things when the paladin went LD and stopped the wipe.)<br />
<br />
All of the prickish people who think that thier contribution as a level 65 is greater than anyone elses. guess what. You are wrong. It isnt your level. Or your gear. That makes you a good person, a good player, or a good shaman.  It is your attatude. You might have more efficent spells. But you only contribute to the dilution and ruining of the game. Because you are contributing the least amount possible for the most gain. So keep you ****ing prick pick up groups. Ill have the level 56 in my guild tanking for us as we continue to have fun. Not mindlessly grind away the next most efficent xp point so that you can see a .005% increase in Total uber points effectiness rankings.<br />

I think the harder flags are actually like a grummus kill where unless you have friends in a big guild or a guild that wants to kill him then you arn't going anywhere... but you can always just quest your keys but to a point you will be stuck in tier 2 or 3... which there is no problem with.   I don't think you should be able to hit tier 4 without a guild because most of the mobs and stuff in there is designed for large groups fighting it, not your casual gamer.<br />
<br />
Also as a 60+ shaman if you can't find at least a decent guild taking out tier 1 and teir 2 mini bosses etc, then you are on a very sad server, as 65 and only a handful of AA's and a half empty spell book I can get almost any guild I want.<br />
<br />
Also the main conclusion is this of the entire posts on this thread ok:<br />
<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with skill or how good you are, a lvl 56 shaman is not going to do 1/2 the **** a 65 can do and will hinder a group more than he helps in pos or pov.   I think they should have set the level restrictions to 60 for those zones and that would have been fair.   Even at an outter pov group the other day when we had a 65monk tanking (couldn't get a sk/pal and we didn't want a warrior hehe) if we got an add or two (yes i know the monk can fd but we were just chain pulling) and I bounced a slow (aka it resisted for you non-shaman speaking folk) I would get agro and get a nice lil ass pounding...  did I die? no... did i even come close...laff no but at 65 these things can still wallop you good and still resisted a lot of malosinia (63 debuff)... so i eventually switched back to malo ( a lvl 60 spell they would not have) ...<br />
<br />
so that being said even if you are the best 56shaman in the world you can't slow things that are gonna resist, and when resisted you are gonan get your ass plowed unless you are good at dancing around and having the tanks chase the mob all over the place till they can regain agro and you try to reslow it....<br />
<br />
what you are forgetting is as skilled as you are at 56 you'd be playing your ass off and would still not be able to hack it because you are in over your head, whereas a 1/2 asleep lvl 65 could do a 300% better job and would not be endangering the life of his fellow groupmates.<br />
<br />
BTW whoever has 56 or 57 friends tanking in PoS or PoV you guys must have some sweet downtime as your cleric meds back to full after every pull, and if you get an add, goodluck on the rezes.</div></div><hr />

Even though Shaman were (from what I've heard) pretty much the last class people wanted for the trials, I still liked the idea of having to prove yourself in battle to get flagged for Tier II.  I'll probably still pass a trial before going into those zones, even though I don't have to, just to prove it to myself.  Of course, I haven't been in any particular hurry to get to the new zones.

Channeled another slow that stuck as I was getting beat. Healed myself while warrior almost died after regaining aggro, and got a tnargs on him at last moment with a ch landing after it would have been too late by the Cleric.<br />

I decided then to ask levels, and come to find out it was most everyones first time in PoV, and we had a 55 monk, 55 cleric, and 55 mage in the group. Druid was 61 but first time in PoV also. Being the nice guy I am, I did stay for a few more kills, but it was all I could do to keep myself alive after a resist.

<br />
A 65 is going to be more efficent yes. But I dont play to get the next aa or the next peice of loot. I play to have fun. And part of the fun for me is meeting intresting people. And Most of the time the people who push themselves a little but are intresting people.<br />
<br />
When pople cut on folks due to just thier level. Or because thier gear sucks. Or because of whatever petty I am uberer than you thing that they use to make them feel better about themselves It just shows who I would rather spend my time with. (Like that is a prize I know /laugh)<br />
<br />
Play the way you want. But if you think someone with a level 56 is useless and worthless and make it a point to ridacule them and make them feel like ****.... Well the plains are open. And that level 56 is gonna be 63 in a few weeks. And If you think he is going to call you an old friend and welcome you with open arms?...<br />

<br />
I'm not maxed out yet, I'm halfway 61 with just a few AAs, but I would not have wanted to go to PoV any lower than 60 and even 60+, not without Malo, or at least in a group with a mala mage or enchanter tashing. I realised that when I first started going there - the first group I got in PoV was with 5 level 65s, I was worried about pulling my weight, but at least I managed to slow everything, and that was my main job.<br />
<br />
However, a group of high 50s are going to struggle in PoV. They're going to get people killed. Overall, my rate of experience in PoV post patch has been lower than in PoD/PoN because of this.<br />
<br />
In those cases, I have been invited to existing groups - I have not invited people lower than 60 to my group. I was not in the habit of asking people the group composition and levels, but maybe I'll start. In the mean time, I'm not &quot;above&quot; accepting groups in PoD/PoN etc, and enjoying them, and getting reasonable experience. And if that experience is better for me at 61 than in PoV atm because of the group not being able to cope, then hopefully the 55-60 people will realise the same.<br />
<br />
In all, I'm not upset that the zones are open now, it was probably a good move long term. However, it has lead to me having some bad experiences in PoV since the patch, and I'm just hoping it'll settle down a bit.</div></div><hr />

They do have a point in the sense that lvl 60 and malo is almost the price of admittance for a shaman in tier 2+. Unless the group has someone elseo to debuff and/or a pretty uber tank. The good part is, given a malo Shaman, you can make almost any group work in Tier 2. We used to hit PoS regularly with 62 shaman, 62 Druid, 61 SK or Monk. Fill in the rest when friends come online but their class/lvl really didn't matter. <br />
<br />
It's easy to make a group work if you can slow reliably, takes some serious firepower from the rest of the group to make up if you can't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean by the half asleep shaman... The one who buffs the group and on incoming mobs just malos and slows... maybe throws on his epic dot and then seems almost afk during the fight, or perhaps just talks but doesn't do anything else but maybe sick his dog on the mob.  The sheer difference in level between 65 and 56 will shine through like the light of day.   THAT is what I meant...  whereas the 56 shaman will probably bounce a few malise attempts then bounce a few slows and by then he's going to be running in circles for 2 min while the group tries to get the mob off him.<br />
<br />
There is something wrong especially with a pre-58 shaman being in PoV or PoS when most of the shaman there have pets that con even or higher to them... maybe it's a sign?<br />
<br />
BTW,  I'm not sure if any of that &quot;whining about groups&quot; crap was geared at me but to that I just laugh.   I haven't been left out of a group yet, nor have I been killed in or by one of the 'noob' groups in PoV or PoS yet.   I'm just saying on a whole these other 63-65 shaman have a point and yes it is partially the fault of the people inviting the lower level shaman.  They might not understand our classes limitations, their error is ignorance...(Hell I was in a BoT group the other day for about an hour when the 65 warrior with like 150AA's asks the group:  &quot;Hey do we have a shaman in the group?&quot; ....  can we say ebay?)  WE, however, DO understand them so if you are in PoS/PoV pre I'd say minimum lvl 59 you are being quite selfish as you are risking the lives of everyone in the group (unless you have a very badass group and you are are the only or one of the only pre-60s in it with a nice 63-65 sk or possibly uber paly because that is all that willl hold that agro after you start bouncing slows).<br />
<br />
Also to the poster who said, be nice now or in a few weeks when all these shaman are 63 we will be in trouble.... Um... What trouble?   How often have you been grouped with another shaman?   It's be ages for me.   Also if you are already 65 it's not like you will need to rely on the newly leveled 63 shaman for a guild invite or something.    I never said don't be nice, none of this is personal attacks ... think of it as if the shaman were an NPC pet, would you rather have a 65 that does a ton of stuff and lives thru the fight or a 56 that dies and you have to keep resummoning.<br />
<br />
Also to the 65 shaman who can't find a group, just grab a druid and go duo in... nm ... not gonna say because of fear of overcamping, but there are tons of spots where you'll get good exp just duoing.   I'd say solo but now that it's only like 80-85% the exp it used to be I can't sit and grind like I used to :-(<br />
<br />
take care all and to the noobs who keep saying they can handle it, stop being so damn stubborn and admit you are wrong.  If you can... great.. it's your uber buddies who are picking up your slack.<br />
<br />
and p.s. to the guy bragging about all his alts and stuff being able to get groups... grats want a cookie?  anyone can get groups.  I highly doubt your 54 sk is tanking in PoS/PoV and if he is I feel very sorry for that group as they are buffing up for nothing but a run to the graveyard.    A 54sk wouldn't even be able to tank the lightcrawlers in CCY in PoD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Putting in restrictions for zones is not a new thing.<br />
<br />
Level restrictions have been in place on the old world planes - and still exist on the Tier 1 PoP planes.  People &lt;46 have always been prevented from joining their friends in the planes... is this different?<br />
<br />
Essentially, the &quot;flags&quot; are key rewards from performing some quest.  The quest might be &quot;kill X MOB&quot; (PoV/PoS, PoT, etc) or it might be &quot;collect these items and bring them to me&quot; (BoT and alternate flagging methods).  Keys have existed for a long long time - remember VP, OS, HS, ST?  If you weren't keyed you could not join your friends.  Is this any different?<br />
<br />
How about the biggest Mack-daddy of them all?  Vex Thal.  You ever try to get THAT &quot;flag&quot;?  Go whine to SoE about not being able to play with your friends in VT... tell them how you &quot;paid for that content&quot; and how they are &quot;restricting your ability to enjoy what you paid for&quot;.  I'm sure I'll be able to here the laughing all the way in Atlanta.<br />
<br />
Point of the matter is that the concepts of having to EARN your way into higher end zones is NOT new.  The precedent has existed for a long long time.  There is a purpose behind it - actually two:<br />
<br />
1) It forces people to EXPERIENCE the content - not just kill, kill, kill, exp, exp, exp.  You progress through the bosses and the encounters if you want to see new zones.  It's called a content progression.<br />
<br />
2) It becomes a test of ability.  Face it, as everyone here has said already, at &lt;60 levels you are not useful in Tier2+.  You just aren't.  Can you kill something?  Yeah, probably, if given enough time.  It's not because WE are uber and you SUCK.  It's because you don't have the levels (read: spells, hp, gear, resists, etc) to be effective.  By forcing you through trials or encounters you prove your capability before ever stepping into the zone.<br />
<br />
Now, before the flamers say &quot;hell - my level 21 necro is PoV/PoS flagged&quot; - I'm talking about people who do the trials without the crib group.<br />
<br />
Anyway - back to the original question:<br />
<br />
Yes I think the patch was good for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) They found a few ways to actually do smart things for the players - the spell sets, exp modifiers for groups (read: F the soloers who screw up zones), and finally made the charm slot useful.<br />
2) They have reset my server at least once a day every day since the patch (read: YAY!  Raid Targets every night!!!).</div></div><hr />

No, I think he's accurate.  We were very well rewarded for having a flag.  You were not well rewarded for essentially re-doing the flagging.  So?<br />
<br />
Do you get a big old bonus for re-doing, say, the VP key quest?  Why should this be any different.<br />
<br />
Oh, and someone asked about BoT key with one group -- it IS doable.  When I got my talismans, we did it with 7 people including a 55(!) beastlord and a 60 melee ranger.  Combine those into one more powerful individual, and it could be done by 6.<br />

Anyone that isnt happy with that charm and the free AA discipline is the moron.  That reward was very VERY nice and way unlike the sony/VI of the past.

It's all relative. I'm sure your probably proud of what you've got like anyone who's worked for what they have but realistically other than the shield it's all sov stuff or tradable and from several expansions ago. Yet I'm sure there are people out there who would love to have several of the peices you have (shield, belt, bp etc) but can't get them yet either. By the same token however for a Guild closer to the cutting edge like mine even a relatively new shaman who has been in the guild for a meer 2 months has several hundered hps on you and quite a bit other stats. Our more senior shamans like myself have even more over you and there are shaman out there who have a significant advantage over me.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know I am an arrogant *******.  I am so arrogant, in fact, that I do not give a flying **** if people think I am arrogant.  When I go to exp, I am there to own mobs.  Lots of mobs.  I enjoy killing mobs at a fast rate, and efficiently.  That is as fun as exp will ever be.  I don't have fun if I am surrounded by gimps and I have to carry them along.  People in the 60-62 are noticeably weaker and less effective, and people &lt;60 are just worthless, for the most part.<br />
<br />
As many people said &quot;I would rather have a lower level character that knows his class, than a 65 that is half-assing it.&quot;  What the hell makes you think that a sub60 character knows how to handle himself in pov?  I have done over 130AA in pov.  Even if I was a stupid person to begin with, that much experience means you MUST LEARN how to do it, by classic conditioning.  How is a level 59 shaman, that grew up on bazaar kei and pop exp, going to play better on his first trip to pov than I do on my 200th?  In every group I am in, I am the slower.  In most groups, I am also the healer and/or puller as well.  Even if there is someone else pulling and healing, I am still contributing decent dot damage, ferine avatar, and Quiesence makes the healer's job very easy.  Now, what does a 56 shaman offer?  Occassionaly, they will be able to slow a mob w/o help from another debuffer.  I can ensure that a group will almost never wipe or have any deaths at all.  A 56 shaman cannot do that.  Remember, I used to be 56 as well.  I know what a 56 shaman can do, and it is absolutely nothing compared to a prophet with a full spellbook and 150+ aa.  I find it annoying that most people are dumb enough to grab the first shaman/chanter that comes along, thinking that all slowers are created equal, when in fact they should wait for me to LFG before they start killing :D</div></div><hr />

I play to have fun. And part of the fun for me is meeting intresting people. And Most of the time the people who push themselves a little but are intresting people.<br />
<br />
<br />
I raid 99% of my play time.  I dont enjoy doing XP groups particularly so most of the time I dont bother, but I do need to do xp sometimes to a) get back xp from raid deaths and b) make me more effective in the raid situations.<br />
<br />
When I want to XP I dont want to be holding some lvl 57's hand.  They may well be the nicest person in the world but I am there for XP as quick as I can get it.  I now hide out in Tactics because my one attempt at grouping outside of Tactics landed me in a group with a 57 cleric and a 56 paladin who were both anon or I wouldnt have joined the group.  I had more hp than the paladin, not helped with the cleric not being able Aego, let alone virtue.<br />
<br />
There is a huge difference between sub lvl 60 and a 65.  I was looking back through my screenshots the other day and at lvl 60 I wasnt breaking 2k unbuffed hp and was just shy of 1k ac - I am now at 3.4k hp and 1160ac unbuffed.  That alone makes a big difference.  Add to that the fact I can Q and FA a tank and that I dont need to Malo an incomming mob 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
XP sucks.  PoV xp really sucks as it is boring as hell, and the one thing that can redeem it is getting as much xp in as little a time as possible.  Due to this I want as efficient a group as possible, and unfortunately lvl 5X's just dont make that grade.  It may sound harsh but that is my personal opinion.  I dont think I would be as pissed off if they didnt go /role - it has been a long time since I have had to respond to a tell for a group with '/r What classes and lvls are in the group please', just because I dont have time to waste sitting around in a group of low level players in a zone they shouldnt really be trying to xp in just because they heard the xp was great.  Before I get the 'But they paid for it why shouldnt they be in there' crap, they shouldnt be in there because it is not fair to expect people you dont know in the game to spend their time PL'ing you.  If they are in there as a self contained group, more power to them, just dont train me when you are running to the zone thanks.<br />

Now if he had Elemental loot or something I could agree with you, or even VT considering VT is at least kinda tough to get in to (though, getting into VT really is a joke now, Emp is no where near the badass he used to be).  Seriously though, if you think his gear is so great go check out any mediocre guild on your server and I will bet ya most of em have stuff at least off HP or other Ssra bosses, its not a big deal anymore.  Ssra was big early - mid luclin, but now every one of the mobs in Ssra is 2 groupable cept for Emp (yes even cursed, though it would be a damn long fight).<br />

My apologies I must be really behind the times: I really had no idea that the average player - (level 60-65) - was in guilds capable of doing the upper levels of Ssra temple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 65 and PoP AAs pretty much trivialize all of Luclin.<br />
<br />
My guild killed emp with 36 people + 3 bots. On our first try. It wasn't even as hard as the high priest really... just a bunch of people that can work as a team and who have all collected a large amount of AAs.<br />
<br />
I'm proud of it, but I'm not going to tell myself that it's 'uber', cause it's not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, it's no great shakes to do higher end ssra stuff, but average joes out there aren't doing it.  <br />
<br />
The disparity between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot;, or the &quot;raiders&quot; and &quot;non-raiders&quot; has never been greater than it is now.  <br />
<br />
It's two different games really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Well I'll say it this way then, anyone who WANTS to can go to ssra and kill anything there np, doesnt matter how strong your guild is as long as your guys are 65 its easy.  Hell, people have did pickup raid type things on cursed on Veeshan and they were gonna do emp too but they couldnt get enough keys and eventually gave up cause alot of the pickup raiders joined guilds  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">On my server, Ssra is packed with raiding guilds who want to scale the tiers - and they treat each other like garbage for the most part it appears.  <br />
<br />
Sure, getting together a big group of 65s to kill something isn't a big deal, but it is raiding, and a lot of folks don't do much of it for a variety of reasons.  I used to more, very little now.  <br />
<br />
For me, it's primarily because my time is very erratic, and when you can't predict when you'll have 4 straight hours, it's hard to get into a groove raiding.  <br />
<br />
It's people with consistent hours, even if it's not a lot, that can do well in that environment.</div></div><hr />
