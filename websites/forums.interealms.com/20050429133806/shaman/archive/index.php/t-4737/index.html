<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>McLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found a really nice UI over at the Ranger's Glade that I am using some pieces from  (Thanks Sean) including a hotkey box that adds 5 inventory slots, perfect for fast gear changes or in my case clickable items.<br />
http://home.pacifier.com/~shirleyn/ <br />
This would be perfect for sow boots, epic, horse bridle, velious armor, bracer, etc. and something I was looking forward to using very much.<br />
  Unfortunately I can't seem to change the boxes to suit what I need (tosses his ruined keyboard out the window).  Now I consider myself pretty well experienced with reading and modifying code but this one has me stumped...<br />
  Posts that I have seen on EQInterface.com and Sean's own info states all you have to do is change the EQType value for the boxes.  I have done this in notepad then fearing that it was somehow corrupting the XML format tried again in XML Spy.  Both resulted in the entire skin erroring out and returning to default.<br />
<br />
  Can anyone provide an assist on this?  Has anyone else had the same problems?  Taking out my frustrations on assling guards isn't working anymore hehe.  I even went as far as to match up the box format with the info in the Inventory XML file and still no luck.<br />
  When working properly this would be one of the huge benefits of the new UI freeing up the original 10 hotkeys per page for spells, creative slow messages :D and other riff-raff.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
