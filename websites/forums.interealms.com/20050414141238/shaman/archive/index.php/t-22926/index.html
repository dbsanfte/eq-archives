<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, when I quit back in March it was before the full DX9 deployment and everything was working fine. However, upon my return this past weekend I find that game performance has really hit the bit bucket.<br />
<br />
Machine specs:<br />
<br />
P4, 2.6Ghz HT<br />
1GB PC3200<br />
GF3 Ti500 <br />
Sound Blaster Live 5.1<br />
7200 RPM HDD's<br />
<br />
The weakest link is the vidcard, but it's still well within spec.<br />
<br />
FPS in zones like Dulak, PoK, Veksar, et al (and even some old world city zones) drops to 1 to 2 FPS. IE, the game is not playable.<br />
<br />
I've scowered the official forums and KB for possible fixes and I've tried the following:<br />
<br />
- Turned Sound Realism in game options down to nill.<br />
- Decreased Hardware Acceleration on Sound Card in OS driver properties<br />
- Turned off Vertical Sync in vidcard OS driver properties<br />
- Reduced clip plane to absolute minimum setting<br />
- Turned off complex sky<br />
- Turned off all partical effects<br />
- Updated vidcard drivers to latest NVidia ForceWare (v61.77)<br />
- Updated to DX9c<br />
<br />
Nothing helps.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how they could have borked up the DX9 implementation so badly.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure someone can recommend a good memory checker you can dowlnload to make sure your dimm's haven't gone bad.<br />
<br />
Something else might be eating up memory...got virus checker running?  If not, get one!  If so, make sure its ignoring c:\program files\everquest\* so it doesn't lag you out.<br />
<br />
Get sybot s&amp;d and update it and run it.  It should clean up any nastiness the internet might have gifted you with.<br />
<br />
Video cards, just like memory can go bad.  Are you having problem only in eq or in other games also?<br />
<br />
Which order did you install drivers in?  They usually recommend installing DX first and then reinstalling video drivers on top of it.  I've never really worried about it myself but I've heard of people having problems if they are installed in the wrong order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Free space on your c: drive?  Got plenty?<br />
5+ GB free.<br />

New MB and RAM. Works fine in everything else.<br />

McAfee, but not running while gaming.<br />

Already done, clean, and immunized.<br />

Plays CoH (with it's high poly count models) flawlessly in 1152x864 res with no problems what-so-ever.<br />

I always reinstall hardware drivers after installing/upgrading DX.<br />
<br />
I posted my DXDiag and MSInfo information on the official Tech Support forums. Though I don't have a lot of faith in finding a solution there. One search I performed found one of the TSR's blaming a custom UI for low FPS and even stating that &quot;very few custom UI's will work with EQ now&quot;.<br />
<br />
What a tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ is NOT running on the full DX9 implementation they were hoping to roll out, I'm fully convinced.  As soon as my ancient Intel video card here at work *magically* was able to run EQ a couple weeks after the big DX9 rollout -- right about the time a lot of people reported drastic reductions in the performance improvements they'd gotten with the engine upgrade ... I really do think they had to cut back on some of their more ambitious DX9 plans.<br />
<br />
Which explains why CoH runs so beautifully - they don't have a lot of income coming from these tired old machines...<br />
<br />
But if I can get this old 400mhz  (64mb) monster to run EQ, I swear anything can...<br />
<br />
I hate to ask, but do you have Luclin models on?  CoH really does get you used to a higher graphics standard, and it's hard to imagine you ever played under these circumstances...  *grin*  What I usually do is go through the eqclient.ini and find anything graphics related.  There are a half dozen tiny things you can turn off, from something about luclingrass, to shadows, and then there's all the armor settings...<br />
<br />
Dulak and PoK make me think it's a luclin model thing, but that doesn't explain veksar.  Wierd.  But I'd say turn everything in game off (graphics related), and if THAT doesn't work,  you'll know to focus on your video driver and DX installation.  If that doesn't work, I'd focus on the GF3 card, and see if there are posts related specifically to that card and EQ with your issue (in case you already haven't narrowed it down that far).<br />
<br />
That's everything I can think of, sorry if some of it you've already tried, I wanted to err on the side of being thorough.  (though why I'm trying to help you stick the needle back in your arm is beyond me!)  *laugh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only have Human, Barbarian, Wood Elf, Dark Elf, High Elf, Dward, and Horse/Elemental models turned on. <br />
<br />
I'll have to disect the eqclient.ini file to see what all it's doing with graphic settins I guess.<br />
<br />
The &quot;needle&quot; isn't back in. I've found I don't really have the attachment to the game I've had in the past. It's a distraction, nothing more. I'm splitting my time between EQ, probably some CoH every now and then, the gym, and music, with the gym and music taking priority over gaming (which is how it's been for a long time). I never considered myself a gamer really. <br />
<br />
WoW, I fear however, will be totally consuming. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Found the problem(s). Previously I was using 16bit depth on both desktop and in game, but after I stopped playing in March I had set my machine up to do video production work (along with other graphic stuff). I had changed my desktop to 32bit so just naturally set EQ to that as well when I set up my custom UI.<br />
<br />
I also disabled HardwareTnL and set VSync=1 in the eqclient.ini. These three things brought my FPS back to normal, though some of my coloring seems to be a bit off. Not bad enough to ruin the game though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">try...<br />
<br />
/dopropertinting<br />
<br />
I think that's the command :-)  It's been awhile since I set it.<br />
<br />
I know it stopped coloring people's skin with their armor dye color when I set it. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good idea. Forgot all about that command. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Though it's really only on my Clerics helm and shoulders. They should be dark grey, but it looks like there's a light shining on him from just in front of him, and up at about a 45 degree angle. It's making his face a little pale and the armor peices a shade of light blue. It's really wierd.<br />
<br />
I'll try that command and see if it fixes it though.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Glad to hear on both counts.  Now I just hope I see some of you in WoW, since that one seems certain to be released first (and if EQ2 manages to come out first, with such a short beta, I'm afraid of it!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wife and I are still debating whether or not to play EQ2. The environments look fantastic, but I'm not too pleased with the PC models so far. Some of the NPC models look phenominal though (dragons, undead, etc).<br />
<br />
WoW = buh-bye EQ, buh-bye CoH :)</div></div><hr />
