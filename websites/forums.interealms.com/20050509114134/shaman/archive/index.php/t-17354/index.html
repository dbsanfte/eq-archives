POISON - Rogues<br />
DISEASE - Shamans<br />
MAGIC - Bards - (The have n30 magic modifier slows (Melody of Mischeif))<br />
GENERAL PURPOSE - Shamans<br />
COLD - Warr/rog/sk/pal/bard/rng - Whoever has the 2 cold weapon slows<br />
FAST CAST - Beastlords<br />
CHAIN CAST - Shamans(Time slow sticks) <br />
AoE - Bards<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
-Gonna have to go with Viscerator - Bards are the AE slow kings. <br />
<br />
-I'm still sticking with shaman's being best chain cast slowers, even though enchanters have a 3 sec slow weapon. Shamans slow weapon has a better slow on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
POISON - Rogues<br />
DISEASE - Shamans<br />
MAGIC - Bards - (The have n30 magic modifier slows (Melody of Mischeif)<br />
GENERAL PURPOSE - Shamans<br />
COLD - Warr/rog/sk/pal/bard/rng - Whoever has the 2 cold weapon slows<br />
<br />
Poison - rogues are the only ones with a poison based slow at all, so granted, even though it's a poison based, not a normal spell. Similar with the other classes and cold, although these are weapon based.<br />
<br />
Disease - shamans undoubtedly.<br />
<br />
Magic - I disagree here. Bards have a n30 magic modifier slow. So what? We have an unresistable n55 magic resist debuffer. Enchanters have an unresistable n50 magic resist debuffer. The bard's song also only lasts 3 ticks without being reapplied.<br />
<br />
I would not agree that the n30 makes the bard the best slower.<br />
<br />
Okay, it's something about the slow that bards do best, but if you're going to do that, you could argue that beastlords are the best slowers because theirs is faster to cast (base is 3 seconds, but factor in hybrid innate spell haste). You could argue that enchanters are the best slowers because their slow has no recast. You could argue that enchanters are the best slowers because their slow has a range of 250. (Turgur's is 200). You could argue that bards are best slowers because their slow takes no mana, and beastlord's slow is next best because it takes less mana. Pick a stat and argue how you like.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that the shaman slow will slow the mob more than any other slow. Maybe that doesn't make us the best slowers in your book, but it works for me.<br />
<br />
Edit: simple mistake corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bards get -51 unresistable debuff.. Harmony of Sound.. <br />
<br />
15 * 3.4 mod = 51<br />
<br />
Bards also her a better slow then MoM called RoT that last a minute, but it doesn't have the n30 MR to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shaman don't get an AoE slow, so I doubt we would be kings for that.<br />
<br />
Bards best slow is Requiem of Time, it is a 52% slow with no resist mod, it lasts 1 minute.  <br />
<br />
Melody of Mischief, while it may have a resist mod is also an PBAE DOT, which renders it unusable in many situations.  It is also only 45% and only lasts 18 seconds.  Saying this is the best magic slow in the game and bards the best magic-based slowers is far fetched.<br />
<br />
and you forgot poor necromancers - 70% undead slow.<br />
<br />
in regards to harmony of sound, the average bard isn't going to have War Drums of the Rathe(3.4 percussion mod), in fact only a couple bards per server will.  Most will only have 1.8 (epic) or 2.8(Thunderous Drum of Karana).  For more info on calculating the effects of bards instruments and AA, look at Reed's Spreadsheet. (http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=17152.topic)<br />
<br />
Enchanters also get their best slow on an item, like time's antithesis, called Serpent of Vindication (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=22959) so they are pretty good in your chain cast catagory too i would assume?<br />
<br />
[edit: corrected the duration of requiem]</div></div><hr />

I have a slow that hit a maximum of 4 targets, like a rain.  What's the name of our AoE slow that I have been missing all these years?  If you want the kings of AE slowing, look to the bards, it is the one catagory they do win in.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's the name of our AoE slow that I have been missing all these years?<br />
<br />
Must be talking about Tirgir's. AoE a bit of an overstatement :) Mobs gotta be packed about as close as a druid quad-hence your 4 mobs &quot;rain&quot; spell.<br />
<br />
Trying to experiment with it but most tanks assume you are going to root park, so mobs either get split or leave range; can't blame them really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, doesn't matter how close they are..  it will only hit 4 of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's still an AoE slow.  Tigir's Insects, hits 4 targets at once.  It's *not* like a rain spell, as a rain spell will hit up to 4 times, no matter how many mobs are in the range... if only one mob is in range, then a rain damage spell will hit that mob 3-4 times.<br />
<br />
Our AoE slow hits up to 4 targets at once, but only each target one time.  It's 50% slow and actually decreases hate by 200, and lasts up to 3.3 mins.<br />
<br />
It's a damn good spell in specific situations.  I've used it more and more on LDoN adventures for when the puller pulls more than 2 back to group, and it's much easier and less mana-intensive to cast one slow that hits 4 mobs than re-cast 1 spell 4 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chain casting.. well I can chain cast and swing a weapon proc as well.  What constitutes chain casting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rain == 4 target limit<br />
Rain != AoE<br />
<br />
We have a single wave, slow &quot;rain&quot; spell basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Call me crazy, but what AE spells are there out there - other than point blank - that hit more than 4 critters?  Hence &quot;quadding&quot;.  Quad.  Four.  This is why druids and rangers only &quot;quad&quot; four at a time.  Because their AE spells only hit four creatures.  Just like our single AE spell... Tigirs.<br />
<br />
The point of a range is that it's not instant-effect.  It takes place in its area over time.  Calling our AE slow a rain is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
For more clarification, AE stands for Area Effect.  It effects a particular area.  Regardless of how many it can effect in that area or how large/small that area is.  PBAE - point blank area effect, typically infinate creatures in a tiny area of effect - centered on you.<br />
<br />
So much for the original topic.  *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe that tigirs is what wizards would call a &quot;column&quot; because it is like a column with a base of a certain size and can only hit mobs inside that base (base is centered around your target), up to a maximum of FOUR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman can slow 4 mobs at once in 1 shot.<br />
Bards can slow unlimited.<br />
<br />
In my book that makes them better in AE situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, Crazy, Pillars hit 5;)  As does the gravity flux line.<br />
<br />
Rain != AoE<br />
<br />
Rains are AoE.  They have an area of effect.  Just for players, they have a limited number of hits.  Get hit by a mob though and you'll see every wave hit every target within range, each of the 3 waves.<br />
<br />
The number of targets doesn't matter, the area of effect does.  It could be an AE with 1 target and it'd still be an AE.  If I could target the tank and drop that AE on him and it damage the mob...AE.<br />
<br />
I'd have to disagree on magical slows though.  When you need a slower, and I mean really need one, it isn't a bard you go looking for.  For magical slows, one slow spell is king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tirgirs is as AoE of a slow as anyone but a bard gets.  However, bards do AE slow much better than shamans do.  The sole point we do better is that our AE slow won't wear off in 3 tics.  <br />
<br />
Alnya has a point, a -30MR resist adjust on a slow is really nice.  However, it's not enough to account for another 25% slow from Turgurs, and another 57 tics worth of slowed mob rather than the 3 tics that Bardslow provides.  <br />
Kianor summed it up best, and early in the post even.  Pick a spell stat.  It will be greater or lesser than another class's version of the same sort of spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The fact that we are having this discussion makes me want to puke really.<br />
<br />
General purpose - Beastlord(1.7 second casting slow for 65%)<br />
<br />
Chaincasting - Check out Zorlac's link. The Enchanter can handle aggro much better than the Shaman. Beastlords are 2nd(faster cast time and they can just tank so much better if they get a resist or multiple aggro)<br />
<br />
AE slow - Bard hands down, they are the only class casting PBAE slows. Shaman 2nd, even thought the restriction of 4 targets make this spell 99% situational. Usually memming Turgur's and Torgor's is safer and more effective in the end.<br />
<br />
Magic - Well the bard will land slow easier than anyone else. Shaman 2nd, Enchanter 3rd, Beastlord 4th. That is on paper...<br />
<br />
Disease - Shaman<br />
<br />
Poison - Rogue<br />
<br />
All in all we are not King of slows even when we leave out the mitigation issue. Did Shamans get any compensation for the loss in relative power ?</div></div><hr />

They get *1* aoe spell, Invoke Lightning. Its lvl 15 for them and does 25 damage to 4 targets.<br />

Tugur's Insects has 3 sec cast time, with TA 3 seconds.<br />
Forlorn Deeds has SIX second cast time, reduced to 3.5 with stick (IIRC lates patch changed it to 3.5).<br />
<br />
Manaless or not is irrelevant. Shaman slow was always better because of fast cast time. That is now gone. Enchanters with this stick are far better slowers than shamans. Don't forget tash has almost no cast time (Howl of Tashan is 1 sec cast time). Not to mention 2K Runes. By the time a shaman Malos and Slows with or without TA, the chanter with stick has long slowed the mob and maybe even mezzed it. And of course going into raid/xp group utility ... let's not go there.</div></div><hr />

As one enchanter I know put it, 'I'd trade you all my runes for quiessence in a heartbeat'. I'd agree that if you look at the Time clickies it does bring them fairly close but I'll never see that zone so I don't really feel competent to talk about those items. I've always seen the big difference between shaman and enchanter slow as the fact that Tash has a lot of agro associated with it while we can malo with impunity. Zorlac, would you trade malo(s) for tash if you had the chance? I know i wouldn't. <br />
<br />
The only class that I see as situationally better slowers are bards, between having a true AoE slow and another one with nice resist checks, I can think of plenty of times where a bard slowing would be more useful than a shaman. It really would have been nice if we'd gotten something like a 65% slow with -30 or -50 MR check, and I doubt SOE could call it unbalancing since bards do get something similar. Any bitching about slow should go in that direction, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My only real gripe with all the relative slow abilities is that BLs get a 1.7 cast time slow that is almost as good as mine.  I wouldn't even care if they gave druids an animal-only slow and mages an elemental-only slow.<br />
<br />
Why the hell do hybrids get a cast-time bonus anyway? What is the game-play rationale there?  If anything, it seems like they would cast slower than a pure caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well the way i see it, when it comes down to peoeple who want a slower.. shamans getting a tell :P<br />

we are the best slowers, else it wouldnt be our main thing, cant argue that :)<br />

people take others for slow if they cant get a shaman~ wuwu</div></div><hr />

Mmm, I've wondered about this too. The Pally 65 root is godly, 0.75 second cast, 75 mana, 1.4 minute duration, same -30 to resist as Greater Immobilise:<br />

Actually it isn't a &quot;root&quot; it is a &quot;stick&quot;<br />
