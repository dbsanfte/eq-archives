<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I personally think that rather than nerf a certain class, or boost a stat of another, perhaps there should be new abilities given to these classes to make them as uber as Enchanters who can command god-like creatures, Bards who are just...just... insane, the BeastLord who is the love child of a cluster-f3ck between mages (uber-pet), shamanseses, and monks.<br />
<br />
Throw out this avoidance, dps, defense crap.<br />
<br />
Example: Instead of...<br />
<br />
 &quot;Warriors have the defensive AAs, and... umm... lots of HP, let's not mention DPS...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors have lots of HP, defensive AAs, and [new idea that makes them viable for practical grouping/raiding]&quot;<br />
<br />
Or...<br />
<br />
&quot;Rogues are good at DPS... and... umm... DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
--&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rogues are good at DPS, and can also help out also by [blank]&quot;<br />
<br />
Now... you guys try to think of something that makes all those 'underpowered' interesting, at least. Something that would make people say, &quot;Hmmm... I can't decide between the Warrior or the Wizard... we already have an SK for a tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
Humorous or serious, throw some ideas out there. Just try to keep the ideas NEW... <br />
<br />
(note: DPS boost/defense boost is not new ;) )<br />
<br />
Examples by me...<br />
<br />
&quot;With the bellowing war cries of the warrior as an example, fellow companions are roused further for battle (+10% dps for all group members, or perhaps stackable haste?)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the Monk's agility and aptitude for avoidance, you take his example to aid you in your mitigation (+10% avoidance boost to all group members)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Immitating the stealth of your fellow Rogue, you feel much less conspicious (Decrease in aggro range of monsters for group members)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Shaman shares his bond to the spirit-world with his fellow companions (+max mana for group members)&quot;</div></div><hr />

However, I'm rather casual and haven't put a lot of thought into it.  There's probably a legitimate reason they don't recieve something like this, even though shadow knight and paladins get spells which do the same thing basically.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something that would be fun (read: never implemented) would be if the pure melees got a &quot;spell book&quot; that had &quot;spells&quot; they could &quot;cast&quot; and it used their stamina bar instead of mana.  It would give them something to do besides hit autoattack and the few melee extras (backstab/kick/bash/taunt/etc).  Maybe something for the next eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think of it this way: What happens when you have two tanks in a group?<br />
<br />
As a Paladin if there is already another Paladin in the group we work out who is tanking.  The tank-er loads out one set of spells to tank while the other loads out another set of spells to help out with utility.  I'm pretty sure two SKs would do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Now look at Warriors.  One Warrior tanks while the other....waits for the first one to die?  That is a poor way to go through EQ.<br />
<br />
All melee can stand next to the monster and turn on attack.  Hybrids can do more by adding spells.  Melee can only just do more of the same.  Unless that is &quot;super high DPS&quot; more of the same isn't helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spells for warriors?  Ok, so you only want hybrids in the game?  Give warriors spells then give hybrids more hp and abilities.</div></div><hr />

Not quite.  Hybrids do LESS from casting spells.  A paladin stunning puts out much less dps then just hitting autoattack.  Only one is useful.  After that, stacking another paladin does nothing but give you 20% less dps than a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But 100% more healing and crowd control than that extra warrior, you know UTILITY.</div></div><hr />

I really believe that if warriors get spells then hybrids should get warrior hp/ac/disc.  May as well make it &quot;balanced&quot;.  Warriors knew they didn't have spells when they started.  It's not something new.  I don't really feel for them that they don't have spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i dont mean spells like you're thinking.  I mean they have something, maybe enraging blow for warriors, that they can sorta cast and it eats all their stamina bar and they cant do any more &quot;spells&quot; until their stamina bar refills.  It would go a long way towards evening out the playing field for them with things like aggro.  Heck, it would make the stamina bar USEFUL for something other than jumping.<br />
<br />
Other things it could do would be maybe double damage on their next attack, increase the length of the next discipline by X value, take less damage on the  next /shield.  Just something fun that would make warriors or other pure melees more valuable than just their melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How about giving Warriors the ability to attempt to grapple a mob and basically prevent the mob or himself from doing damage, but leaving him with them both with reduced AC with a chance for for them to break apart each time they take damage. Giving a form of crowd control/mob delay to warriors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've often wondered what kinda effect it would have if Warrior had an offensive disc that could be turned on fulltime that would give them say a 20-30% increase in DPS ability at a loss of say 30% of their tanking ability, unlinked from their other disciplines.  Perhaps a big boost to dual wield, double attack, triple attack and a big penalty to all defensive skills like riposte, parry, dodge.  Thus in a roleplay sense the warrior is focusing his attention on hitting the mob by ignoring his abilities to avoid damage.  In essence turning a warrior into a near monk for damage dealing purposes.<br />
<br />
The idea being to make warriors stack at least somewhat in an xp group and on raids.  If you're not the MT, then you go into damage focus mode where you ignore your parry, dodge, etc skills and focus purely on dishing out damage.  If the mob turns on you then you can turn it off and concentrate on those skills again allowing you to quickly turn from monk-like damage potential to normal warrior damage and tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I can see right off the bat with it is that monks are pretty hosed already right now and this would make them even less desireable without some significant upgrades.  What those upgrades should be... I dunno heh.  Just an idea I had tossed into my head for warriors to make them a bit more versatile.  <br />
<br />
By itself it seems to me it'd help the stacking issues and perhaps desireability of warriors for xp groups, BUT it still wouldn't &quot;Fix&quot; them since their ability to tank in an xp group is trivialized by knights with comparable hp/ac and vastly superior aggro abilities.  It also fails to address the problems the other pure melee classes have.  Mostly, just something to give warriors a wee bit of versatility.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Truly Fixing warriors and pure melees in general is going to be a tricky road I think.  IMO, Knights are overpowered at the moment and need some drawbacks to their aggro abilities.  With the massive amounts of mana regen a knight can burn fast casting, low mana cost spells damn near nonstop for an xp grind creating insane aggro.  Up the cast times to increase the chance of an interrupt and thus at least introduce a chance at failure on those aggro abilities as well as increasing the mana costs so that they need to be used judiciously instead of non-stop... then we'd see a more balanced set of knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lowering the reuse time on AE Taunt would make Warriors a lot more fun to play. I mean... fifteen minutes? I'd like to see it more like three. Even with all the AAs it only gets down to 12. Wave of Prexus/Marr is basically an AE Taunt for a Paladin that heals in addition, and it has a MUCH lower reuse time than AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
Boosts to triple attack would probably be the easiest way to boost monk and warrior power, at least offensively. Monks just need to be totally re-examined.</div></div><hr />

And we had some discussions on using the sta bar for cool abilities.<br />

<br />
The problem with using the stamina bar to base these &quot;spells&quot; or &quot;special attacks&quot; or whatever you want to call them on is that there are spells in the game like Invigor that would basically allow Warriors to do these abilities endlessly.  All a Warrior would need is some priest class to Invigor them after ever fight (at a very low mana cost).  If they do decide to give them abilities like this, I think they should make it work off the mana bar.  Give Warriors 1 in meditate like Bards.  Mana regen items/spells would still work on them, so they could get a boost at higher levels.  The big problem with this could be warriors wanting to be in on the 100+ mana and FT items against casters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just fix warrior taunt.  That's all I ask.  I could care less about their damage output or mitigation, just fix freakin' taunt so that my Ele-geared buddy doesn't have to chase the ping pong ball after the chanter casts Tash 60% of the way through the fight.  Add on a &quot;speshul taunt&quot; or something, make it an AA-based skill, I don't care what they do as long they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think the one simple and easy way to make Warriors totally equal (and desired) in the group situation is to give them one new AA ability.<br />
<br />
Death Blow.<br />
<br />
The name sums it up.  Every attack the warrior delivers has a  very slight chance of being an instant kill.  However, this ability would not work on anything above a certain level.<br />
<br />
It should have 3 rankings, costing 3/6/12 to purchase.  The first rank instant kills anything under level 55 and has a 1% chance to succeed.  Rank 2 kills anything under level 58 and has a 2.5% chance to succeed.  Rank 3 kills anything under level 63 and has a 4% chance to succeed.<br />
<br />
Against mobs too high level for instant death, a proc of this AA ability would cause a double-damage critical hit.<br />
<br />
This AA would be under the Class AA's, requiring level 59 and the warrior's instant kill of running mobs archetype ability (can't recall the name) to be maxed out.<br />
<br />
Warriors kill things.  That is their one and only purpose in EQ life.  So, they should have an AA ability that allows them to do just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As to the worries of Invigor, just nerf it. Make it be a sta regen rather than insta full sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In response to Binter:<br />
<br />
Basically you want to give warriors a rogue ability and literally SUPERCHARGE it?!?!  Although the idea isn't ridiculous I suppose, your suggested percentages are WAY overpowered.  Dual Wield, Double Attacking warriors put out well over 100 attacks in a minute, so 1% is a damn good chance that no fight a warrior is in with an xp mob would ever last more than 1 minute, giving them utterly ridiculous DPS potential.<br />
<br />
As said before, higher DPS isn't really a fix for warriors anyway though.  Their main problem lies in their lack of taunting ability relative to knights.  A full time DPS boost to warriors would just make monks even more screwed up than they already are as well as encroach on Rogues main function... Dealing damage.<br />
<br />
Warriors main function isn't to kill things so much as it is to take the damage things deal out... Tanking.  Rogues and Monks are the pure melee who's specialty is dealing damage, warriors dealing damage is just a part of the formula for keeping the mobs focused on their self since they are best equipped to take it and live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was in an interesting LDoN group yesterday where we only had a ranger for a melee (it was a mostly pet class group with a cleric puller and our DPS and pull rate was insane).  The ranger would snare every mob we fought to cause aggro.  I could cast my biggest slow (the level 51 slow, I'm 53) and could immediately sit and med - and I never once got aggroed.<br />
<br />
If I'm with pali that stuns or an SK that DoT/snares or whatever...the chances of me getting slow/sit aggro are almost nil.<br />
<br />
If the only tank in the group is a warrior (or several warriors - it could be an armor of warriors) I can almost never sit to med and I will get slow aggro at least 50% of the time from casting.  Often times I'll root a critter just so I and others can med in peace in this situation.<br />
<br />
Simply put, warrior taunt blows.  They get no magical or otherwise special class abilities so the least they should have is a somewhat effective taunt.  It seems a bit ridiculous that hybrids can take and hold aggro with minimal effort and warriors have little chance of doing the same with the *taunt* ability.  &lt;shrugs&gt;<br />

Lack of taunt is a RED HERRING when talking about the problems of the warrior class. Im sorry.<br />
<br />
Maybe.. MAYBE I am just spoiled, but I havnt grouped with a warrior in like a year that had a real problem gaining or holding aggro from people who werent dumbasses. IMO TAUNT is not an issue, 9 times out of twn TAUNT is snap aggro and the mobs turn to the warrior. Hell half the warriors I group with ditch their aggro weapons and drop their aggro like 200% just to do more dps cause TAUNT isnt such a big issue for them.<br />
<br />
The issue is a complete and total lack of any utility at all. How can they fix it without making them knight-like? I dunno. Some of the ideas here were cool.. especially the grapple one heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunt isn't broken. It's more often a case of the people in groups not understanding the difference between agro and hate, and how they need to adjust their play accordingly. Most people, even at the higher levels of the game, are pretty clueless about those sorts of things, because they are not immediately obvious. You can go a long way if you play smart with the order and timing in which agro generating events occurr  ;). Warriors are better tanks than knights, and to compensate they have fewer tools for gaining agro. This means that groups with warriors as MT need to play with more skill than those that have a knight as MT. There is no way for VI to change this fairly. If they do, they will render knights pretty much obsolete in groups.<br />
<br />
Obviously those warriors at the high end of the game have equipment which makes their task a lot easier. This is what the real problem is - the people requiring the most skill are those least likely to have it ;). Consequently in those groups knights are far more favored (skill isnt required). At the high end of the game it is very different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One of the problems with EQ characters is their lack of a physical barrier to mobs.  In a 'real' fight, that big, burly warrior type guy is standing between you and the finger waggler, there is a 'physical' obstacle to overcome before you can bash that smurfing gnome to powder.  EQ's engine completely ignores the PC's 'physical' presence and allows the mob to ghost through the tanks if it gets mad enough.  A discipline that works like root (on non-ghost mobs), but focusses the hate on the warrior for a short time, would offset this lack of presence and give warriors something unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On behalf of the hybrid community: NO.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to be a hybrid then you should have played a hybrid.<br />
If you wanted to tank you should have made a warrior.<br />
<br />
And taunt only works ~60% of the time.<br />
<br />
And warriors don't have a problem with aggro, so long as the other 5 people know what the hell they're doing.<br />
<br />
The point is, those 5 people make up about 20% of the 55+ community. The other 80% don't know how to control aggro and will pick a knight over a warrior. This is why you see warriors talk about this. Because this is how it is for the majority of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just reduce most of the discipline re-use times by 75% (for pure melee).  Certain ones would have to stay the same for game balance like Defensive, but if the pure melees were able to use their offensive discs more for fun I think that'd give them a little more spice.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to have all disciplines be on separate timers (like AA abilities).  Warriors have a bunch of disciplines that are almost never used like Charge, Furious, Mighty Strike, Precision, and Fell Strike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found this comment incredibly amusing.  Taunt, which works about 40 to 60 % of the time against blue cons(less against higher cons) is snap agro 9 times out of 10?  You are right about one thing(sorta)...in a group with people who watch their agro, a warrior has no problem.  Trouble is that with a knight MA, people can not bother watching their agro, making for easier, safer faster exp.<br />
<br />
This means that groups with warriors as MT need to play with more skill than those that have a knight as MT. There is no way for VI to change this fairly. If they do, they will render knights pretty much obsolete in groups <br />
<br />
The first sentence is 100 % true, the second is 100 % false.  Knights would still be perfectly capable of tanking, and would bring other things to a group that a warrior never will, even if knights had the exact same agro generation as warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I know you guys are gonna slam me bout this, but I think alot about it. generally cause I'm on a pvp server. I would love to see classes get some serious overhauls, even if just for pvp. IE, warriors.<br />
<br />
My best friend is a warrior, lvl 65, with about 150 aas. His gear isn't all that great, some ornate, but mostly tov. He doesn't stand a chance against any class equally equipped, unless in very confined areas where there's nowhere to run. For this situation, I'd like to give warriors a hard-to-resist instant cast root/snare called Grapple. The target would have to be in melee range for this to work. This would at least give warriors a decent chance against someone. Have the snare last about 10 seconds and recast of maybe 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Bards, on the other hand, are seriously overpowered. They get nearly lure dots, a nice manatap, insane speed, insane resists, lure mez, cures, dispells, and good regen. There's nothing you can do about a bard that knows his class. He'll just dot/manatap you, and run away to heal if he gets low. I'd like to see it made so that a bard can sing only 1 song while running, but a normal amount of songs while standing still. This wouldn't hurt them in raid situations, as they hardly move anyways. But this way they wouldn't be able to get away quite so easily.<br />
<br />
there's other classes I'd like to see beefed up, and some I'd like to see nerfed, but these are the 2 main ones. I know it won't happen and it's just a dream, but they need to be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A few things;<br />
<br />
First, as someone else already pointed out, repeated parses have shown about a 60% success rate for taunt against blue mobs...less against even or higher mobs.  Taunt is definitely NOT snap agro.  I don't know what weapons you're friends are using for dps, but I use a WMBS and if I use it when I'm MA the mob ping pongs all over the place - even if the casters wait until the mobs at 80% or less.<br />
<br />
Second, having a warrior as MA in an xp or ldon group is much less efficient then having a knight MA.  The reason is the casters can do what they want when they want.  Most importantly, they can slow on incoming and sit to med during the fight.  This effectively negates the small hp advantage warriors have at the moment (an advantage % that keeps shrinking with the newer gear btw.)  For example, last night I was grouping in PoS.  The chanter couldn't slow until I got the mob into camp and took a few hits, otherwise she'd get agro.  So, I had to take a beating from an unslowed mob hitting for 400 to 500 a shot.  That extra damage far exceeded the hp advantage I get from being a warrior.  By the way, I use either a GSoT or the CHoS and SoBS combo for agro.<br />
<br />
Warriors are significantly underpowered when it comes to xp and non-boss mob encounters (which is 99.99% of the game for almost all of us out there.)  I love playing my warrior and I've got friends that I group with all the time (and I recently joined a great guild), but we all realize how much better the group would be if I'd made a paladin or sk instead of a warrior.<br />
<br />
By the way, I think the saving grace for most good warriors is the fact that most knights do not know how to play there class and use good team tactics.  I think warriors are generally better at this than knights because we are forced to prove our worth and forced to group most of the time (and therefore learn how to group better) whereas paladins and sks can be sloppy and still get by.  (anyway, that's another long thread...oh yeah, and before I get flamed by the knights out there  :p  ...I've played with a number of knights that know how to group and they are great...I just don't think they are the majority)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One of the problems with EQ characters is their lack of a physical barrier to mobs.  In a 'real' fight, that big, burly warrior type guy is standing between you and the finger waggler, there is a 'physical' obstacle to overcome before you can bash that smurfing gnome to powder.  EQ's engine completely ignores the PC's 'physical' presence and allows the mob to ghost through the tanks if it gets mad enough.  A discipline that works like root (on non-ghost mobs), but focusses the hate on the warrior for a short time, would offset this lack of presence and give warriors something unique.<br />
<br />

I like this idea!! Kinda like the warrior standing on the mobs toes, to keep it's attention and not let it go scampering off.<br />

1) Unlink the timers on the 51-59 abilities. * A * Thunderkick every 3 minutes? Woooo. Cower in fear as once every 180 seconds I POSSIBLY deliver a 159 point damage kick.<br />
<br />
2) Undo the AC Nerf. It didn't have the desired effect on the desired target populace. <br />
<br />
3) Itemize better. (IOW - don't be lazy). Why in the name of all that is abashi - er unholy are Monks and Druids on the same equipment? &quot;But they're leather wearers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hi - EQ has been around 4 years, I think you can do better. <br />
<br />
Yes they both wear leather, but one is a frontline damage taker and doer the other is a finger waggler. (When was the last time you saw a Druid swinging Leaf Blower or some other weapon?)<br />
<br />
4) Do not attempt to use AA's or equipment as a balancing factor.  Look at what got you into your current predicament, then dust off the old class descriptions and read those.</div></div><hr />
