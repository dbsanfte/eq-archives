<br />
&quot;search for 'marr' and 'envy/woe'<br />
give them to the spirit in wk<br />
repeat until you get 'your faction with truespirit cannot get any better'<br />
then do rakashiir&quot;<br />
<br />
just to skip the hole? I would so be up for this if it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I still don't understand why ppl want to skip the hole part.<br />
<br />
It's the most funny part of the Epic and since lvl50+ mobs can be mezzed / charmed, more trivial than before :p.<br />
<br />
Trying to MQ the tear part, I can understand, but the hole ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When the damn High Scale Kirn broken the root and he bring lots of ghost friends to visit us.........its tooks 3+ hours for another group to rebreak in and Rez time already passed(without knowing lv 1 halfing rog worship brell can drag all corpse from buttom to zone in.) <br />
It's a pain to find a pickup lv 55+ balanced group to go the hole to help a non guild shaman doing his epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did Kirn about a week ago or so with one group, 60 chanter, 60 cleric, 59 pally, 57 pally, 57 druid and me (57shm at the time, 58 now).  We just killed everything, in all 3 rooms, except for the other epic NPCs.  It was a very fun time crawling to Kirn.  My favorite part was being turned into a skellie repeatedly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you would have to do the steps upto envy and woe in order to repeat those steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So I've been told. But if things go wrong, bye bye tear, and hello, no sympathy from GM's.<br />
<br />
We had trouble with Kirn not being up, but finally he was..... Kirn's pet was up, but Kirn wasn't.<br />
<br />
Glad that part is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you do Kirn, be sure to kill his pet.  There was (not sure if it ever got fixed) a bug where the pet would keep him from respawning.  So if you kill him, do the next Shaman a favor and kill the pet.<br />
<br />
Yes, our epic quest is poorly designed and open to MQ.  I was tempted a while back to make a newbie Shaman and get him the epic - would probably get a lot of xp from the faction work, but I doubt if it'd be over 20th before being able to max it.  It'd take work and help from some friends, but it would show just how poorly designed the quest is, in that regard.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, if you are able to do the final fight, you're really not too far off from doing the entire thing, I think.  If you raid CoM &amp; the Hole, it'd take 3-4 groups of low 50's to do it, but only one group of near 60's for the same.  If you can't get a handfull of people to help with something like that, you probably won't ever see your epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ruuen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Say you do get a MQ of the tear....... is there going to be a lvl requirement for final turnin or just going to need the ally faction?<br />
<br />
Anyone know?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
