Familiar topic for alot of us: spell drop rates, über guilds, farming, and earning your stuff<br />
<br />
I encourage you to share your views with your fellow players, as we have debated this time and time again.  Give the beasts a hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One question,<br />
<br />
Will there be pudding for all?<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG are they complaining cause some uber rare spells were made vendor sold?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, a few are. Several hybrid spells on the emp table were moved to PoP vendors. Beastlords werent. They fixed this on tests, and a few of the ubers whined that they earned them the hard way.<br />
<br />
 Well whoopty ****. Some people didnt have to kill the golems in fear... I guess they didnt earn their epic huh? When I began smithing, ore didnt stack and I had to lug it from grobb to ogguk. I guess all smiths after me didnt earn their smithing. My sk leveled to 50 under the old hybrid penalty. I hope all you other sk's realize what worthless scrubs you are being pl'd be verant.<br />
<br />
Sheesh, come on.<br />
<br />
Sometimes things get changed easier. Sometimes they get changed harder. Its part of the game. Occasionally someone realizes that a few class defining spells for one specific class arent really entering the game and does something about it. These arent ancient spells, where ubers can still feel good about having something the rest cant have, but still function perfectly well without. This isnt the difference between having the best possible weapons and a lowly waning light katar/entwood mace. I agree, those who put in more time deserve better. But the rest deserve to function.<br />
<br />
A bl without these spells is very sub-par. Not the difference between a shaman with an ancient dot and a reg one, or a shaman with primal essence or without, but more like the shaman who never gets turgurs, or a cleric who never bought a post 29 rez.<br />
<br />
Put em in thorugh a quest similar to the sk lifetap spell (leech or whatever the hell it was called), put em on kunark dragons, slap em on a vendor, or give em free with your newby turn in note. The spells needed to enter the game in a better fashion.  As it stands, you could auction to buy em for 100k, and no one would sell. Because major guilds arent focusing on luclin now.</div></div><hr />

And sometimes SOE decides that anyone who invested time into a monk should have all their hopes and dreams destroyed by the biggest nerf EQ has seen in 4 years.  My ass is still sore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, I'm sorry you are a bit biased in saying this. It most certainly was not the biggest nerf in 4 years. It hurt for sure, but not the biggest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Monks did deserve to be nerfed the way the did.<br />
Ok before u start flaming think of this.<br />
With high ac a monk could tank non casting mobs easily.<br />
Could mend fd and pull damn well.<br />
Sometimes due to insane ac gear they were better than a warrior at taking dmg and they didn't need a taunt key since their dmg kept mobs on them.<br />
<br />
Yeah in places where mobs didn't cast a monk could easily be MT.<br />
That is why they were nerfed. Because they made warriors useless just like sk's are doing it now. and IMO they are next to be nerfed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The who got the biggest &quot;nerf&quot; is a joke.  Any nerf you can tell me I'll throw out 5 HUGE bonuses that class got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am against anything that takes away from my main function in groups.  I think it is rediculous that they have pimped out slow to the masses.  At least before I knew there wouldn't be too many BST with slow.  Now, they will all have it.<br />
<br />
I have already paid over 100k for spells.  When torpor, malo, and Q become vendor sold, I may have a different opinion.<br />

<br />
Bull.  Even with the old mitigation back and complete reversal of the nerf.  POP alone would have changed everything for the monk.<br />
<br />
HPs matter a lot in your tank in POP.  When a mob can spike a double 600 or tristrike or even quad, dear god you need hps to tank in POP.  <br />
<br />
Even without the nerf, balance would have been achieved because every other class took a step forward, or two steps forward in POP.<br />
<br />
Warriors: 1 step by the need for even crap taunt, and by need someone who can handle the damage<br />
<br />
Paladins/SK: 2 steps.  Dear god all casters got more out of spells<br />
61 to 65 then any pure melee class.<br />
<br />
Monks in Luclin needed a nerf.  Maybe<br />
Luclin Monks in POP setting didnt at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone here remember the patch message/?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh... Btw... Shaman Dots are now 50% less damage<br />
<br />
and oh and charm..... Opps... sorry... you werent meant to have that.... its gone too...<br />
<br />
Rubicite... bah... lets take that out... to much fighting over it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People can access most luclin zones while in pop one needs to be flagged sure pop changed a lot of things but outside pop monks outdid warriors against everythign except caster mobs that needed to be changed.<br />
<br />
It sucks that they let it slide to the point where a drastic change needed to be done but at the time the nerf came the problem was big with monk mana burn and mod rods.<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">60 monk with a few handfuls of AA(no PL till 57) retired.  All gear sold except what will not sell because it is specifically monk gear, and nobody wants a monk now, rendering much monk gear essentially valueless.<br />
<br />
51 warrior is already more useful.  29 hours spent total to a few bubbles into 51 -- with a little screwing around thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have always thought spells, especially core spells, that are insanely rare and end up costing a player loads of plat, is a complete screw-up on the game developer's part.  It seems lazy though, that they can't just move the spell drops to a different lesser mob and/or up the drop rate.   It may suck for those who spent the mega-plat for their rare spells and see them for a micro-fraction on an NPC vendor, but all I can express is *shrug*    <br />
<br />
As far as monks go, I don't think the Pacify spell was mentioned .   That has trivialized pulling in many, many areas.  To me, that is the biggest &quot;nerf&quot; monks (or any pulling class a guild/group would use) have had to face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't like it.  I think they should address kunark spels before Luclin spells.</div></div><hr />
