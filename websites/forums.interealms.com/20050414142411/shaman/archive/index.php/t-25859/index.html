<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for suggestions on what expansion might most interest me.  I'm almost always teamed with my wife, and most often only with her, giving us a 56 shaman/56 Enchantress duo.<br />
I suspect end game for us is to reach level 60 and get our AA's so &quot;high end game&quot; content isn't a factor.  On that note neither is anything that raiding will acquire as we don't ever intend to join a guild.<br />
<br />
The expansions that we currently have are <br />
Kunark<br />
Velious<br />
Luclin<br />
LoY<br />
and Planes.<br />
<br />
Are there any other expansions that have content that might interest us?  Any suggestions would be welcome...keeping in mind that I am the tank for our group of two...<br />
I have my magelo below - all bazaar gear but very good for our level I think.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Tronc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you'll be very interested in Omens of War.  The utility of charm kinda goes out the window, but the long range of personal advancement available is astounding.  Go ahead and reach for level 70.  AA yourselves up.  Really, explore.  The oldest dungeons still have some of the best adventuring there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree - Omens for the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Omens will open 3-4 areas for you to EXP in, as well as get drops for a bit of plat.<br />
<br />
with your level, Dranik's Scar should be average-light EXP, Harbinger's Spire, Noble's Causeway, and Bloodfields should provide a nice challenge for you.<br />
<br />
all of these zones offer nice drops that will help your characters along greatly. there are rare random drops that sell for enough plat to gear up and grind easily to 65+, and plenty of AAs along the way.<br />
<br />
if you come to be able to take out names, spell runes still go for 15-30k, depending on type. and the gear drops are nothing to laugh at. many of them circle around Elemental Quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tons of super fun duoing and soloing content in OOW, I'd definitely push for 60+ and start hanging out in the zones mentioned above.  Lots of fun stuff to see, do, and get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are there any other expansions that have content that might interest us?  Any suggestions would be welcome...keeping in mind that I am the tank for our group of two...What they are telling you about Omens is correct.<br />
<br />
The biggest weakness in your magelo is augments, introduced with LDoN and out of reach for those who solo / duo all the time.<br />
<br />
That's why I think you should consider Gates.  You can do Natimbi at your level, and pick up 20 hp augments for you and 20 mana augments for your wife.  There are a few other nice drops there as well.  You will get pretty decent experience there.  Sometimes it will be challenging with the adds, but with an enchanter to mezz you should be able to handle that.<br />
<br />
Since you are the tank, you need to work on your hp more.  Bag the Lodi shield for when you need enduring breath, and get an iksar hide cape.  Several of your pieces have available bazaar upgrades that will get you another 20 hp or so for that slot.  <br />
<br />
If you can get to 2700 unbuffed hp, you will be able to tank a lot of things that are iffy right now.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the information...it would appear that OoW is the one I should be looking at.<br />
Although Macnair brings up something I'm wondering about.  Augments...do I need to purchase LDoN in order to use augments that come in OoW?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know there are birdbaths (augment sealers) in Abysmal Sea you can use.  I don't think LDoN is required to apply GoD &amp; OoW augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">do I need to purchase LDoN in order to use augments that come in OoW?I am almost certain the answer is No.  <br />
<br />
The birdbaths (augment sealers) are at the adventure camps in Everfrost, East Commons, North Ro, South Ro, and Butcherblock.  You don't need to have purchased LDoN to get to those camps.  You should be able to open the container, put in your armor and augment, and click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you use custom containers in your UI, and the birdbaths don't work, issue /loadskin default 1 and then try again.</div></div><hr />
