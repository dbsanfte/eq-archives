<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question. <br />
<br />
What do you think would help with soloing more. A JBB or horse/regen bp combo. I could probably swing a JBB or a horse/iksar bp combo but not all 3. I am a 43 Vah Shir shaman with decent gear. I am thinking of switching to more AC versus wis and my defense and offense is maxed at 200<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JBB without a doubt.<br />
<br />
I am still leery of the advantages that horses offer at the moment.  The medding while standing/casting thing seems a likely candidate for nerfage and still do not increase your soloing power like a JBB will.  <br />
<br />
A fungi might help more than a JBB but is mucho more expensive.<br />
Iksar BP is nice, but not anywhere near as game changing as the JBB will be at level 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion, at your level, the JBB will help you a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">JBB, Hands down.<br />
<br />
While a regen breastplate is great, it won't let you kill stuff with almost no mana. at level 45, you still get good exp from things that are mid 30's in level.<br />
<br />
Buy a JBB, go solo kodiaks in the great divide, they only take 4 or so clicks to waste, maybe 3 if you use dogdog<br />
<br />
otherwise you could kill hill giants (roughly 2500hp) and earn some money, but the experience is kinda lousy at that level<br />
<br />
once you get the cash, go for the regen BP. I really wouldn't consider a horse a worthy investment unless you really have cash to burn. Most of the time I only spend 250 mana (turgurs) a fight anyways with epic/jbb... and I more than get that back when between fights healing back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah the fungi tunic, would that I could wear one. Vah Shir's only choice for high regen is the Fungus Patch vest from FG. Rarer drop then even the Tunic.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how much do jbb's go for nowadays?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw one for 11k last week on D-Ro.  IMO that's what the price range for the JBB should be: 8-10k.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Without a doubt get the JBB.  I flew from 45 to 54 thanks to it.  Im wearing a fungi and a JBB right now, and if I had to pick one to keep (for soloing purposes), I'd keep the JBB.  Manaless damage is a great thing that is hard to appreciate until you've used it.<br />
<br />
Will run you about 15k on solosek ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">8 to 10k? even 15k? :eek: <br />

Good to know..thanks!</div></div><hr />

My guess is it would go fast even at 22k on my server.<br />
<br />
Glad I got one when I did hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I ask for a PC on the Zeb server board and came back like 15k. Though, one person said that she saw one on the auction channel for 10k. I don't have quite 10k yet but have quite a few things to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">mez got all 3...  jbb / iksar bp / horse<br />
<br />
mez think jbb &gt; horse &gt; fungi &gt; iksar bp.<br />
<br />
fungi is nice but horse give massive mana recovery while blasting with the jbb ann yoo asked about soloing.<br />
<br />
when mez solo in outdoor zone mez almost never stop clicking da JBB and I use cloroblast more then canni III.  Mez slow and dot and click and heal and my mana recovery still tends to outpace my hp recovery.  A fungi would be nice but mez not have da cash.<br />
<br />
Nurfage::  count on it....  the horse is just way too powerfull.  outside solo mez think horse == 3 X Fungi or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So, for the horses, do the cheap ones provide the same mana regen as the expensive ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, there is no difference between horses with mana regen. If I had to choose 1 item first, it would be the JBB only because it's so much harder to obtain than the Iksar BP/Horse. I spent a good month auctioning on Terris-thule non stop for a JBB when I was on. Finally lucked out and got one for 20k. <br />
<br />
The Iksar BP goes for 5-7k, got mine for 5. It helps a bit with regen, but not a huge improvement. The horse on the other hand, I haven't named her ;) , but she is great! Killing for exp while my mana goes up ;) is really sweet! The little sitting regen I lose and all that extra food I eat doesn't come near the pro's of using a horse. It's just super sweet to not have to go up and down when I'm outside Cannidancing. Just so you know, I bought the 8399pp horse, el cheapo, and haven't regretted it.</div></div><hr />

But I understand nonetheless ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, JBB definitely.  Horse is a luxury item, and regen BP is a toy.<br />
<br />
As for horses being nerfed.  Honestly, I don't see it happening.  VI caters to the elite, and nerfing the medding while standing aspect would kill a large part of the desire for those with means to buy a horse in the first place.  Running speed alone is not enough to tempt someone to drop tens of k on a horse.<br />
<br />
Not saying I wouldn't put it past them, but I just think it's very unlikely that they would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Even if the horse is nerfed- you can sell it back to the vendor for around 85% of what you paid for it... so it's not like a nerf would mean a huge loss anyway.</div></div><hr />

From the horses mouth so-to-speak, although this Mr. Ed spoke back in January.<br />

I am considering purchasing a horse for a couple of different reasons:<br />
1. It looks cool <br />
2. You can meditate and engage in combat in outside zones.<br />
3. It makes you a little faster than running.<br />
<br />
If all three of these reasons hold true, I think I will buy one...but if reason number 2, meditating while fighting, is nerfed...I think I would rather wait and just use my AA points to get a Holy Steed.<br />
<br />
Thus, my question is this. Is meditating and engaging in combat an unforseen consequence of horses that will be nerfed or is it legitimate? This will weigh heavily upon my decision on purchasing a horse so I would appreciate a clarification on this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Horses were not intended to a character to meditate while fighting. That is indeed something we will be fixing in the very near future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Damn, I wish I had known that before I bought the horse. If that fix goes through it will totally make the 8400pp purchase a waste. I guess I better use this to my advantage and level as much as I can now while I have the standing meditate. I just hit 54 tonight too.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I knew it was too good to be true and understand why it would be fixed. But in my opinion, the horse wouldn't be worth 10pp to me if I couldn't meditate while standing/fighting.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up Oldshaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That was nerfed.  You used to med even while auto attacking on a horse, you no longer do to the best of my knowledge.  Been like that for about two months, I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you're on your horse and not moving or swinging, you med.  Casting doesn't count as moving or swinging- so you med while you cast (or JBB, or whatever.)<br />
<br />
If you move or swing, you don't med.<br />
<br />
If you have the horse model turned off, the same rules apply.<br />
<br />
This definitely encourages a root/rot or root/JBB style of play.  :)</div></div><hr />

There seems there is 2 issues here, medding while fighting and moving which has been fixed and medding standing? or whatever the position is called while on a horse that also allows you to cast while medding.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine it was ever in VI's plans to be able to cast and med at the same time no matter what position. I suspect that once they figure out  what in the code allows this and can change it without breaking something else that is obvious ( be assured that if they fix this Shaman will never be able to do Pottery) they will change it. I wouldn't bet the house or horse on it but it seems in line with this game's history.<br />
<br />
I smell another Fungi Stick in the making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bigguss it also supports the slow tank for your pet and JBB (no root) switch melee for JBB and you get to med. <br />
<br />
JBB is definitely better though. JBB makes a far larger impact on soloing than a horse. In a group, if you group outdoors, I still say JBB is more useful. Other than for Flawless canni-dancing of sorts it doesn't server much of an advantage now that slow aggro seems to be fixed (at least for me). <br />
<br />
The beauty is using both at once though. Both solo and grouped this allows you to do damage while medding up. Need to get mana, well canni up and then JBB, you gain as much mana casting it as you do sitting so why not.  <br />
<br />
BTW Nerun, I got JBB for 10k several months back, was not aware they had gone up that high on Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">another vote for JBB. i have fungi and jbb, but since I hit 45 i could sure do without fungi, it's just not that big of an issue now that you only spend mana on slow on each mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i really dont see horses being nerfed again.  as it stands, we are the only class that really reaps such large rewards from it.  <br />
slow, disease dot, epic, then jbb until mob dies, while it beats on me.  thats how i solo most effectively.  all the horse really does is reduce the amount i cannibilize.<br />
to reap the full benefits of the horse &quot;bug&quot;, you need a right click dmg item, and the ability to tank the mob your trying to kill.  No other class besides shaman can kill in this fashion, without turning on auto-attack.  <br />
think of it as &quot;risk vs reward&quot; from the programmers side.  or maybe work-vs-reward.  the horse effect helps 1 class kill a few more mobs per hour.   even with the horse, i get about an extra blue per hour.  certainly not what id call unbalancing.<br />
<br />
but as for the original post, go for the jbb.  a horse will do you very little good without one.<br />

<br />
While I agree that we are the only class that fights this way, we are not the only class that reaps benefits from having a horse while soloing. Wizards have it great with the EPIC/Mana Robe/Horse combo. They just EPIC rune themselves and Mana Robe themselves and all the while &quot;medding&quot; on their horse. The can get to FM in 3 or 4 minutes now instead of 10 minutes. Then head off to another quad kite. This more than doubles their kill per hour.<br />
<br />
And to answer the original poster's question...JBB for sure.</div></div><hr />
