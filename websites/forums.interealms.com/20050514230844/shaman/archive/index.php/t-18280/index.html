<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman 1-2 extra spell gems<br />
Chanters 1 extra spell gem,<br />
thanks for makeing the lives of every poor bastard who plays one of these 2 classes easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
that or start passing out SOME FRIGGING CLICKYS YOU CHEAP BASTARDS!<br />
<br />
<br />
druids, clicky root, soloable at lvl 20ish, usable well into the 50's.<br />
Clicky snare shield, cheap and common as hell,<br />
Clicky dot low lvl usable and also cheap and common.<br />
<br />
shaman, <br />
clicky nuke, lame dps and incredible cast time. good for about 5-10 lvls of your career. <br />
<br />
spells perma memmed <br />
Cani<br />
malo<br />
heal<br />
torpor/Q<br />
gate (for me anyway Zeks are like that)<br />
Root<br />
wow thanks for the 2 spell gems, one of which is almost perma BoS since I cant kill anything with out some sort of dps up.<br />
<br />
would a clicky Cani4 item that is EASY to get be so damn game breaking?<br />
how about clicky shrink? I mean god knows warriors deserve this item before shaman do. Clicky root off of something a little more common than Bot mini's?<br />
<br />
sorry for the inchoherance, its way early for me. I have played quite a range of classes, in my personal opinion shaman need more spell gems and or truly useful clicky crap, and chanters with their 4million spells to choose from could certainly use an extra gem as well. I mean compared to the other true caster classes, clerics load heals/nuke/da? wizzys load nukes and evac?   none of the other caster classes have the perma memed spell loads that shaman and chanters do.<br />
<br />
give us gems or give us clickies!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get by just fine with only 8 spells memmed and consider it strategy.  More would make my life easier for sure....but I get by just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We get a nice clicky root...  Granted, it's not until much higher level, and harder to get, but its there.  Trolls get clicky snare too, those lucky bastards. ;)<br />
<br />
Overall though, I wouldn't mind extra gems, but I can deal with it as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not all the trolls ........ I am following Cazic Thule, whish I knew before picking deity :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i never have gate memed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are in a tough spot because your on a PvP server so you always have to be ready, not sure about the rest of the bluebies but i do fine with 8 gems, since i dont need gate memed and can switch out root when needed.  Would it be possible for you to use a spellset with only gate in it? Thats what ive done, with a drogmor or horse meming the spell doesnt cause extra agro, and as long as gate is the only spell that has to be memmed it doesnt take much extra time, if im in trouble i just type /mem 3 and im gtg.<br />
<br />
Theres no way SoE would give specific classes extra gems, its just not fair to the other casters.  I would like to see pure casters get 2 more gems, but im fine with 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They should give everyone a bunch of extra gems that can only be filled in by non-healing buff spells.  Does not increase character power, but decreased tedium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love my clicky snare, its always either on my neck or in my bag.  I'm still using it at level 59.<br />
<br />
Months ago, I had a grass is greener moment and I rolled up a second shaman... this time an ogre.  I did this because I wanted to try putting my starting points into sta rather than wis, and because I valued the stun resistance over the natural regenration.<br />
<br />
I loved having the starting points in sta... I still value the no frontal stun more than regen... but I play my troll shaman because I could not bear to do without my clicky snare.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just get my FD ring somehow...<br />

I'm using it all the time at level 65 soloing Droga named. Works perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, its one of the &quot;just do it&quot; kinds of things. If you are on a red<br />
server then use a gate potion, or a shadowstep clicky. Use your imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That clicky snare is not a 100% reliable but I'ld sure rate it up there in the 90% range.  It tends to be a bit short duration but if planned out it works great.  If you wait though till they start to run then your just hosed.  I personally dont find it resisted any more then say root or any other spell we cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sir are a genius.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats the real problem, the insane amout of spell swapping involved playing shaman or chanters, even in ldon with gate dememed I swap a spell every few miniutes at the very least. with my chanter I frequently swap spells 3 times mid fight. <br />
<br />
sorry just me ranting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always have these memmed:<br />
Turgur's Insect  (given)<br />
Malos (some mobs resist too much without)<br />
Greater Immobilization (ghetto mezzing)<br />
Ferine Avatar (DPS gainer)<br />
Quiescence (for mana)<br />
Tnarg's Mending (back up heal)<br />
Cannibalization IV (for mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">An extra spell gem or two would be REALLY nice. Just enough to leave focus memmed and maybe boar. I get a buff request every 30 seconds it seems and for some fights, there's just not much space if you have a few heals and the major debuffs up. :( The new spellsets help somewhat but constant spell swapping still gets tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I play on a Zek server and i never have gate up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">although most shaman clicky armor sets dont compaireto alot of other classes we do get some useful clickie items ie black fur boots and epic. also having canni and vp aas generaly save 2 spell gems, particilarly vp and only cost 3 aa.  personaly i think i would prefer buffs that have durations matching those of kei and virtue or at the least having boar and the others last as long as focus...</div></div><hr />

8 slots is just fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, the more the merrier, but really we dont NEED any other slots.<br />
<br />
And as i generally say : You choses to play PvP on a game that isn't designed for it, now live with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Troll clicky snare stick in on golems in PoV, I am regular group's snarer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My typical spell line-up in a group:<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
Canni<br />
Root<br />
Malx or nuke<br />
Slow<br />
Group regen<br />
Open slot or dog<br />
Haste or pet buff<br />
<br />
Usually that one open slot I have is taken up by something else, depending on the situation (Like Pack Shrew for dungeons).  I get by fine switching out buffs with this, since I just do it after slowing stuff.  I usually just pull out regen or the open slot and it works fine.  Sure, 2 extra slots wouldn't hurt, but they're really not neccessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here's a solution.<br />
<br />
Pick a spell slot to devote to &quot;transient&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
Set up a bunch of single-slot spellsets putting just one spell into that slot.<br />
<br />
Set up a hotkey bank that does /memspellset followed by /cast &lt;n&gt;.<br />
<br />
Now you add a slight bit to cast time (since you have to sit and mem the spell) but you can cast all your buffs by clicking on hotkeys.<br />
<br />
If you like, do a /pause and another /memspellset to restore the spell gem to a known spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would just be happy if there was some way to move Ferine Avatar to a hotkey instead of a spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Posted by fifidong - 12-06-2003 at 02:12 PM<br />
I always have these memmed:<br />
Turgur's Insect (given)<br />
Malos (some mobs resist too much without)<br />
Greater Immobilization (ghetto mezzing)<br />
Ferine Avatar (DPS gainer)<br />
Quiescence (for mana)<br />
Tnarg's Mending (back up heal)<br />
Cannibalization IV (for mana)<br />
<br />
Same here, but I can drop Ferine avatar for buffs when group just started<br />
Nuke in last spot but opened for speeds, regens, and other spells needed<br />
Anyway, even if you don't have FA, that makes  at least 6 gems taken from 8 :/<br />
But even after that, I don't really know if I want another gem, cause I don't drop the nuke that often for another spell, if it was the case, then yes I think it would be needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">FWIW, casters on the test server had 10 gem slots for awhile.  At least we know that SOE has considered giving us a couple more.  No idea if it will ever make it to the live servers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My usual spell line up is:<br />
<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Q<br />
FA<br />
empty (buffs, nukes, or dots as necessary)<br />
empty (buffs, nukes, or dots as necessary)<br />
Turgurs<br />
Malos<br />
Canni 4 (sometimes switch this out for root or other debuffs)<br />
<br />
I don't feel like I need more gems and alot of the time I will actually have an empty slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">how about clicky shrink?<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413<br />
<br />
2 second cast, clicky group shrink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">EASY SOLUTION:<br />
<br />
MAKE Canni into a SKILL that does the SAME thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">errr.. that was addressed to the developers... if there are any</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">or u know.. how about a Blank Slot AA for 10pts per?<br />
Lets you store 1 spell into a SKILL button..<br />
<br />
I bet this is capable since there are SKILLs such as Cannibalization and Virulent Paralysis..<br />
<br />
I'd love to put Tnarg, Quiescence, and Canni IV into a hotkey for 30AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I get by just fine with only 8 spells memmed and consider it strategy. <br />
<br />
            Having very few open slot is not a strategic option ,nah ,it's just decrease the diversity of every class and make us to lazy to swap spell each minutes.</div></div><hr />
