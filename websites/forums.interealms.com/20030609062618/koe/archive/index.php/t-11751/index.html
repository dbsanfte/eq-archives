 <br />
 <br />
Stuff all that smoke back in and it will probably be ok.. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doh :(  Hope whatever it ends up being is cheap to replace bud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sorry to hear that Sarc, believe it or not that happened to a monitor of mine once.<br />
 <br />
G'luck fixing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I plugged the printer to my Commodore 64 into a different outlet than the one the computer was plugged into.<br />
 <br />
Turns out the two outlets were not on the same circuit in my parent's house and there was a slight variance in the voltage.<br />
 <br />
I actually saw SPARKS shoot out of the printer, followed by smoke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was at a customer's site that thought they were hit by lightning. I was checking everything out and looked like the power supply was fried. I was putting everything back together, and went to plug in the keyboard. and don't you know it, the power cord to the ATI modem looked just like the keyboard connector. A bunch of sparks and smoke later, they needed a new power supply and motherboard.<br />
 <br />
Oops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">smoke = bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hopefully its just a power supply.....looking forward to grouping with you again when you return.  It's been way too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, you let the magic smoke out. That is what is needed to make it work.<br />
 <br />
I had a network rack catch on fire once. I still remember that smell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah sarc, just what adel said. Computers run on Magic Smoke(tm).  PC techs will charge you out the wazoo to put it back in, but usually you can just order more online and do it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hope its something cheap and easy to fix bud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Folene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I once turned my boyfriends computer on to be greeted by sparks and smoke... scared the daylights out of me hehe. Turns out the lead thats connected to the power switch was touching the metal case too... took a nice big chunk out of the scsi hard drive... luckily it all still worked after the smoke had drifted away...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dalaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sarconus, I know the feeling, three days ago my power supply did the same thing.  Was zoning into the Bazaar and POP! BLACK SCREEN ...First thoughts were ...!!! When are they gonna fix that darn Bazaar bug!!!! Then I see and smell the smoke (the case cover was already off of course) rolling off the power supply.  Well of course this was and emergency...!!! off to CompUSA I go....and $108.00 and a couple of hours later and Im logged back in and heading to PoN for some magor EXP grinding. I would have been back on sooner but my wife absolutely refused to let me pull the PS from her new P4....and TEST...<br />
