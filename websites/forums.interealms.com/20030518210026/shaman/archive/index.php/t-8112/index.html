<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
Thanks for reading my (and hopefully answering) my post.<br />
<br />
I am approaching level 50 and need to start thinking about organising a raid for my Tear. Not belonging to any large guild I really need to know how many people im going to have to convince (threaten :)) to come along and help me raid. What other levels and classes should i think about taking along and what would be the minimum amount of people required.<br />
Once again thanks for your time, any feedback is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To get your tear, you need to break and do the mini-bosses of Fear.<br />
<br />
To do this, you need experience. You will have to practice breaking in and holding a corner of fear before you can even think about pulling a demi-boss. Fear isn't that hard (compared to Hate, etc), but it can easily lead to a wipe and a painful painful painful cr.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer your question - if this is your guild's first trip to fear, bring everyone. No less than 3 groups. A monk is a /must/, if only to retrieve everyone's corpses and warn when the door is clear.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Experience is the key to breaking fear... if you have never done fear, before you lead your guild there, tag along on another guild's fear raid. You'll get an idea of what camp 1 looks like, of how a break-in goes, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another way you may try is check the higher guilds and see who is doing Fear.  Than ask very politely if you may loot any tear that drops.  I got mine this way waiting for 4 hours though and watching a mage solo Cyndy.  Kept his pet buffed and read a book while I waited.  <br />
<br />
If your guild/friends are going to help, bring everyone with  you and the kitchen sink.  Good Luck.<br />

<br />
Did Fear a few times a week ago, due to CT respawning the zone I think we had a total of 4 of them left behind with noone needing the tear.<br />
<br />
PS - Have one I can MQ on Brell if anyone needs one.</div></div><hr />

You should join SCARAB (Society for Cooperative Allied Raids on Antonius Bayle) Sign up at the SCARAB Board (http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467) <br />
<br />
We are a group of people who like to raid, and don't have guilds that are big enough to do it, or in some cases don't raid often enough. We generally have 2 raids per week. We raid places like Hate, Fear, Kael etc. We also raid places for Epic quests. We're planning on doing the royals in Chardok on Wednesday for epics.</div></div><hr />
