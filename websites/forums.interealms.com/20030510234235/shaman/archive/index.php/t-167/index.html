<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Originally written about 2 years ago)<br />
 <br />
My father is Skol, blood-brother of Kylan O'Danos, and I was born of his tryst with a shamaness from Lake Rathetear. As is the custom of my kin, male children are given to their father to raise, and so I was to grow up in Halas and be named Rathelon, which means 'Of the Rathe Lake'. I was more than eager to take up the blade and follow my father into the ranks of the Wolves of the North when I came of age.<br />
<br />
Some spend their lives pursuing mystical insight, mine came quite by surprise when I was yet still a whelp among the Wolves. While hunting bear pelts to tailor into armor for myself and other young warriors, I mistakenly ventured too near a lair and found myself set upon by a entire den of angry polar bear cubs. The fight was furious, and seemed to last an hour, though more likely was only a quarter that length of time. As I strained to recall all my warrior training and downed the first of the bears, a clarity came to my mind, like the ice over a frozen river, and my limbs became light and moved as easily as the falling snow. I thought this must be the euphoria of battle that the old songs tell of, and I fought on til I alone stood among the corpses of the family of bears. During the battle, one of the bears had gouged my face and left me blind in one eye, but there were even more repercussions in store for me.<br />
<br />
My father didnt know what to make of my tale of the battle and the energy I tapped into, nor did Kylan. Only Shamus seemed to know of this, and he related his knowledge to me as he tended to my wounded face...the Tribunal, the Shamans of Justice, alchemy, and spiritual power. It was not battle rage, he told me, it was my spirit awakening to the magic I had within.<br />
<br />
And, so it was. I became a member of the Shamans of Justice, and follow the teachings of the Tribunal. I gave up my blade and learned the quarterstaff, since the Tribunal forbids us from dismembering criminals whom we send to the Divine Court. I was given the name Steelbear because of my warrior past, which has always driven me to seek fray of battle to deliver punishment in a more personal manner, much to the chagrin of my trainers.<br />
<br />
So goes my tale, and now I wander Norrath and beyond, sent out to forge my way and establish my Clan, but always an instrument of The Tribunal, dispensing justice and retribution upon the wicked as my sacred duty.</div></div><hr />
