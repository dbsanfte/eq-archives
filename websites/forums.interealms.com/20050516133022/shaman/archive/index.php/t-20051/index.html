<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MoMoNeY8720</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is a instanced zone a PvP zone? Can someone please explain to me what it is? Thanks.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and yea im thinking about coming back to play my 65 shaman again so thats why im asking. Also is the expansion a good thing or a bad thing to the game in your opinon? And any good new things for shammys or things that just sucked for shammys with new expansion would be great if you could tell me also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Instanced is like taking one zone, and duplicating it over and over, so each group gets it own independant one to fight in IIRC.<br />
<br />
As to how the new expansion is - I'm retired, but I'm sure others will be able to fill you in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah what Garf said.  You get an &quot;expedition&quot; (in GoD, &quot;Adventure&quot; in LDoN).  When your group zones in, you have the entire zone to yourself, noone else there.  Other groups get their own instances, so there's no competition or anything.<br />
<br />
GoD expansion is pretty useless atm unless you're in a high end raiding guild.  The trials things aren't bad if you've got a decent group of folk, but I've yet to have any items drop at all in this expansion, though I've seen some nice ones linked that are supposedly 1 groupable.  If you aren't 65 100+ AA and in a decent guild / group of friends, you won't get much out of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In Expedition # 6, the named (Bow-using MOB) dropped a chain bracer. I was with 5 members of the top guild on Xev (Harmonium) and the Shaman in the group seemed pretty excited about it. (110 + hp, 130 mana, boatload of stats. (May have been 150 / 170 not sure)).<br />
<br />
I got VERY lucky and picked up a + 30 HP, + 30 mana AUG (ANY slot)(LORE /e rude Sony) off of the named Krag Beast on the same run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FYI, those links for the random sewers drops don't work.<br />
<br />
How rare are the drops in the sewers?  We've done the sewers adventures (first 2) about 10 times total, and never had a single thing drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jaradis:<br />
<br />
&quot;All of these can be gotten by a single level 65 group in Ferubi&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that a group of level 65s with equipment &amp; AAs equal to yours or a more &quot;normal&quot; group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A reasonably equipped group should be able to kill those named.  They are yellow cons, don't have a whole lot of hp, and don't hit too hard.   With a warrior that has decent gear he may need to use defensive but it still should be doable.  I would rate them about as hard as the named in an LDoN hard mission, maybe a bit less.   Our groups pretty much destroy them.  I can only suggest you go try, they spawn very often (30 mins or so?) since the loot is no drop and lore you can't really farm them forever.  Maybe take 2 groups if you are uncomfortable with just one.   You can make a full night of killing in there for very good XP and loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I noticed that I don't have the item numbers for the sewer items in my database yet, thus the links don't work.  I've been so busy on the raid level items for our system that I haven't had time to put a lot of work into the non-raid zones yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To answer your first question, instanced zones are not PvP (unless you're on a PvP server). They are just zones that are triggered for a specific group or raid, which only that group or raid can enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A little random advice that I picked up trolling around, in case you plan on going item hunting.<br />
<br />
If you're attempting the harder trials, try and take a warrior for your tank. The SK board is up in arms about how, as one poster described it, a VT equipped warrior can tank the named in their sleep(with def disc.), while a PoTime+ geared Knight stuggles like hell to stay alive (high damage quad spikes will eat them alive).<br />
<br />
The thread can be located here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=20168), but be warned, there is some serious hate flying around :rolleyes:. I believe on page 3 Brael posts a log with DPS measurements.<br />
<br />
If anything I posted is wrong please correct me, I haven't experienced ANY of this personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well from what I recall of your last postings. Unless you have made a LOT of gear upgreads. Do the players on your server a favor and STAY OUT of GoD. A lv65 shm with lv30 gear and half of his lv51-60 spells let alone the 60+ spells. Will not cut it in GoD.</div></div><hr />

To be clear it's to Momoney8720. Look at his other threads. Lv65 useing lv49 dots gear that put my jaw on the ground. Actully now that I think about it he showed up right about the same time that Yantis was selling custom made chars. Chars that came into life at 65 with no gear and spells only up to lv49....Hummmm<br />

Its possible to get around that by copying the name of the item and pasting it into the searchfield on the Lucy website.</div></div><hr />

        You know that all these random trash mob drop would be nerfed in few ,if it was not already nerfed yesterday. It's after useally a month after release. It obvious when trash mob drop better loot than named.<br />
<br />
          About ferubi it not easy at all ,at least for pre vt group . Repop is pretty fast and there lot of wanderer ,but the worst is when roamer warp on us because the zone is still bugged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunatly, Ferubi is not for the pre-VT geared.  Sony really bumped the requirements for this expansion gear wise.  I'd say you needed a minimum of VT+ gear to xp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Then again, if you don't have great gear, this zone is a potential raid zone for 2-3 groups that could yield you some on par or better than VT without any long timesinks. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is that a group of level 65s with equipment &amp; AAs equal to yours or a more &quot;normal&quot; group?<br />
This is my friend's Magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=838373) who I party with whenever I can.  She tanks stuff in elemental planes.  She tanked stuff no problem in Ferubi when we went there.  Her profile is mostly filled with bazaar bought stuff, a bit of ornate, and a bit of elemental plane mini-named loots.  Bring a competant healer, a tank with at least ornate armor, a good slower, and a good CC artist, along with 2 dps and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes ,we can exp here with pre VT gear but we don't expect to be able to kill these named with one groupe( except the elit ,they're not really named). And trash loot have been nerfed(which is very logic) in my sense.</div></div><hr />
