<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've given up on groups at this level, the only place anyone hunts on my server is ldon, and there's far too many retarded people for it to be worth it, many times after a pickup group i end up with less xp than i started with, so i'm stuck soloing for now.<br />
<br />
anyways, i've been doing the skeles in DL, and it's about 1 yellow per hour (with kei), which isn't horrible, but i'm trying to find someplace better, i tried taskmaster in EC, and poachers in JP.. and xp there was about the same, are there any camps anyone can suggest that will be faster? i don't care about loot, all i want is the fastest xp possible (trying to catch up to some friends who are all 60+ :P)<br />
<br />
i have *ok* gear.. about 1780hp and 800ac selfbuffed (defense skill is still only 175).. and 205wis w/ kei, i also have a horse and soulstripper, no jbb.</div></div><hr />

You get about 4-5% per solo kill in Nadox up till level 49. I stayed there till level 51 because I was still gettin 2-3% per kill at 50 and 51, and around 8% off the named that spawns there...the link above will explain pretty much everything you need to know about soloing the camp</div></div><hr />

While you're in DL, run over and clear out the 2 Yeti caves.  Clear the Skellys, then run to the 1st Yeti cave, clear it, then run to the 2nd Yeti cave, clear it, repeat ad nauseum!   :D <br />
<br />
That will probably double your XP!  no downtime waiting for respawns!<br />
That'll get you to 51 fast.  XP slows down a bit then, but still good till 53.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think at 47/48 I was killing the Spirocs in TD, and I did this up to 49/50 if I recall correctly.  Most of the time they were not camped on my server, and there was only a few times that I saw they were.  Usually it was a wizzie or druid that did not know how to kite.  Was entertaining.<br />
<br />
The spirocs do tend to hit fast, and there is one that is a rogue.  Be careful that you do not turn your back on him.<br />
<br />
Loot... well, it blew, but I was looking for xp and not loot.<br />
<br />
To get to TD, I hopped on the boat from Oasis, and jumped off at the first stop.  Once I was on shore, I would turn left, and run until I saw the bird tower ( a meaner version than in South Karana ).  I would call Rover, buff him, and I would pull birds to the shoreline.  There were a few times in which I got adds, but they were easily rootable.  Heck, you could even bind on the island, use your Spiritstone to port to Halas - run to PoK for kei and back again.  At the time, I did not have a Spiritstone, but the possibilities with that little piece of goodness.</div></div><hr />

Spiritstone has a required level and won't work until level 51. :( <br />
Good information on the Spirocs though.  :) <br />

Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">spirocs... best exp ever at 49. i got 49 to about two yellow into 50 in 2.5 hours, you can't beat that anywhere. just grab a KEI and tear some mobs up. dot the birds up and sic dogdog, they drop fast. ebolt shreds their hp fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been getting about a yellow an hour in Dulak, and that's probably going to pick up today after I get Ebolt and Plague.  I've just been grinding away on Stormwave and getting great gem drops along with the xp.</div></div><hr />
