<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrotherBorder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Apologies if this is not in the right place.  <br />
<br />
I picked up an iksar childs tear for a guildie the other day when I was in fear so I could &quot;MQ&quot; it to her (not strictly multi questing I know, but for lack of a better term).<br />
<br />
I started the shaman epic with sneak so I could get my faction up.  I can get 1 faction hit at a time doing the first part of the quest over and over, but I was wanting to know if this was a pointless exercise?  Is it possible at all to get my faction high enough to successfuly do the hand in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try the quests board.  there have been several discussions about the faction needs at each step.  To hand in the tear, you must be ally - many say max. ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sendaor^VallonZek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can MQ the tear but you need to be max ally, only shadowknights are on the same epic-faction as us shamans (truespirit faction)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wont work.  Only a shaman can raise true spirt faction and as Baz stated you need to be around max ally to hand it in to rak'ashiir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sendaor is correct.  A epic'd SK can MQ it if they haven't trashed their faction.  SK's have to be on truespirit faction to get their epic completed, just like shaman.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Isn't the point of the SK epic to lower their truespirt faction?</div></div><hr />

Go whack the guy in RM who drops Woe and Envy. Turn them in to the wandering spirit in EK / NK ?<br />
<br />
Also kill the Pirate in OOT and talk to the spirit who spawns. Turn the gem into the drunk in FP.<br />
<br />
* IF * either of those work, I think you can raise your TS faction to   MAX  ally.<br />
<br />
I know there was a Necro (iirc) who got the Dire Boots, but he couldn't activate them. That leads me to believe anyone can interact with the wandering spirits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BrotherBorder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting.  I'm wondering if there is a cap on the truespirit faction though.<br />
<br />
I can hand in the gem to the shaman in NFP when sneaked and I get a faction hit.  But it's not gone up at all from dubious.  I'm a monk of Quellious and my Cabilis faction is capped at indifferent, where as an agnostic human monk can get a higher faction rating than mine in Cabilis.  <br />
<br />
This necro who got the sow booties, do you know who?  Or where did you hear about this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The faction bumps applied when completing the early portions of the quest are faily tiny.  If this will work at all, you'll have to do them so many times that your shaman friend will probably have already had 2 or 3 opportunities to get a tear of her own...<br />
<br />
<br />
sepsis - it's my understanding that a SK that has nearly completed his epic will have ally or near ally faction.  However the final fight / turn-in for their epic turns them KOS to True Spirt.  This is done to prevent SKs from easily requesting a portion of the epic that results in a rather nice BP (which is turned in later in the quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wizard epic is also truespirit faction based. There is a part of the wizard epic where you donate some pp (1000 pp) to a guy for the sole purpose of raising your truespirit faction. Not to mention, there are some other errand type (Like take this to soandso and bring back what he gives you in return) that raise truespirit faction.<br />
<br />
I think when SK completes their epic, they take a faction hit to truespirit. A friend was explaining it to me. They get a decent BP as part of their epic, but they have to turn it in at the end, and loose faction, and cant go get another easy.<br />
<br />
I believe everyone starts out dubious to truespirit, and every class has to work up from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am only saying this on someone else's word. There was a friend that looted the tear, he was going to mq it for another shaman in guild. I told him since he wasn't one of the classes that normally have Truespirit faction he would have to get ally Truespirit before even trying the mq. He said he worked up his Truespirit to ally and got the tear ate. I myself being a shaman have mq'd the tear a few times and worked no problem. Ally should be ally as far as I can see, and I have turned in the tear when Rak was on the rampage, being moved and it worked, but obviously something caused it not to work for him. Anyways hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah the wizards are on true spirit too.  I looted a piece of the wizard epic off VS for possible MQ months and months ago because I knew I would have max ally Truespirit faction.<br />
<br />
We don't have anyone who needs it yet so I haven't go to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Completely off topic I know, but does this mean a Shaman could MQ any part of the SK epic? If it's MQ'able that is. My friend mussed up his Outpost faction (hunting in KC a little longer than he should have) and can't get in to start his epic. At first it didn't seem a problem because he could've used the invis-trade bug... which they just fixed.<br />
<br />
But yeah... anyone know anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A Couple notes on Truespirit faction (From the research I've done as an SK preparing to try the Epic):<br />
<br />
-SKs are on Truespirit Faction, but in the course of the SK Epic, we pretty much go from low apprehensive to high apprehensive, and I believe none of the Shaman Epic mobs will interact with us at any point cuz our faction is so low, so SK doing Truespirit MQ'ing for other classes is just as hard as other classes, to the best of my knowledge.<br />
-At the end of the SK Epic, our Truespirit gets a major hit, usually dropping the SK to Scowl unless they've done some extra faction work. <br />
-One SK I know accidentally killed a Wizard Epic Mob and got scowling to Truespirit. He actually ended up having an Enchanter charm the lesser spirit, got the gem, had the Enchanter charm the Drunk in NFP, handed it in, rinsed and repeated a LOT of times, and eventually got his faction back to Apprehensive.<br />
-Also, Kurron Ni Himself is on Truespirit, and no-one assists him when he attacks, and it doesn't stand near any OT mobs. I would imagine one could pull him out of the outpost so that a KOS SK could still do the turn-in.</div></div><hr />

make him/her ally to lord rak, confirmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sliths</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember when leveling an iksar beastlord that the spirit responded to him. I believe when VI made the other beastlord races (except Vah Shir) they took the less challenging route and put the beastlords on the same faction tables as a shaman of their race. That having the effect of making truespirit start at the same as a shaman. So with work a beastlord should be able to raise theirs to max ally...unless VI fixed this.</div></div><hr />

Just curious Ahaman are you confirming they can ally themselves or that they can ally themselves and mq the tear? Read my above post as to why I ask this. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">im confirming epic enc can make themselves ally to lord rak only. 2 epic enc of my guild have the tear on bank, i will test the MQ part and report later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to be anal (SHADDUP) but I think you mean Collaboration. Alliance is the level 8 faction mod spell and give + 1 faction hit (or so).<br />
<br />
Collab can give up to + 3. (I get some wierd results on my alt).<br />
<br />
By + 1 &lt;-&gt; +3 I mean from Threateningly to dubious or threateningly to Indiff.</div></div><hr />
