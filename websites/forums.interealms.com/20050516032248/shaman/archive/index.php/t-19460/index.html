<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merwenn0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=1&amp;mid=1075435996761751677&amp;num=0) : &quot;I saw this on the safehouse.  It says what I was trying to say earlier, but far better than I put it. I'll post it below, but here's the link as well: <br />
<br />
http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29404.topic <br />
<br />
Here's the post by Jinex22: <br />
<br />
You might remember someone's post awhile back explaining that there were dupes inflating bazaar prices in the game. <br />
<br />
You might remember that shortly after this, SOE patched and posted they were working actively on fixing the problems. <br />
<br />
You might remember that after this, things seemed to stabilize for awhile. Prices in the bazaar started to become more reasonable so that players could actually begin to buy some toys without being forced to buy duplicated or exploited platinum from Yantis or exploiting it themselves. I mean, let's be serious here. 150,000 platinum or more for ornate armors? A normal player will never be able to afford that. 500,000 Platinum or more for a white dragon helm? Same problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, you may have noticed that again, prices are increasing in the bazaar to insane levels. Ornate is again up there at 150,000 + for the pieces that anyone wants. The cool items are again running way too high on the pricing end. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enter in two new issues. I will not explain details of where or how to get anything in this post. I will explain the problem, though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Number one, as most know that have read other various posts on the issue and online news sites. IGE and My supersales have merged. Each side used to combat eachother on platinum prices for real world money. Each side's main opponent was the other. Now, they have no competition, and thus the only hurdle is how to control the platinum market. <br />
<br />
<br />
Platinum for real life sales is controlled by supply and demand like any other market. Supply here is simple. IGE and My supersales has a dedicated team of professionals specifically employed to hack, crack, cheat, dupe and macro. Basically their job is to find any and all ways to get excessive amounts of platinum easily or for free using loopholes or bugs in the game. These are paid individuals hired specifically to, in essence, cheat YOU. <br />
<br />
Look at My supersales offering level 1 to 65 and 300 AA in 24 hours some time ago. They yanked this when customer accounts were getting banned and people were issuing complaints when their $1500 purchase was deleted overnight, and sometimes their main characters as well if registered on the same credit card. Remember the post by SOE and the patch that fixed this? <br />
<br />
Look at My supersales listing up billions of platinum on every server while simultaneously refusing to buy platinum from anyone. Remember the post by SOE and the patch that fixed this? <br />
<br />
It has reached that point again. The prices IGE and My supersales pay for platinum is extremely low, and they say they are &quot;full&quot; when you try to sell to them in quantity. <br />
<br />
<br />
They have an unlimited supply line. Dupe or macro or exploit or whatever, that platinum they have is &quot;free.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was rumor posted by another individual here, saying that my supersales had received thousands of free EQ accounts through Ubisoft. They give out free trial accounts to any email address. Yahoo, hotmail, etc. When the last dupe was in they banked millions on every account and let them expire. When SOE banned off the exploited platinum, these expired accounts were not checked, and now when platinum is needed they are renewed for $15 and the plat is pulled from them for use or sale. <br />
<br />
Because whatever plat they get, and how they get it is free, they can price it extremely low. Low enough to push out remaining competition for them, unless that competition has access to the same exploits. <br />
<br />
But there's a problem. People only need so much platinum. Now, it does no good for IGE or My supersales if their plat is priced extremely low so people can buy alot cheaply, because that just means the customer will be able to buy all the stuff they want faster. <br />
<br />
So they need: <br />
<br />
More customers. <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
In game inflation on items. <br />
<br />
<br />
More customers is way too hard to control. But in game inflation, for an entity with access to ulimited free currency, is very very EASY to control. <br />
<br />
So, number two, <br />
<br />
There is a program out there currently that does the following: <br />
<br />
<br />
You set up a character in the bazaar and set price points for items you want to buy. So... I want to buy all white dragon helms that are up for 300k or less. <br />
<br />
I set this program to white dragon helms for 300k or less and when someone puts one up for sale for, say, 275k, it warps right to the vendor, buys the item, and continues searching. The program runs 100% free of human interaction, so all that is needed is one person to restock the plat on the characters when it becomes low (it will even make the PC beep when it is low). <br />
<br />
<br />
You can set it to search for anything. You can make a list of 5,000 things and it will search for them. <br />
<br />
What happens is any item they put in this program fixes the price at whatever they put it at. Since within SECONDS it will buy anything put up for less than their fixed price. <br />
<br />
---HERE YOU HAVE INFLATION 100% CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE WITH ACESS TO THIS PROGRAM AND ACESS TO THE UNLIMITED PLATINUM--- <br />
<br />
The program exists. EQecon.com uses a similar one to find all server prices for their site. You can't get the program from them. I merely list it here for an example of a legit site that uses the basicsof the program for non detrimental means to prove it exists. And I know IGE and My supersales will have people come here and post up that all this inflation is due to Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Please, the playerbase is far more intelligent than that. <br />
<br />
<br />
If they have unlimited plat, and this program, why don't they just buy ALL high level items that show up in the bazaar? Items are a hard sell and platinum is an easy sell. Price fixing causes people to NEED more platinum, increasing their sales. If they bought up all high level items there would be no need for people to buy platinum from them, as people would have nothing to spend it on. It would also make it glaringly obvious, and they get enough bad attention, and likely do not want more or do not want this thing getting nerfed. <br />
<br />
Why do they only control the high end prices? Simple, that is what people buy plat from them to buy in game. People don't buy 500,000 platinum from them to go in and buy a bunch of 2,000 plat value items. They want the things that are 100,000 +. They are, to put it bluntly, screwing people who do not buy plat from them, but ALSO screwing people who do buy plat from them, forcing them to buy more and more. <br />
<br />
The end result here, is total control by IGE and My supersales on the in game economy. TOTAL. And it will continue until it is stopped. The prices on in game items will keep going up a little bit at a time as they artificially raise. In the last couple of weeks ornate and other high end prices have gone up 80% or so. Expect more of the same as long as this is allowed to go on. <br />
<br />
Your game, your enjoyment, your fun, is being controlled by these individuals. At the moment the in game economy is controlled more by them than by all the players and SOE combined. <br />
<br />
It is possible SOE does not even know about this. Or if they do they are not doing anything about it because the players do not know and are not complaining. <br />
<br />
Now you know. If you do not care, that's fine. If you do care, tell a friend and tell the makers of Everquest you want this stuff fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
hmm</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Sony was serious about Yantis and IGE, all it would have to do is buy accounts from them and plat, record the days and character names and;<br />
<br />
either delete those accounts, to the point that sooner or later Yantis/IGE would have no more mules to do this with...<br />
<br />
or launch a lawsuit.<br />
<br />
The fact is Sony hasn't done either, and you can bet your bottom dollar they have discussed this problem at length and what to do about it.<br />

The original thread topic is very disturbing to me, and it is things like that (known bugs/cheats/exploits going unanswered &amp; unfixed) which are doing more to cause me to consider quitting EQ than any class balancing or other issues in the game right now.<br />

  And have you EVER looked at the upper right hand corner of the main board pages?  They have had an ad there for a while now so you probably shouldn't have even made this post according to your philosophy, and there have been a great deal of posts regarding the fact that the ad is there, so if you read general section much you shoulda known about it by now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I must be missing something.  If an item is put up for sale in the Bazaar by someone unrelated to IGE (or any other similar agency) and IGE buys it providing it is less than a certain price, doesn't that person still get their money?  IGE may try and resell it at a higher price, but as long as the original person selling does so at just below IGE's magic price, he will maximize his return in very short order.  Now, since the person who originally sold the item has the money in his pocket, he can go out and do what he likes with it.  The money is in the economy and circulating.<br />
<br />
From the economy's point of view, how is it any different that an item is purchased with duped or macroed plat by IGE than it is by anyone else?  If every person who purchases plat from IGE instead ran the macros themselves, how would this change the in-game economy one bit?  There is more plat in the game which means that it's buying power is lower.  This drives in game prices for items up.  It also means that the real-life cash price to purchase plat itself goes down.<br />
<br />
The amount of curency in the game is always increasing.  There are far fewer consumables being purchased (food, arrows, spell components, etc.) taking plat out of the game than there is plat entering the game by way of currency loot and high priced vendor junk.  For the first few years of the game, new and better dropable items coming in at the top end drove prices on older equipment down even though the buying power of the currency has been decreasing from day one.  Since the amount of currency in the game has increased so dramatically recently due to exploits and cheats the balance has been thrown askew.  If the folks who in-game sold items and currency for real-life money were not also cheating, there would be no issue. <br />
<br />
As to SOE doing nothing about it, I think they are making some subtle attempts to remove money from the game.  Horses took a significant chunk of currency out of the game when they were introduced.  Skilling up on tradeskills can take a significant amount of money and they are introducing a new tradeskill interface which could increase the number of people dumping currency on to vendors (where it disapears) to attemp to improve their tradeskills.  The casino was a good idea to pull money out of the game, particularly if it returned NO DROP items, which effectivly have no intrisic value.  Again, however, for these measurs to be effective, there cannot be unlimited amounts of currency entering the game due to exploits and cheats.  They have to fix the original problem before they can resolve the issues that arose as a result.</div></div><hr />

I think there are black helicopter in the game to! The other day, a friend of my brothers aunt's uncle saw it!<br />
<br />
Enough with the conspiracy, they can only affect your game if you let it. If it's droppable you can go get it yourself, you don't have to pay a single copper for ANY of it. <br />
<br />
Let Yantis et al do whatever they like, if your shortcut to buying not camping is not an equitable purchase for you then fire up a group/guild/raid and go get it.<br />

Ok way i read it is that Yantis etc buy the item with duped plat then destroy said item thus taking it out of circulation.<br />
Then the item over time will become a lot more expensive due to rarity thus people will go out and buy Yantis' PP.<br />

I still don't see the problem.  The person who looted the item got his money.  The money is still in circulation.  Whether the item is destroyed, sold for real life cash or simply worn by the purchaser forever doesn't make a difference to the EQ economy.  High end items have to be available for sale for there to be any market for selling platinum.  Buying the platinum is only one option, people can always farm it (or use the cheats themselves).<br />
<br />
Duping the platinum lowers its inhering value.  Selling it does not.  Remove the in-game exploits and most of the problems go away.</div></div><hr />

/e wonders if this poster is a Yantis bot.....<br />
Anyway in all seriousness, the problem is that say a White Dragon Helm sells for 100k on your server......this Yantis/IGE bot program searches bazaar for all of the helms and buys them up; eventially, this bot has a near monoploy on the market on the helm, heck all ornate molds too, and BoCs, Fungis, SoD, etc, etc.... and you now have to play premium plat costs for these items, going from 100k on the helm to say 200k.<br />
It does make a difference to the economy where the plat comes from; basically free plat is a huge problem and causes this sort of inflation......look at some RL historical problems where this sort of thing has wrecked economies; in Germany post WW I they were paying retribution payments to other countries for starting WW I and it was bankrupting them; to help &quot;offset&quot; this Germany started to print MASSIVE amounts of paper cash, with no real gold or property to back up the cash, thus making it essentially worthless; it was so bad that you would need a wheel-barrow full of cash to buy a dozen eggs. EQ isnt far from this sort of picture; sure its a virtual community, sure no one in RL is going to be hurt if the high end toys start costing 2-3x as much plat as they used to, but it ruins the fun for 95% of the player base that doesnt have access to endless plat, wont use dupes/bugs or that refuse to buy plat/toys for RL cash.<br />
Anyone that believes that there was no problem a few months ago with prices being out of whack, then have a look at how prices are on Karana now.....4-5 months ago a Fungi tunic was average of 50kish-60kish plat, with the average on the high end, the plat dupe introduced a FLOOD of cash into the market, making them now go 90k assuming you find one for sale. The economies are wrecked and due to this tons of duped plat that Yantis and his cronies obviously still have, I dont think that we will be able to recover unless there is some serious work done to prevent Yantis/IGE from operating and selling this plat. SOE &gt;NEEDS&lt; to search all accounts that exist and look for this obviously duped plat, they have the programming technology to do so and can access any account they feel is needed.<br />
Its a serious problem and it needs to be addressed; any further Ostrich maneuvers will simply make this problem worse, not better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/e wonders if this poster is a Yantis bot.....<br />
Most definitely not.  However, I don't partake in the Bazaar with much regularity, so this is a very theoretical discussion.  Wubao over on Monkly Business makes a much better case for this entire thing being irrelivant than I seem to be, and I agree with him that most of these threads are likely to be started by the cheaters themselves to spread anxiety in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
Anyway in all seriousness, the problem is that say a White Dragon Helm sells for 100k on your server......this Yantis/IGE bot program searches bazaar for all of the helms and buys them up; eventially, this bot has a near monoploy on the market on the helm, heck all ornate molds too, and BoCs, Fungis, SoD, etc, etc.... and you now have to play premium plat costs for these items, going from 100k on the helm to say 200k.<br />
Okay.  There are constantly new instances of each of these items entering the game (with the exception of things like SoD's that no longer drop, but they're a special case).  If the price due to the &quot;monopoly&quot; has been driven up to 200K from 100K due to someone with large amounts of currency being able to corner the supply, one of two things will happen.  People who loot one of these items from a mob will either try to sell the item for close to what the monopolist is selling it for and make more money than he would before, and thus be able to spend that extra money on other, equally, inflated items or he will sell it almost instantly to the monopolist for a still significant, but lesser, sum and be on the loosing end of the trade.<br />
<br />
At a certain point in the game, money becomes irrelivant.  All gear is NO DROP and the only money that is needed is to pay for spell components and other consumables.  Also, people who are playing at the end game level are likely to have access to the very best droppable gear (which will be worse than what the NO DROP gear they have available to them) and thus will be able to sell items to other players and horde that cash.  Level 65 spells that result from the rune turn ins are a prime example of this.  The top level guilds, as they were moving through PoP, were able to equip all their casters and then sell their extra spells at almost any price they liked because nobody else was able to get to the areas the items dropped.  They were, however, able to farm platinum for hours (or days) on end or pay real-life cash (either directly or indirectly by buying plat) for the spell.<br />
<br />
It does make a difference to the economy where the plat comes from; basically free plat is a huge problem and causes this sort of inflation......look at some RL historical problems where this sort of thing has wrecked economies; in Germany post WW I they were paying retribution payments to other countries for starting WW I and it was bankrupting them; to help &quot;offset&quot; this Germany started to print MASSIVE amounts of paper cash, with no real gold or property to back up the cash, thus making it essentially worthless; it was so bad that you would need a wheel-barrow full of cash to buy a dozen eggs. <br />
<br />
I like this analogy.  You are absolutely right when you say it makes a difference where the plat comes from and that was my entire point.  In Germany, it didn't matter if the wheelbarrow full of cash came as payment for a days work or from a printing press in your basement, it still cost a barrowload of cash to buy those eggs.  However, if you printed your own cash (duped the plat), you were contributing to the devaluation of the currency, which further drove prices up.  The big difference between Germany and EQ was that in Germany you didn't have the option of not getting the eggs (starving to death) or getting your own eggs (if you're being paid to build the tanks to defeat the French).<br />
<br />
EQ isnt far from this sort of picture; sure its a virtual community, sure no one in RL is going to be hurt if the high end toys start costing 2-3x as much plat as they used to, but it ruins the fun for 95% of the player base that doesnt have access to endless plat, wont use dupes/bugs or that refuse to buy plat/toys for RL cash.<br />
<br />
Really, it should make no difference.  Firstly, you always have the option of going and looting the items for yourself.  Secondly, people playing the game can still sell items at the current inflated price and then buy the item they want at the same current inflated level.  Because items in EQ are never consumed, the economy has always been very artificial.  Items and currency has never held its value well.  People who sit on either have always been carrying a risk.  If you went to GFay (or wherever your trading zone used to be) in the old days, most people would sell their wares and buy new stuff in very short order, leaving themselves back being without any currency on hand.  Selling one Fungi may get a JBB and a couple of spells and it doesn't matter what the actual numerical prices are of any of it as long as you look at the relative intrisic values.<br />
<br />
The people who purchase platinum or use cheats themselves to gain currency will help drive prices up (on everything).  The people who are playing the game properly still have to go and get something of in-game value (usually a drop) and sell it in order to be able to afford to purchase the item they want.  The only people who will suffer are the ones who sit on their bank accounts between selling and buying.  If you are very concerned, simply don't hold on to any cash.  Hold on to actual items that have held their value well and are relatively easy to sell (SoD's, Fungi's, etc.) as you are saving up your fortune in order to buy the really big ticket items.  If prices are driven up as you are farming due to another influx of currency, you should be able to sell your items at the inflated prices before you go to buy the really big-ticket item.<br />
<br />
The economies are wrecked and due to this tons of duped plat that Yantis and his cronies obviously still have, I dont think that we will be able to recover unless there is some serious work done to prevent Yantis/IGE from operating and selling this plat. SOE &gt;NEEDS&lt; to search all accounts that exist and look for this obviously duped plat, they have the programming technology to do so and can access any account they feel is needed.<br />
Its a serious problem and it needs to be addressed; any further Ostrich maneuvers will simply make this problem worse, not better.<br />
<br />
I want to see the plat duping/macroing bugs squashed because it is not fair for those who play the game within it's rules to be left behind by those who cheat.  Macroing to get the money to buy a high end item is no different, in my opinion, than using a pathing exploit to kill a high-end mob with no risk to loot the item directly.<br />
<br />
From a practical matter; what do you do if you find duped plat?  The bugs were in the game and people took advantage of it.  Some people used macroing programs to take advantage of it more than others.  These people cheated and their accounts should be banned.  However, what if that person used the duped plat to buy something from you?  Should the plat be deleted?  Does the item get removed from the banned account and returned to you and the plat deleted?  What happens if there are a number of transactions in the middle?  What if the person who bought the item from you paid cash (real-life) for the platinum and then turned around and spent it on your trader? What about if he's turned around and sold the item to someone else who thinks it's a legitimate transaction?  There is too much currency in the economy at the current time and new methods need to be put in place to remove it - be it through encouraging people to throw money away with tradeskills (new interface), the casino or horses (turning cash in to NO DROP items, basically removing it from the game) or tributes (who the heck knows exactly how that will work).<br />
<br />
To sumarize, I think the powers that be should be coming down hard on the people who are exploiting the game to cheat.  I do not, however, think that the current glut of platinum that is in the marketplace is worth all the doom and gloom predictions that seem to be floating around right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it extremely distressing that, assuming this is all true, IGE can sell somebody 150k for 100 bucks so the buyer can afford a price-fixed item in game from an IGE mule and they can turn around and sell that plat back to somebody else.  That, my friends, is racketeering.  Since real money is involved here, perhaps if we can get enough proof together the community can bring some sort of legal action against IGE for this.  It has to be illegal outside of simply breaking the EULA.  If Sony isn't going to do anything, we've got to take it upon ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sathak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok way i read it is that Yantis etc buy the item with duped plat then destroy said item thus taking it out of circulation.<br />
I don't see why they'd destroy it.  Consider this:<br />
<br />
1- Yantis/IGE purchases pp from players for real $.<br />
2- Yantis/IGE purchase/farm items, with either game pp or real $.<br />
3- Yantis/IGE puts the items on trader mules at jacked up prices.<br />
4- Yantis/IGE sells plat to players for real $.<br />
5- players use that plat to buy items from Yantis/IGE trader mules.<br />
6- Yantis/IGE sells the pp for real $.<br />
<br />
It can create a very profitable cycle for them.  If they have the items and the pp, they can sell both, then make additional money when they get back the pp via item sales in the bazaar.  No need to destroy any items.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Sathak but your #1 is where you lose the point you are trying to make.  They DUPE the plat.  They are paying nothing for it.  Try to sell them some they say they are full.  It is kinda like the barber shop being a front for the real &quot;cutting&quot; thats going on.  SO yeah they say they will buy plat but that doesn't happen.  Destroying an item making it more rare will make it seem as tho the inflated prices are more reasonable.  Hey I have the last bag of pork rinds in North America, sure they used to cost $1.49 a bag, but now this bag of pork rinds is a novelty item, prolly never even gonna be opened and eaten.  But I could sell it to a buyer for $100k because some one with more money then brains wants the last bag.  Sure they could sell the items again at a profit but its not the items that are bringing in the money for them its the plat.  Hows does platnum circulatong in game make them money? It doesn't what does is SELLING the unlimited plat that they make to players for real life $$$.  Then the player buys said item from One of the vendors they have set up with a &quot;1 of a kind item&quot; so now yes they have that plat back to sell, but what does it matter they have a machine pumping out the cash far faster then they have it coming in from item sales.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or a price cap. 50K on any item. And with that 50K sale in the bazzar you get a 10% tax levied. Is the item worth more than 50 K to sell. Well then get pounding the pavement and sell it in auction. Spend some actual Time looking and buying and selling.<br />
<br />
Money has gotten next to worthless. Ornate selling for 250+ K That is total BS. <br />
<br />
(And yes I have almost full ornate. And no I dont sell it.)<br />

Put some actual TLC back into the game SoE. At least show that you care about the product that is being violated before your very eyes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Taxing and price ceilings is so not the answer.  The only way to stop them is for SoE to spend the time and resources to remove the plat duping and macro exploits manually.  This means they have to actively search out and ban macroquest users and constantly monitor the movement of large amounts of platinum, including code to trace the origin of the platinum.  SoE would have to make it cost ineffective for yantis/IGE to keep replacing the accounts they get banned, and their 6-7 figure annual profits will buy a crapload of accounts.  <br />
<br />
SoE knows how to fix things, they just realize that it will cost them a lot of money to do.  They would have to quadruple their CS staff, and that ain't gonna happen.   <br />
<br />
As far as buying plat and items with RL cash, I suggest we get used to it, because its here to stay and will continue in future mmog's as well.</div></div><hr />

I for one am going to be saddened that you are leaving. Your insight and assistance throughout all your visits have truly made this site a beacon of knowledge to which all flock.<br />

I went from lvl 1 to lvl 65, from Blackburrow to planes, with the gear I quested for or looted from dead mobs. Got my spells from runes and parchments and loot drops. Basically never bought anything big from Bazaar now or Faymart in the past. Only things I have bought are some smaller trinkets, which were neat to have and were up with a handy price. Were these items crucial? Nope, so if it would have been only IGN bot/anyone selling those items for crazy amount, I would simply have never bought it. That's the choice what everyone has. No one HAS TO BUY anything from Bazaar and thus endorce such methods and ways. You got where you are on your own, without those trinkets, with your own skills and time. So, personally, I don't give a rat's tail about all of this - I just wont deal with them, never did, never needed and will need.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I must be missing something.  If an item is put up for sale in the Bazaar by someone unrelated to IGE (or any other similar agency) and IGE buys it providing it is less than a certain price, doesn't that person still get their money?  IGE may try and resell it at a higher price, but as long as the original person selling does so at just below IGE's magic price, he will maximize his return in very short order.  Now, since the person who originally sold the item has the money in his pocket, he can go out and do what he likes with it.  The money is in the economy and circulating.<br />
<br />
You can see it in two different way.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
<br />
I fletch a Stonewood Compound Bow and drop it on my bazaar mule for, well... 100k pp.<br />
<br />
The bot who buy any SCB for 100k or less, instantly warp to my mule, buy it and then resell it for 200k.<br />
<br />
Anyone who sell a bow for 80-120k is instantly visited by this bot.<br />
<br />
Great for me, for all the vendors, we got our money. <br />
Maybe, we even got some duped money, not that I care, I can't see if the money is or isn't duped anyway. But, with a &quot;legal&quot; transaction, I just help the dupers to &quot;legalize&quot; these plats.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
<br />
I want to buy a Stonewood Coumpound Bow. The usual price is between 80-120k pp.<br />
I check the bazaar and someone just sell one for 100k.<br />
I go to the vendor, and nada... the bow is gone. Bah... I wasn't quick enough this time... and the next, and the 10 next time.<br />
Each time, some secs later, I see another SCB on another vendor but for the double price.<br />
<br />
It can be someone who is checking manually the bazaar every mins or so, who earned his pp the good ol'way and play the &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; game, but if it happens every single time a bow is on the market, you have a good chance that something isn't goin right.<br />
<br />
If this is a bot, as a potential customer, I would be pretty upset. Anyway... I continue to grind my pp the good ol'way and finally I buy the bow to the bot.<br />
Not only, the bot spend some duped plats on the markets when it bought the bow, but it gains legal plats. In this exemple, it's not a 100% profit, but a 200% profit as its plats was the result of a cheat.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end...<br />
<br />
The prices are &quot;artificially&quot; inflated with no valid reasons.<br />
The casuals customers are just ripped of their cash.<br />
The dupers have a good way to disperse all their duped plats in the economy.<br />
<br />
Time to eat my pills... I'm starting to be paranoic again :D<br />
