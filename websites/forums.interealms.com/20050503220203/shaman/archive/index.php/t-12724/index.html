<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">About 80% of the time when I try to reply to a thread, I get a message that says &quot;This Forum is not currently accepting new posts&quot;.  If I hit &quot;back&quot; and then submit again, I'll get something to the effect of &quot;you can only post 1 post per 30 seconds&quot; enough though I haven't successfully posted anything yet.<br />
<br />
It sometimes takes 3 times with 30 seconds waits between to get my message to post.<br />
<br />
Is there a limit to the number of people who can post at once or something?  Am I doing something wrong? :-)<br />
<br />
I'm usually using the &quot;quick reply&quot; area at the bottom of the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The 1 post per 30 seconds message is a flood protection message. The first message you are reciveing is maybe you are trying to respond to a thread that has been moved ?</div></div><hr />
