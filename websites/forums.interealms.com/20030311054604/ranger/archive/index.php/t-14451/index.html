<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Soloing? At 44 Dawnshroud slowed down for me, so I took a dare and went to Jaggedpine. Griffs--griffenes and the griffins themselves--were great. Been sidetracked for a while with money issues, but I will be getting back there ASAP.<br />

Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rooke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been doing griffons and griffawns at 43 griffens tend to leave me with 2 bubs of hit points at the end of a fight darn resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vindikael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just dinged 47 in DSP myself did levels 30-47. Probably could have left DSP a few levels ago but I had heard from friends that though the exp slowed down at 44-45 in DSP it was still better than the griffs in JP. <br />
So what I would do is donate in the nexus for Visions of Granduer which would usually last about 45mins and kill the closests blue animal to me as fast as I could. I have to say that was some turbo fast killing with that spell. Could do 2 yellows in the early 40s for the duration of the spell.<br />
<br />
What I think I will do is setup my 2nd acct with a druid on it who will take me to and from the nexus + SFG. Whenver VoG runs out have a chanter lined up to cast it on me. It is soo worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went from 30 to 45 in DSP in just a few days. Once i hit 45, Dark blues seemed kind of thin, so i gave JP a try. Too many hills and trees and too much running from one griff to the next. Went back to DSP and just tracked down the closest blues i could find and it went a lot faster. Its also a little easier to get to the Nexus from DSP than JP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spidaaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thing about JP is the insane amount of lag..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flea_2010</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DSP until 47?  <br />
<br />
Can you say stop hitting me in the head with that dull arrow and kill me already?!<br />
<br />
DSP does not offer enough EXP after level 43 or 44 to hang there.  You can get great EXP in Jagged Pines killing the basiliks in the caves like Sandary said.  You can FEAR-KITE them and gain great EXP, but most importantly, YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WONDERING MOBs, as you will in the forest of Jagged Pines.<br />
<br />
Also, good EXP for low 40's to 45 or so, is Dreadlands.  Easy to get a group and there are constant pulls.<br />
<br />
When you hit 45, get some crack (KEI) and head to Burningwoods.  There is hardly ever more than 10 peeps in the zone and you can solo the skellies and Sarnaks (except the champions). Root, Snare, Flaming Arrow, bow, bow, bow, bow, then REPEAT.  Good EXP, and open arrow, run to zone instead of dying.<br />
<br />
Also around the mid 40's, you can head to Karnor Castle from DL.  Easy to get a group, but sometimes need to be patient.  Zone in on the RIGHT side and take the trains to the RIGHT side as you exit, it's just being polite there.  Good EXP there, I earned 2 levels in 2 nights and am at 47, almost 48 now.<br />
<br />
Change it up, as soloing in DSP until 47 would be enough to make me QUIT EQ!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vindikael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">To say DSP offers no EXP after 43 is ridiculous. I will admit it slows down after 44, but it is still better than grouping and most other solo spots. <br />
<br />
I did not try the Basilik Cave .. maybe that is better exp than DSP, so I cannot comment. <br />
<br />
If your going to waste your time pre-AM to do the root/shoot technique at least do it in a zone with decent exp, for example the entrance to the hole has some elementals that spawn there. You can finally bust out your anti-summon spells that have been rotting in the back of your spellbook. <br />
<br />
For any class that can solo reasonably, there is no excuse for you to be grouping in DL. The exp there while safe and reliable, grouping is far far too slow. I learned that very fast with my druid, while being LFG I would pull mobs to KC, root rot them till I found a group.. I saw with KEI how much faster this would go .. so I sayed bye bye to grouping and hello to soloing.</div></div><hr />
