<br />
Not only are the original servers being replaced (such as tarew).<br />
<br />
They are NOT doing anything about the clusterf**k that is time when they add 3-4 time enabled guilds per server.<br />
<br />
I know for some of you, this matters not... but when trying to RUN a guild on a server this is CRAP.<br />
<br />
I don't mind an influx of new people, I mind the fact the developers offer absolutely NO forum for players to get their concerns addressed.  They are doing it for business reasons, the existing playerbase be damned.</div></div><hr />

True to what they should have done, SoE waited it out a bit to determine how much was needed to be done.  I think that it's a good move.  It costs their operating costs in half, as well as it &quot;should&quot; increase the support per server.  Some servers will be stacked a bit (like maelin now will have four anguish guilds and another one in Tacvi), but i'm looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, maybe 4 months from now after all the guilds on the server decide to die or to continue and put up with the undo stress and anger of those players on OLDER servers now having X's in their names because the developers choose to obsolete the hardware.<br />
<br />
Servers are a community.  Built up over YEARS.  The developers with one flip of a switch eliminate the community and force people to rebuild.  It doesnt help that 0 customer service will be present to resolve guild disputes.<br />
<br />
And for what?<br />
So the population doubles?<br />
<br />
Is it a cure?<br />
<br />
No. The game isnt newbie friendly.  Adding another pint of blood will keep the patient alive but for how long?  Right now I feel sony is as committed to EQ1 as they are to BETA/Palm pilots/their computer products.  And unlike sony's rivals, there seems no vested interest in keeping their players happy.  Don't like it?  Leave.  We are happy with our 10% of the market.</div></div><hr />

We just got our 4th qvic enabled guild on the server and we're looking at 4 or 5 more merging over from what I hear. 8-10 guild fighting over qvic is just gonna suck.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heres the thing. This sucks for the top 4-5 guilds on each server, but its really good for the rest. Most guilds below that mark have been hurting. WoW, EQ2, and guild-hopping have left many unable to effectively raid. On my server alone, at least 5 EP+ guilds either folded or are unable to field an effective raid force. And of course, this is a boon for anyone who goes LFG a lot. <br />
<br />
We all knew it was coming. SOE now probably knows the average populations. They know how many accounts have been cancelled. And they have a &quot;number&quot; in mind for nightly log in averages per server. Its too early to say, but I think that there will be shake ups at the top end of the Guild Food Chains, and the middle people will be in great shape.</div></div><hr />

My own server, Vazaelle, is WAY older than Maelin Starpyre, yet MS keeps the name, and people who have been around since Vazaelle started now might end up getting their names X'd.<br />
<br />
This is even more BS when you look at ORIGINAL servers being merged and losing their names to YOUNGER servers.  That's a crock, plain and simple.  The original EQ server names should be inviolate.  PERIOD.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that when the go through the servers on merge day and find players with the same name, whoever has more /played time gets automatic rights to that name.  That should protect the older server players who have been around a lot longer than the people on the younger servers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I thought perhaps the whole thing behind merging older servers into younger servers might have something to do with hardware upgrades. I'm no expert. Just a Barbarian. Keeping &quot;Karana&quot; ... well, meh. It might be the same zones, but on a new server, experience will become memory. Just not the same.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there aren't many on Karana who are looking forward to the merge. We have one Anguish guild, one guild  working through MPG trials, three Time guilds ... and have worked out a very nice, equitable rotation. It's gonna be tight on upper-end raiding, I bet.<br />

<br />
Going from competition with 2, to competition with up to 10, is going to be horrible.  But, if you're like us, you probably have 1/2 to 2/3 the numbers you had.... so &quot;/mezmorizing voice&quot; join us...Join us..JOIN US :)</div></div><hr />

Fennin = 1 Anguish guild, 2 Higher end GoD, 1 time, 1 ep... Also a couple smaller guilds scattered in GoD. Any other shaman's from fennin are more then welcome to elaborate, as I'm not completely sure of this, but I think that's roughly correct</div></div><hr />

The 'X'ing is based on your /played time PER CHARACTER - not the server time.  <br />

Sure enough Sony may have been disrespectful as to which server retains their name - however the players - it is based on their start dates.  So if you're an old player - you got nothing to worry about.<br />

What are you going to do in 10 days? I mean, if they gave you 6 months to prepare what would you do? It's a game for crying out loud. Do you need to get used to the idea?

We have:<br />
<br />
1 Anguish Guild -  The Mystical Order (strong guild raid ALOT)<br />
<br />
2 Txevu Guilds -- Caelium Infintini(Sp?) and Sacred Fyre  (both are kinda hurting tho but still raid)<br />
<br />
1 Qvic Guild/Time Guild -- Talons of Ferocity (above guilds still do qvic now and then)<br />
<br />
Time Guilds -- Primal Dreams and maybe 1 or 2 more<br />
<br />
<br />
I probably missed 1 or 2 in there between Txevu and Time... i almost positive i missed some... but TMO is definatly the furthest guild on our server being the ONLY guild in Anguish .... Caelium has done like 2 or 3 MPG trials before the change but havent done any lately.....<br />

Maybe some people don't want to go to the server their being forced to move to? Perhaps they want some time to consider using the free transfer after? Need some time to look at other guilds cross server, maybe talk to some people there, etc.<br />

Some aren't content with eating what's shoved down their throat, so yes, 10 days really does suck for making those kinds of decisions.<br />

EPs arent &quot;open&quot; but the flagging process for the EPs and Time have been streamlined a ton. Also the rules for will-ins have been modified to include single groups, so you could have 5 flagged and 1 unflagged and go XP in the EPs if you were so inclined. <br />
<br />
Sol Ro has been &quot;opened&quot;, sort of. There is a pretty simple quest to gain access, far easier than even the back-door quests to Tactics or Decay, actually. Hail a drake, kill a guy who spawns every 6 hours or so, turn in the drop, your flagged. <br />
<br />
The whole concept of opening the EPs sorta died with OoW. There is comperable loot dropping in zones that are completely open. There are 1-group trials that have loot comparable to Quarm drops. Opening the EPs right now wouldnt accomplish anything, in reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SotS? Souls of the Shadow? Boy, that brings back memories! They were a notorious and widely hated E'ci uberguild back in the day. The amount of drama on VN boards was just unbelievable and most old timers still remember the &quot;SotS eats babies!&quot; battlecry-cum-joke.<br />
<br />
The guild was eventually disbanded by GMs for misbehavior, tried to reform, was GM-disbanded again and finally server-moved when SOE (or was it still Verant?) split servers. Then Reconstructed became the resident uberguild, more conflict ensued and eventually its leader was exposed as an Ebayer of guild property and accounts and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Ah, those were the days! :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I haven't done much public raiding on E'ci in the last year or so, but what I remember from the last couple of years varied a great deal depending on the people leading the raids. Some of it caused a great deal of drama as well, probably inevitably :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well 10 days notice would be a major issue for me if it had been given next week.  I'm going on vacation for 16 days, if they had posted the server merges on April 8th and Brell/CT would merge on April 18th, I'd have lost a bunch of our guild mules full of gear.   While it didn't happen to me because of when they posted, there WILL be some people that will not see the merger notice in the 10 days before it happens.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if it was just a server merge, but with the deletion of characters under level 10 it becomes an issue for giving such a short notice.<br />
<br />
Some guilds got a 2 month notice, it would at least have been nice to get more than 10 days.</div></div><hr />

Public raiding was huge on Tunare, with bowraid and it's decendants. At least when I quit EQ about 6 months ago, the open raid groups were starting to break into elementals. If E'ci brought more open raiders, I doubt it would shake up guild pecking order. Talisman and DC were doing their best to keep open raids &quot;in their place&quot;.<br />

Well... What is sometimes referred to as &quot;E'ci public&quot; or &quot;Ashorty's raids&quot; (see http://www.ecipublic.org/) is Time/Qvic+, but it's built around a guild with a semi-open invite policy -- see the URL for details.<br />
<br />
Then there is (or was last time I checked) the /backflag channel, which was lower level and messed around in PoP. Then, of course, there are high level raiding guilds and they operate like most EQ guilds do.</div></div><hr />

The way I am reading it, if you want to take advantage of the free server move, then ALL your characters from that server will be moved. You cant pick and choose.</div></div><hr />

<br />

The first part sounds correct, all chars will be moved afaik. But if there are not enough char slots, they will still be moved but you cannot see some of them until you delete some chars so that there are only 8 slots taken. That is the way it works with the merge as well if you already have chars on the server.<br />
<br />
Aikoiko, I would recommend making room for all the chars you actually want to keep.</div></div><hr />

i can see that.  off hours are a lot more quite then they use to be.  have you heard about how the rotations are going to work out though... not sure if it is true as i am getting 8th hand info, but it didn't sound pretty for non NC/MS guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">The way merged server character slots worked with the Zek server merge was that you had 8 slots available as with any server - if you had 5 characters on Server A, and 5 characters on Server B, all characters would be combined, but only 8 would be visable - they woulf be listed alphabetically so if say your main character happened to have a name beginning with &quot;Z&quot;, and the first 9 characters began with lesser letters, your main would not be visable until you delete at least three of the other characters to get the &quot;Z&quot; character into that 8th slot.<br />
<br />
As for the moves after the merge - it is an &quot;all or nothing&quot; move - all your characters from the &quot;new&quot; merged server are allowed to move to any server of your choice (excluding the indentified &quot;special rules&quot; servers), but they all move as one - you cannot specify induvidual moves/stays for your characters.  If you move to a server you already have characters on you would have the same 8 slot limitation and have the same options listed above to get down to the 8 visible characters.<br />
<br />
Some key things that can't be said enough - make sure you have nothing in any of your shared bank slots on either server being combined, this includes shared cash.  If you have items on both servers in shared slots, only one will get moved and the other will be lost so it's just best to have them empty.  Make sure you have no corpses left prior to your merge date - if you have a corpse with gear and your server is merged it will be lost.  Make sure you login characters 10th level and below soon before the merger or they will get purged with all there gear and any cash they have in their bank.<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />
<br />
Jind</div></div><hr />

I am hoping its a sign of things to come and working together instead of begrudging the people who were brought to the server against thier will too. I hope that this means less hours of LFG or trying to find the last person for a group during non peak hours :) sitting around waiting for a cle or tank to go LFG for the perfect RS group sucks :p  <br />

No - according to the Guild Summit forums, SOE is being very careful to not judge how individuals choose to spend their time in game. According to a dev that posted, a trader also earns a reputation and is just as deserving of the name as a non-trader character.</div></div><hr />
