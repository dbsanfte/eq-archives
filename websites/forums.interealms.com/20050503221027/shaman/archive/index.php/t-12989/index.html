Just type /mp3 and a winamp looking console comes up.  The file selector kind of sucks (can't select multiple files) so I use winamp to make a playlist and open it up in the eq mp3 player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">alt+k also works to bring up the player.  I also vaguely recall them mentioning in a recent patch message that the ability to select multiple items at a time had been added.  I'm not sure, since I make my playlists via Winamp outside of game and load them once I'm in.  Only quirk that bugs me is that I have to save the playlist to my root directory on the C drive in order to have the EQ player automatically load it.<br />
<br />
But it's pretty self explanatory, works a lot like winamp.</div></div><hr />
