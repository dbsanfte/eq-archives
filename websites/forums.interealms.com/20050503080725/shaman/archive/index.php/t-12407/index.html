<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of my friends was looking at getting back into the game, and since he plays at odd hours, he wanted to make a very soloable character, but one that could group with my shammy as well.  Some guildies where debating Necro VS: Beastlord in soloablility, not including charm. <br />
<br />
He just wanted to get a second oppinion before he made up his mind for sure.  :confused: <br />
<br />
PS: Excuse the typos, it's late, job hunting sucks  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I say Necro.  I have a level 20 necro.  No twinking, with about 50 plat to buy spells.  He can kill reds.  no KEI, no buffs other than my own or what folks give a they pass by.<br />
<br />
Insanely overpowered, and that makes it fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necro, by far.  Like us, beastlords solo by slowing a mob and either tanking it or (usually) sending pet to tank.  This doesn't work in PoP.  Necros can charm, which is the only way to solo in PoP without having uber flags or finding one of 3 spots in the game where its possible, or going through other BS.  A better choice might be chanter; they can solo anywhere, whereas necros are limited to CoD and a few other spots.  Enchanters can also solo itesm worth 50-150k, and the upcoming changes won't hurt their ability to do so.</div></div><hr />

Necros can also agro-kite and rootrot in very efficiently in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMHO, necros complement a shaman much better than a beastlord. Necro pet is just a tad weaker but still good enough to tank with our slows and if that's not feasible they have the best dots in the game to stack with ours. Necros give you snare, FD splitting, fear, 24sec ghetto mezz and a wide variety of deadly dots. If something goes drastically wrong they can summon corpses and even 93% rezz if they have an essence emerald handy which isn't hard to find peeps selling them in the bazaar. They are my favorite dungeon crawling partner along with SKs.  In return we give them regen to offset the hp lost from their lich line, sow, slows, heals, buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fardadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as someone who has a 55 beastlord as a main i can honestly say that necros are the kings of solo but beastlords are more fun ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, he is not the average necro either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Inan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But is it the druid/ranger VS, or the real VS? big difference....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necros obliterate every other class in overall soloing ability, being at or near the top in soloing for xp, soloing for loot, and soloing for bragging rights.<br />
<br />
They are also extremely good duo partners for shamans (imho, the best duo partner).</div></div><hr />

It's legit. He's done to much and proved it everytime to try to fake something.<br />
<br />
But to answer original question. I have both. Necro hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not only is the Necro a better soloer but the Bst's buffing and special abilities overlap the the Shaman very much. Def. go with the necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necros obliterate every other class in overall soloing ability<br />
<br />
Well, I wouldn't put it quite that strongly - I've played both, and before 55 Necros have a slight edge over Beastlords, (mostly in downtime) but not a huge one. 60+ of course, they're incredible.  I'd definitely go with a Necro if I was planning on doing a lot of partnering with a Shaman, the two classes complement each other well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Necro avoids getting hit.  Thats the whole key.<br />
<br />
BL sends pet, sits and heals pet, or goes in and melees with pet.  Either way, BL AND pet are getting hit.  Necro snares, fears, dots, sends pet, and neither necro or pet ever gets hit.<br />
<br />
The secret to solo high level is avoiding hits.  Any class that can do this can solo high up.    Enchanters druids wizzies all can solo high level because they can avoid hits.  Mages cant avoid hits (or their pets cant) so they have a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
I havent played high level shaman yet, so I dont know.  But my guess is high level shaman can avoid hits with root rot and can take hits for a bit with max ac/defence (far more so than pure caster).  How shammy does in PoP though I dont know.  There, the whole solo point is avoid getting hit.   I'm suspecting shammies do get hit.  Can we solo the plains?<br />
<br />
Hebrides</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well fear kiting has taken a hit last patch with the changes in pathing so necros losses some power but most necros stopped fear kiting by 55/57 or so and changed to different tactics.<br />
<br />
The key to necros is the fact that they have literally no down time like us shamans and their root rotting is extremely efficent. <br />
<br />
By far I'd agree go with the necro. They are a much better partner with shaman then bl and they probably are by far the best all around soloers.</div></div><hr />

Well, 60+ shammies can solo in PoP. With the 61 pet fully buffed ya can kill rats/goos/raves/spiders/treants/trash no problem in PoD. Pet tanks, you dot, pet takes 1 CH. mob dies./ Repeat. Its actually really safe 61+. These mobs max at 250ish per hit and double. We can easily mitiage this. When mobs quad for 400 is where we have a problem. In PoV or PoS you are gonna have to root rot. Unfortunately that means ya cant get the damage out of the pet, and there is more mana wasted on roots, and time wasted running around and re-rooting. Its not ass effecient as pet tanking, but still is plausable. Its also alot more dangerous.<br />
<br />
The real question is can ya get the same or better exp/hour compared to a group.<br />
<br />
If you are 61 and do not have access to PoV or PoS you can solo nearly as well as a PoD casle group. You solo much better than a crap CY group, and nearly as well as a CY group that is pulling your CY and MCY. Its about the same exp as a PoN Hedge/docks group. Gargs/Spidies/Dooms/Gobbos are better.<br />
<br />
It really boils down to kill speed. At 61 you will be getting 2% aaexp per kills solo. Sometimes 3. So at say the CY, you only get 1% grouped. You kill much faster though. So you gotta kill 100% faster at 1% to make up for the lesser exp. Since shamans kill so slow solo, its entirely possible that ya could. In castle ect, Mobs are teh same % groups as the trash solo kills. And ya kill at least as fast. Therefore its better exp.<br />
<br />
PoV PoS you get 5% ish. And ya kill just as fast. So, its obviously better exp.<br />
<br />
So yes we CAN solo. However Necors and chanters can solo stuff that we cant. Therefore, they can  solo or group and get the same exp. We need to group to get the higher level exp. But we do have the option to fart around while we ait for a group.<br />
<br />
At 63+ this all changes. The trash goes lb/green. Your only option is to root rot with more risk. Necros and chanters keep chugging along though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">necros seem to solo the fastest to 60. BL are a good class, but it depends on your play style . i prefer the necro over the BL becuse necros have powerful spells , while BL get watered down shammy spells, but a strong pet.<br />
<br />
as far a yag goes , that man is THE necro. he has many great solo kills , but does not in any way represent the &quot;average&quot; necro. most necros will never be able to solo half the stuff he has.<br />
<br />
it' s all about gear, level, and skill.</div></div><hr />
