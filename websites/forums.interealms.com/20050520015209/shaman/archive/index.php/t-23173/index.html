<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont go about inspecting other people, as a matter of fact it annoys the crap out of me when others do it to me without asking.. Anyways, by pure accident I inspected someones gear the other day and low and behold he had a nice quote and a picture in the inspection box.. How do you go about doing that?..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Switch to 3rd person view (F9) and right click on yourself to inspect. Then just type in the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And now, ironically, very few people will see your bio if you don't allow them to inspect without asking first...<br />
<br />
I ran into a few people who didn't like being inspected, they used the argument, &quot;how would YOU feel if someone lifted up your robe and looked at your pants?&quot;... and back in Kunark era, I admit, it WAS kind of annoying to run through newbie zones and get inspected ESPECIALLY if someone inspects you 3 or 4 times in a row (what's up with that...) but nowadays it happens rarely, and I am usually flattered when I get an inspect.  As long as they don't spam it, I don't see the trouble of one line of white text.  Also, they get to see my humorous biography!<br />
<br />
Anyway, you F9 out and right click yourself, and enter one in.  People will see it when they inspect you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I turned the message off, and I turned off my ability to inspect others.<br />
The only annoying thing about inspecting was that it was usually followed by some kind of begging.</div></div><hr />
