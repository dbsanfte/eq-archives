Really who gives a f**k please lets get all the bugs sorted out first before they worry about introducing the new engine proper.<br />
Whats the betting we still have lots of bugs when they do introduce it because once again they are 1 too lazy or 2 too inept to sort it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saramin.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
Just noticed it states &quot;All new content from this time forward will take advantage of this new engine etc etc etc&quot;<br />
They state they wont upgrade existing content...Yet more laziness ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So we get new, prettier broken content rather than the older, ugly broken content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that's what eq is.... debugging for eq2 new graphic engine!!!!<br />
Really though, who cares what a rat or bat looks like.. personally I don't think they look soo much better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How many hours of playtime are we going to lose for this upgrade?<br />
<br />
I mean really SOE...shouldn't we get the game working a little better before you screw it up again?  GoD has brought a ton of class issues upon us, and you put graphics at the top of your priority list...I really need to apply for an exec position there.<br />
<br />
Reminder:  EQ has survived every other game that woo'd us with better graphics.  Do you understand why, I will give you 3 guesses if it helps :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I pray that they don't change bear form. The changes to wolf form sucked all the coolness from that illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually I&quot;d say if rats and bats are changing it'd be a safe bet that bears would too, and wolves.<br />
<br />
  Wonder how many of my guildmates will be completely unable to log in after this stuff hits.  And if they'll now have the option for &quot;original/Luclin/super-crap&quot; models to be turned on for raid/bazaar leg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why are you guys complaining?  This is a good thing (except for those with old systems).  <br />
<br />
Good graphics matter.  It makes a difference.  <br />
<br />
EQ has the content, and it remains a great game - subject to significant flaws.  <br />
<br />
I just get frustrated because I think it can still be a fabulous game if the design weren't bad as it has been recently, but it is still the best thing, by far, on the market. <br />
<br />
I wish like hell they'd redo the Luclin animations and graphics.  God, those suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe this time the 2hb animations will be changed to look like you are actually swinging the hammer instead of poking the mob with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally I couldn't give a rats left buttock for how the models look in online games. After a few minutes of admiring the eye candy I turn off the graphical effects in most games to give better system performance. The only Luclin models I have on are those required for my toons to use their horses. <br />
New models are a case of change for the sake of change rather than anything that would make me buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The theory is new models utelize dx9 thus give better performance and graphics for most people.  Those with computers they'd be embaressed to take into public will suffer.  Their execution of this does suck bad though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">and i must agree, I find graphics mean little or nothing to me personally, but i did play muds for 11+ years and still play them occassionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gotta echo what Vanilla and Addisonate said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Prettier and broken is still broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
As an aside - all MUD's are text based - correct? Meaning they're like playing old Zork (iirc) where you don't see any Avatar but all commands, results etc generate from what you type in? (Kind of like working in DOS?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">bleh was gonna post something real but **** it, sony blows ass sums up my opinion pretty well.</div></div><hr />

   You're not alone ,but well directx9 patch was a horror for me : lot of lag ,reduced performance ,and lot of fog. Oh well it even rain indoor now  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was in PoN last night and it was raining, but only on the corner of the zone out building. Was kinda funny actualy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">a couple nights ago it was raining in PoTime B... but only in RZ's room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">dx9 patch was the worst one I have encountered yet.<br />
The only one so far to make me stop playing for an entire week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That patch kept me offline for about 3 days. New models for rats and bats look stupid. Like it really matters to most people what the models are for mobs that they kill for 2-3 hours tops look like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">why are you guys complaining?  This is a good thing (except for those with old systems).  <br />
<br />
Good graphics matter.  It makes a difference.  <br />
<br />
I'm complaining because I'm more interested in basic game mechanics then I am in how nice the graphics look.  (does anyone actually play with spell affects on??)  The new graphics engine introduced major problems and I hate to see development resources going into anything other than fixing those problems.  <br />
<br />
Examples of the problems I'm referring to include:  (1) the collision problems - enough has been said about these including &quot;falling through the walls&quot;, (2) the rewind &quot;feature&quot; - this was totally pissing me off on a raid last night cause everything was warping everywhere...almost impossible to MA a mob when there isn't lots of space to avoid collisions, (3) targetting seems worse than it was before...I now have a problem with the Droga head getting in the way like a horse's head did (I don't see the head, but I get it when I try and target using the mouse.), and (4) performance in select zones is horrible (ex:  plane of Hate.)<br />
<br />
Graphics are nice, but they are a distant second to gameplay for me.  And right now, gameplay is very screwed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The new engine will provide a face-lift to EQ, possibly correct the number of bugs/errors that have caused havoc for many players. Personally I’m waiting for EQII to come out. I am looking forward to seeing how the engine will affect the game though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new graphic engine introduced those bugs.  I'd like to see those bugs fixed before they start working on more eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally I would say its been bout time for this kind of change, I'm not complaining but comparing the new GoD models to 5 year old models it got sketcy sometimes.  However what I would love to see changed most of all would be the old orcs, goblins, and maybe even dragons.  Sure the dragon model is still cool, but it never hurts to experiment just a little  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I play with spell effects on, they look cool.  (Someone asked.)<br />
<br />
But, should graphic redesign take precedence over game mechanics?  No, not by any stretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I finally get to say it and mean it literally.<br />
<br />
I really don't give a rat's ass about new graphics, when my only character's class is so totally screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Luclin Models were a Game Mechanics Bug.<br />
<br />
I don't see them fixing those yet, though with LoY they added in models that could replace those hideously laggy models.  They don't need a new graphics engine, they need to learn how to use the one they have, well nm, they have learned how to use the one they have, they actually need to use it is all.<br />
<br />
I just hope them rolling out this new graphics engine won't be as bad as the &quot;Umbra&quot; graphics engine they put in with Luclin that made many zones totally un-usable, emerald jungle and traks teeth had 15 minute zone times and you could not move unless you turned off umbra in your ini file.</div></div><hr />
