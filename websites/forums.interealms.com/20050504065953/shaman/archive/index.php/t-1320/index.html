<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Critting canni5 seems like a bad idea, unless it takes less hp?  or gives more mana?  not real sure what you mean here.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be named quick buff if it worked with debuffs too =)<br />
<br />
I'd take most of the melee abilities over some of our stuff.  Hell even critical hits would be fun =)<br />
<br />
Critting dots would own, even if every tick it got a chance to do a little extra that tick would be nice.  Low dd's and even lower heals really make for little difference on our usage.</div></div><hr />

...You could crit CannV with SCF?<br />
<br />
Would be cool for big numbers but not really a good idea. I could survive a double dmg crit on Cann V in raid buffs but I wouldn't have much slack and I'm fairly well equiped so i'm sure there are people that would just flat out kill no matter what. To unreliable too. Would end up just taking extra dmg to much of the time since you didn't need 2k of mana.<br />
<br />
...They changed SCF back to work with clickys, so those of us with points in it wouldn't just have wasted them?<br />
<br />
Was always one of my initial fears with aa points. Verant messing with them after they put them in and changing them so that people don't want the skills they have now with no way to change them.<br />
<br />
...They made reinforcements and quickbuff work with debuffs?<br />
<br />
Quickdebuff would be nice but reinforcement isn't that big a deal. Save you a few reslows on a long fight but that usually isn't bad since you know it's coming.<br />
<br />
...We got the combat agility/stability skills?<br />
<br />
I would definitely go for those. Add spell casting sublty while your at it =).<br />
<br />
...If you could crit dot's or other spells we actually use instead of chloroblast and DDs (*cough* DoTs *cough*).<br />
<br />
:D <br />
Yeah something useful for us to crit on would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Something along the lines of reducing the cast time on dots, reducing the mana cost, and reducing the aggro would be great.  Not overpowering, but much needed...Bane is a huge mana hog and taunt.<br />
<br />
Bertoxxulous' Plague Mastery (or something like that..meh).  10, 25, and 50% reductions.<br />
<br />
We do a lot, with slowing, malo/sini'ing, crippling, healing, canning, buffing...doesn't leave that much time for dealing out some damage.  Most of the time, I use Ice Strike with the Mage focus ring/bracer/earring, or Torrent of Poison.  Our dots are so lacking.<br />
<br />
Another skill idea would be to put Cann4 on a hotkey...free up a spell slot for us.  <br />
<br />
And yet another, for all priest/int casters, is to reduce the recovery time of spells.  20, 40, 60%.<br />
<br />
It's all pie-in-the-sky, of course, but I can dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have given up the hope to ever use DoTs again.<br />
It's sad that what once was once of the strengths of our class has now become something you waste mana on and get killed when you do it.<br />
<br />
We have 2 goddamn DoT lines. Why oh why can't they be resisted like the fire and magic lines of the necromancer?<br />
Hell, they should be totally unresistable for the huge manacost they have and the hate they generate. Not even talking about the fizzle rate or the efficiency that is inferior to a wizard's nuke.<br />
<br />
Once again, we have 2 DoT lines, that's all we have for offensive spells(DDs you say?). <br />
Both DoT lines are easier resisted than 99% of all the spells in game, 1 of them taking 2 minutes to do it's full damage and dealing as much damage as the highest wizard nuke(not counting SCF even), which takes ~6 seconds to cast and doesn't generate a 10th of hate of the DoT, while being 20 times less resisted and boosted by different AA skills and items.<br />
<br />
Where is the so called versatility of the shaman class ?<br />
The spell book might look as if we had a variety of spells, but if you play the class in the high end game you realize, that all you cast is slow(because it's 5% better than the Enchanter's and they are busy doing other things) and Malo. <br />
You are saying the strength of my class is versatility ? <br />
Give me a lot of useful spells, which do something in different high end encounters.<br />
You want to turn me into a specialist ? <br />
Give me a strong line of spells, which i can use in every high end encounter, has no stacking problems and has a major impact on the fight, always.<br />
You want me to quit my class, when i have been playing for 3 years and find myself only useful when i buff ?<br />
Don't change anything, you are doing a great job.</div></div><hr />
