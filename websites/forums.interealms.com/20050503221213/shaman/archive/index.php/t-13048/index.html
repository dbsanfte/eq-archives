<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few questions I would like to ask. Sorry if they are dumb . I read some of the answer on other posts and I still don't get it. I just need specific answers please. My english is that bad. I am a troll shaman.<br />
<br />
~When does runed ice fang proc? ( It dropped off a guad in Kael)<br />
<br />
~What should my HP : Mana ratio be? In translation: I have read I should have 200+ wis and the rest should be HP becausae from what I read HP=Mana based on the Canni spell we get. So exactly how much HP should I have compared to my mana pool. Example: I should ahve 1k of hp for 1k of mana ( this is only a example, not right at all)<br />
<br />
~What does a shaman look for in items? Sta? Dex? Str? Wis? Cha? pure HP give?.....<br />
<br />
~What are quests that all shamans should do?<br />
<br />
~What are favorite buffs to have on self during soloing and on pet?<br />
<br />
~Are there any items with a clicky that can summon a rusty item or something so I can give to pet , so that it DWs?<br />
<br />
~What should our weapon skill be? I see our epic is piercing so I am practicing piercing but at higher levels does it change to 1hb?2hb?<br />
<br />
~ Should we go with the 1hb/piercing with a shield or is 2 handed weapons better? Or does this depend on situation like soloing and grouping?<br />
<br />
~What is the use of shrink and grow?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your replies as I know it will serve to help me grow. /em bows before the elders of The Shaman's Crucible</div></div><hr />

Not exactly sure, got mine around lvl 51 and it procced.<br />
<br />
~What should my HP : Mana ratio be? In translation: I have read I should have 200+ wis and the rest should be HP becausae from what I read HP=Mana based on the Canni spell we get.

<br />
There is no correct mana to HP ratio.  If you are at or above 200 wis then you dont need anymore (many do fine with 170ish wis)  Focus more on HP, mana, stamina and resists.  Look for things with combinations of the above<br />
<br />
~What does a shaman look for in items? Sta? Dex? Str? Wis? Cha? pure HP give?.....<br />
<br />
Dex and strength = nearly useless, cha = good for buying / selling to a merchant, sta = more HP, HP = GOOD<br />
<br />
~What are quests that all shamans should do?<br />
<br />
Epic quest, many other quests are decent / fun depending on your playstyle and stuff.<br />
<br />
~What are favorite buffs to have on self during soloing and on pet?<br />
<br />
HP buff, Regeneration. and stamina buff on self.  HP buff, Regeneration, and haste on pet.<br />
<br />
~Are there any items with a clicky that can summon a rusty item or something so I can give to pet , so that it DWs?<br />
<br />
None that I know of<br />
<br />
~What should our weapon skill be? I see our epic is piercing so I am practicing piercing but at higher levels does it change to 1hb?2hb?<br />
<br />
In general weapons skill matter less and less the higher level you get.  Epic is a piercer so IMHO that is primary skill to work on<br />
<br />
~ Should we go with the 1hb/piercing with a shield or is 2 handed weapons better? Or does this depend on situation like soloing and grouping?<br />
<br />
your melee damage will be pretty unimportant soon if it isnt already.  I think stats from a piercer / shield better than 2hb.<br />
<br />
~What is the use of shrink and grow?<br />
<br />
Shrink is very useful when you need to fit many people in a small space like on a raid.  Grow is more of a toy but some magicians and rangers like to shoot over peoples heads.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
