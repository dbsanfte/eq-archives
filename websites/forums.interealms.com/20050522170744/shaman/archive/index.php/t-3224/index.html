<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hexore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Uhmmm how do i get a Crushed Durenit ? its for the totemic quest<br />
<br />
The Boots:<br />
require banden boots <br />
1 Dufrenite <br />
Ore chief's Tongu<br />
Torro spines............END<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the breastplate you need a Crushed Dufrenite &lt;--- how do i get that ?<br />
<br />
and a powdered Dufrenite ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy dufrenite at one of many vendors, take it to the three ogres in Lake Rathe, hand it to the right ogre.  The ogres are neutral to all races.<br />
<br />
A good guide is on http://www.eqshaman.com in the EQUIPMENT section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe dufrenite also drops in Sol A.<br />
<br />
The different ogres in Lake Rathe will powder/crush or whatever your dufrenite.  You just have to find the one that offers to crush/powder, etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm, did that make sense?<br />
<br />
There are multiple quest ogres in Lake Rathe.  Each of the ogres will offer to do something different to your dufrenite.  If you need crushed dufrenite, find the ogre that offers to crush it.  Hand it to him and he will hand it back crushed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dufrenite is rare drop on Carrion Ghouls in unrest too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is easier to just buy them. 150p is not much and the time it will take to get the gems as drops is just not worth it.  <br />
<br />
But the ogres near the RM zone will mash up the gems for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heheh i recall being a lvl 20-25 shammy and having the tot leg items, but not being able to afford the pp for the dufrenite.<br />
<br />
eeeeh by gum  Mr Wilks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">150p is not much <br />
I agree that it's better to buy them instead of relying on a random, rare drop. But it's quite a bit of money for a non-twink.  I'm with oogha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, the cost of dufrenite was a serious consideration when I was doing the totemic armor quests.  Some of you seem to forget what it was like!  No money for spells, no money for dufrenite...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But that was before Glorianna landed the big modelling contract that changed her life ...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We all know Glori was never poor.  Models never are.<br />
<br />
What I meant was that buy the time you have one gem drop you will probably already looted 150p worth of vendor crap.<br />
<br />
I remember being poor, hell I only got about 500p now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On my server, you can probably buy whole suit of rygorr from the money needed for Dufrenite and time wasted on other quest items.</div></div><hr />
