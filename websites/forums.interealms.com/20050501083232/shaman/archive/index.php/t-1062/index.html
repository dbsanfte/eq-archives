<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Faction needed to complete all three = Ally <br />
<br />
Max Ally Faction from Max KOS = 3700 faction hits<br />
Droga/Nurga goblin kill = 1 faction<br />
<br />
Took me 18 hours to get kos to ally. And for me it broke down like this.<br />
<br />
14 hours killing 160 gobbos and hour.<br />
4hours(when i was with rogue) 340 gobbos an hour.<br />
Salts/skins 89 skins and 230 salts. Total turned in.<br />
<br />
thats 3600 gobbos. That means the skins/salts were next to jack and squat for hits.<br />
