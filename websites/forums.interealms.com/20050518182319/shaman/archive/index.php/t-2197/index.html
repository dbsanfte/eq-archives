<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sounds bizarre, but when i was swapping around equip, I was slapping my spears back on, usually howling harpoon in range, icewurm fang in primary, and when I went to attack I noticed harpoon graphic, did a double take and I had howling harpoon in range, are all spears like this? RE Icewurm fang is listed as primary only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">REIF has been Primary AND Range for as long as I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a REIF for quite a while and it was always primary and range for me also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tege</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For slots it only has primary listed for me, but at the bottom it has Range: 50 *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Barbarian Hunting Spear did that for a while too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are quite a few items (mostly spears) that don't have the RANGE thing listed but do indeed fit in the range slot.  Some do and some don't, and there doesn't seem to be a pattern.  Runed Bone Fork comes to mind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One night I experienced a weird graphics bug. With my shield in my inventory and a spear in primary and ranged, I saw my character duel wielding both spears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anuenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a screen shot  of my shammie weilding the shield of falsehood and the Blight Hammer (2HB).  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, Jannia, I used to love to do my &quot;rogue&quot; impersonation.  A set of mostly gnome skin armor (black) spear in main hand and sarnak parrying dagger in range (looks like a dagger when equipped).  Depending on the order they are equipped, you can look like you are dual wielding.  Fun fun fun to get away from those annoying SoW requests!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always used to carry an Axe and a parrying dagger for just such times.<br />
