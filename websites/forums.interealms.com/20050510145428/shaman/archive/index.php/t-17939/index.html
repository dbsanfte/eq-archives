<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From Mobhunter.com regarding melee tuning:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm of course, always one to speculate and I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's going to be some sort of stance, or special skill system using mana, stamina or some new bar, not unlike what I talked about previously or things found in just about every roleplaying game I've played in the last few years.&quot;<br />
<br />
I never bought group Acumen and now it is up to 14k+ on Rodcet.<br />
Just a heads up to get these spells just in case they do use the sta bar. You know how people like to sell our spells to us so cheaply =P<br />
<br />
I found the research items last night for 300pp.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to be have the KEI of the melee crowd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whee - another scam to rake in plat over dropped spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure how far they're willing to go with this melee revamp, at this stage in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if any of you played &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; (EQOA) which is the PlayStation 2 version of EQ.  It's got some simliar stuff, and some vastly different stuff.<br />
<br />
Every class has &quot;power&quot; which is basically like mana.  Casters get spells... melee's get skills.  All use power.<br />
<br />
So for a warrior, they have a skill called &quot;Taunt&quot; which is just like a spell... uses power... hopefully taunts.   Later they get a more expensive (in power cost) upgrade called Taunt 2.  Etc...<br />
<br />
So you actually has some tactics in choosing which skills to use.   Just like casters have to decide what spells.<br />
<br />
Do you use that new, powerful nuke (or taunt, kick, etc...) which burns the power (mana), or do you use a combination of cheaper, but less effective abilities?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying SoE is going to go that far.   It would be a radicle change for melees.<br />
<br />
My bet right now is that instead of a re-use timer, disc's might be &quot;stamina&quot; based or something.<br />
<br />
For example... if a warrior wants to unload that nice crit disc... they can... several times... or whatever.<br />
<br />
If they did move to a more EQOA type style... one would have to wonder where their &quot;power&quot; would come from... stamina makes good sense... but would they also get &quot;+mana&quot; benifits like casters?  (eg: A cleric can have 220 WIS and +1000 mana).<br />
<br />
Guess we'll know next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Please be Stamina... I have a Rogue in my guild who continually begs for Acumen everytime I'm with him. He uses DE form all the time so he doesn't need the UV. <br />
<br />
I tried explaining to him that the Stamina bar does nothing to effect DPS with over 100 Stamina but he refuses to believe me. <br />
<br />
Not holding my breath but expect Acumen to be KEI for melee if this does happen though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd love for that to be the case, but if it were, the acumen would probably be overpowered (unless the stamina usage values were really harsh).  When my monk has acumen on, he never drops below full stamina.  <br />
<br />
It really would add a use to the &quot;zing&quot; spells and acumen, and probably allow adding in a lower level line of stamina regen spells.  <br />
<br />
Who knows what'll happen, but this wouldn't be a terrible change imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">only thing that sounds bad about it is, it will hog up another buff slot<br />
<br />
what other spells decrease stamina loss? i just woke up, only thing that comes to mind is the enc epic haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont know why you would bother buying group acumen anyhow...the regular version lasts a very long time, not a huge deal to refresh it.  It has always been up on my server for 25k+, to which i just chuckle to myself and friends about.<br />
<br />
Must be getting pretty cold in hell about now if they are actually going to balance pure melees in some way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have always heard the thing where if stamina is over 100 it will not affect dps. However some of the rogues in my guild insist that even with stamina at 305, if the stamina bar is out there is a big difference in the dps they do. Anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bard hp/mana regen songs also regen stamina.  Technically, I think they slow sta loss by 1 (cantana/chorus of replenishment) or 2 (chorus/wind of marr).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh my God think of the possibilities...they could nerf acumen! The horror!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extinguish Fatigue is a CH for sta. Our SoV boots have it has a clicky. And there is a lower lv form of the spell thats like celest heal for sta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, if your sta stat is over 100 but your bar is out, then your attack speed stays the same but your MAX damage is reduced...therefore affecting your total DPS, albeit probably minimally.<br />
<br />
If under 100 sta and out of sta on bar, then your swing speed goes down, greatly affecting DPS.<br />
<br />
So yes, Acumen does have a point, though I'm not willing to pay the 5-7K for the group spell just yet...the single spell is a fast cast with low mana cost, doesn't take much to do it.</div></div><hr />

Your husband is wrong.  Having a stamina under 100 and being out of stamina will reduce your attack, and possibly attack speed.  However, once it is over 100, there are no negative effects to having an empty stamina bar.  I'd need to see parses before I believe otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Anyone who's ever told you that being out of yellow with 100+ sta affects their DPS is full of ****. They never have a parse to prove it; it's always observation. I used to know a pally who swore that being out of yellow made him miss more; there are all kinds of takes on this.<br />
<br />
The fact, proven by many parses, is this: if you're under 100 sta, being out of yellow means your melee stats (str included) go down. Str going down means a lower max hit, which explains why Cuetzpali's warrior husband's opinion - only an opinion, if he parsed himself he'd have realized it wasn't true. If you're at 100 sta or above, your stats remain unchanged. The only adverse effect to being out of yellow at this point is not being able to jump.<br />
<br />
Rather than debate, hop over to www.thesteelwarrior.org and post the question. You're likely to take a little flak since everyone there assumes this is obvious by now, having been asked and answered so many times, but you'll get your answer ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, running out of stamina does nothing but make jumping a pain in the butt.<br />

On the plus side... Acumen, Group Acumen and the Acumen click from Seru quest Earring all stack. KEI... eat your heart you.<br />

It's so fun getting random tells when someone dies on a raid &quot;focus boar diaku acumen wrulan plz&quot; :mad:<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I picked the wrong class if I don't like buffing, but I have other things to do besides cater to their special needs :/</div></div><hr />

14k on Rodcet?  Hah, I sell it for 100 plat every time it drops in Ssra, which is ALL THE TIME.  Heck, just go grind in Ssra for the evening, you'll get one.  A level 65 can duo with any melee in right tube, a group of level 60's would have no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love group acumen, bought it for 8k several months ago for the convenience of see invis buffing an entire group at once.  Some people hate me getting them with it because of the extra buff slot, but for some its pretty nice, including my 2 blind barbarian characters I play together.  Buffing a group of 6 sucks with the single buff.<br />
<br />
Someday we might be seeing: 'MGB Acumen at the pok bank in 5 mins!' if Sony makes the stamina bar useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The one reason I buff my group with Acumen is because when the sta bar is used up.. so goes the food you are using... when you are out of sta bar you use up more food... at least this what I have seen on my Rogue.</div></div><hr />
