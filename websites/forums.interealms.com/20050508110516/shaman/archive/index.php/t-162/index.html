<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swampserver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering do you have to do all the stuff (with the greater spirits and such) too turn in the envy, woe, marr's promise or can you turn them in right away to get the shield? <br />
<br />
Thx in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need a particular level of faction to receive the Shield of Falsehood, which only comes from giving the gems to the spirits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, you need the faction or the wandering spirit wont talk to you. It's not at all hard to to do though. I got mine around your level then I think I lost it in my bank about 2 or 3 levels later. I pulled it out to use it for light sorce once. <br />
<br />
The black fur boots are where its at though ;) SuPeR spam! Pretty at night when your running to just click away.<br />
<br />
But ya all you need is the faction....<br />
either do the quest all the way up to that point or<br />
Just do the first part till you get enouph faction.....<br />
<br />
*WARNING* It IS possable to get to much faction and make other parts of the quest untriggerable.</div></div><hr />

NO it isn't.  This was fixed AGES ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It wasn't fixed AGES ago,trust me.My guild did it for a shaman not so long ago and the shaman skipped many steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thats prety lame :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not really,if you consider the time you need to get faction up,it's faster to do it from A to Z.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Swampserver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok so I just kill the peg lee guy (in butcherblock) a lot of times cause the part in erud's crossing seems kind of hard for me with the killer sharks.<br />
I'm going to mistmoore tonight for the black fur boots, but I should get the shield first then ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, that is really, really lame. I so wish that verant would cut out the loophole between Neh and the fear child. Skipping over the quest (especially such an already easy one!) by factioning is a big steaming pile of cow manure.<br />
<br />
Now, before you come back with &quot;but we have such a small guild, we can't do epic quests for real&quot;...<br />
1) If you can't do the quest, you don't deserve the item.<br />
2) I did every part of the quest WITH NO GUILD WHATSOEVER, right up until the final battle with Rak. Didn't need a guild for that, I just happened to have one available at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The loophole exists to enable characters who have swapped from another server to complete their epic.<br />
<br />
Whats more the faction was screwed for Iksar last I heard and it is a big risk going to the Hole only to be told you have not got enough faction. Still I will be taking that risk if my guild is happy to take it with me. Sure they will as they are a good bunch, not UBER in the ****e sense, or any sense for that matter :) All in good time.</div></div><hr />
