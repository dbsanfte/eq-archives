<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taken from the page:The good news is that the totems have unlimited usage once you get them. You don't have to continue to buy reagents to use your totems. <br />
<br />
As for them being quested, every writeup I've seen for WoW has shown the quests are FUN to do.  They aren't the drudgery of doing quests in Everquest.  Don't knock it until you see what kind of quest it is.<br />
<br />
The stationary totems aren't going to be that big an issue.  Placement will be another tactical part of combat.  If you've ever played any Warcraft 3 you already know how totems work.  We'll just have a lot more of them than the few types there are in W3.<br />
<br />
After seeing the writeup, I want to play the class even more than the original writups I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tauren Hunter please.  Assuming they haven't gotten a clue and added Ogres by the time it finally comes out.</div></div><hr />

hey- i called dibs on them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far the game is turning out just as I suspected....WC3 heroes and gameplay, Diablo 2 skill tree with a dash of EQ.  There better be more to the classes and gameplay than this.  Although it does sound like it will be fun, it sounds less like an rpg that has the staying power  of a game like EQ and more like an action game meant for the teen masses or console gamers.  Really really fun for the first few months, and downhill from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Look fun sor far. After the most important : wow would be challenging ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doesn't look too shabby to me.  I haven't read all the other class descriptions yet, but Shaman at least sounds pretty fun.<br />
<br />
Remember that just because something was annoying and you hated it in EQ, doesn't necessarily mean you're going to hate it under WoW's implementation (quests, tradeskills, etc...).  I trust Blizzard to not make a crappy, tedious game.  I've been playing their games for nearly a decade and they haven't disappointed me yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shamans sound ok, kinda like the sound of warlock. <br />
Don't like priest or paladin.. warriors sounds alot more involved than any in the other MMORPG's I've played, which is good. Waiting on rogue, hunter, mage and druid descriptions.<br />
<br />
I'll probably end up playing a warlock, shaman, or hunter though most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think this is what a tauren shaman looks like:<br />

I'd be more than happy with that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree Jin, thats about the route im taking i think. But i have to wonder, can you make multiple toons like in EQ?  I defiently want to try a few.<br />
<br />
If nothing else itll be intresting not being the slower in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Word is so far that you'll be able to make 8 characters.<br />
<br />
What are unknown at this point is whether that will be across all servers, and what (if any) restrictions will be placed on characters on the same server and opposite factions. You might not be able to have both a tauren and a human on the same server. Or you may...it's one of the things that Blizzard hasn't been completely clear about yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't handle Ass-Ears on Elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looks like the shaman will be a snare/kite class with an option to tank in teh face when you've got your shield and weapon proc buffs up.  No slowing, but two different snare options.  I frigging love it.  This sounds like serious fun (except for the res part).  Best of all it, no mashing the keyboard and from the write up, it sounds like a challenging and diverse class to play.  I'm looking forward to WoW and I can't wait to give blizzard my money.<br />
<br />
No offence to any SoE reps browsing here, EQ was fun in it's day, but with all the mudflation, two tier classes bassed on gear, gear based on playtime, the way class balance has become an oxymoron and all the exciting press I read on WoW, I really don't see EQ2 as an option for me.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they won't be. Blizzard has said quite a few times that they support many many styles of play, from soloing to small raids to large raids to grouping...<br />
<br />
They *HATE* kiting. Any method the players find to kite will be nerfed. Devs have come right out and stated this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the WoW guide.<br />
Earthbind Totem - slows down enemy movement speed. Cast this totem shortly before an enemy is about to run away.  <br />
Stoneclaw Totem - Taunts nearby creatures to attack it. This is one of your most useful Totems. When the monsters are attacking this totem they are not attacking you. This means less damage during a fight. This is also a somewhat useful escape totem. Cast it and start running after the monsters start attacking the totem.  <br />
Frostbrand Weapon - Chance of causing additional frost damage and slowing the target's movement speed. This ability is great to use in addition to the Earthbind Totem against monsters that are going to run.  <br />
While I will not dispute your information, it seems to me that you can use the frostbrand weapon proc to snare and some combination of the Earthbound totem or stoneclaw totem (they don't stack) to snare.  Should be feasible to nuke/dot while a mob is snared, of course the effectiveness will depend on the mana costs, spell cast times and ranges of effects for the totems.<br />
<br />
/shrug no biggie to me, but I'm explaining where I draw my conclusions from.  Even if kiting gets hosed, it's still an interesting class from the general information available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Seal of Protection - Protects the target from all physical attacks. This seal is great for escaping battle if you cast it on yourself as you run away. It's great to cast on a party member like a Priest who has attracted too much of the monster's hate. The monster will turn and attack someone else. This Seal is also good to cast on party members who are about to die.<br />
<br />
So like, do Paladins have total control over aggro in combat?  Keep &quot;sealing&quot; whoever is getting hit until the monster hits the guy you want it to hit.  <br />
<br />
I dunno.  <br />
<br />
Not into the graphics either.  Looks too cartoony.  <br />
<br />
But I'm certainly ready to try a new game.  EQ is getting more and more distorted.  Building expansions to accomodate newbie powergamers who blast by all previous content to glom onto a guild at the end game is unfortunate, but unavoidable I guess.  <br />
<br />
5 years is a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me thats one bit of very good news and one bit of very bad in the same post.<br />
<br />
I hate kiters: I don't even understand why anyone would want to do it.  So I agree with Blizzard there.<br />
<br />
However, supporting large scale raids implies that WoW is going to go along the same path as EQ - degenerating into a two-tier game where if you enjoy raiding you get to be ubah, if you find raiding boring you end up distinctly 2nd rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The graphics are the best part about WoW.  Sure they dont look as &quot;realistic&quot; as EQ, but at least it won't grind your computer to a halt.  Simplicity equals efficiency in my book.</div></div><hr />

Can someone please link to a post by Blizzard that said WoW is going to a &quot;raiders only need apply&quot; game? Seriously, if this is the case I'd love to know now so I don't waste my time/money on a game that will ultimately disappoint.<br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard will hire SOE's customer service team and class balance designers to ensure the game stinks out loud. :P</div></div><hr />

Actually, in an article on Gamespy, they said that items dropped on big raids will be equal to anything that can be won (re: quested) by a casual player with a group or two of friends, BUT the difference will be that the higher tier items will &quot;look&quot; cooler.  If you raid you'll be able to get a sword or armour that has a visual effect that an item that was quested and is relatively equal in stats doesn't.  This way uber do get a cooler appearance, but that you don't end up with 2 tier gameplay like EQ has.</div></div><hr />

The graphics look absolutely phenominal! I guess it's just a matter of taste/personal preference.<br />
<br />
5 years here too, but it really was easier to leave permanently than I thought it would be. Just see sig. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Can someone please link to a post by Blizzard that said WoW is going to a &quot;raiders only need apply&quot; game?

<br />
They haven't said that: its simply what I suspect will happen given that raiding will be catered for - and based on EQ where raiding gradually became the 'one true way'.<br />
<br />
What I'm hearing about WoW has changed over the last few months.  Originally it was supposed to be based around group play.  Then I started hearing that raiding was to be catered for.  As this happened after Furor's personal visit to Blizzard I fear that some of his 'leet' vision has now entered the game.<br />
<br />
You won't ever see a post by Blizzard that says 'raiders only need apply'.  But if the best gear is only obtainable by raiders then those who don't raid will inevitably be 2nd rate citizens in WoW.  And if it's not the case then raiders like Furor will throw a huge sulk and ask what's the point of raiding - as they did after their first trip to Veeshan's peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">5 years here too, but it really was easier to leave permanently than I thought it would be. Just see sig. <br />
<br />
I dunno Valgoth, I think you are more like George Foreman - perpetually coming out of retirement to climb into the ring &quot;one more time&quot;.  :P<br />
<br />
Deleting characters is almost proof you'll be back again.  It denotes significant emotional attachment - which is perfectly understandable given the sheer time invested in this game.  <br />
<br />
I'm quite protective of Gart.  But I suspect that when I quit (if not when they shut the servers down probably), I'll just fade away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Crusty, I can't think how they can design a game so folks who hunt in groups won't get better gear than those who solo or play casually.<br />
<br />
This idea is a very sound idea for these types of games.<br />
<br />
Obviously it can be taken way to far, much like too much of a good thing is not a good thing.  EQ takes the idea too far, but the idea itself I think is necessary.  <br />
<br />
A game that can be plowed through by a single guy muddling along will not appeal to a lot of folks, and will end up a very limited and boring game - even for the guy muddling along.  <br />
<br />
There's something to be said for frustration, it implies goals.  Goals give purpose.  Without purpose, I feel like I'm wasting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Monster Health Regeneration<br />
Monsters will quickly regenerate to full health if you attack them and then run far enough away. This is to prevent cheesy hit-and-run tactics.<br />
Sounds to me like you won't be able to kite.</div></div><hr />
