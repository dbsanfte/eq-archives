<br />
I had been having major problems with OOW the past couple of days.  Character continually locking up in a particular zone (Noble's Causeway), the inability of CS to actually provide a reasonable solution (I've gone from zone moves to DL'ing my motherboard drivers to deleting certain zones).<br />
<br />
So today, after getting disconnected in Walls of Slaughter I had an epiphany. Or so I thought.<br />
<br />
Hey, why not delete everything and re-install? I mean I have the latest CD....(Epiphanies and weariness go together like oil and water)<br />
<br />
Lickety-split I deleted everything, not making the connection that 12 GB (or so) of deleted crap is a whole heck of a lot more than 1 single OOW CD.  Yes lo and behold (since all my CD's are in storage), I couldn't install a darned thing.<br />
<br />
So off to Best Buy, Target et al to find older CD's, with the full knowledge that re-installation STILL may not solve whatever problem I had. (have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, you can download the original trilogy for free from SOE. Then let the patcher do the rest.  Just tap all the other expansions under &quot;advanced options&quot; in the patcher.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but I'm sure there are plenty of EQ nerds that would be more than willing to take Faern's place. :D<br />

For about 25 bucks you can get &quot;Everquest:Platinum&quot; which has the original game plus every expansion except OoW.  It's handy to have all the files on one set of CD's as well for re-installs.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I have had 5 positive rep bumps in a row and not gotten a single point. I am CLINNGING to my 5th greenie by 4 points, LOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always destroy the cd's when I quit eq. So suffice to say I've reinstalled purely via the patcher about four times. I haven't done it recently but it used to be the patcher would fail on you and refuse to download anything if your list of missing files, autogenerated in your root folder, was more than a certain max amount. But you could manually download those files in the list by knowing the root dir the patcher gets them from (and add .gz to the filename) and uncompress them yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just burn your EQ directory to 2 cds or a dvd rw, install new eq, copy all files over.<br />

That's the way I do it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 bucks admission?!  Damn that's cheap...<br />
<br />
Two drinks for $7.50?  I spent 20 on a *BEER* and a foo-foo drink for my lady friend who's b-day it was (yes her friends took her to a strip-joint hehe)<br />
<br />
The rest is accurate of course ;)  Although, you know that drink &quot;minimum&quot; will be more like &quot;good lord how much did I drink last night?!  WTH, 200 bucks!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
:)<br />

I haven't had to re-install for a while, but Sony *still* keeps every install file in their root directory?  Wow, good to know they are still living in the Win98 days - not that it's bad, just abnormal.</div></div><hr />

I have occasionally 'lock' problems in Wall of Slaughter, but it only seems to happen whenever a new model has to load (almost like it takes an insane amount of memory by itself for the zone file, the player models have nowhere to go, and this is 512mb of straight ram and 256 video ram).<br />
<br />
Do you have any of the Luclin models on? If so, have you tried disabling some of them that you do/don't see often (or do/don't want to see)? I have humans, elves, ogre males, and Vah Shir on... when I had humans/ogre off, I didn't notice the freezing as often as I did. Give this a shot if you haven't already wiped and reloaded, worth a go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope sorry, you don't need your product keys after you have entered them.  You only need your station name and password.<br />
<br />
PS Product keys are some sort of proof that you owned the account, (if you get &quot;hacked&quot;, or you sold your acct on ebay and want it back) so don't toss them.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are adding an account, it is even easier to move the EQ directory to your new pc across a lan or direct connection.  One of the good things about EQ is that SoE does not mess with the registry.  Run the options to let EQ find your new video card ane you should be good to go without waiting for Cds.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, maybe that's why after dying 2-3 times I lock up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, you might also want to try disabling all the new OoW graphic features.  They are sort of hidden, as you need to press an &quot;advanced&quot; button in display options which is below all the standard options and not visible unless you increase the size of that window.  There are several options there which I don't have the first clue about (and I used to work testing graphics card drivers from NVidia and Ati for Silicon Graphics), but I'd guess if you turn them all off it might fix whatever memory issue SOE has introduced with it's latest changes to the graphics engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why did you preface your original post with &quot;(Long)&quot; ?<br />

I used to have a similar problem in EC with my other pc. Only thing that worked was deleting those zone files and repatching.</div></div><hr />
