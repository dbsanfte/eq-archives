<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and a friend started a shm/shk iksar duo combo. We are now both lev40 and got some pretty decent gear. I just thought I would ask where to go...looking for quick fast exp of course!  I know most places but i was hoping you folks might mention some more. Also what level do u feel we could start duo in CoM? (gotta get my epic going)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think 2 level 40s should try doing bats and sonic wolves in tenebrous mountains.  I soled there from 44 thru 47, so you two <br />
should be able to handle it fine.  I set up camp near KK zone, but u 2 goons might be KOS.  Better to set up camp near the grimling zone line.  With you slowing and he and dod-dog bashing, it should be good exp.  They con dark blue up through 47.<br />

Good Luck,<br />

Chow Chow for now <br />
