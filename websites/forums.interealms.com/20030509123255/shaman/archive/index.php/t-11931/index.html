<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it's not that big a deal, and after this I expect to see more ppl there...<br />
<br />
I solo in Nadox by the lava river/bridge. Guardians are DB, and most miners are DB too, with the occasional LB. <br />
<br />
I get 1% AA per DB kill at lvl 61. I also get around 5-9 pp and usually an item that sells for 5pp per kill. (Miner's picks sell for 5pp, Ornate miner's picks are rare and sell for 47pp to vendors) Plus, some low to med level gems drop. So, after 2 hours there, I can walk away with roughly 30% AA and 600pp in the bank. And I've usually done other things in the meantime, like catchup with friends in tells, read a book, research stuff online, etc...<br />
<br />
Luggalds tend to be tougher, so I stay on the other side of the bridge.<br />
<br />
This is easy, mindless XP. Focused alpha'd dog is the way to go. I usually just Slow pull, root, epic dot, Plague (no pox, no JBB) and med up. At about 40% I Bane (because I'm getting bored...) and go pull another. By the time I get back, the first one is about to drop dead, so I root the new one, and start the cycle over. With KEI, it's non-stop pulling with rare cannys, without KEI, but with MC2 and FT2, I canny, but not often enough to worry. <br />
<br />
Lately, I've been pulling one, following the above method, and then pulling another and root/rotting it. Root tends to break fast, tho, so be prepared to run around and root alot. That's why I plague and wait on the bane, because bane is crazy aggro.<br />
<br />
On Mith Marr, few if any ppl are in Nadox, and if they are, they are usually somewhere else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes its a nice spot, It can get fun too there is a chance you'll get a named pop from the corpse of any Mob. I've been there since it came out and I've seen this happen once so its rare. there is also a wandering &quot; a Shrine guard&quot; he apears to be a Place Holder for a names as well, killed the named twice. Accross the cave are the Furiose and Vearment (yeah i cant spell) Blackboods these can drop some nice things but its rare. Also Keep an eye out fro Quest drops on FV these are tradable so can boost the cash if you sell them on.<br />
<br />
HAPPY HUNTING</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a Blackhand Lieutenant that spawn in the room to right (when looking away from the bridge) that drops some decent things so if bored you could try to keep that room cleared. He is not overly rare.<br />
<br />
At 62 the guardians and miners go lightblue but all the luggalds are still dark ;-)</div></div><hr />
