<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found him near the aquaduct thingie... (you know, the big long wall of arches you run past all the time)<br />
<br />
Apparently they pop, and die quite often so just sit in one spot and wait for a new one to pop.<br />
 <br />
took me about 4 hours with 3 different druid friends off and on to find him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aquaduct . right around the entrance ot the city above seb. always seems to be a hot spot around there just a lil out from the archway.<br />
<br />
hope it helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah what they said. <br />
Found mine there.<br />
<br />
 Saw one ran up in the distance chased his $#@ all over. Cast and was interupted due to moving. Turned around to see one hit me. I was surrounded in Yun shaman. Pulled him away as quickly as i could no adds and black power dropped. Yeah, you bet i went out and got a lottery ticket too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found mine in the same area. I ran there, ran around the arches a couple times, saw a couple different types of frogs, and boom!, there he was. Killed him, he had the powder, and I gated out.<br />
<br />
Total time, 10 minutes. Sounds like I got real lucky, which isn't usually the case with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frogs are kos to Trakaraptor's and other life so the yun's lifespan from spawn might be short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well I brought a tracker today, I found 2 Yun shamans in 3 hours, but were already getting killed. needless to say, I didnt get the powder  /sigh I want this spell so I can get back to leveling. thanks for all the info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yun shaman isn't hard to find.  Hang out near the aqueduct near Seb city kinda.  Browse around a bit.  You can find one np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been making the Trek to Sebilis quite a bit lately, and if you run from EJ to TT, and then stick to the Left wall in TT, you'll see HORDES of Yun Shamans. I have yet to make the EJ-Sebilis run and see less than 3 Yun Shamans.</div></div><hr />
