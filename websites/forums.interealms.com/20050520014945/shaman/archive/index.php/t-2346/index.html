<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello did they nerf spell casting reinforcement mastery in last patch?<br />
<br />
i got 50% longer buffs and torpor  icon usually lasted 38 sec.<br />
first time i casted at me(after the patch) it was only 28 seconds,the first try then 39 and 38 sec,and some other time it was less than that.<br />
it was always healing me to full when i cannibalised(5),even if i casted 2 or 3 canni 4 whit that.<br />
now sometime  it's healing me &quot;only&quot; to 4 blue bubs hp.<br />
<br />
regen went from 28:46(min) to 19 minutes.<br />
celerity was the same.(24min).<br />
some other spells loo to be less sometime.<br />
<br />
it's maybe just a bug or they nerfed the SCR mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know what is up with it...  SCR1 should increase Torpor fron 1200 - 1500 pts, or at least it did, now it does not seem to and it only lasts the normal 1200 pts.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of petitioning or sending an E-mail and asking about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps you had some focus effect for buff extension that was 'overwriting' the SCRM ability???  Focus items and AAXP abilities don't seem to mesh to well just yet...</div></div><hr />
