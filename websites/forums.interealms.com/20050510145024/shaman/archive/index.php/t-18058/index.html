<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, guys, nice to be back after all this time...<br />
<br />
But, my two-month vacation from EQ and EQ paraphenalia has had interesting reprecussions... Now when I log in, I'm told I have 16 days left on my &quot;free trial&quot; - This is an account that's been in use since Kunark, mind. All my characters are still on there, I'm just really paranoid about this &quot;free trial&quot; thing - Do I need to set up my account again, or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know that for a while Sony was e-mailing old EQ players who had stopped paying on their accounts (quit playing) and offering them a free month of EQ to come back to their old accounts, hoping that at the end of the free month they would start paying again.  Maybe that's why it's saying free trial ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, that's what I gathered, after a friend showed me the Email about that. How does one reactivate an old account? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go into the Billing section and enter in your CC stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, they did that to me.<br />
<br />
Just go to billing info and fill it all out like you did before. You just get one month free :D</div></div><hr />
