<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say armor.  You need to pump up the HP's/AC on your char.  It looks ot me that you would get much more positive effect off of upgrading that, ATM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you spend most of your time hunting outdoors, buy a horse.  It will give you permanent mana regen better than KEI.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I clicked your profile.  You are way to wisdom heavy.  You need to drop some wisdom for hps and ac.  Get in the combat a bit, and max your defense skills.  Swap out your +wis rings for some 6ac/65hp rings (vellium/fire), swap out the +wis earring, the boots are next on the hit list... The returns for a wisdom over 200 are VERY low, so dont worry about the mana loss.  Especialy if you can get the horse you will regain mana quickly enough.  Learn to cannibalize if you havent already, cannibalize and regen will do a lot more for your mana than a high wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, if you spend a lot of time in &quot;outdoor&quot; zone, a horse will improve your mana regen greatly, hence giving a more positive effect on your playtime than any piece of armor that you can buy for 8.2k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He has a lot of wis which implies to me that he does not tank as much as he lays back, casts and relies on his wis to get him through fights.. if that's your style a horse will help you most because medding w/o sitting is really nice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a nitpicky note...  A horse gives you your sitting mana regen while sitting.  At high levels, this is indeed more than KEI.  At his level, it's not, but it'll eventually get there.  Personally, you'd have to pry my bridle from my cold, dead hands. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buy the horse and sell the GEBs for enough money to upgrade some decent armor.</div></div><hr />
