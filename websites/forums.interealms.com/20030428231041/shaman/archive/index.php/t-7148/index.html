I would find out for myself, but I don't know any enchanters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No clue.  Can you even drink a potion while mesmerised?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sows McBuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't think so...last time i got mezzed i don't seem to remember being able to use hotkeys or getting into inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you missed my point<br />
<br />
as soon as PvP even looks like happening i drink a wort potion anyway, because it gives me extra hp to play with....but....<br />
<br />
the increase in hp is temperory - they wear off with each tick, so its kinda like a dot - i was wondering if this effect would break mez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarcoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the effect just wears off, so it wont break mezz. Cast a real dot on yourself, instead...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've heard that it DOES work (if you drink it before mezz lands!). Apparently mezz only checks to see if your hitpoints are going down rather than checking to see if there's a dot on you. This may well have been changed in a recent patch, my info is both old and second-hand, so do take it with a pinch of salt.<br />
<br />
All I can say is try it and see if its changed!<br />
<br />
I must say, with my alchemy at around 60 these are the only things that make me want to even think about spending plat on raising it. For emergency situations, especially when soloing, a 10 shot of these in my bag would be invaluable. For now though, I think I'd rather just pay 100pp for a rezz :D Maybe when I'm richer....<br />
<br />
I'm most disapointed (but not surprised) at the lack of anything significant for alchemy in PoP. It shows that it is dead as far as the developers are concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cripple et all don't break mez, but lowers over all hps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What has &quot;Cripple&quot; got to do with anything?<br />
<br />
This thread is about the spell effect Calimony, which is the effect of drinking a Stinging Wort Potion.<br />
<br />
When you drink the potion you get an instantaneous 300hp increase in both current hp and total hp (i.e a 300hp heal and a 300hp buff)<br />
<br />
However, these additional 300hp wear off over time, so that effectively, you own Hp decrease back to their initial value in a way that is very similar to the hp reducing effect of a DoT.<br />
<br />
It is well known that DoTing yourself prior to PvP will prevent you from being mezzed. I was interested to discover whether or not the DoT-like hp decrease from Calimony would have a similar effect. Cripple has nothing to do with it<br />
<br />
Kthxbi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cripple (http://lucy.fnord.net:80/spell.html?id=1592&amp;source=Live) doesn't affect HP anyway. It debuffs Dex, Agi, Str, and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thought cripple also reduced STA, which in turns decreases HPS?<br />
<br />
Sorry, looked back though spells, dis-empower reduces STA, Cripple doesn't.  Damn, call me a newbie =P<br />
<br />
So anyway, someone try out getting mezzed with Calimony on yet to see if it works?  Or just feel like speculating and bitching?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This might actually make this potion usefull.<br />
<br />
Pity it costs 800 plat to make per 10dose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IG toes arent exactly rare drops. Camp em myself, or buy em from people ther for 6 or 7 plat each. Ther herbs cost 33plat. Even assuming 10% failure, that means 363 - 440plat per 10 shot?</div></div><hr />
