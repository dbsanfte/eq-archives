<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is something I think will help out the community of players in everquest.  Currently the situation with Ragefire and his spawn rate is something that causes too much contention in this game.  We play a game that is designed to make us interact and work with each other.  With the reduction of ragefire pops there has become an increasingly hostile environment for clerics who wish to complete their epic.  Guilds themselves have become a part of the fight for ragefire and it is causing friends to contest each other and in the end leaves everyone involved with a bad taste in their mouth.  We each pay Verant money so that we can sit down and play a game. When we log off the game it should only be with a feeling of happiness and with memories of good times.  The ragefire spawn though leaves one to log off feeling bitter, disgusted and completly frustrated with the game.  Because of this I want to try to fix the situation.  I am asking that all players send an email to the following addresses to let verant know that we are not happy with the ending of the cleric epic.  <br />
<br />

<br />
  If you want you can just copy and paste the following to your email.<br />
<br />
  I am a player of Everquest.  I am asking the designers at Verant to please come up with a better solution for the ending of the cleric epic.  The current spawn rate and accessibilty of Ragefire causes contention and fights among people that normaly are friends.  It is my belief that the spirit of the game is something that wants us to work together and to interact with others.  Ragefire as he now is designed almost forces players to go against each other and leads to bitter feelings for everyone.  Please consider the situation as it now stands and look for a solution that will not pit friends against friends.  Thank you for your time and have a good day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I do not know if Verant will listen to us or not, but I do know that I feel we must try to do something.  The way things are now with Ragefire simply stink.  More then one person I know says the camp is painful and wish something would be done about it.  Well now is the time for us to try to do something about it.  This message is being posted on as many boards as I can find that are related to Everquest.  Let your friends know and have them send Verant an email.  If nothing else is done atleast we will have voiced our opinons and have tried to fix the problem as best we can.  Thank you all for your time and may you have good hunting and safe journies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or you could just follow the listing system that some servers do...though at this stage I wonder how possible it would be to institute anything like a list on sevrers not used to using them.  And even with lists there are occasional problems.  Morrell Thule has a whole set of rules regarding the Ragefire spawn and the entire server generally abides by them, with the occasional hiccup.  (Which in my humble opinion is what makes MT such a nice server to play on).  Even with those little hiccups, it streamlines the process and avoids guildwars and gripes.<br />
<br />
As an aside, cleric or shaman, we all play this game.  Might be nice to band together and help our fellow players petition for something that effects guilds and individuals game-wide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been involved in two Ragefire camps.  One the old Sol B way and one the new SF way.  There was NO real difference between the two.  Both were heavilly contested.  Both had my friend clerics camping the spawn for hours(in Sol B 5 days with 12 hours offline for the cleric) the SF camp is typically shorter lately been sub 24 hours after a server/zone bounce.  <br />
<br />
The SF camp ended with 3 guilds/alliances holding vigil.  As we were getting the invites finalized on our fourth group, and making sure our cleric was in a KS group, Talendor paid a visit to us.  Our whole Raid party was wiped, along with one of the other raid parties after Rage.  One of our ranger that was bound in the zone agrod zoradicus and proceeded to kite him to buy time for us to regroup after being trained.  As we were regrouping the third alliance had recovered from Talendor and attacked Zoradicus and in fact finished off Ragefire.  In the end the GM ruled that since our ranger had engaged zoradicus, by kiting him, the third alliance had KS'd us.  The GM took the heart from the cleric who looted Rage, and gave it to our cleric.  All in all a good thing for our cleric, but it has been an accepted rule on most servers that the first party with the force on the scene gets Ragefire.  While we were the first with force before the Talendor Train, we clearly had not recovered as fast as the folks who took him down.  The alliance that was called KS'ers were going on the first with force principle, while the GM followed the strict &quot;engaged MOB&quot; rule.  I would bet that with 20 different GM's you would have several different resolutions for that situation.  <br />
<br />
The other thing of note in this instance, as soon as Zoradicus spawned there were 3 guides in the zone.  They were expecting trouble.  That fact in itself should make it evident they really do need to do something about the cleric epic.<br />
<br />
oh and we learned that next time we camp Ragefire, we kill Talendor early in the day to prevent unscrupulous guilds from training him.</div></div><hr />

Lists suck.  Period.  They are nice and orderly but you cannot enforce them.  In fact, there is nothing you can really enforce in EQ.  Its a dog eat dog world in Norrath, if you can't hold your own you don't belong.  <br />
<br />
For your last sentance...All servers had no list at one point, they all start off equally.  Implementing one isn't hard at all, and I doubt there is any server with a perfect score of ppl abiding by a list.  13+ months for an item? get real.  lists rank right up there with calendars.  sukka only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The cleric epic is, without question, the most powerful epic inthe game.  It makes raids happen, and fast.  VI has admitted that RF is a poorly planned encounter and that the camp sucks.  But, they have also said they have no intention of changing it.  As the most powerful epic in the game, they are not going to let one per day be completed on every server in the game.<br />
<br />
I have camped RF with people and it sucks ass.  But you can petition, email, beg, plead, and whatever else you want to do until you are blue in the face.  Even if they change the encounter it will not speed up the process.  ~6-8 epics per server per month is right where they want to be.  And, I think, if you were to go back to the epic quest developers they would tell you they wish the cleric epic had never been made with a 56 res....it is just soooo powerful.<br />

War, I doubt a single thread in the general section about Ragefire is going to suddenly make us a haven for (gasp) clerics.  You can always put your hands over your eyes and say 'LA LA LA' really loud if it bothers you that much ;).<br />
<br />
But to keep on topic...<br />
<br />
Enforcing a calendar or list isn't an issue if you have a server that thrives on respect.  But that's all moot and not the issue at stake here...<br />
<br />
Someone was looking for some support in drumming up a repsonse to Verant about making some alterations to the ragefire epic.  I think it's in everyone's interest to do so.  Should every issue deserve this attention?  I think not.  The Ragefire issues are pretty pivotal, especially in guild situations.  And apathy is SO 90's;)<br />

<br />
This couldn't be anymore true.  For many guilds, he's still a challenge or takes quite a bit of preparation.  Not every guild has manaburners, which in fact makes the situation worse.  An entire guild could be camping Ragefire for 6 days just to be ganked at the last minute by a group of manaburners.  At that point, it doesn't really matter if the original guild was capable of killing RF with ease or not, the manaburners would inevitably ks exp.<br />
<br />
That example was maybe a little extreme though, but consider this: you have 2 equally respectable and powerful guilds camping RF, both chipping in the same amount of time and effort.  In cases like those, it's basically &quot;may the best man win&quot; type of scenario.  But here's the problem:  say guild A and guild B both have the same numbers and approximate levels.  If Guild A has 1 manaburner present and Guild B has 0, odds are highly in Guild A's favour for scoring the kill, and that's just not right.  <br />
<br />
When manaburn is involved, it's not even about the skill and healthy competition anymore.  It's entirely dependent on one class that has to click one button.  He's not doing doing jack the whole day because he's afraid rf will pop at any minute and wants to stay fm.  All he does is cast one spell, and boom his job his done and people like consider him a hero and erect shrines for him and stuff.<br />
<br />
Sorry for venting off btw, I hate manaburn with a passion, except if it betters my guild's cause :D :D :D</div></div><hr />

Ragefire<br />

Ixbalt and Chardok can be done at any time since the mobs are always up every 2 hours.  That's no bottleneck.<br />

If joo look at the percentage of lvl 60s with epic classes like shaman, druid, and rogue are high on the list...  clerics are near the top also.  Then go look at the epic count among bards, shadow knights or even warriors.<br />
<br />
Cleric epic is already fairly easy.  That is not the problem at all.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the cleric epic has an enourmous impact on the raid.  Remove that impact and joo remove the problem of contention over the RF spawn....<br />

For the benefit of the people here.. I'll explain why I'm sick of hearing about Cleric Epics.<br />
<br />
It's an out-dated item.<br />
<br />
The Cleric Epic was a groundbreaking improvement in Raiding a year and a half ago.  But this was during a time of Single Cast Aego, and when people thought your FT was Hoss when you had a Brain/Eye of Cazic.<br />
<br />
In top Raiding Guilds, there are Clerics with the following Mana Regen stats.....<br />
<br />
KEI (14) + Mental Clarity (3) + Blessed Armour (6) + FT 1-15 + Bardsong (10?)<br />
<br />
The there's Necros, Modrod 2's Etc, Etc, Etc.<br />
<br />
Clerics with a Standing Manaregen of over 30 is not uncommon anymore.<br />
<br />
Weapon-wise, there are Many weapons for Clerics that are BETTER than the Epic...  Sprinkler, Blackstar, Hammer of the Sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the Day&quot;, you wanted every Cleric in your guild to have his Epic.  Now... 2-3 may be sufficient.     The time where once a Cleric passed level 55 it was his &quot;turn&quot; to get put into a list to get his Click Stick is past.  <br />
<br />
This is why I get tired of hearing about Cleric Epics... because they are no longer a &quot;must have&quot; item.<br />
<br />
Then of course.. there's Mass Group Buffing....  One Cleric with 4000 Mana is all it takes to Buff your raid.  Done.<br />
<br />
The Cleric Epic was implemented to help curtail the Huge amounts of Mana needed to get a raid going after a wipeout.   A good Wipeout used to mean at least an hour or more before you were ready for another attempt at X-mob.<br />
<br />
Now, myself and one Cleric with MGB can have 65 people salted and ready to raid in under 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The Cleric Epic was an item MONTHS ahead of it's time in terms of Effectiveness.. but the Rest of EQ is catching up to the Cleric Epic now.<br />

-Recovering from a wipeout in hostile territory, BEFORE repops<br />
-Not taking 3 hours to res 40 people<br />
<br />
Cleric epic has little to do with mana conservation, it has to do with time.  <br />
<br />
Lists:<br />
My guild has 0 cleric epics, we are perfectly capable of killing ragefire, but he doesnt live for more than 30 seconds, and when he pops we rarely have the people online and willing to get there fast enough.  Although I have no worries that we will eventually get one.   Having to wait a year to get one would suck hard though.  I think lists/calendars/reservationsystemakalegendsgimpserver are worth less than poo, and I am grateful that Veeshan is above that crap.<br />
<br />
Customer Service:<br />
Guides/GM's are worthless on this issue.  A LOOOOOONG time ago the head GM of the server declared that ragefire was not a camp and it was strictly a first in force rule on our server (Veeshan).  Countless disputes pop up all the time, but they are always handled under this assumption by the customer service reps and the guilds.  Well the other day rage was due to pop and my guild finally had enough people on at the right time to camp him.  We sent a group over to kill GW's and check out the camp situation.  We got there and no &quot;force&quot; was in the zone other than ours.  About 2 hours later some pos guide shows up and makes us random for the zone against 4 other clerics.  The cleric who won was the only member of their guild even on-line at the time.  Guide Nalarie told us to leave, and we did.  HAHAH rage didn't even spawn that day, thanks for saving us the time, but *** is with randoming for a camp for a mob that MIGHT spawn in the next 2 days.  <br />

They also know that once it was implemented, they could never take it out or the outrage would be phenomenal.   But they sure are not (Capital N O T) going to make Cleric epics any Easier that they already have.   <br />

Just prepare your guild.. have someone Box a Druid in Skyfire or something and the moment he pop.. paratroop like Army Recon into Skyfire and blast him...  Don't wait, just do it.    <br />
<br />
You've said it yourself, he's been declared FCFS on your server, so just do it. Petitioning that he doesn't spawn Enough, Close enough to a Zone, When you're online or with the proper triple scoop of Ice Cream you want is doing nothing for you.  Just get together 30 people and blast him into Oblivion.<br />
<br />
TIme spent Arguing with me is not going to put that Sprinkler in your hand any faster.   So good luck and godspeed, I hope you get it.<br />

Lists suck.  Period.  They are nice and orderly but you cannot enforce them.  In fact, there is nothing you can really enforce in EQ.  Its a dog eat dog world in Norrath, if you can't hold your own you don't belong.  <br />

While I generally don't agree with Wildaar (I'm not nearly cutthroat enough to), he's right.<br />
<br />
List fekkin suck. I'm on TM and our list is so half ass.  My guild has NO clickers, and we potentially CAN take out Rage when he would pop.  Only the top five guilds on our server do not follow the list, but those top five KS one out of every three RF spawns.  Irritating. It makes it longer of a wait for the rest of us who are trying to honor this half ass list.  The damn moderator of the list doesnt' even moderate it anymore, some deputy of his in his guild does. :P<br />
<br />
One of our clerics is RL friends with the guild maintaining the list, so we can't really go in and KS it, much to my chagrin.<br />
<br />
I'm really more pissed off at VI for making such a sloppy implementation of an epic mob.  There HAS to be a better way to do it, and they KNOW it...take some damn programmer and hook him up to the Jolt cola IV and get to work on it....jerks...<br />
<br />
/big fat rude to VI<br />
<br />
And one other thing....just what KIND of pudding do you have there Wildaar? ;)</div></div><hr />

Um, Azmodai, which quote of Wildaar's are you agreeing with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Here is a quote from the Steel Warrior version of this post that is perfect:<br />
<br />
Some people will never understand scarcity. Verant wants cleric epics to come into the game at a certain rate. If everyone was supposed to have them, just put em on a vendor for 50kplat. Since VI decided that they want them to come into the world at a maximum fixed rate, they set up the Ragefire spawn. It seems like a good implementation.<br />
<br />
Would you rather that all the clerics on the server who are ready for ragefire be summoned to CSHome once every 4-7 days and have the GM play ene-meanie-miney-moe? Competition lets the players sort out who wants it the most. <br />
<br />
Yes EQ is a game, but like it or not, it is a competitive game. There is scarcity in Norrath and THAT is the only reason anything in the game has value, or feels like an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what VI does, there are simply too many clerics trying to get an epic at once. Because of the fact that cleric epics are so usefull to guilds and because of the fact that they are limited in number, we the players are the ones who make this spawn suck a problem. <br />
<br />
Does the same problem exist with Sev? Does the same problem exist with Phinigel? Does the same problem exist with Gorenaire?Is the problem nearly as bad in those cases? If not, why not? <br />
<br />
Maybe its because the epic drops from those mobs aren't as high of a priority for most guilds.<br />
<br />
Competition isn't created by VI, it is created by us. VI simply sets the rarity of items and spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Erathlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">To those of you giving grief to the person who posted this message I hope you reconsider.   Ragefire is such a screwed up spawn/example of EQ gone wrong that it would do good for VI to make the situation better somehow...  Help your best eq friend camp ragefire twice, 70+ hour camps both times, only to have the camp blatantly stolen away and you might understand better.  (/grumble manaburn ks'ing wizards).  I pity clerics who don't have their epic and are interested in getting it, solely because of how ragefire is set up.  No one &quot;needs&quot; their epic, but compared to the difficulty of a lot of other epics and the importance of the cleric epic, the ragefire spawn completely blows.</div></div><hr />

The Cleric Epic was a groundbreaking improvement in Raiding a year and a half ago.  But this was during a time of Single Cast Aego, and when people thought your FT was Hoss when you had a Brain/Eye of Cazic.<br />
<br />
In top Raiding Guilds, there are Clerics with the following Mana Regen stats.....<br />
<br />
KEI (14) + Mental Clarity (3) + Blessed Armour (6) + FT 1-15 + Bardsong (10?)<br />
<br />
The there's Necros, Modrod 2's Etc, Etc, Etc.<br />
<br />
Clerics with a Standing Manaregen of over 30 is not uncommon anymore.<br />
<br />
Weapon-wise, there are Many weapons for Clerics that are BETTER than the Epic...  Sprinkler, Blackstar, Hammer of the Sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the Day&quot;, you wanted every Cleric in your guild to have his Epic.  Now... 2-3 may be sufficient.     The time where once a Cleric passed level 55 it was his &quot;turn&quot; to get put into a list to get his Click Stick is past.  <br />
<br />
This is why I get tired of hearing about Cleric Epics... because they are no longer a &quot;must have&quot; item.<br />
<br />
Then of course.. there's Mass Group Buffing....  One Cleric with 4000 Mana is all it takes to Buff your raid.  Done.<br />
<br />
The Cleric Epic was implemented to help curtail the Huge amounts of Mana needed to get a raid going after a wipeout.   A good Wipeout used to mean at least an hour or more before you were ready for another attempt at X-mob.<br />
<br />
Now, myself and one Cleric with MGB can have 65 people salted and ready to raid in under 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
The Cleric Epic was an item MONTHS ahead of it's time in terms of Effectiveness.. but the Rest of EQ is catching up to the Cleric Epic now.<br />

I like this post because it exemplifies several things that I have been saying about the cleric epic all along.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about the mana regen portion of your post first War.  So were saying that with all the alternatives for mana regeneration it lowers the value of the effect of the cleric epic.  To all the people that have been saying this is the best effect in the game War and I stick our tongues out at you. :)  War has just given the perfect reason why the ragefire spawn should not be like it is.  The cleric epic effect is not worth the hassle that VI is putting us through to get it.  <br />
<br />
Now here's the downside, War mentioned &quot;In the top raiding guilds&quot;.  Heres the deal the &quot;top raiding guilds&quot; really never had a problem getting people their epics.  They just went in (and still do) and took them.  Where does this leave the middle-tiered guilds?  If you say that they don't deserve the epic as much as the &quot;top raiding guilds&quot; then let me ask you this...Does Redhat have a right to sell an operating system since Microsoft obviously has the stranglehold in the OS market?  Should we go back to Ma Bell ruling the phone lines?  Only Jello should be allowed to make gelatinious products?  McDonalds the only place to sell hamburgers?  You get the idea.  The &quot;top raiding guilds&quot; do not need the epic the mid-level guilds do.  But who do you usually see farming the damn things?  I'll let you figure that out  yourselves.  The point is if we base a present day sub-par epic in a monopoly type situation (the strongest eat the weakest for lunch) then we totally disintegrate friendly competition in the future.  Some may love to see that happen.  Some may be perfectly content with their station in EQ life.  Why piss on the fires of the ones who do have a dream of reaching the higher plateaus of the eq environment?<br />
<br />
Others on every board that I have visited concerning this topic have bitched and moaned about how &quot;easy&quot; the cleric epic is.  See the above paragraph.  Easy but with &quot;cheesy and outdated&quot; effect.  First of all we know that no one on the Shaman board should even open their mouth at all on this one.  Second of all, I believe not one cleric is bitching about how hard the epic is.  They are bitching about the situation VI has put the epic-bound cleric and his/her guild in.  Mind-numbing camp_100 is the lazy-programmer way of doing something quick.  We should all know that.  To top it off after a 7 day wait you have no idea who is going to come in and crap all over a weeks work.  Yep I said work.  I helped my wife camp Rage for 119 hours.  We and other friends did it in shifts and slept on average 5 hours a day.  Afterwards, I was so burned out on this game that I didn't log in for almost 2 weeks and very nearly quit altogether.  *** is so so epic about that.  Let me answer for you...Not a GD thing!  Someone on the safehouse posted about the Ragebringer being the easiest epic in the game but it was probably the only one done right.  It involved different skills and didn't actually involve to any great degree sitting on your hind end for 7 days!!!  If VI could start redoing these stupid epic quests and make them all like the Ragebringer maybe we could leave all these discussions behind us.  <br />
<br />
As the population ages, so does the &quot;need&quot; for epics but guess what, most people still want them.  It is one of the biggest &quot;main&quot; goals that people have in this game other than reaching sixty.  And before I get all the &quot;I just play EQ for fun and I don't let this stuff about goals and getting this and getting that get to me&quot;.  I say BS otherwise you'd still be wearing cloth and running around EC giving people hugs.  Whether you like it or not there are goals in this game that everyone strives for and it just so happens that questing an epic is very important goal for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Send in the email.  What can it hurt?  I better take a &quot;work break&quot; now and get something useful done.  Once again thanks War for helping prove a lot of points that needed to be proved.<br />
