<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject: Five Surgeons<br />
<br />
Five surgeons are discussing who makes the best patients to operate on.<br />
<br />
The first surgeon says, &quot;I like to see accountants on my operating table,because when you open them up, everything inside is numbered.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second responds, &quot;Yeah, but you should try electricians. Everything inside them is color-coded.&quot;<br />
<br />
The third surgeon says, &quot;No, I really think librarians are the best; everything inside them is in alphabetical order.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fourth surgeon chimes in: &quot;You know, I like construction workers.<br />
<br />
They always understand when you have a few parts left over at the end and when the job takes longer than you said it would.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the fifth surgeon, Dr. Morris Fishbein, shuts them all up when he observes: &quot;The French are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no balls and no spine. Plus the head and ass are interchangeable.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And to think - all those years we've been horribly maligning the Polish when it should have been the French...<br />
<br />
I hereby apologize to every person of Polish descent that has never peeled an M&amp;M - apparently, it's a French thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, that was funny.<br />
<br />
But I don't get this French hate thing thats now going on.<br />
<br />
You check out whats going on in Baghdad right now.........see their point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lmao that's hilarious :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They seem to forget that when Paris was liberated, there was looting, too.  Same for when the Berlin Wall fell; East Berlin was near-gutted.<br />
<br />
Only thing different:  Folks were not afraid to restore peace.  Now, if we go to bust some looters or help a little old lady or a young mom with her kids, one of them is apt to push a button and blow himself/herself up in an attempt to take out people whose only concern was doing the right thing and helping their fellow man... which, curiously, is one of the pillars of islam (charity)</div></div><hr />

 It si simple, we hate the French because they are an evil, immoral bunch of traitors and should be stapled to a cross for their treachery. And, they are wrong, wrong about everything.<br />
<br />
 Iraqis are happy as hell man, if you lives in absolute poverty, when the evil men go away, you would  take some loot too.<br />
<br />
 And, iraqi's are now involved in policing the looting. If France had their way, saddam would stil be torturing children, and France would be happy and smug knowing they thwarted the USA, hell they probably order child torture videos from Iraq, the slimy pricks.<br />
<br />
Mill, France hater</div></div><hr />

Ok, wtg stereotypes.  Firstly, the french are not evil, immoral bastards, and are only traitors in the sense that they dont give respect where it is do.  They never signed a contract saying 'We will do whatever the US wants', or something of that nature, so how the hell are they traitors.  If they were evil, then we would have bombed the **** out of them, not Saddam.  No, they are merely people which have lost the respect of the good majority of Americans for their incessant dribble.<br />
<br />
Im sure plenty of Iraqi's are not dancing in the streets like you see on Fox.  Im sure they are a hell of a lot happier then they were with Saddam in power, but clearly there are some who would rather us not be there.  A large percentage of the Iraqi people distrust the US for what we did in the Gulf; not finish the job.  For every couple people who dance in the streets, there are some who fight back.<br />
<br />
If you actually believe that the French would watch torture videos, then i dont even know why i am bothering to write this.  If that was said with even the slightest honesty, or you believing that one tiny bit, then you my friend, are an idiot.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Your post has been maybe the most arrogantly ignorant thing i have ever read, and made worse by hiding behind the mask of being 'patriotic'.  I dislike the French for their policy's, their blatant lack of disrespect, their overall bad hygene, etc, but too say all this stuff, and actually mean it, is mindboggling.  Maybe you should get out of Texas, or wherever you are from, and actually go to France.  They are largely cowards, or arrogant punks, but hardly a collective evil, as you seem to believe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The joke is funy because it is true.<br />
<br />
The French are spinless, castrated cowards who supported Iraq for personal profit and oil.<br />
<br />
The French need to be spanked hard for the crap they pulled.  No way in hell should they be given any role in post war Iraq after the support the gave to the former dictator.  Same goes for Germany and Rusia and the UN.<br />
<br />
The new Iraq also need to ignore any debts that Sadum acrued from those nations.  France and crowd benfited from opressing the people of Iraq and it is now time for them to pay.<br />
<br />
France chose to be a slut and to spread her legs wide for Sadum....  let her sleap in the bed of her own choosing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looting is the natural thing done after you are free, it is the &quot;liberation of goods&quot;<br />
<br />
If you notice, MOST of what was looted was the government buildings, where all of Iraq's money went and people have given at least some of the stuff looted back.<br />
<br />
Now with an actual police force, Baghdad and other cities can go back to peaceful living.<br />
<br />
And if the UN wants in on IRAQ, I'd tell them to get to stepping, you have Russia, France and N. Korea to work on now.<br />
<br />
Thanks to our Iraq liberation, N. Korea isn't so hardline.  That's what giving a dictator an ass whuppun' does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree.  New-Iraq wipes the slate clean, including debts.  As a PR move, i dont think bush would try to tax the Iraqi people by making them pay the old debts anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once the french start desecrating the graves of British servicemen who died for france, ya, I would say the population is evil.<br />

I didn't see frenchmen protesting that.<br />
<br />
<br />
face it, they liked Saddam, tried to keep them in power so they could save their precious oil contracts and other ilegal goods. Their buddies russia have been actively supplying intelligence training and equipment to Iraq. They harbor Iraqis and help them escape.<br />
<br />
What more evidence to I need, do i really need a frenchmen to burn down my house before I can declare them evil?<br />
<br />
They are the trash of the planet, and deserve to be treated as such. And they will, mark my words, they will not get away with this.<br />

I am a Texan but much to my shame I was born in VT and grew up in Mass.<br />
<br />
I am not a native Texan but I got hear as quick as I could.<br />

Every time I go up north to visit family, I contantly feel the lack of personal freedom.  Just watching the news on the TV at my Grandparents home in Ipswitch makes me so glad I live in Texas.<br />

Texas version of Servival....<br />

Make the contestants drive pink volvoes with Mass plates from Dallas to Houston to Brownvill to ElPaso and back to Dallas with an assortment of bumper stickers.... &quot;Gay Power&quot;, &quot;Clinton in 2004&quot;, &quot;Guns Kill support the Brady Bill&quot;,  &quot;Visualize would Peace&quot; and so on  :).</div></div><hr />

Thats crap. <br />
<br />
What was the main reason that the co-lition went into Iraq? Freedom? They said that we fought for freedom of speech etc. If France can't agree with something that they don't like without people calling them traitors, then everything that we're trying to fight for falls by the wayside.<br />
<br />
Millman, you obviously ain't got a clue, and you have got something shoved too far up your ass for your own good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What was the main reason that the co-lition went into Iraq? <br />
<br />
Ok first, it's &quot; coalition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Secondly, we went into Iraq because the past 20 years proved: a) Saddam can't be 'contained,' b) Saddam can't be 'deterred,' c) Saddam was in violation of various (last count 17) un resolutions, d) Saddam continued to advance his WMD acquisitions in violation of c), and e) Saddam has expressed a continual hatred for the United States.<br />
<br />
Oh and he has a history of using these weapons on people.<br />
<br />
france is otf. Out there flappin. Cya. Forget the unsc, forget nato. chirac has done more to hurt the french diplomatically and economically than he ever imagined.<br />
<br />
Welcome to bit-player-ville you grave desecrating feks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Mozeley <br />
 <br />
take you long to think that up? haha, talk about clueless.<br />
<br />
17 resolutions and 12 years of openly defying the UN, that is what France supports, and yes, it is fact they are arrogant rude sons of bitches with no balls.<br />
<br />
I have more of a clue then the entire population of France, and last I looked, I actually still had testicles.<br />
