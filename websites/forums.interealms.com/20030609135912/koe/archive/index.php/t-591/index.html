<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We will be hosting a mid level (29 to 40) event at the Crystal Caverns in EW. <br />
<br />
KOE and petitioners welcome. <br />
<br />
Start time is 7. Please form by 6:45 PM CST outside the Rygor fort. <br />
<br />
There will (hopefully) be a command team.<br />
<br />
No limit on participants; we will form groups and send out hunting parties in the dungeon. This is not a true raid, but rather KOE night in Crystal Caverns. Depending on what happens; we might make a run at the spider area in the bottom. (This is the highest level area of the dungeon).<br />
<br />
This is a very nice dungeon with some goodies. Components for the Thur gate potion drop here as well. <br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallandro Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can consider me there.  I cant promise ill still be level 40 at this point, but i will be there for sure.  I will only be able to stay till 11pm cst at the latest due to work.  This should be a lot of fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>razma taz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Klydon I'd like to go on this run but I'm not sure yet if I will be off work.  I will contact you in game monday if I can make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wanna come :)<br />
Level 40 mage.. yeah, I'll still be 40, heh<br />
As with the others... it all depends on my night, even though it looks free right now, I always forget about something and I might not be... so I'm interested, but it all depends</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm.. well, can't say that I am overwhelmed by the response.. I did not give a lot of notice, so lets change this to &quot;Is anyone interested in having a midlevel event and where?&quot;, instead of doing one this time around.<br />
<br />
Post below.. Thanks to those that did sign up, but I don't think a couple people make a raid..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My cable was down a lot this weekend and I did not get a chance to check this. Becidian is interested in any events that include a lvl 40 Cleric. Tonight though I need to get Bemidian out of HS where I was out when I went LD last night. After that I am up for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kanaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to head out to a mid level night at CC or anywhere else.  So count me in and so long as RL doesnt interfere I will be there.  ;) <br />
<br />
Kanaa<br />
Level 30 Necromancer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would love to join you guys pretty much anywhere.  I am not working this week because of finals for school, so I expect to be online quite a bit looking for you guys.  Basically, I am in the same boat as Kanaa...as long as real life doesn't interfere, you can count on me being in on pretty much anything.  &quot;Real Life&quot; for me will usually interfere during the week, but I am certainly available on weekends.<br />
<br />
Hoarmurath Urdar<br />
41st Dwarven Brewe...Cleric<br />
<br />
P.S. Did I mention I have a couple of alts?  Of course not, since I didn't want to confuse the whole getting-into-the-guild process, but I have a 23rd level Monk that may be a good fit for certain events...anything that will get me in a group with you guys. :)</div></div><hr />
