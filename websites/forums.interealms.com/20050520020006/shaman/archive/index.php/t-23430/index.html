<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is the first time I have failed to buy an expansion at time of release and I for one think that this expansion is nothing but an attempt to nerf the shaman class out of existance or into the realm of the buff Bot.<br />
<br />
1. The spells given to the shaman appear nice from the outside but on closer examination we see better spells being given to other classes at an ealier level. Why do people need a shaman when they got a druid which can snare out heal us and buff as well as us several levels before us.<br />
<br />
But we have slow! (I hear you cry) In the last 2 tipt raids i did the mob died before i could malos and slow it. My only perpose on that raid was to malo the chanters pet each time it broke snare. In short I felt like a spare wheel on a car with brand new tiers.<br />
<br />
2. The AA's though uninspiring would be nice if the shamans where not so fudundelmentally flawed before they introduced them. AA's should not make or break a class they should complement it.<br />
<br />
3. All are balancing suggests have been flobbed off with currently under review or will be reviewed when omens has been released. In short this is customer service speak for go away we don't won't to speak to you any more.<br />
<br />
I have been giving serious though to doing the follow<br />
<br />
/petion can you turn my 65 shaman into a 65 &lt;other class here&gt; with same number of aa's <br />
<br />
Well maybe i will do that just to see if the message hits home<br />
<br />
One seriously upset shaman<br />
<br />
P.S. if you order omens then cancel it. this will probably have more effect then just not ordering it as will show up as lost revenue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is my basic path of thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give up. Enjoy your shaman for what he is. Buy WoW the day it comes out.<br />
<br />
The shaman of old is gone, EQ of old is gone. There is nothing left to do at this point but accept things for how they are and stop being upset and ebrace and enjoy the final days of your time with EQ. <br />
<br />
There is a time to fight against a idea like a rabid dog, there is a time to put things to rest and move on. I believe the time to fight is now past. It was a valiante effort on our part, but SoE has made it clear how they are going to remain, how they give nothing but words with lil action.<br />
<br />
This is why i dont post here much anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exactly my thinking on the issue.  I can still enjoy playing Ubex even though he stacks poorly on raids, doesn't contribute much in GoD where group is using Chanter or Druid pet, and has more competition for the slowing role.  I will buy OOW either by pre-order or at the store and have fun exploring the new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But we have slow!

<br />
The simple solution is to... do it without a chanter pet.  And if the mob is dead before you even attempt to malos... then you are waiting far far too long to get it slowed.  That **** won't fly in KT or beyond and you won't have a fancy charmed pet to help you after Tipt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While I remain the only class capable of soloing in Solro (Pre-time and GoD gear) im happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to be in that boat too.. tipt just is ass for us.. how do you think the rogue feels, the wizard? Their best nuke is 3k pre tipt, the pet does 1200dps.. it's only one event guy, and you're doing it one particular way...</div></div><hr />
