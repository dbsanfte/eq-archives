<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was looking through my guild boards archives and I found this little gem...<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045036.html <br />
<br />
Doesn't really get too good until page 3 when Bracy pipes in. It has something to do with slow, the space-time continuum, time bubbles, shaman with higher DPS than wizards, and the futility of arguing with a brick wall. I think.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xishi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sebanis, Shame on you!  You should have posted a disclaimer to protect new shaman like myself.   I officially started having a nervous tick when I read the following comment from Bracy:<br />
<br />
If I cast Haste on a &quot;DPS Class&quot; that counts toward *my* DPS. It is damage that would not be dealt without me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow.  Bracy is just... Wow.</div></div><hr />

Alas, DPS is simply how much DAMAGE PER SECOND is done. <br />

<br />
Both you and Ardak seem incapable of comprehending the simple fact that Slow has the effect of slowing TIME. With slow, a single second spans the course of several seconds, allowing a Shaman to get in several hits before being hit in return. The effect is virtually identical to Dual Wield/Double Attack.<br />
<br />
It's so incredibly simple.... <br />
<br />
ROFL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, I actually understand Bracy's point of view. I must be stoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I couldn't continue reading that drivel for long... but while I did, I was surprised to see no one bring up that slowing a mob would actually reduce your DPS because the mob isn't hitting your damage shield as much.  Even in xp groups you can get some damage shields pretty high if you have the right stackable click ds items and a druid/mage.   Depending on the mob you are fighting, sometimes its better to not bother slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Truly weird.  Bracy needs to come to the Crucible and air his ideas here, where the friendly and loving culture of mutually supportive shaman can gently set him straight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, I actually understand Bracy's point of view. I must be stoned.<br />
<br />
I really dont want to start it here too lol, but I really fail to see the point. What the problem is, is Bracy is making his/her OWN definiton for DPS, one time as a ratio between your damage output and mob's output, another time as the total increase in damage done by the group as a result of adding a shaman. Now, not saying those two things aren't things to consider, the whole point is, is that they are NOT DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was able to read the first page of Bracy's thoughts.  After that my head really really started hurting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, let's do it this way, since you still don't get it:<br />

<br />
Seems like Bracy just didn't recognize that in huge portions of the game, this just isn't the case, and this is where DPS measurement counts.  The inability to realize that everyone else is talking about a totally different concept is mind-boggling though.</div></div><hr />

A lot of classic lines, but for some reason this gem really had me howling:<br />
<br />
Under your definition, how can anyone classify a Wizard as a &quot;DPS Class&quot; when there are more seconds which elapse in the course of a battle in which the Wizard does *NO* damage than there are in which he DOES damage?</div></div><hr />

They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-haaa<br />

happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats and they're<br />
coming to take me away, ha-haaa!!!!! <br />

You thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed when I had said<br />
that loosing you would make me flip my lid.. RIGHT???<br />
I know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed you laughed and<br />
laughed and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad... And..<br />
<br />
<br />
They're coming to take me away, ha-haaa,<br />
They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-haaa.<br />
To the happy home. With trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">lmfao, heres a gem<br />
<br />
Yes, and when a shaman casts buffs on a melee which allows the melee to do extra damage, a percentage of that melee's damage output becomes the Shaman's weapon. To a certain degree, the melee becomes the shaman's pet.<br />
<br />
If a druid casts a damage shield on a shaman, and that shaman does extra damage to a mob as a result of that damage shield, then the damage is shield is equivalent to a Druid's weapon. The shaman, to a certain degree, becomes the Druid's pet. It is damage that is exhibited as a result of the Druid's ability, not the Shaman's.</div></div><hr />

but i do agree. that a shaman can deal out some very nice DPS.  if you want i can can copy my post i made on my guild board, but basically a 57 Shaman, with Plauge, Bane of Nife, epic and a JBB can hit about 95 DPS on average. not including dog either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well the ideals that Bracy is writing about are perfectly valid and completely understandable. Too bad it has nothing to do with Damage Per Second.<br />
<br />
I knew the term &quot;DPS class&quot; would eventually lead to trouble. People should not use that term, it's not correct usage. What you people need to say is that you are looking for the classes you seek. &quot;DPS class&quot; just looks like a shallow attempt to put too much of an intellectual slant on a mere game. Basically it shows that someone has read too many message boards.<br />
<br />
Of course we always referred to these classes as &quot;damage dealers&quot; as that term is still vague but doesn't conjure up the non-roleplay imagry that &quot;DPS class&quot; does.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">&quot;DPS Class&quot; to me is just shorthand for &quot;high DPS class&quot;.  Duh, every class has DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">The hilarious thing is that I actually do exceed the DPS of most other classes in many groups I am in.  I don't mean this in a wacky hole-in-space-time Bracy way, although I can see his point in solo situations.<br />
<br />
What I mean is that, yes, our DDs are less efficient than other classes, but I can spend 60% of my mana during a fight and still be FM when the next pull comes in.<br />
<br />
Now, there are places where our rains are resisted, but there are many places where they are not.  And if I am casting Tears of Saryn X 2, with Torrent of Poison in the gap on each mob with few resists, thats a good chunk of damage, especially when you figure in the dual wielding hasted pet, who spits out over 30DPS all on his own, even using cheap daggers instead of proccing mage weapons.<br />
<br />
And those rain spells are nice LOW aggro.   I can cast ToS, then ToP, and ToS again and very VERY rarely ever get aggro.<br />
<br />
Now again, this is very situational, and there are situations where it just doesn't work.  In BoT for instance, the resists are just too much to use the rain spells for me, or for that matter any of our damage spells.<br />
<br />
But seriously, those rain spells are some fun stuff in many cases, check em out.<br />
<br />
I couldn't help but notice all the people in that thread talked about DoTs when talking about shaman DPS in exp groups.  In most cases DoTs just arent any good in exp groups.  Soloing is, of course, a different matter.<br />
<br />
-Dredak<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I don't mean to say that I can exceed the DPS of a rogue, for instance, or an uber wizzie with all his AAs, or a proper ranger.  My point is that, in many cases, a shaman really can contribute a good chunk of DPS, to the point where having 2 shamans in a group wouldn't necessarily be inefficient.  <br />
<br />
If I can do 5K in spells over the course of a typical 1 minute PoV exp group fight, then add in my pet DPS, I am contributing around 100 DPS.  With rain spells, torpor, cann 4, cann 5, a horse, and KEI, you can do this and keep it up over a long period of time.</div></div><hr />
