<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most of my LDoN groups are made of at least half guild members, but we often have to fill in spots to get a full group of six.  The most frequent base group I have is a 62 warrior, 62 necro, 61 cleric and myself.  So we look for a couple of good DPS members.  Personally I like rangers.  I played one to 51st level and I have often grouped with a couple of rangers that really know how to play their characters.  However, after grouping with several different pickup rangers my opinion of the class overall is dropping.  <br />
<br />
I know rangers can&#8217;t take the same damage a warrior can, but it&#8217;s amazing how many of them act like their wearing robes instead of armor.  We&#8217;ve actually had a ranger in our group running from a mob when we had only pulled two.  We have a very good cleric who knows how to keep us alive.  Our group often takes six mobs without any trouble.  When I played a ranger I considered myself a tank and it was my job to take the hits.  But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case for many of the rangers we&#8217;ve grouped with of late.<br />
<br />
What really irks me is getting a ranger in our group for DPS and to split tank the adds and all they do is stand at a distance and shoot their bows.  I know that with the right AAs rangers can do a lot of damage with their bows.  But is this really more than they can do with duel wielding?  I guess what I really want to know is if these bow rangers are really doing their job or are they just keeping out of harms way.  I trust the rangers I know but after seeing some very poorly played rangers I&#8217;m just not sure about seeking unknown rangers for our group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the AA's the bow is better DPS. Without them they should be mostly meleeing. I prefer rangers that have played theclass a while, the guys whostuck itout when rangers &quot;sucked&quot;. They willtank, snare, jolt, they know their class. Today there seem to be a TON of PLed rangers who have no clue how to play the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a ranja with EQ/AM3 can rival wizards in DPS with the right bow/arrow.<br />
<br />
and they don't go OOM from it unless they have to jolt after a few crits every minute or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Skilled rangers in LDoN are great to have in a group and hard to come by.  I usually like to have at least one in a LDoN group for the tracking/CC/DPS, but I have managed to pick up a few who were &quot;not sure how track works&quot; and ran off to let me and the cleric tank while they shot some arrows.  I have much luv for channelling! :p<br />
<br />
I don't really think this applies to rangers so much as to the lack of skilled players in general.  EQ has been dumbed-down to the point where most anyone can cruise to 65 and pickup groups can REALLY make this apparent.  Sadly, LDoN is also providing the first &quot;dungeon&quot; experience to quite a few players out there so there are bound to be some pretty challenging groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My main is a 61 ranger so I'd like to comment here.<br />
It's funny how you said that the rangers now are so afraid to take the adds.  I get teased alot because I'm NOT afraid to be MT or tank mezzer.  But did you all think that maybe these rangers are afraid because for years now they've been told they are paper tanks and should NEVER tank?<br />
  I concentrated alot on my rangers AC/HP/STA stats and I made her viable in a tanking situation and I enjoy doing it, but I still get ignorance from some groups that will say, Well the pally should MT since he's a Pally even though he has less HP, less AC and he's 6 levels lower.  Now I would agree with them here if they were the same level since the Pally probably mitigates dmg better but not 6 levels below me.<br />
  It's quite amazing how ignorant most people are about rangers, and how much those ranger jokes affect us.  <br />
  I'm not flaming you by any means Pait, just trying to explain why there may be so many chicken shi* rangers coming around now.<br />
<br />
  Oh and as for the tracking in dungeons, mine is maxed and yet I can't always see the named when we first zone in either, track is very screwy down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My main is a 65 ranger. in ldon two things from my experience; usual group sk mt who aggros all adds and doesnt want me to offtank.  different mt no chanter then i off tank root park etc.  i have very good gear and i get ripped thru even in ldon sometimes.  we kept getting told we cant take hits and used our bows in PoP and sometimes get shouted at for forgetting. id love to use all my tricks but i get shouted at for slowing the speed of completion down.  ive done 21 odd adventures and ill do more but not fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My first main was a ranger, he's 61. I started him back in May 2000, and levelled up through the &quot;rangers suck&quot; era, hoping things would get better by the time I hit 50+, and things did.<br />
<br />
Here's a little history: When Kunark came out, the level cap was raised from 50 to 60, and some skill caps were raised accordingly. However, the tank hybrids defensive skill caps were raised, and ranger's offensive caps were raised, but rangers at that time got no defensive skill caps.<br />
<br />
Rangers went from being a semi decent tank pre-kunark (although obviously behind warriors and knights) to being unable to tank, and having to go full AC gear to survive. This is when &quot;ranger down&quot; became a common cry. Clerics hated rangers tanking, and even when they weren't tanking, rangers had all the agro from dual wield and no way of removing it. This is when AC became popular for rangers, and replaced dex/agi, hehehe.<br />
<br />
However, a number of tweaks since then, such as defensive skill raises, the jolt spell, and much better gear from Velious through to today means that rangers do not die nearly as much as they did, though they're still living down the reputation from the post-Kunark times.<br />
<br />
Velious brought new lines of spells for rangers, and Luclin brought AA, in particular archery AA.<br />
<br />
With spells and melee, they outdamage warriors with similar weapons, but with archery AA, and a decent bow, they can outdamage rogues, while remaining at a distance with little agro, and in some cases staying out of AE range. This can be invaluable at some raids.<br />
<br />
Most rangers who've been around a long time are quite happy to step in and tank if necessary. Some of them even welcome it.<br />
<br />
Sadly, a lot of rangers these days are people who started a ranger alt when it became clear how powerful and useful archery AA was, but who still remember the whole &quot;ranger down&quot;, &quot;paper tank&quot; phase.<br />
<br />
I still laugh at rangers with the &quot;Baron&quot; title who insist on using archery in exp groups though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In what I am starting to call: The Age of Twinking (yes I am guilty of this, check my magelo for proof) there is very little that is common combat practice for many classes. Rangers are one of them. A ranger can play 2 ways, melee or bow. It is really hard to tell which ranger you will get without asking or finding out when combat starts. My SK is my primary LDoN characterand will usually MT, my mage mostly goes to PoP or raids with friends and the shaman will group wherever. I have been in groups where the ranger is ungodly twinked with a bow and arrow then proceeds to pump out impressive damage while being back by the casters. They will tank aggros until I can get there; maybe even toss in a crap heal on secondary or thirdonary tanks to help out the healer. Othertimes I have had rangers that will be the MT over me since they are higher level or gear that is above and beyond mine. What I look out for are rangers that MT and don't have a DS up. Or don't snare, but root. **shudder**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My main is also a 65 ranger (110aa).  First off, LDoN sucks on bows.  You have LoS issues, arrows poofing cause a group member is in the way, mobs being walled.  Half the time, I'll melee rather then use my bow.  As to rangers tanking, I've tanked LDoN just fine.  Stuff in LDoN hits so weak that if you have a high DPS grp, you dont even need to slow it.  I've also tanked HoH and BoT several times (my HPs is about 6850 w/ pot9/symbol/brells; less with virtue and PotW; gear wise I have no ssra/VT/Elem) and had the healers in the grp had no problem keeping me healed.  With all the defensive AAs, a Ranger CA3 and LR5 should be able to tank just as well as a lvl60 warrior from Velious era.  <br />
<br />
Decently equipped/AA'd rangers are not paper tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From my understanding, with enough AA Rangers will outDPS their bow damage (excluding trueshot) using melee. Guardian of the Wood or some such.  There was a brief furor over on the 7th hammer boards about how AM3/EQ is the most overrated AA in the game.  <br />
<br />
Don't rangers get some nice avoidance skills as well?  No reason for them to be chicken****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WOOT lets here it for rangers!!<br />
I like to see how many others here treat their rangers like I do mine!  <br />
  And I agree RedChief, LDoN is not a good place for archery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I’m still not sure what to think about some of the rangers I’ve grouped with in LDoN, but I freely admit that they are certainly not the only class I’ve seen with questionable skill.  And I appreciate the additional insights you all have provided on higher level rangers.  I leveled my ranger to 51 back when Lake of Ill Omen was THE place to level and the tunnel in East Commons was THE place to buy and sell.  So I have no idea what it’s like to play a ranger in zones like PoP and certainly not in LDoN.  I guess all I can do is hope the ranger, or any other class, in our pickup group knows what he or she is doing.  Thankfully with a good foundation like we usually have we can still complete our mission even if one or two members of our group are clueless.  So unless they train us with 10 or 20 mobs, as one pickup member did, we usually come out ahead.  <br />
<br />
And all this talk about ranger AAs is making me want to play my ranger again.  If only I wasn’t having so much fun with my shaman.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did a LDoN group the other day and we couldn't find a tank or healer. (I really really don't like playing healer) but we decided that since our average was under 63 we'll give it a shot with my healing and my Level 63 Ranger friend tanking.<br />
<br />
We had no problems. <br />
<br />
He was nervous about it at first. We always tease the Rangers in our guild more out of fun than anything. Hell, the Rangers themselves are the ones who seem to make the most fun of Rangers, lol. So he always had this notion that he couldn't tank and well, he did a kickass job that night. I'd even say with CC and a cleric he could tank in a 63+ avg group.<br />
<br />
And yet last week I was grouped with a 65 SK who died 3 times in an adventure. We had a good group too but he just went down anytime he brought back an add. Couldn't hold himself together before we could slow or mez. <br />
<br />
Sure, I'll always tease Rangers for fun, but in all honesty I always love having a well played ranger in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well I will take a stab at this. I have a 65 ranger alt with almost 100 aa's and although I will do it, they aren't near as much fun in LDoN as they are in PoP. We can't use harmony, which used to be key in pulling, and archery is very hard. With my aa setup now I probably do double the DPS with my bow as I do melee, so that hurts.<br />
<br />
However, I am never afraid to step up and tank a mob when the tank goes down, or need CC help. Sure rangers don't tank as well as a warrior or knight, but they can do decent. However, with low delay weapons, repostes can get your hp down in a hurry. Even though I have no defensive aa's I have still tanked for hours and hours in HoH without a problem.<br />
<br />
I don't know how I would feel as a main tank in LDoN because I feel that it would be better left for them to just add tank.<br />
<br />
Also, you guys make cracks about all rangers being PL'd and dont' know what they are doing, but I am a shaman and I notice alot of things grouping with other shaman. How about when I am on my ranger and ask the 65 shaman in our group for say...FoS and he has no clue what that is? Or maybe the cleric asks for Infusion and once again he is stumped. I see many twinked classes that leveled way too fast and try to act like they are &quot;big dawgs&quot; but they are easy to seperate right of the bat. I know that since I have played a shaman since day 1 I am very picky about when I have to group with another while on an alt. When we pull adds I am more then happy to slap Q on and add tank however many necessary, yet you have some shaman that get aggro and run around in circles yelling &quot;GET IT OFF ME!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting back to the main point at hand, Rangers really should stick to the DPS category if at all possible. Sure they can add tank or something, but a knight/warrior with the same equipment will outdo them most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tenjhai, yYou're right, there are representatives of every class who don't know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
I was chatting to a guildie druid the other day, who was telling me of this shaman he'd been grouped with in LDoN. The guy was full mana all the time, but never cannibalized, and kept telling them to hold pulls for him to take a break because he was oom and couldn't slow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Our rangers do CC when there's no chanter/bard around.  One also tanks, but then, he has like 276 AA or something.<br />
<br />
Rangers = great CC.  They get decent roots, 60+, and they get snare, which grabs agro much more quickly than turgur's, and has a much better refresh time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The guy was full mana all the time, but never cannibalized<br />
<br />
Why would he canni if he's full mana?<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why would he canni if he's full mana?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
Doh, oops, my bad. I meant oom.... Though I kinda thought that was clear from the rest of it:<br />
and kept telling them to hold pulls for him to take a break because he was oom and couldn't slow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am sure many of you will agree that one of the key things in EQ is maintaining aggro.  Shadowknights and paladins are probably the best at maintaining aggro yet a ranger can also build up excellent aggro with snare, tangling weeds, taunt, weapons and our lvl 9 godsend spell flamelick.  These tools allow a ranger to grab aggro fast and lets the shaman slow early with no worries of getting beat on.  This also allows the healers to direct all their healing to one target since you will have less ping-pong etc etc.<br />
<br />
So if you are sitting there desperate for a tank in the group and coming up dry look to your local ranger.  I have tanked LDoN:normal (lvl 65) many times and easily won the adventure.  <br />
<br />
Now by no means am I stating we are a superior main tank.  A tanking job should always be given to the SK,Paladin or War but in desperate times don't think a ranger can't do it.<br />
<br />
I will agree that many classed out there have players that don't know what they are doing.  Experienced players make groups solid because they know their classes inside and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally I'm overjoyed with how bowing in LDoN often times isn't viable, bowing sucks period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've always been a big ranger fan. I used to do a lot of crazy &quot;let's see if we can take THIS mob&quot; duos with a ranger friend a couple years ago and we always had a blast. The new aa's have only made him a much more diverse partner. Between his power and mine, there really isn't much that can stand in our way. <br />
<br />
In LDoN, I love them. I usually have the same cat with me there as well and he's alway sright on the adds split tanking til I get it slowed and rooted then straight to firing off dps to the tank's mob. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm spoiled, the only rangers I've ever known were damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I find my rangers better than most &quot;pure tanks&quot; his level. I've played him forever, when rangers sucked and there was no end in sight as far as things getting better. Now hes got better hps and ac than most tanks his level and he can get agro as fast as the others also. I did an Ldon adventure with a 56 pally, my ranger was 57, the pally had less ac and 400 hps less than me. I ended up doing all the tanking since he dropped his hp's to damn fast. Unfortunately our cleric wasn't smart enough to sit down to med and kept going oom nuking and not healing. My ranger healed more than the pally did and almost as much as the cleric.</div></div><hr />
