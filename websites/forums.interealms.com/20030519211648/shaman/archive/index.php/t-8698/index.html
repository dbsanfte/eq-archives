<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wondering if anyone has a list (or magelo profile) of the highest hit point droppable gear.  It would answer many of these other thread questions.  Plus it would be nice to see in theory what an unguilded 65 shaman could attain .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After looking at what you suggested... i created a magelo for this experiment....<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=486577<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a 65 shaman, no aa's, 25points into wis, 5 points into sta.  some of the things you mentioned were good (although the items were not in the magelo database yet).<br />
<br />
So take a look and make suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The helm and bp are pretty out there as far as peices go. Helm is tradable but results from the quest from turning in tormax's head to yelinak. The WDS boots that quest gives are very nice and are normally what the head gets made into. Never seen the helm for sale.<br />
<br />
The bps only drop off the big named in WW like sont and the likes and even then only rarely and matchless the rarest of all making it an extreamly hard peice to come by. Even tho no drop I would consider a vindi bp much more reasonable as a bp. Even before PoP came out vindi was 1 group killed and with the new lvl cap and aa's he's definitely fairly doable for small groups of high lvl people.<br />
<br />
Spirit wracked cords and strength of elements are both very nice hps peices. They are no drop but are from relatively easy quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally posted by taraddar <br />
Even before PoP came out vindi was 1 group killed<br />
<br />
Nah? Seriously? Nah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by Gorre <br />
<br />
<br />
Nah? Seriously? Nah. <br />
<br />
Yeah i think it was FoH off hand. A warrior, 2 clerics and 2 rangers or something along those lines. Warrior mted while the 2 rangers went to town with trueshot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i belive the 1 group vindi kill was 3 rangers (all vt gear AM3 etc) 2 clerics and the last piece of the puzzel was a enc for the main tank<br />
<br />
dire charm pet to tank, about 10k hps .. back when CH wasnt capped <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
or it was just a really nice rumor ... no clue on pulling  him either<br />
<br />
<br />
/hijack off<br />
<br />
nice magelo of droppable gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Barbed Rubicite Leggings are 65 hp, and droppable (and what I still wear actually), probably a better choice than Rotting Flesh Kilt.<br />
<br />
No idea on it's approximate value though.<br />
<br />
Oh, um..spirit wracked cords/str of Elements are an easy quest? I guess if you have a group of high level friends that will help you mindlessly faction for days and camp contested spawns at 4am, that's absolutely true ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Relatively easy in terms of forces, etc.<br />
<br />
Not a full guild thing, up until Trak, and he's hardly full guild really.  His piece you can get off juggs anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Spirit wracked cords and strength of elements are both very nice hps peices. They are no drop but are from relatively easy quests.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was looking at this quest but was turned off by the fact that<br />
<br />
1) my guild still needs epic pieces from chardok and I owe it to my guild to help them with this.<br />
<br />
2) a bunch of 3 day spawns that require 2 or more people to take down. <br />
<br />
It's one reason I am getting a twink warrior up though, I could use her to attempt to get to these &quot;right after the server comes up&quot; pieces, but it doesn't solve the tracking issue.<br />
<br />
I might pass on this quest in the long run. I don't mind long quests (8th shawl), but I hate camping rare +3 day spawns.</div></div><hr />
