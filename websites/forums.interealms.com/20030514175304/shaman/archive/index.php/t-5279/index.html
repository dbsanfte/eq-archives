<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dethlok_Thelush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a shammy friend that just had the tear MQ'd for her epic.  Only thing she did for faction was kill Ghiosk and turn in his books again.  That gave her enough True Spirit faction to finish quest, and she is now the proud owner of a Spear of Fate.<br />
  BTW, anyone on Drinal server have a tear in bank they wouldnt mind MQing??   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Voiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the tear can be MQ'd without having to do more than the first jewel turn in to the drunk shammy in freeport, all you need is maxxed ally faction when you go to turn in the scale to receive your spear.  the further through the quest you go, the more faction you get per hit, so the lord ghiosk idea sounds like the simplest way to get the most faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sorry, but this was about a non-shaman handing in the tear to Lord Rak, right ?<br />
Ok, a friend of mine tried this without being ally to him (he was too lazy to read through the whole epic thing and forgot some early parts).<br />
What happened was that Rak ate the tear and nothing more happened. No aggro, no message. We killed him anyway and he did drop nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the one handing in has to be ally to Truespirit faction, which means for a non-Shaman to do a lot of Faction killing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe I read at some point that the person has to be a shaman. It won't work even if that other person is max ally with true spirit unless they are a shaman. Don't know if thats true or not, but its what I heard.<br />
<br />
And since my guild is too weak to do Fear.<br />

Paying for tear MQ on torv ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dethlok_Thelush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That could very well be true.  The person who MQ'd the tear for my friend was a lvl 60 shammy with his epic.  Hadnt thought about that . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, the person handing Rak the tear MUST have the correct faction level (somewhere inside of ally or above i think)  or Rak will eat the tear.</div></div><hr />
