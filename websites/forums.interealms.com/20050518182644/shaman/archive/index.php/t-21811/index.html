<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think the dragon's in skyshrine, but I don't know the specifics, just heard a Shaman buddy of mine talking about this. I'd like to put my merits against this dragon, and solo it before I ding 61, just for bragging rights. So, anyone know what I'm talking about to give me the name and confirm the zone? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is reffering to the wussy dragon in western wastes... give me a few minutes and ill get the name been so long but yes its shaman soloable ive done it. Pretty easy once you get the hang as far as i remember  been over a year though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeldema in Western Wastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The dragon is Yeldma, it's one of the nest dragons in WW, i can't remember it's loc of the top of my head, but it's not too hard to find.  <br />
<br />
If you have torpor it's not too hard to solo if you don't get any adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeldema thats it !!!.... So ya i mean its pretty straight forward. its the only dragon w/o an AE pull with malos slow it dot it sick dog on it watch it die /shrug nothing special about the fight really.<br />
<br />
One more thing it really depends on what kind of gear you have n stuff. but yes watch agro its HUGE in ww when fighting a dragon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doubt he meant skyshrine.  Yelinak is lvl 70.  Good luck.  lol<br />
<br />
I think he prolly meant Guardian Wurms in Skyfire.  They had a chance of dropping Malo / Torpor.  They were quite hard for a lvl 60.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh, Yeldema :) Alrighty, cool; thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">safest place to kill it is on the gnome ship. free of any adds. lev and pull it there with malo over the water slow it along the way.  lay on the first dmg after you have it positiond. then stay close to prevent  beiing summond in to the water. it will run when low have a root ready.(at 60)<br />
<br />
the other dragon are doable. if your well equiped. cept the 2 with stun and silence. least those were the 2 i stood no chance aginst. (at 65)</div></div><hr />

Best link I know of, includes locs of Yeldema and various other dragons.<br />
<br />
Its very old. These dragons are '1 group/2group encounters'. Not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought a Shaman soloed Gorenaire in DL at one time, and THAT was the famous dragon solo, am I mis-remembering? I read the write-up before I knew much about Gore and I was never able to go back and find it :( And personally I wouldn't attempt that fight even today at 65.<br />
<br />
Yeldema in WW -- I pulled west past the edge of land and killed it underwater. He's just straight melee. The only trouble was if I didn't stay close enough to him when he started walking at low health he'd warp back to his nest. For dragons with an AE dispell, two insta-click buff items will counteract that making several of them also soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A Paladin solo'd Gorenaire during the GoD beta. The /betabuff 65 pally was pretty decked out in time gear.<br />
<br />
Good to know that while I was crashing in Natimbi and getting mangled in Ferubi, other beta testers were soloing kunark bosses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think a shaman's ever solo'd Gorenaire ??? they might have, but it would be one heckuva shaman since we basically can't do any damage to her except via dog, melee, or damageshield potions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">gah.. Grumgor you asked in the shaman channel who that mob was and I told you they were talking about yeldema in WW :(<br />
<br />
The nest dragons aren't hard, the only thing that makes them difficult is the constant stupid adds from the middle of no where.  Back when I was trying to get a nice talisman for my twink I would be 80% done with soloing one when out of the blue I'd get four dragons adding all at once.  Happened at least 10 times till I got sick of it and made a friend help me kill them.  I did get my revenge on a few of them.. most notable glati (**** YOU GLATI)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">PoP and GoD trash mobs could solo Yeldema in their sleep. There was a time when WW dragons could wipe entire guilds. Today, people laugh if they even bother to enter the zone.<br />
<br />
GoD mobs hit so hard and so fast, and run so fast, and summon so often, that I do not believe any named GoD mob will ever be solo'd by any shaman. Unless there are HUGE and completely REDEFINING CHANGES made to shaman.</div></div><hr />
