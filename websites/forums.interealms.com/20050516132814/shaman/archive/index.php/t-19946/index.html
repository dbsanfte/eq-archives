<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this is supposed to be a new &quot;feature&quot; or if it is just another bug (wouldn't be suprised at all).....<br />
<br />
I was trying to help a friend, who hasn't played EQ in over a year, level is 56 necro in Fungus Grove (ungrouped).  Anyway, if I cast any dots, even my lowest level that for some reason I never deleted (plague), I KS every time.  This is when all I do is sinia, slow, let dog attack and I keep agro with cripple.  He uses his rogue pet (which I make sure is correctly positioned), Ebolt(x2 usually), splurt and dooming darkness.  We have tried it without my dog and plague alone will KS, yet I can nuke for more and faster damage when the mob is at 50% and not KS ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Has always been wierd issues with this.  I was soloing at the seru zoneline way back when (pre-PoP) with a druid sitting outside the group.  he'd just use 2 clickable dots (like level 30 dots or whatever), and end up KS'ing me half the time, even though I was doing a good 10-15k more damage than him.<br />
<br />
Handy way to get exp though, throw dots on random mobs as you pass by other groups =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you thought of using that to your advantage there?  Maybe let him do the dotting and you just go all out meele/DD/Pet.  If the DoTs are allowing you to KS might they not allow him to KS you?<br />

Sorry just thought I would give you another point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah happened to me last night to, was sitting in ferubi at bardinu zoneline. Some roamer aggroed, both my group and this time equipped group beat it down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you do more damage than the person (whether you actually do the damage or not) you will KS.  Some examples:<br />
<br />
Fictional MOB that has 500hp<br />
<br />
If you cast a DOT (like say plague) that will do more than half this mob's HP during the course of the DOT (it will not matter if you actually get one tick or more than one tick of the DOT, you WILL KS).<br />
<br />
The same would be true if you cast, for example, spear of torment when the mob is at 1% hp and you killed it...you would KS even though you only did maybe 1 damage with the spell.<br />
<br />
So..if you load every DOT you have on a mob at 50%..you MAY KS if the sum total of the potential damage the DOTs would do is greater than 50%.  If this makes sense :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry just thought I would give you another point of view.<br />
I don't see how me waiting around until a mob is at 50% and then using our very unefficient nukes is better than say...casting bane from the start.  Regardless, the only way that we could get it to work is to simply dog/nuke with zero dots.<br />
<br />
If you cast a DOT (like say plague) that will do more than half this mob's HP during the course of the DOT (it will not matter if you actually get one tick or more than one tick of the DOT, you WILL KS)<br />
So what are you saying, if a dot can do up to 3k damage, even if only one tick hits, the game counts the possible max damage?  Sorry, but that doesn't make sense, or else shamans and necro's would be able to consistently KS on raids before raid grouping/shared xp was implemented.<br />
<br />
The same would be true if you cast, for example, spear of torment when the mob is at 1% hp and you killed it...you would KS even though you only did maybe 1 damage with the spell<br />
This is instant damage, unlike a dot, even so that is wrong.  I've started chain nuking at 50% all the way down to a crit on 15% and another at 2% (using SoT) and not KS'd once this way.  If a mob is at 1hp and you crit SoT, you aren't going to take it to -1349 hps in damage.<br />
<br />
So..if you load every DOT you have on a mob at 50%..you MAY KS if the sum total of the potential damage the DOTs would do is greater than 50%. If this makes sense<br />
I understand what you are saying, but this has never ever happened until recently.  Also, even using the clinging darkness (a level 4 necro dot) neck will KS him...because it has.</div></div><hr />

I also have observed the above when 2 boxing or PLing.  If my main hits the mob with a big dot or dd when low on health, even only 1hp left, he will ks, no matter how much damage my alt has done.  Same for anyone PLing, my Wiz buddy would have to be very careful not to overnuke or I would not get any exp.  It is just weirder with the dots, because it seems to consider full potential damage eventhough the dot has only landed 1 tick, it seems to count full damage.  Oh well, bug or by design, who knows.<br />
<br />
But I know what I've seen, done it many, many times with different alts and situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, if you duo with an enchanter or bard and they use charm, you gotta be careful of this.  I've been swarming noc darklurchs and screamthingies in Natimbi with my bard, (for those who don't know, get a bunch of mobs, charm one, then when it's getting its ass kicked and almost dead, break charm, and kill the ex-pet)   If my pet gets dotted by one of the other mobs, then unless I can kill the creature that dotted my pet, I get KS'd every time by an NPC. (hence no xp)  I've tried this several times to test; the Noc dots only take around 10-20hp/tick - with 3 chants going, I'm doing approx 240 dmg/tick, yet the mob poofs when it dies.<br />
<br />
Actually, the funny thing is that if a mob gets dotted, after charm breaks, they sometimes re-agro on the mob that dotted it. (not every time though)  Can lead to some amusing battles between mobs, except I don't get xp from it like the Tactics exploit  :(  (no, I didn't do that, my bard was only lvl 55 when that was happening)  Once lost a 20+ mob swarm in Natimbi when I mixed up some Nocs with cragwalkers and those hyena things, as the animals assisted their friends, and the nocs assisted other nocs.  I guess you can imagine my tears as I watched a mass xp-less slaughter.<br />
<br />
I assumed it had something to do with the dots, but couldn't put a finger on it as I don't recall it happening before.  However, I don't think I ever swarmed mobs that could dot before (casters + swarming = dead bard usually) so I don't know how long this has been going on for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Used,<br />
<br />
Looking at your Magelo, you have Torp but not Q.  You have maxed your defensive AA's.  Im wondering why you are trying to do damage at all.  Slow, cripple, root, and then stand right on top of the mob and keep Torp up on yourself.  As long as you keep the mob rooted and are standing closer than the Necro (Mobs will ignore pets if there is a PC in range, so just stay closer to the mob than the Necro) you are golden.  Its been awhile since I was in FG, but I do remember that after slow/cripple the mobs werent hard (even the giant nifflikis).  A 56 necro with rogue pet can put out some good damage.  If you feel you need to help, mem Spear of Torment (fast nuke) and toss it when the mob is about 40% or so.  Wont kill it, but will dent the remaining HP.  <br />
<br />
Thats my suggestion anyway.  Its gotten my ranger from 1 to 48 in just over 3 days, though  I did let him tank about half the time to get his defense to max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 56 he should be able to get exp with you.  Take him to PoV, group with him and just kill.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you are outdamaging him with plague.  The only thing I could think of is if the necro is FD'ing to clear agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The answer was alluded to by Ruatonim. This is the same reason that DOTs like Festering Darkness which is only 50/tic but lasts a long timehave HUGE aggro. The amount of aggro and the amount of damage  that is credited to you is figured when you cast the spell. It is the potential damage, not the real damage. If they did it any other way it would cause huge programming problems. This means if the DOT was one that would last 30 minutes at 5 hp/tic it would add up to a LOT of damage - maybe even more than the mob has. Doesn't matter - you are credited with that amount of damage for purposes of aggro and KSing. The answer is to not DOT in a case like this or use a short duration DOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The amount of aggro and the amount of damage  that is credited to you is figured when you cast the spell. It is the potential damage, not the real damage. If they did it any other way it would cause huge programming problems.<br />
<br />
This makes my spidey sense tingle.  I don't think that's the case.  One of the (albeit very situational) uses of our disease dots is for long, boss/raid type encounters.  Sort of dot and forget it.  The disease dots tend to have much less aggro then the poison dots.  I don't think anyone can argue with that.  So, if &quot;potential&quot; damage was the aggro indicator, you would think the disease dots would have greater aggro, yes?  But I can put 3 disease dots on Seru and not pull aggro, but 1 poison and the mob turns.<br />
<br />
Not flaming, I just don't agree that DoT &quot;potential&quot; is an indicator of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Serepi, I agree with you on the agro thing... It certainly seems like the dots generate their agro over time, and not collectively (hence why disease dots don't pull agro).  However, Zatso could still be right about the death stealing of slow dots...  Not to say that I know one way or another, but determining who won the kill is not agro based, but total damage based.  It would make sense that the server trys to calculate that as the spell lands instead of a on-tick basis.  This could amount to your slow dots &quot;tricking&quot; the computer into thinking you did more damage when, as of yet, you have not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aggro is a different issue from the original post.  However, must agree, it builds over time.  I'm sure we have all been solo with dogdog, had him pull aggro for a bit after slow, and then get the aggro back after a couple of ticks of a dot.  I my not pull the aggro with only the initial dd and dot tick, but give it a few more ticks and I'm sure to get the aggro.<br />
<br />
However, in relation to damage done to the mob for calculating who gets credit for the kill, certainly seems as if the total potential damage is used, at least in my experience in duo's and 2-boxing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This change has been in the game for a while, and is not limited to DoTs.  I used to PL toons by nuking at 49% - and suddenly started to KS the low level, since the game now took the whole damage done into calculation.  Aka the 500 HP mob, 260 dmg by low level, 925 nuke = 1185 total damage 22 % done by low level = KS.<br />
I had to get out my JBB, since I deleted all the old mini nukes :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is a weird one, but I've seen it happen.  I was waiting for a friend in Plane of Fire with my necro, saw an SK kiting some of the guards in the area where the birds spawn.  He got the mob to about 15% and was taking forever to kill it, so I threw a DOT on it and ended up KSing him.  Felt bad because it took him a long time to kite it down so I grouped him and let him suck up some xp for a bit to make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll add my vote to the total damage being counted causes the KS. <br />
<br />
I was powerleving an alt, and noticed that using just my level 61 pet, I would KS low level mobs everytime.  As an example, given a 100hp mob, I would have my alt take it down to~45%, then sick my pet on it.  Given the low level, dog hits for 60.  60 is more than 50% of the mob's HP, so it KS's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So what are you saying, if a dot can do up to 3k damage, even if only one tick hits, the game counts the possible max damage?

<br />

This is instant damage, unlike a dot, even so that is wrong.  I've started chain nuking at 50% all the way down to a crit on 15% and another at 2% (using SoT) and not KS'd once this way.  If a mob is at 1hp and you crit SoT, you aren't going to take it to -1349 hps in damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand what you are saying, but this has never ever happened until recently.  Also, even using the clinging darkness (a level 4 necro dot) neck will KS him...because it has.<br />
<br />
In order:<br />
1. Necros and shaman would allow their DOTs to run until they faded and then recast;therefore, they weren't doing excess damage.  I assume if they recast their high damage DoTs, they would KS the raid (assuming they could do this without being summoned and squished first). You don't have to believe me, but try it some time.  My friend KS'd my alt by casting funeral pyre when the mob was at 10% hp left (was a basilisk in JPF ~1300hp on those), and he didn't do any other damage...<br />
<br />
2. I'm not sure what you are talking about here, but my example is the mob has 500hp and you cast the nuke when its at 50% (spear of torment WILL cause you to KS this MOB).  You don't have to believe me outright, but TRY IT!  You are right, the MOB won't be negative HP, but the game mechanic works like I have stated.  If the MOB has 4khp and you nuke it for 2001 damage (whether or not you do this at 100% hp or 1% hp) you WILL KS the other person.<br />
<br />
3. How much HP do the mobs have that you are using the necklace on?  If all you are doing to a MOB a 56 necro would get exp from is casting a snare (clicky necklace quest item for trolls?), then I don't know why you would be KS'ing--if this is ALL you are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Simple and most logical answer.<br />
<br />
Its a bug of some sort, and most probably the programmers have no idea why this happens and figure its so inconcequestial (wow big word mispelt) that why bother.<br />
<br />
My guess, since every post up there except for the one bout the sk in fire is bout someone powerleveling is that it is somehow lvl based.  <br />
<br />
In regards to the instance with the SK, they have lower lvl necro spells, but if that were the case Plague wouldn't have KS'd Ebolt if its spell lvl alone in regards to the original post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The disease dots tend to have much less aggro then the poison dots. <br />
Thats because poison counters add ungodly amounts of aggro compared to disease counters (and those are bad enough as we know from our slows). At least that is my guess. You are sure right about the effect, it is no problem to stack several diasease dots but one poison dot -loading, please wait-<br />
<br />
As to the DoT KSing, this has changed! I used to dot with my spear when PLing my twinks and I found a few weeks ago that I no longer could. I am not sure it has to do with the damage of the dot but it could be. I have KSed the twinks with nukes as well and wondered why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's a sad thing when a necro of all classes needs to be PLed!  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LoL, I remember getting kicked out of Derv 2 pre-kunark cause an enchanter from the guilds uber guild wanted to powerlevel his friends necromancer.  That guild is currently dust.<br />
<br />
I barely understand what was going on at the time..................WTH is that air elemental doing, how'd that mage get a pet that cons red?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Looking at your Magelo, you have Torp but not Q.<br />
That's because I haven't updated the magelo spell book in...forever.  I have a full book, sans the new GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Im wondering why you are trying to do damage at all.<br />
So that it goes faster....and I am the one tanking..how else would a necro's rogue pet be backstabbing while the necro stacks dots?  We aren't fear kiting. :)<br />
<br />
And I know you were just trying to be helpful with your info Thorz, but all of that is old news from EQ 101, I'm not a PoP crack-baby-n00b.<br />
<br />
And yes, we have tried it where the only damage I did was with the snare neck, which casts a level 4 necro dot.....and it still ended up in a KS. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've seen this before too. Not sure exactly what is happen but best I could figure was that all dot dmg got attributed to who ever cast the first dot on the mob for deciding the kill.<br />
<br />
What used to happen was back in the day i'd be soloing shrooms in FG. I used my lvl 53 druid to help things out a bit by doting a bit and keeping regen up on me. I'd have fido up and would cast bane of nife and ebolt and epic dot and then tank and jbb the shroom. My druid would use 2 dots. Drones of doom clicky from his bracer which does 340 dmg and winged death for 1287 dmg for just over 1600 dmg total. Obvious not a huge amount of dmg but made things go a bit faster.<br />
<br />
Obviously I was doing nearly as much dmg with a single dot as the druid did with both of his. Not to mention Jbb, melee and dog melee. Yet with out fail if the druids dot landed first because I was slow to cast, got resisted or got interupted on my shaman the druid would get the kill. Interestingly enough he'd also seem to get more aggro too.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what happened but I learned to make sure the shaman landed the dot first and everything was fine. I'd imagine that you can do the same thing here. Let the necro land a dot first and then you should be able to dot the hell of out it and he'll still get the kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I was actually wondering if it had anything to do with whoever cast first, but not for the reason you suggested.  We will have to try that out and see if it works.</div></div><hr />
