<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The flagging guide on http://www.rpgexpert.com/1346.html has some flaws.<br />
<br />
You don't need sewers to do vxed / tipt. You can do these trials in any order. You just need the 4 sewers (or Smith raid), Vxed and Tipt for Kod'taz flag. For Qvic you need Uqua and Ikkinz4 (the raid trial). And I havn't seen a single group beating Uqua, only raids ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason that thread from the Runes board is so long is because it explains the BiC quest too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does anyone know the difference between getting an expedition from the High Priest Diru Riwirn, and Gamesh?<br />
<br />
The expeditions seem to be the same... is one for trials, and one for xp only?  I know that hailing the High Priest twice will get you an expedition that you have not done before, and I suspect that he gives out the trials.  Does anyone know, and enlighten me?<br />

Yeah have to go through the high priest to get the ones that count. With Gamesh can choose to do whichever one so you can exp in it. I think highpriest gives you the highest (plant) to lowest (pool) depending on which ones you have done already. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think the text is gamesh knows how to get to the places and can show you how to sneak in or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When going to the high priest for trials you're right, he will give you the highest expedition that you have not yet beat.  BUT,  if you fix you flags by talking to the scribe and saying 'issues'  he will give you the lowest trial you have not yet beat.<br />
<br />
For example:  You have the flag for #2 but have not said Issues to the scribe.  High priest will give you #3.<br />
<br />
Example 2: You have the flag for #2 but you said 'Issues' to the scribe and fixed your flags.  High priest will give you #1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does it matter whom you go to get an expedition from?  My friends and I are trying to farm the spells in the sewers.  So far, we haven't had luck seeing anything drop in over 10 expeditions.  We've been primarily getting &quot;Plant&quot; expeditions from Gamesh, and wondering if we will get any better &quot;luck&quot; with the High Priest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They are exactly the same except that the High Priest will allow you to get your flag from that expedition.  If you're just farming in there for spells .. good luck.  You'll have to kill either 20 mobs or wait 20 minutes after zoning in to even see if any rares will spawn.   Even then the nameds will only rarely drop a spell,  the common drops are items.</div></div><hr />
