I am quite certain no one is ninja'ing the stuff, we are always there as a guild , and have no ungrouped people even if someone did give in to an unethical impulse...<br />
 <br />
This has only been happening on Luclin mobs (Greig, IV so far that I know of for sure). The loot is there when the first person checks but then when the person awarded goes to loot it it's gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danlby</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that happen once to my guild, and no one could explain it until we noticed an anonymous non-guildmate nearby. One petition and a few hours later...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirenia Brighteye</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always lock your corpses (have someone with loot window up untill loot is distributed) if the mob has important loot. Ive seen and heard of too many scammers who just have no problems ninjaing from hardworking guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Globin_Shade</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think this is a ninja. We killed IV last night and had it happen. It's not like that's a really easy spot to go to...and the only people in the zone where guildmates, all grouped. ALthough maybe someone took it and /q'ed before I did the who.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mileron</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the new code that was recently patched in that allows you to receive tells and such during zoning, it causes a weird /who situation.<br />
Player names stay on /who for several seconds up to several minutes after logging off or LD.<br />
I've noticed this a few times trying to catch friends online, seeing them in /who friends all, sending a tell and getting the 'not online' response.  (There's also a split second window where you can get this if the receiver of the tell is zoning, but I've only done that once in several months.)<br />
Often, I've noticed too that if a groupmember goes Linkdead, they won't show up as Linkdead until the actual body disappears from the world.  Meaning, if you did /who GUILD, they won't show up as LINKDEAD until they are actually kicked.  (This happened twice last night.)<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuldian</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somebody is either ninja looting at  your raid or...well there is no or, because I have never ever heard of a loot poofing bug.  Make a kill shot group of people you absolutely without a doubt trust and have them keep that corpse locked until the loot is awarded and then still keep it locked in between people looting.<br />
<br />
oh and I can run back to itraer vius without aggro as long as I'm tripping over rocks and not triggering reavers and mind worms :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can petition the GMs of your server to see where the item disappeared to.  If the item wasn't looted, I think they can see that it dropped, but isn't anywhere ot be seen.  If so, they may be able to create the item and give it to the awardee.<br />
<br />
But I suspect Ninja looting going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GMs are not able to see what is on a mob or corpse until actually inspecting the corpse.  And the logs only contain information about item transfers (loot, trade, buy, sell, destroy), so they will not have anything about loot items unless a character actually loots them.  So, the GM can see if someone is taking the items, but if the item is poofing directly from the corpse, then the logs will not have it, and the GMs will not know what items dropped.</div></div><hr />
