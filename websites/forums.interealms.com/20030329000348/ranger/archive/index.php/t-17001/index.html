<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhadgast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick background.  I am currently a 63 ranger quickly moving to 65.  I created my ranger on Day 3 of release but I took 9 months off after SoL came out.  As such when PoP was released I had very few AA points.  I decided to level instead of grind out AA for EQ.  I would say my gear is above average but my weapons are not (Using Epics and Twisted).  At 63 I have a self buffed ATK of 1431 and 157 DEX.<br />
<br />
My AAs are Run3, Regen3, SCF, CF, ND.  I plan on getting CA, CS, MC, EQ for my next 15 AA points.<br />
<br />
My question is this.  At what point does AM outdamge melee weapons (well my melee weapons)?  If I were to do AM, or AM2, would I be doing more damage than in melee provide the mob was standing still, not in the wall, etc?<br />
<br />
There are a lot of AAs out that that I would like to train and the idea of needing 15 AA just to get EQ and another 18 to max out AM seems a bit daunting.  I would like to get GoF and Entrap fairly quickly (I would love putting a DD in the Ensnare spot).  I would also like to train PE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Without ferocity or other melee aa's, AM2 will outdo epic melee.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's time to open your eyes, brothers.<br />
<br />
With pop you can forget to put 27 aa for the most bugged skill of EQ. <br />
<br />
Now ranger can take another way, 1H and 2H have received a good upgrade with pop.  Not archery <br />
<br />
And stop dreaming for an archery fix, we 'll probably NEVER see it.</div></div><hr />

What i really like on archery is Zero aggro it produce, especially if im puller. Even if both melee option would be significiantly higher dps, like they are now, I will stick with bow, like with special class way of dmg dealing  ... with 0 aggro and nice criticals :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have all melee, archery, offensive aa skills you can get.. every one.. Archery owns melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tygraon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL <br />
<br />
What are you doing when your mob is pushed in the wall ? .<br />
<br />
What are you doing when you fight in a small room with possibility to agro and whip your group or your raid ?.<br />
<br />
Seriously Dangon, i don't have the all offensive AA you can have; BUT i have AM3 and my best piece of equipment is my Bow of Doom.  No way, whitout the Trueshot Disc (refresh time 72/67 min) I can't outdamage a pally or sk with pop 2H, Ferocity, Punishing blade and haste item.  And i don't talk about rogue and monk.<br />
<br />
I play my ranger since 3 years now, i know my job and my dps.<br />
<br />
But maybe i'm a tramp with my epic, my SS armor and my bow, no?  All other rangers have better  no?.<br />
<br />
And for finish, when you talk about archery, you don't forget to consider it without AM3 ?, for the poor ranger level 52 lfg.  I m sure he is happy to know the dps he can hit when he'll have all archery skills up.  If he find a group to make xp.<br />
<br />
When all melee skills get an improvement except archery, it is an hiden nerf.  And please don't talk me about Headshot.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : Sorry for my bad english, i hope you can understand my point of view and if you find me too direct, is just because i make my possible in english.</div></div><hr />

When my target is in a wall, so am I. If I am still missing shots I can still pack a decent wallop with Epics. Besides a guild on raid that puts mobs in walls is cheating iteself from Rogue backstabs and Arrow shots. Its just plain dumb to do it.<br />
<br />
In a small room? I have these two nice pieces of cutlery I am rather fond of :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tygraon...<br />
<br />
If you've noticed, there aren't many walls in PoP, therefor archery outdmg's your melee (even with your aa's) by about 50-100dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Btw, am2/eq outdmg's regular melee, depending on your combo and haste.  am3 is where you'll really see how great archery is.  You wont need melee unless a mob is pushed into a wall but PoP is mainly open areas and great for rangers.  I dunno what Tygraon is talkin about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khazidhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, bow damage is worth it when u go past 60 and start getting AA's... a &quot;poor&quot; lvl 52 ranger will have a poor DPS on bow... on melee even eh<br />
<br />
Now face facts, i did all my AA's to increase archery DPS, EnQu to use those 11/4 modifer arrows a million thousand times, AM3 to maximize shots, fury 3 after CF 3 to crit like a beast, and others like guardian of the forest..<br />
<br />
My regular DPS goes from 180 to 210 wihtout disc in groups (doing around 1700 atk self) with a primal bow or doom bow, while melee does about 100 - ok my primal / claw lighting - or swiftwind sux ...<br />
<br />
Not to mention i crit 1966 max, like 3 or 4 times in a raw, many times,  facing an Itraer vius or a xanamech, with about 50k damage in less than 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
No way ur melee can do this, unless u have real uba weaps may be, no clue on this ...<br />
(but then take an uber bow to compare eh)<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion, the way i see rangers, when i hear rogues friends kinda jealous when we compare dps, rogues... the former best DPS in game )<br />
<br />
LoS Sux, mobs in corners sux, peeps coming in front of u sux, NO AUTO atk sux even more (so tired hitting my keyboard), BUT<br />
If u can avoid that, go for archery, and u ll kick ass ))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use Primal Bow and 13/17 100dd 14/17 120dd weapons with 1702 normal attack at moment.  I get about 110-150 DPS in melee with nukes and about 150-200 DPS with bow (non discipline).  Up to 400 DPS with trueshot.  One key to good archery damage is having combat fury 3 and fury of ages 3.. when you critical for 1900's more often that adds up to alot of extra damage, not just eye candy.<br />
<br />
Of course if a mob is in wall and I can't hit it with a bow, I use melee.. I do quite well with melee as well but not as good as archery.<br />
<br />
My guild knows the awesome damage of AM3 rangers on trueshot and if it is at all possible our guild keeps the mobs out of walls if they need our damage.   Our guild has very few rogues but has alot of rangers so we use that on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Even when you get to the point where your melee AA and weapons might push your melee damage ahead of your archery damage, there are still fights/times during your raiding career (and this is the only way you are getting those uber melee weapons heh) when the archery range will prove useful. Many fights in PoP have nasty AEs that aren't as long as the range on bow+arrow..and that combined with the duration of the fight means lots of rangers with high archery damage = win for most of those. <br />
<br />
IMO do the archery AA, get that skill up (for solo, raid damage etc) then focus on getting melee AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">go for whichever you like using better, when it all boils down to it with equal melee weapons and bow and with max of melee and archery aa's they are basicaly even, melee however can be used more often than archery and costs less for the AA's for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tygraon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1700 atk very nice.  How many rangers can say they have the same atk self buffed ?.  Not me :(  .<br />
<br />
Max critik 3-4 time in a raw.  Sorry never make or see the same.  But critik betwin 100 - 200 on disc, i see that very very too offen. <br />
<br />
No way, i m probably cursed :rolleyes:  .<br />
<br />
AM2 own POP and Luclin 1H and 2H.  Well well, not in AB,  Sorry again.<br />
<br />
When i hit a mob fixed by a tank for 4 (yes yes 4 and no root on  mob) with my 33 35 bow, i thinks lot of my brothers don't see the reallity.<br />
<br />
Put a 45 35 2h in your hands , put the AAs in the good skills . And see the DPS and Critiks, you'll made .<br />
<br />
I have see some pally and SK critik for 800+ (and not on dead mobs).  <br />
<br />
But maybe it is a dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well I have a fairly good 2hder too.. 50dam 42delay 200dd proc but it doesn't beat archery still.  I also have 41% off weapon haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Davood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">41% haste or 34~% haste?<br />
<br />
is the haste cap 100% still? if so then all you need is 32% haste or better to max it with vallon (68% haste)<br />
<br />
im curious since my ranger will never see another 41% haste item that isnt a melee weapon ;o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Getting melee aa's is still a good idea, but I'd get archery aa's before that.  Archery is very low aggro and safe.  Everyone will die before the person using archery, unless the cleric uses DA.  Although, it's always a good idea to have good melee to backup incase you need to move in and do the work up close and personal with the mobs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darkdoc-Trib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At lvl 60 as i am with every luclin aa point and all the lvl 61 ones cept for innate fear resistance 3 (338 aa points) I solo using melee mainly for my aa .. odd hours in velks mostly.<br />
<br />
At AM2 +eq the bow consistently outdamages melee in any group. i use the Essence Mace (sleepers tomb scale quest) and Bonechiller (XTC drop in ssra) for weapons and primal bow.<br />
<br />
so answer to your question was EQ +AM2 = higher damage than your weapons and decent bow/arrow eagle eye spell helps miss alot less.<br />
<br />
Trygroan - primal bow is 33/35 my atk on a raid is usually 1616with EQ ya can use te Blessed champions arrow 11 dam +4 fire dam so 15 dam arrow on most mobs its magic 170 range.<br />
<br />
 without trueshot i have hits in the 300 to 548 range most frequently and crits up to 940 (avatar procs eagle eye  up and ya git alot of good hits.<br />
<br />
TS is insane 1112 non crit max hits lots of hits in the 800 to 1112 range  and usually 5 crits in the 1300 to 1898 range ..when fury of the ages 3 comes my way that will triple.. no melee weapon is even in the same timezone.. pally slay undead only on undead  on a raid of undead is about the only way some other melee class would outdamage me .<br />
<br />
Best trueshot was on that spawned mob in sleepers tomb  31,268 damage had 3 secs left on trueshot disc when it dropped. melee will never do that =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It comes down really to what you want to do, but keep this in mind.<br />
<br />
For most rangers acquiring a 33/35 ratio bow is at least a possiblity. Alot of decent bows from POP are tradable. WIth this type of bow and AM3/EQ you can do substantially more damage then you can with epics with similiar aa points invested.<br />
<br />
If you have post epic weapons and similiar aa, your melee dmg can equal or exceed your bow dmg. Sean and several others have shown various logs to this effect. <br />
<br />
Melee is definently needed, lots of guilds wall mobs at times and like it or not, we get to live with it. Personally I say go wtih EQ3/AM first and then work on your melee aa. Simply because more rangers will see bows of dooms then AHB/Render combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally dear, I plan to spend a lot of time in the AA exp grind, and after a similiar 8 month AFK, I have found rangers with AM3 and EQ to be very desireable among the pet class types who tend to hunt in BoT.  I am happy I went the Archery route first, and plan to follow up on the 2hand melee route next, and then lastly with the dual wield due to differences in equipment, and my guilds capabiliities and desires.<br />
<br />
We would have to chat about where you tend to hunt for exp, because that will help &quot;drive&quot; your train.  Exp does not seem to be much of a problem in PoP, and you will start filling out your AAs much more rapidly than when SoL came out.<br />
<br />
Best of luck whichever way you go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just as an aside to this, our guild recently did Sontalek in WW and as you know his 500 pt AOE and dispell causes havoc if you arent careful.<br />
<br />
Well with 3 Rangers OUT of AOE range plugging trueshot we were like the sole survivors. I couldnt beleive the pile of bodies accumulated around the dragon. I never took a scratch.<br />
<br />
Parsed out 16,500 damage myself with bow, thats 144 DPS. I will use AM3 archery WHENEVER its possible. It would be foolish to not &quot;be all you can be&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tygraon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">OMG :eek: <br />
<br />
My name is T Y G R A O N  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
You continue to say DD archery + Trueshot Disc + AM3 own DD melee , I AGREE.<br />
<br />
But pleaseeeeeeeee gimme me the TIPS for hit with archery when the mob is in the wall or in the corner , get hight DD and for use Trueshot Disc all the time.<br />
<br />
Because my bad guild put, in 95 % time, the mob in a corner and use ranger with WS for debuff line :(  .<br />
<br />
And generally if the mob is not in a corner; we wipe because riposte , AE and funky aggro fight :cool: (low hp agro POWER).  In this last point, genrally, clerics and wiz are not happy , i don t understand for why :confused:  or maybe is because they died :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">you'll never really regret the 27 aa's for am3/eq<br />
<br />
you'll use it while lfg... perma rooted mobs... and busting out 2kish crits is fun<br />
<br />
people see wizzies and mages crit for more... but for some reason people drool when they see bow crits, its fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Either route is fine, they're both equal'ish in dps.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on doing both personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Darkdoc-Trib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">well if a mob is in the corner yer hosed for archery<br />
<br />
But if its in a wall not in a corner ya can line up against the same wall (in archery range) and you will hit the mob.<br />
<br />
corners are bad lotta guilds push mobs badly sometimes the mob has to be in the corner for various reasons to win the fight.<br />
<br />
AoW is one thats hugely easier in a corner that i know of off the top of my head. Archery makes ya appreciate those permarooted mobs in NToV , WToV an ssra a bit.. cept XTC that atk debuff really bites for the bow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Speaking from the totally non uber end of the spectrum archery is the way to go.  Its likely that I will even the gap between my melee and archery when I get Ferocity and Ambidex(may skip this for punishing blade though) somewhat, but currently my archery flat out owns my melee.  Still using a Nightmare bow I usually sit right around 100dps in exp groups(1460ish atk) and with curved claws or tox axe and swifty I am around 70dps melee.  As soon as I can find a twisted longbow or carved bone shortbow( or lol my guild gets off its rear and get Doomshade) I expect to see a nice spike up, where getting something like a fleshgrinder/disembowler to replace my primary is unlikely to even come close to my archery for a much larger price tag in pp.  I'm sold for sure.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The rules on mobs in the wall are simple.  If the mob touches a wall, you touch the same wall.  If the mob is pushed deep in the wall, get as hard against the wall as you can and turn slightly into the wall.  If the mob is pressed into a corner ( touching 2 walls) you need to get as deep into a wall as you can and hope that is the one the mob's center is inside.<br />
<br />
Walls are used to control push and rampage/enrage damage; or directional procs, but aside from that, if your guild spends all its time with the mobs in the wall, find a new guild; they will never learn what a ranger, or even a rogue, is good for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Meecham Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Max critik 3-4 time in a raw. Sorry never make or see the same. But critik betwin 100 - 200 on disc, i see that very very too offen.  <br />
<br />
No offense bud, but is that what you expect with only CF1?  Seriously, if you max that and FotA you will see a huge amount of archery crits.  Max crit 3 times in a row is not common, but it is not unknown either.<br />
<br />
There was a number floating around, I think it was Sean said approx. 25% of archery damage comes from crits with both those skills maxxed?  Having seen it for myself now I can well believe that.  Often see strings of 5-6 crits in a row.<br />
<br />
As far as DPS and efficiency goes, you cant really beat abit of archery, especially in PoP.  Low ac mobs and mostly spacious outdoor locations mean we can really shine.  No question about it,  AM3 outdoes melee DPS by a significant amount when you take into account comparable level weaps (I use velious weaps, Primal bow vs Baton of Flame / Swifty, and my archery DPS is almost 50% more).<br />
<br />
When it comes to the question of archery vs melee tho, it boils down to preference IMHO.  Do what you like to do.  Personally I like a bit of both,  so having maxxed archery skills now I am starting to work on the melee ones (ferocity etc).</div></div><hr />
