<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there.<br />
<br />
Trying to do this quest and have sidestepped a few places (like that miserable halfling was up as I was running through Nek so I popped him for his head).  And looking around trying to find the NPCs.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to give me some locs or something for the NPCs?  I'm not really good at running around Neriak, but I looked all though the cleric tower for Ithvol and cant find him.<br />
<br />
Draxiz is in the Neriak commons area, and I think I could find him with some patience.<br />
<br />
I also went through that waterfall thats by the PoD (without spawning the spies) and found no secret room anywhere (its the waterfall that is just up the ramp from the PoD in the same room, all I hit was the wall).<br />
<br />
The rest of the quest seems easy.  Big hint to all the trolls out there.  if you are level 14+ and decide to do this.  Bind at the firepots in Timorous Deep.  They make delivering the faction letters a piece of cake. as well as getting to Lfay then back to Neriak.  Turns a 3+ hour deal into 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually,<br />
<br />
I went to the site, printed out the quest and all the appropriate information.<br />
<br />
They don't give a loc for Ithvol.  The Quest starts out with &quot;Hail master Ithvol K'jasn....&quot;  When you click on the NPC link to find where he is, you get a nice picture of a dark elf standing beside an urn.  But no loc.<br />
<br />
There is no link for the Draxis NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, I am not sure on the names of the NPC's but I do know the loc's, I think hehe.<br />
<br />
Ok 1 guy where I believe you start the quest is in 3rd gate 2nd floor, you need to be shrinked to get up the stairs.<br />
<br />
1 guy, the guy I believe you are refering to is in the building with all the int Caster Trainers, right near the bank.  Go to the 2nd floor and you will see a balcony, go on the balcony and make a left around the building, here is where you will find the NPC, on top of the roof.<br />
<br />
Their is a Tunnel in the Waterfall, You need to climb up if I remember, try levitate and Shrink, it is their and here is where you fight the halfings.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
