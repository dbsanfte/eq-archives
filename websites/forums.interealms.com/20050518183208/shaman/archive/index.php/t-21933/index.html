<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have cancelled all 3 of my accounts, effective<br />
immediatly, due to your (SOE) treatment of my chosen<br />
main class..... Shaman.<br />
<br />
This decision was made very easy by the posts that<br />
were made by Rytan (a spell developer who I believe is<br />
utterly clueless about the use of, and lack of<br />
functionality of, the Shaman class) and Brenlo (who<br />
was outright insulting to Shaman that have made every<br />
attempt to communicate for the past 2 years what our<br />
issues were).<br />
<br />
To expect me to PAY for an expansion (let alone 1 for<br />
each of my 3 accounts) to fix what should never have<br />
been let happen is so ludicrous it begs the question<br />
of &quot;just how stupid do you really believe your<br />
subscribers to be?&quot;.<br />
<br />
If people had listened to what was being said instead<br />
of trying to sell ice to eskimos this issue could have<br />
been avoided years ago.<br />
<br />
EQ was a defining product years ago, now its just a<br />
sad old man at a bar reliving the glory years of old<br />
before dying quietly and alone.<br />
<br />
Thanks for a few years of fun and a few years of<br />
frustration (5 total years playing),<br />

this email address) <br />

**Flame as you like, I really dont care and I left EQ for no reason other than the Brenlo/Rytan stance on Shaman and my total disagreement with thier attitude towards myself and others that spoke the truth for so many years they have a right to anger and frustration. **</div></div><hr />

I never ran in the same circles as you did, so never saw you in the game.<br />
<br />
However I recognize Endo as one of the top guilds in the server and I hope you enjoyed your time in Time ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">100% with you, and did the same ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is a question for you I am curious about.  When you cancel your account do they allow you to give a reason.  If they do I am glad you wrote that.  If they don't why do you come here and post this when we already have others exactly the same like it.  My point is send this to them in an email dont leave it on a mb and hope by some chance it gets read by the right people.  Make the right people hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sent a mail to EQstation, asking them to feedback to a relationship member. ( it was a really long one indeed, telling them that I was really disapointed about the way they were considering their consumers, the way they sent trolls to neriak because they were too bored to design a new zone *hehe, I know, I am accumulating all the bad points lol, not my fault if I picked a troll* )<br />
<br />
As an answer, I got a generic mail, telling me that it was always a pleasure for them to have players feedbacks and so and so ......<br />
<br />
At this point, I really believed my mail had no effect, but shortly after, Brenlo went on our board to say a quick hi, which made me hope some things ..... ( not saying that it is thank to me that he went, but I was just letting them know that they couldn't ignore us like they did after so many feedbacks made by our community  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nah eq doesn't ask for a reason when you quit eq, it would be very useful though, and I believe DAoC does it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No they dont ask for a reason why when you cancel.<br />
<br />
I sent this same email to the CS email addy so they get it (if they even bother to do anything with it).<br />
<br />
I posted here because the posts that Brenlo and Rytan made on this forum are the biggest reasons for me finally tossing in the towel. There is an off chance that they will see it (or others will) and maybe if theres enough people that react to the way Shaman have been treated something will happen.<br />
<br />
In order for someting to make a business change you can only do one thing, effect thier bottom line. Since I dont wanna picket SOE, and I dont feel like spending more money to get change.... the one thing available to me is to cast my vote by not giving them my money anymore. Selling an account doesnt effect change cause thier bottom line doesnt change, as long as they get money for that account it means nothing to them if you actually care about the char on the account.</div></div><hr />
