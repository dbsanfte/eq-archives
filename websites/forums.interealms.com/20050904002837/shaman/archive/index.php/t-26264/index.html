<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...if given seperately. I remembered reading somewhere on this board (couldn't find the post again to reply) that our pets would no longer dual wield weapons if they were given seperately. Just tested this by handing Goner a rusty dagger, then handing him a rusty long sword. He both slashed and pierced. I handed him another rusty dagger and he only would pierce. Just a little tidbit I thought others might want to know.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if they will dual wield lore weapons still?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Er, didn't the whole rusty dagger thing get eliminated in the last patch? Or are we talking about lower level pets?</div></div><hr />
