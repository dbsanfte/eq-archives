Problem is I *might* not be home until 6:45pm EST or so.  It'll depend on what time the movie is over...<br />
Grayeyes is in FV btw, where should I go from there?<br />

Sorry I can not make it tonight, already have plans to do something else. <br />
<br />
On doing HS I have found that a single group doing zone in or basement is great xp.  When the zone in gets a little boring, you drop down to the basement for more mobs and fun;).   Group make up here depends on where you are going to hunt at and how familiar you are with the zone.  You should try to have 2 healers and an evacer is a must, 1 taunting type tank, and an enchanter  that leaves 2 or 3 slots open that can be anything. You just base your tactics on what classes you have.  I have hunted the zone in with 4 people before (Pally, Druid, Mage, Shaman, air pet rocked),  I have also done the basement with 6 and no enchanter (that was a tough fight and we finally had to zone back up).<br />
With more than 1 group you need to head down one of the wings to get enough mobs or you can split your groups between the basement and zone in.  The mobs down the each of the wings are a little higher in lv and tougher.  The wings in order of toughness are North, West, South, and East. To get down the East wing becuase of a trap you must go down the South wing and thourgh a secert door over to the East wing.<br />

Sorry for the book.  Just had to put in my 2 cp :)<br />
