Did they simply remove it ? Anyone know ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making rabid bear worth getting? You mean they are changing it to a 75pct slow fast recast with -MR check and cripple effects??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No point in being so negative without any sort of evidence.  Rabid Bear does exactly what it is meant to do.  The only problem is that shamans rarely have an occasion to make use of upped melee damage, and the recast timer is very long.  All it would take is a few creative changes to make it a great AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally i would like enchaced to add 300 atk, and give use an innate ability in that time to hit for up to 250 pts with double attack or duel wield (you wouldn't need to equip a wep, it would just be innate whilst in Rabid bear).<br />
<br />
I'm dreaming though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought you could double attack while in Rabid Bear form,  at least I could swear that I do when I use it.    Is this true?  Theres no way I could be hitting like that with just 100% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah - <br />
I do miss melee, or &quot;In Teh Face!&quot; but I have zero interest in Rabid Bear, or in most of the proposals I see posted to improve Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
I will not spend any AA to be able to miss less often, or to do more damage when I don't miss, for 5 minutes out of three hours.<br />
<br />
The few suggestions I have seen that do interest me basically throw out the current version of Rabid Bear and put in some much different set of effects, such as:<br />
using the warrior or hybrid damage tables<br />
dual wield<br />
huge increase in attack (or in offense, or in offense skills like 1hb or piercing)<br />
damage bonuses - usually labeled as dd or dot procs<br />
<br />
<br />
just reducing the reset time to 2.5 hours, or 1.5 hours, or 45 minutes appears to be pointless.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I personally wish we could get away form using the terms &quot;rabid&quot; and/or &quot;bear&quot; when discussing potential improvements to shaman melee.  Rabid Bear is fundamentally flawed as a means of returning melee to the list of shaman abilities.</div></div><hr />

Humor was lost in my text. Meant it as &quot;TEH FUNNY&quot;. I'll be more blatantly obvious in my sarcasm next time =)<br />
