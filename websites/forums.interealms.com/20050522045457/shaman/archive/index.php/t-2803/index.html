<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nightfall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I made an Iksar awhile back, but was wondering if I should have been a troll instead so I could use JBB.  Just wondering what your opinions are on this matter.  In a hurry and didn't notice any threads on the subject.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;STOP!  Chances are the question you are about to post is a dead horse.  Try our search function.  Eg.  'AC + wis'. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think a woodelf druid is a good choice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, you can't do a search on AC + wis.  Search terms must be greater than 3 characters, which is very limiting for a game which thrives on shorthand (AC, JBB, wis, etc.)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Posting dead horses upon arrival is a hallowed tradition ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sacred tradition indeed.<br />

Welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To answer your question:<br />
<br />
The JBB is a very powerful tool, and makes soloing very easy.  However, there is more to the game than exp grinding.  I believe that in the high end game, iksars are the best shamans.  They have the AC bonus and the regen, two very important things for a shaman.  However, trolls have an easier time getting there, thanks to having a more gentle exp penalty, and being able to use a JBB.  The lack of JBB isn't that much of a disadvantage.  You can still group and duo just as well without a JBB.  You cannot solo as easily, but an iksar with fungi + iksar regen + regrowth is a cannibalizing beast, and has more than enough mana to cast lots of dots with little downtime, which a barbarian shaman with no fungi (like me) cannot.<br />
<br />
Either race is a fine choice, and if you already have a shaman made, stick with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fact that you have to ask makes you unworthy of being an iksar. <br />
<br />
Make a troll.<br />

<br />
The experience penalties are the exact same for both races...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Start over right now....<br />
<br />
Don't spend the rest of your eq days posting about how great iksars are and how they are the best then arguing inconsistantly that they should have the JBB also.  It is a logical embaresment.<br />
