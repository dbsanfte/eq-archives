I have been reading that they have moved the high scale Krin from the tower to a different location.  I cannot however get anyone to tell me the location.  Can anyone help please.<br />
Thanks<br />

I think this is old information. About 3 weeks ago we fought our way to the top of the tower, I gave him the Icon of the High Scale (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29782) and he gave me a giant noogie!....well, he immediately aggroed on me and we ganked him. I looted the Engraved Ring (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12121) off his worthless carcass.....serves him right for sleeping with Neh'Ashir.<br />
<br />
We found him at the top of the tower and he respawned at the top of the tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When they moved him from way deep in to his current location, they coded something wrong; for some time after that, the agro version spawned at the old way deep place. This has long since been fixed, as a cursory search of threads here for &quot;kirn hole spawn&quot; will probably confirm. It was fixed long before I did my 1.0 back in 2002.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aanbuffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are familiar with the hole he isn't too tough to find.  After you make your way through the city.......Instead of going into the tunnel heading toward Jaliel (ranger epic) and the old Kirn location, you head straight and go through the house and to the left.  This will wind you through a couple halls and into an open courtyard.  On your right you will see an entrance to another building, at the top in one of the rooms is Kirn.  You should see ghosts, a couple of ratmen and a named imp (roams on the first floor) in the area.<br />
  This is about the best directions I can give you, but they may sound confusing if you arent familiar with the hole.  It took me 4 tries of wandering around with my guild to find him, I had the same issues finding him after the revamp. &gt;&lt;<br />
  Anyhow hope it helps more than confuses you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mortimer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aan totally right, you head into the building and at the very top room (think its 5 floors high, might be 6) there is a locked door with kirn behind it. Not sure if the sacred key works or not, didn't think to try it... had a rogue with me.  This is the same ratman infested building the chanter mob is in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I killed Kirn with just me and my shaman, but it wasnt a cakewalk. Upon getting to the courtyard area of the tower, i ran into a named ratman, that 1. runs at 20%, 2, isnt snareable, 3. still runs if other mobs are around 4. has a TON of HP.  By the time I killed him he had walked halfway thru the building and i had 6 or 7 mobs on me. I barely lived thru it, and i mean *barely*. <br />
<br />
It may not be there when you go, youre mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
But other than that, it was easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did Krin last weekend 65 bard, 66 necro, 61 ranger, &amp; me, 65 shaman. Mobs on the way there were tougher than her. Malos, Turgurs, BoS, &amp; I tanked her most of the fight from the dot aggro. can't remember how hard she hit, pretty sure it was all below 300, may have even been below 200.<br />
<br />
She is definatly on the top floor of the building ppl mention, behind a locked door. We had a key to it drop off a mob on the way, otherwise you're gonna need a rogue to open it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hj7lucy1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can anyone tell me what faction is needed to do the hand in to Kirn? I skipped Ghiosk because guild set up a raid in the Hole for a couple of targets including the epic drop for me, and my true spirit faction is kindly now... do I need to get it up to warmly before I can do the turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">do every step before him, or make sure your faction is in the ally-range (best is to have max ally anyway).<br />
when i did my epic i skipped the part where i had to hand in the black fur and believe me, the jokes in gu when i did the turnin and he just plain ate it were not that funny :)<br />
gladly a druid ported me out, i trained whole com, got out and got cothed -&gt; didnt have to do the raid again, but dont take risks with the faction, its not worth it imo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Strange thing when I did Kirn.  I did the turn in and he didn't aggro.  I just stood there for a minute or two and finally said &quot;Ok, I guess you can kill him now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
We killed him easy, a group of mostly 65's.  He still dropped the ring though.  He was in the tower, this was back in about October.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm pretty sure this part can be soloed. I tried it a couple months ago and made it as far as the second floor of his tower before I slipped up. (Canni'd myself into low hp aggro while using puppies for cc- wasn't paying attention) I made it most of the way down alternating invis and ivu potions, with an occasional fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I plan to make another attempt at this one day soon, as I'm absolutely convinced it can be done. Especially if Kirn is as much of a pushover as everyone says he is.<br />
