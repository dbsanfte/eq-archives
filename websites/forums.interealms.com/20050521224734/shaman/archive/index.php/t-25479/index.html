<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hooray! I get to start this thread!<br />
<br />
As we all know, it's much easier to criticize than be constructive, so let me begin:<br />
<br />
Sorry, let me preface first my stating I'm about 1/3 through 2.0 myself.<br />
<br />
No +PR. Is there no room or something?<br />
<br />
Low +mana/hp regen. Isn't +4/+4 more appropriate? At least? Tier 4 PoP &amp; Tipt+ have more than 2/2...<br />
<br />
Right click. Sorry, not strong enough. 50% increase over 1.5 would be more appropriate. Increase the HoT &amp; the +crit modifier.<br />
<br />
Sadly it looks like I'll have a TA before ever getting my mitts on the 2.0. Then I can drive Sam crazy &amp; complain about the TA not being inventory-clickable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No +PR. Yeah, I will agree with that. I was wondering that myself.<br />
<br />
Low +mana/hp regen... Kind of moot since most people that are able to complete the 2.0 are already at max regen in both, or close.<br />
<br />
500 a tick HoT with a 1 minute duration that stacks with our AA HoT, with a faster refresh time than 1.5. I think it's just fine the way it is.<br />
<br />
Lastly: Why do some people think that an item always has to be equipped/usable from inventory to be useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on the +mana/hp I definitely see your point.. BUT when the new expansion comes out &amp; you can raise your cap.... again, OR would possibly free up some slots, could ditch a Rosrak's Bracer for something with better stats.. Still it's EPIC! Godly ft &amp; regen thanks please.<br />
<br />
Right click, yeah it's nice... I stand by needing a bump though.. especially considering that these things don't fall out of trees.<br />
<br />
Inventory clickable is just a PITA thing. Conjures up memories (from me at least) of Velious quest armor, jb Breastplates.... /shudder. The bandolier feature in the new expansion may mitigate this entirely though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, before I see another &quot;make TA/epic clickable from inventory thread&quot; (and there really have been too many lately) I'll just point you to this...<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.station.sony.com/dragonsofnorrath/features.jsp&quot; Target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dragons of Norrath Features&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
specifically the bandolier feature. (not breaking NDA, listed as feature on main website)<br />
<br />
While it may make things a little easier for some, I know there will be a few that keep complaining about how they have to give up their TA for the stats of epic or epic stats for clicky slow.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt that the TA is an amazing weapon, I've /drool for it many times....but you have to look at it realistically, the TA is a dropped weapon, sure it can be farmed, but it obviously wasn't intended to be attainable for every shaman, especially considering reported drop rates....so if you got it, you were lucky.<br />
<br />
epics, on the otherhand, are from specifically tailored quest where you are working towards a known goal. if you complete the right steps, it is a reward for your hard work.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying killing PoTime Saryrn isn't hard work (well, maybe trivial now), but its alot easier for you to kill a single god for an off-chance drop, than to kill several god-power mobs for a single item.<br />
<br />
my point is simple...understand and recognize your blessings.<br />
<br />
I never mean to offend, and no one has to agree with me, these are just my opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The upgrade in power from the 1.5 to the 2.0 is fine, imo. I do think that the idea to make the effect an HoT that heals a set amount is kind of weak as it has little to no scale-ability(is this even a word?).<br />
<br />
See, right now, the Shaman epic effect is fine and handy due to it stacking with AA and spell(the +crit mod is junk, imo, but it's &quot;icing on the cake&quot; or something), but 6 months from now, it will be less powerful than it is today in relative terms. <br />
A perfect example of how an epic effect should be designed are the Cleric epic 1, 1.5 and 2.0, as they scale with the power of the character(s) to 99%. <br />
If they really wanted to go with a HoT effect for the Shaman epic, they could have made it heal 5%(6-7% for the 2.0)of the target's total HPs/tick and preserved its power through the future expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baman the Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stats shmats.  We all know we're vain and that the real reason behind our discontent is that, quite simply, the epic is ugly compared to Time's Antithesis.   :D</div></div><hr />
