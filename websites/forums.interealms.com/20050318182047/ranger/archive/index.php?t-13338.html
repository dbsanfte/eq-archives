<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catastrophe</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the aerin dar gate-key quest seems to be unable to be completed by a person who has killed aerin dar and gotten flagged to enter halls of honor.<br />
<br />
this to me presents a number of problems...if key people quit, a guild would have to *wait* for a recruit, or hire someone with a key, to open the gate and flag said recruit. also, there's a large quantity of very good xp golems in the tunnel behind aerin dar...which are inaccessible w/o the key. on my server PoValor is overcrowded as is...and i thought it would be nice to do the key quest and be able to take an xp grp back there when Aerin Dar isn't up...but i found out the npc's think i am some kinda hero for killing aerin dar, and i cannot complete this quest<br />
<br />
what i am saying here is that perhaps the dynamics of npc's recognizing character accomplishments is perhaps being overdone, and that some quests as yet undiscovered, ranging from either minimally beneficial such as this one, or very very beneficial...may be unable to be completed due to the same flaw of only being available to one who isn't flagged; i.e. the quest is like a subquest within the quest to get flagged for another zone etc, and once a character gets a flag on a raid he wouldn't be able to get x key or x item which might be very wearable (like the emperor key which is also a very popular worn item)<br />

But I do recall reading an announcement by the EQ live team that they intend post 60 lvling to be something that happens naturally as you progress through the game, not something that happens by waiting around for the same monsters to spawn over and over and over again.  What you are experiencing is the actual implementation for this &quot;vision&quot; of post 60 xp. I think you may have to change the way you play and think about the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you don't have the previous flags than you can't get the final one... at least that was the Case in PoN trying to get into the lair of Terris Thule...<br />
<br />
my friends guild was doing it and only 1/2 the people who actually went on the raid bothered talking to the person outside to get the intial junk flag just by spewing out the normal [so and so junk] lines of text... pretty meaning less in the grand scheme of the quest<br />
<br />
but they went though did the &quot;trial&quot; thing for it but didn't get the flaged for the lair.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I havn't tried to get my Key for that part of PoV yet, so maybe it would work out differently, but just want i was thinking</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st kill, got the text from Astral Projection and then zoned into HoH via the long underground tunnel.  Once zoned in, you were flagged.<br />
<br />
2nd kill, Astral Projection Did not pop!  30 people petitioned who were on raid and still needed flag, not one response from GMs (they absolutely are worthless and just take up bandwith on the servers!)<br />
<br />
3rd kill, Astral Projection showed up with both mixed flagged and unflagged chars, the ones who needed hailed, zoned into HoH, boom they got flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thornwhistler</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cata have you tried talking to the npc's while aerin'dar is alive?  I'm curious if they give the same response whether aerin is alive or dead, I know you can't click the orb down to aerin's lair if he's dead.. but you can if he's alive.  Interesting new trigger VI put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand what he's saying, he's not talking about getting flagged for HoH, he's talking about the key quest to open the door to Aerin`Dar (you need like 6 random drops from various mobs in zone).<br />
<br />
I agree there's no real point in keeping someone who is flagged for HoH from doing the dragon key quest, although it's kind of neat that the game now supports this kind of dynamic thing.  Sony needs to keep in mind that guilds will not be progressing through this expansion in completely lockstep fashion (because people do miss encounters, and there are new recruits), and allow backtracking to some extent.  Still, if you lose all your keys somehow, the only way it really matters is if you still have unflagged people, and then you just have one of them do the quest (MQing is supported, I believe)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah hes saying after you kill the dragon you can not get the key quest becuase the people you talk to say something like  &quot;hey great hero&quot; instead of  &quot;you need a [key]&quot;.  <br />
<br />
He points out some benefits to having a key, like exp from  some mobs.   While this is minor  perhaps with other quests  later in the game it will be major.  <br />
<br />
Say only the group leader needs a key to get you into X mob,   but to get that key he had to go to another zone and kill Y mob,  and Y mob drops some rad loot along with the key.   So your leader with the key ports your group in and you all kill  X mob, get flagged. <br />
<br />
Now you, who did not have a key go back to the people that would want you to slay Y mob, to get to X mob,   but instead they say &quot;wow you have killed X mob you are great!&quot; and will not give you what you nee to get to Y mob.   So you miss out on seeing Y mob, and getting any of his phat lewts.    <br />
<br />
I dont play anymore so im not even sure if thats how it works, but that is how i understood the 1st post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catastrophe</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VI has repeatedly stated they do not support Multiquesting in any way, shape, or form...this policy started sometime during velious, or started being publicized sometime during velious heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well fine, then you would just have the new person loot all of the quest items.  I was just pointing out that in reality it's even easier than that.<br />
<br />
Nothing about going back and getting a dragon key for a new person requires multiquesting.</div></div><hr />
