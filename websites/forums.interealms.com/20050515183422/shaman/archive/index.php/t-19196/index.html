<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually keep one of these on me, http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2586, kind of a get out of jail free card. I buy them in PoK for around 1049pp. Yea, kind of expencive but in certain circumstances I can justify it's use.<br />
<br />
Anyways, aprox 2 weeks ago I went to buy one from the vender in PoK  but for some reason he didn't have any on him. I thought it was strange but I remembered that they sell them in Rivervale so I bought one there. Well, an opportunity came up when I needed to gate fast so I clicked the potion and nothing happened, (btw, I did survive). So anyway, it seems that the Vial of Swirling Smoke might be bugged. Then about a week ago I see them on the vender in PoK again but this time the vender has it in a different slot. I'm not sure if SOE is messing around with the gate potion or if it was a bug and they fixed it. In any case, I thought I'd let you know it might not be working.</div></div><hr />

For that 1k, you could find a necro/sk to summon your corpse, a cleric to res you, an enchanter to c3 or c5 you, and enough PP left over to get a cute wood elf to [blank] your [blank].</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you've got enough money where blowing 1K all the time is not that big of a deal, why don't you just work on your Alchemy skill and make your own Gate Potions (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8348&amp;menustr=080010900000)? Roughly 250pp per combine, you could make 4 for less than the cost of a Vial of Swirling Smoke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a side note, a friend of mine (also a Shaman) was asked to make the instant cast Gate potions.  The buyer was insistant that they were made, but both of us had never heard of such a thing.  We knew about the 3 Heliotrope version (10 sec cast).<br />
<br />
Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh, I see. Didn't know that the VoSS was insta-cast. Makes more sense now.<br />

<br />
Sure, it's a little expencive but it saves me the hassel and downtime of finding necro/sk, cleric and dragging them to god knows where and it gives me the piece of mind to try stuff I otherwise wouldn't consider and 1kpp isn't that much money. <br />
<br />
That's how I justify it.</div></div><hr />

If you play on a PvP server where trains are allowed, its a 1k one way train ticket since plat is a joke to come by.  Its also your personal Oh - $hit button :)</div></div><hr />

Potion vendors have limited stock. Once it's sold, it's gone. Sorry, I've got no idea how they are restocked. Ore vendors are similar, but there is a quest you can do to restock them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">However I believe that that instant cast can both fizzle and be interrupted, so it's still not quite &quot;ideal.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tribe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">duno about fizzling or interupts but you can get the 'your gate is unstable and collapses' or whatever message. My friend used one of these to try to get out of Hate after picking up a rogue epic piece. He paid a wizard for the port up, snuck his way in to loot it and his instant click gate collapsed on him haha. He ended up training mobs around until I paid a wizard to take my druid up to get him out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They dont fizzle, they are instant, so cant be interrupted.<br />
In some cases they are well worth the money and time you'd spend trying to hunt down someone to summon your corpse/ress you.<br />
<br />
I never leave home without one.<br />
<br />
They are refreshed on vendors after a period of time, so you'll need to travel sometimes to get one. I found the best place is the woodelf city.. there is a potion vendor right outside the bank, if you can afford a char slot, make a newbie woodelf and park him at bank. Use your shared Plat and bank space<br />
<br />
remember, they are lore.</div></div><hr />
