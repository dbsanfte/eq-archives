<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok call me slow but I don't see the bug in this picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3:53 minutes left on canni5, which is a 3 min timer.<br />
<br />
Care to elaborate on what caused this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone that uses the word gay to describe anything in EQ doesn't even deserve to speak if you ask me...<br />
<br />
If you have a complaint, try voicing it as an adult, not like you are on the playground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tonight...and tonight only....Sunmoon playing judge jury and executioner<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ps<br />
don't take me too seriously and pop a blood vessel in your forehead...<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  don't. <br />
<br />
ha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you ask me... <br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but no one did.<br />
<br />
not like you are on the playground.<br />
What else would a message board about an online game be but a playground?<br />
<br />
You have to realize and understand that very different people from all ages, cultures, walks of life, genders, races, religions, and nationalities play this game.  Each has its own way of speaking.  Get over it.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic at hand...<br />
Most of EQ's bugs are &quot;gay&quot; :)<br />
<br />
How hard is it to test and see if a quest works before you send it live?  How hard is it to see if Bard songs actually work after a minor code change?  Sony's lack of testing resources and solid testing methodology surfaces after every patch.  It's a shame they can get away with being so sloppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;gay&quot; meaning &quot;stupid and pointless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope I offended some PC-speech nazi with that comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ive had this happen before too , the time is not corrent , even though its not poped , if yu click it you can use it, atleast inmy experience , usualy i have seen this after i zone or something , i figured since it was working even though it wasnt poped ,  that it wasnt a big deal to me. Ill see if i can figure out a more exact reason and bug report it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In my opinion.... Sunmoon and Thantu are GODS here.<br />
<br />
Should they so desire to fling lightning bolts at people for using the term &quot;gay&quot; so be it.   <br />
<br />
Personally I think Sunmoon should fill those disrespectfull people with arrows.  <br />
<br />
But thats just my opinion.  I could be biased as, once upon a time, I knew Sunmoon in game.  :p</div></div><hr />
