<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velondra</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night after hunting around in PoJ with some people I decided to go do the willamena's needles quest, as I was looking for some of the guys I noticed a small gnome sitting by a tree in the tradeskill section of town.<br />
  <br />
 Unfortunately I am not at home so I dont have my log of this handy but his name started with a T. When Hailed he says something about doing him a favor, if you say you will he will tell you that he wants to set up shop there but there is a nasty halfing eyeing him and he is sure if he moves the halfing will take his spot. You follow the text (there are no brackets but it is easy to figure out what to do next) and he will give you a crate and ask you for 6 items each from a different city zone. He wants a Purification tablet from FP, a Keg of beer from Quenos, an armor assortment from Thurgadin, A crate of meat from the bazaar, a bundle of weapons from FV, and something else I cannot remember at all. <br />
<br />
I have two questions - 1. while I was hailing him a level 20 ran by and hailed him and he responded to the guy that he was not yet expirienced enough and to come back when he had killed a few more (large, mean nasty - some kind of adjective) rats. I was wondering if this was because the fellow was below planar level or if it could be related to haveing gone to PoJ where we killed alot of rats... Perhaps one of you who is planar level but not yet entered the planes could hail him and see what he has to say. <br />
<br />
And secondly, anyone else who is working on this quest or who has seen these items around? Last night I started digging through FP and was just starting in the caster guild when a friendly newbie told me the tablet was on a vendor at the NFP zone! Kiristyn Charcoal or somthing close. Perhaps we can get a list going of who has found what where for this quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The result is 60pp (about a 45pp profit) and he gives you a tinkering recipe that turns out to be a Wok.<br />

 Hehe ... &quot;Don't take me for a conjourer of cheap tricks&quot; ( aka newb).... as stated above, was using cleric, no sneak.<br />
<br />
But , found out that a female vendor near crow Tala something or other, also sells the keg and will sell to everyone.</div></div><hr />
