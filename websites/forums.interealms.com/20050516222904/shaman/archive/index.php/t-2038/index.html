<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A group of guildies and I were in Skyfire killing guardian wurms and rares for spells and AA.  Eventually, we got bored with the area and we went next door to The Overthere where we killed the cliff golems and General D'Veers several times each, along with a bunch of misc. dragoons and those named sentries at the tunnel (Tourmaline, etc.).  I actually had a pretty good time killing golems / general / goons, etc.  It wasn't bad exp for the group, and was a nice change of pace.  Either D'Veers or a Golem dropped Bane of Nife once along with a variety of other spells.  These guys respawn fairly quickly, and they seem to be a fairly nice source for 56th to 60th level spells...<br />
<br />
I checked the spell drop list and only saw the cliff golems listed for BoN, but I've heard rumors that they can drop other rare shm spells.  D'Veers and the Golems are all 58 or 59, so they're in the right level range to drop good spells...  Can anyone confirm or deny this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if they drop level 60 Spells, but you can pull rares from 54-59 off them.<br />

<br />
The cliff golems however I have got 56-60 spells off, including 56 necro pet, 60 enc tash, 60 mage pet, and 2 regrowth of the groves.</div></div><hr />
