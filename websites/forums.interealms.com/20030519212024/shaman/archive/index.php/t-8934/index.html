<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
been saving up for a Fungi, and have just given up. . .tired of camping plat, and losing rolls on drops.  ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've saved up about 18k and was wondering if you all would share your wisdom with me.<br />
<br />
Magelo link is below, and Shadel Bandit ring is first on my list  ;)<br />
<br />
Please help me with the maximum 'bang for the buck'.  A 17k one piece upgrade would have to be a BIG upgrade!<br />
<br />
Additionally, I have a friend offering me a reinforced Dragonhorn Bracer for 3K. . .a steal on my server, unless you know a better wrist slot item. . .<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">iksar regen bp and a horse should take care of your plat quickly and easily. With whatever you have left it is time to get some hps, here are some easy and super bang for the buck upgrades:<br />
<br />
black sapphire electrum ears(300pp each)<br />
velium fire rings(450pp each)<br />
barbed rubicite bracers(2k each, and definately better than a dragon bracer)<br />
spider fur belt(200pp)<br />
goranga idol(100pp)<br />
shimmering terrorhide cloak(300pp)<br />
crystal spider eyes(1k)<br />
brown chitin leggings(1k)<br />
<br />
you should be able to get all of these things pretty easily within a level or 2, and after selling the stuff that you upgrade. You will also get a ton of hps and a bit of ac.<br />
<br />
enjoy and have fun :)</div></div><hr />
