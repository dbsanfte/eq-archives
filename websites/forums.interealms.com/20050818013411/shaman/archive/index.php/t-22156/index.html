PUPPY SIZE <br />
<br />
&quot;Danielle keeps repeating it over and over again. We've been back to this animal shelter at least five times. It has been weeks now since we started all of this,&quot; the mother told the volunteer. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it she keeps asking for?&quot; the volunteer asked. &quot;Puppy size!&quot; replied the mother. &quot;Well we have plenty of puppies, if that's what she's looking for.&quot; &quot;I know... we have seen most of them,&quot; the mom said in frustration. Just then, Danielle came walking into the office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, did you find one?&quot; asked her mom. &quot;No, not this time,&quot; Danielle said with sadness in her voice. &quot;Can we come back on the weekend?&quot; <br />
<br />
Well the weekend came and the little girl was back at the pound. Danielle walked slowly from cage to cage, kneeling periodically to take a closer look. One by one the dogs were brought out and she held each one. One by one she said, &quot;Sorry, you're not the one.&quot; It was the last cage the volunteer opened - the child carefully picked up the dog and held it closely - this time she took a little longer - &quot;Mom, that's it! I found the right puppy! He's the one! I know it!&quot; she screamed with joy. &quot;It's the puppy size!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But it's the same size as all the other puppies you held over the last few weeks,&quot; mom said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, not size - the sighs. When I held him in my arms, he sighed,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't you remember? When I asked you what love is, you told me love depends on the sighs of your heart - the more you love, the bigger the sigh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, every time you hold me, I sigh. When you and Daddy come home from work and hug each other, you both sigh. I knew I would find the right puppy if it sighed when I held it in my arms,&quot; she said. Then holding the puppy up close to her face, she said, &quot;Mom, he loves me. I heard the sighs of his heart.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;LIFE IS NOT MEASURED BY THE BREATHS WE TAKE, BUT BY THE MOMENTS THAT TAKE OUR BREATH AWAY.&quot;<br />
<br />

The only &quot; love &quot; Shaman are gonna get is anal, with a lead pipe and no lubrication.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ya, instead of fixing pet shrink and the size of our pets.<br />
<br />
Sony will probably decide to give us ally faction to our pet and go for the sighs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why don't they just add us to the list of classes that have tiny companion spell?  Very simple fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">er.. we've been on the list of classes that have tiny companion since it came out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not a problem with having the shrink spell, it's a problem with the current model being the minimum wolf size. Thus, we can't shrink our pets, but a BL who summons a (much larger) wolf can shrink him to the size that ours is.</div></div><hr />
