One thing to note though, our Defense was no where NEAR the caliber it is today when we beat you in November.  The Patriots are going to have their hands full next week, you can count on that.<br />

The Rams certainly should win, but if you think that they will walk over the Pats you are surely mistaken.  The Pats' defense is VERY physical and gives up among the lowest point totals of anyone in the NFL.  They held the vaunted Steelers running attack to 52 yards TOTAL yesterday, at Pittsbugh, and 34 of those yards came on a single scamble by Stewart.  Jerome Bettis had 8 yards total.  The Pats-Rams game earlier this year (when the Pats were not playing nearly as well as they are now) resulted in a 7 point Ram victory.   Mike Martz was quoted today as saying that the Pats gave the Rams their toughest game this season, and that they are the most well-rounded, best-coached team in the NFL.<br />
<br />
As a Pats fan I will tell you that I still expect the Rams to win by 7.  But it would not shock me if the Pats upset them.  On the other hand, if Brady is out and Bledsoe is in, The Pats will lose big-time.<br />
<br />

Dallas also my favourite team.  :)  They seem to be down for a while (where is the Vikings front office, we need another deal from them), but at least Smith will break Payton's all time rushing next year.<br />
<br />
Amarin,<br />
The pack was supposed to be &quot;Physical&quot; too, and they had an offense to boot.  Vegas is at 14 right now, and I think that is way short.  Basically, while not as good as either, the Rams have a team not unlike SF(80s)/Dallas (90s).  Top of the game running, great (though I really dislike him) QB, excellent reciever corps (though lacking a real star).  What they lack as compared to Dallas/SF is a solid defense, but their defense is not full of holes either.  This will rival the Pats 85 performance, except that they will score a few more points.  My predicted score Pats 17ish, Rams over 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dar,<br />
<br />
<br />
I think what makes the Rams so extremely hard to play against defensively is the fact that Warner will use absolutely anyone as a receiver.  In the last game against the Pack, he had thrown to five different receivers four minutes into the game.  One of the announcers made the comment in the third wuarter that he was up to ten receivers, and in order to get to 11 &quot;They will have to get the coach to suit up&quot;.<br />
<br />
Add a runner averaging close to nine yards a carry post season, and you just can't stop the offense.  <br />
<br />
Now as long as the defense shows up . . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
The luck factor is still worrisome, though.  The superbowl is still just one game, and a single game can be completely monkeyed up by a few calls going the right way, or key turnovers/big plays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, just to chime in here. I still think people continue to underestimate the Rams D. <br />
<br />
The thing that really worries me is the Rams do not have good special teams and the Pats basically used special teams to beat Pittsburg. One of the commentators for the game (might have been Phil Simms) said the Pats felt they had a big edge in special teams and they were looking to put it to use. <br />
<br />
This game should either be a Rams blow out or a very close nail biter. Injuries will play a role as both teams have people hurt. You have to like the Rams chances tho. They are on a familiar field that they play on at least once a year and it is a dome. <br />
<br />
Both games were good yesterday and here is hoping for a good super bowl!<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
I dunno Dar.. you have a lot of &quot;experts&quot; calling the Rams offensive run of the last few years one of the best, if not the best, run in all of football history. This in an era of &quot;parity&quot; which the other teams you mentioned did not have to deal with at all or the full impact had not taken place with yet. <br />
<br />
I think the thing that makes the Rams offense special is the huge depth they have. It is not a question of shutting down one or two guys, because the rest will still kill you. Frisco's big run came when the rest of the teams in the division were doormats for most of that period. Considering the wild card has come from the division the Rams have played in the last few years speaks volumes about the teams that play in that division now. It will all change next year, but the Rams did not enjoy the easy divisional games that Frisco enjoyed for much of their run. <br />
<br />
I never was a Cardinals fan, but one thing is consistant about the Cowboys.. either you love em or hate them. My favorite teams over the years have been xyz team and the team playing Dallas ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh, anyone that thinks that this is going to be a repeat of the 85 Super Bowl is smoking funny cigarettes.   The Bears in 85 were the best defensive team in the history of the NFL, and the Pats were not nearly as good as they are now, either offensively or defensively.  If you throw out the Pat's first 4 games, they have given up 12 points a game, best in the NFL.  The Steelers sang the same song about how they were going to push the Pats around, and they are home today.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I think the Rams are amazing offensively, and they clearly should win, and likely will, but this game will NOT be a blow-out.  The Rams will not score 40 - not even close.  My predicted score - Rams 24, Pats 17.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One more thing - everyone keeps saying New England is &quot;lucky.&quot;  What does that mean?   They have won 9 straight, which makes them, along with the Rams, the hottest team in the NFL.  If you want to say that they got some breaks in a game here or there, sure they have, but so has every good team.  Take yesterday's game, for example.  Troy Brown runs back a punt for a touchdowm, and the Pats block a field goal and run it back for a touchdown.  Drew Bledsoe enters the game after not playing for 4 MONTHS and throws a TD on his first possession.   The Pats hold the Steelers to 52 yards rushing, after the Steelets averaged 172 yards rushing all season.  If the Rams did all these things we would sing their praises, as well we should.   Why do people feel the need to disrespect the Pats by calling it luck in their case?<br />
<br />
Dar - you may not believe it because you they are a bunch of no-names, but the Pats are a better defensive team than the Pack.  Ask Mike Martz and the Rams.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think these experts must be the ones writing for the St.L. Gazzette (or whatever the local rag is there).  Calling the St.L. offense &quot;the best in history&quot; is just absured.  Frankly, calling Dallas under Aikman or SF under Montana &quot;the best in history&quot; is a little nuts (though calling either of them the best team in history would be reasonable, though not correct, IMO), and they were both clearly better than St.L. is now.  The best offense I have ever seen is S.D. under Foutes.  IIRC, that team was routinely posting 400+ yard games and scores in the 40s and up.  Also, while SF may have had an easy road to the playoff each year (Dallas did not), you don't win SB's on the weakness of your division.  SF's offense in the 80'd did not suddenly collapse once it had to face out of division opponents.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for correcting me Wulfran.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, the St. Louis teams are being compared to the &quot;Air Coryel&quot; teams and St. Louis is not only putting up numbers like those teams did, but are actually surpassing them in many categories. The big difference is San Diego never had any type of defense to go with that team and never made it to the big game because of that. <br />
<br />
As far as comparing offense to the 49's, they had some great teams, there is no question. Joe and Steve are some of the best quarterbacks to play the game. Rice speaks for himself. They had a great TE and Roger Craig was pretty good to. The problem for those teams is they generally could not run the ball like St. Louis can and their 3rd and 4th receiving guys don't even compare to what St. Louis has now. Frisco went as far as their defense could carry them and the years it was pretty good, they went all the way. Other years, it let them down. Frisco never really relied on their defense to win games for them. <br />
<br />
Dallas had some well balanced teams and 3 of the biggest stars to play the game in Troy, Emmitt, and Irvan. They had a great full back and a better, more consistant defense than either the 49's or the Rams. The Dallas defense could (and did) take control of games on days when the offense had problems..<br />
<br />
Dallas still did not have the depth on offense the Rams do. Who did they have for extra receivers? <br />
<br />
The Rams defense this year has played generally well and, unlike last year, has won several games for them and I think played a big role in the Green Bay game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Novachek was Dallas' TE and always put up huge numbers.  He was Aikman's #2 reciever for a while.  Dallas did not really lack depth in the recieving corps so much as they lacked depth in roles.  Irvin was a Wide, but rarely ran posts or corners.  Almost half of his yards came after the catch.  Over the dominant years, Dallas sported a number of other wides, though they did not typically recieve passes.  Martin, Sanders, Harper (who in 1993, iirc, was the NFLs #2 reciever in terms of yards, behind Irvin).  These big play recievers basically ran really fast upfield and allowed Irvin big gains after his receptions.  Anyway, you are not going to get me to disagree with you that this team was one of the best teams in the NFL history and certainly one of the best offenses ever (though I still rate S.D. as better).  I think the focus on depth is really overrated though.  It only matters if your starters can't stay in.  If you look at Dallas' big three - they had an amazing start game percentage (especially Smith), and really, where Dallas lacked depth was at QB, but most teams (Rams included) do.  It is rare (Dallas with Danny White and SF with Steve Young) that a Great starting QB is backed up with someone who could also be a starter, but for their team's current starter.  Dallas, however, was particularly weak in depth at that spot (though neiter Martin nor Bugler are anything to be thrilled about either).<br />
<br />
I also agree that the Rams defense has played pretty well (ranked 3 or 4 in yards given up, I think.).  Their gaping hole is in forcing turnovers.  Or maybe that is too harsh.  They are about average there and the Offense (esp. Warner) is particularly prone to giving it up (another reason they really can't be considered one of the best ever).</div></div><hr />

You're not the only one who's being &quot;underestimated&quot; there Amarin.<br />
<br />
And I'm not even beginning to &quot;underestimate&quot; the Pats chances, I didn't against Green Bay, and I didn't against the Eagles.  The lines mean nothing, I knew that the game with Philly would be a great matchup between the teams.  I know that this Sunday should be a great game, but to say that the Rams will blow out the Patriots is a bit pre-mature, but not out of the realm of possibility :)<br />
<br />
The Patriots earned the right to be AFC Champions, as did the Rams earn the right to be NFC Champs.  They both belong in the Super Bowl.  Saying either is &quot;lucky&quot; is not accurate.<br />
<br />
What would you rather have?  An total dominate Offensive blowout?  Or a strong defensive showing till the end of the 4th quarter?  I know which one I'd like.<br />
<br />
Speaking of estimates, our defense STILL isn't getting the respect it should be after TWO great showings.  One year after being blamed for our fall from grace, it's the DEFENSE that got us to the Big Dance once again.  Seems that everyone's brushing that aside...<br />
<br />
One thing we do have is Super Bowl experience.  A lot of the guys from 1999 are still on the team.  They know what it takes to win and will show that on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Some random points I'd like to address :)<br />
<br />
Point 1:  We are &lt;B&gt;NOT&lt;/B&gt; the Steelers...you Patriots fans can count on that.<br />
<br />
Point 2:<br />

&lt;h1&gt;On to N'Awlins&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;ONE MORE GAME!&lt;/h1&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Da! Forgot about Novachek. He was one of the best. <br />
<br />
It should be noted that Martz draws his lineage to Air Coryell and the St. Louis offense is considered rooted in that line. (Coryell-Norv Turner-Mike Martz). One of the points I am making about the depth is that Martz has shown himself to be one of the very best at designing plays to exploit unfavorable matchups, utilizing his depth and watching film of other teams. The Rams also look to be very good at making 1/2 time adjustments on the other team. Green Bay confused St. Louis by going with a &quot;dollar&quot; protection scheme, using 7 DBs in the first half and St. Louis crushed it in the second half. It was a close game the first half with the Eagles. Although the score really did not show it, the Rams dominated the second half. <br />
<br />
Hard to compare the teams as I think the era's are different pre cap and post cap and the efforts the league has gone to for parity. No question Frisco and Dallas were one of the best teams of their era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Waran:<br />
<br />
All good points, which is why, as I say, my head tells me the Rams will win.  My quarrel is not with those that pick the Rams to win, it's with those that act as if the Patriots are this bumbling bunch of fools that managed to &quot;luck&quot; their way to the Super Bowl.  You don't win 9 straight in the NFL, including the AFC championship on the road in Pittsburgh against a team that was 13-3 with one of the best defenses in the league, because you are &quot;lucky&quot;.  (Not picking on you Fal, btw - this is a common statement about thge Pats.)<br />
<br />
The Pats' game plan against Pittsburgh was to stop the run and to keep Kordell in the pocket and make him beat us throwing the ball.   He couldn't do it.   I think that the Pats can slow down (not stop, slow down) Faulk.  The question is whether they can do that without so sacrificing their pass defense that Warner and his receivers run wild.  A tall order to be sure, especially on turf.  But if anyone can design a successul defense against the Rams, it is Belichek, as both Martz and Warner have said.<br />
<br />
I'm with you Waran.  I would much rather see a game that is tied or close in the 4th quarter, and I suspect that is just what we will see.  Again, my prediction is Rams 24, Pats 17.<br />
<br />
Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">IMHO Pittsburgh has been and until they ditch Cordell (SLASH) will continue to be over-rated.<br />
Lets face the facts the AFC is the weaker cousin to the NFC. Their is a level of play that the NFC teams seem to be able to achieve year after year that the AFC cannot seem to equal.<br />
<br />
So saying that the Pats beating the Steelers means something I feel is wrong. The Pats dont have the offence or the defence to compete in this SB. BTW one of the great recievers that the Cowboys had that I think was overlooked was Harper. GO COWBOYS errr RAMS.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmm Toker, let me see.  Of the last 4 Super Bowls, the AFC has won 3.  Sure sounds like the AFL are a bunch of weak sisters. <br />
<br />
Certainly there was a time when the NFL dominated the AFL, but in the more modern era of salary caps and revenue sharing, it is nearly impossible for one team or league to dominate.  It's just too hard to keep a good team together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Honestly, the Rams are a pretty amazing team and Aeneas Williams has been a HUGE addition to that defense.<br />
<br />
Waran, you've been quoting some pretty good stats about the Patriots losing 2 Superbowls in New Orleans, but here's a good one to chew on thanks to the Monday Night Football crew:<br />
<br />
&quot;No team that has ever lost to the Buccaneers in the regular season has gone on to win the Superbowl that year.&quot;<br />
<br />
How's that for surreal?<br />
<br />
All joking aside, if not for a bad call by the refs in their first meeting the Patriots had a shot to at least tie it up late in the game.<br />
<br />
Here's my take:<br />
<br />
1) The Rams receivers are not physical but they are fast.  I have no doubt that Ty Law can take Isaac Bruce out of the game, but we'll have to see how Otis &quot;Toast&quot; Smith can handle Holt.  He did well against Plexiglass this past Sunday, but Holt has a lot more speed.  Bottom line:  the Rams receivers are going to get beat up.<br />
<br />
2) Faulk won't run for a lot of yards in this game.  What killed that Patriots in their first meeting was Faulk catching the ball out of the backfield and getting into the open.  The Patriots are going to need Bruschi to step up and shadow Faulk on passing plays (Bruschi is probably the fastest and most energetic of the Pats linebackers).  If the coverage against the receivers holds, expect Lawyer Milloy to move up and punish Faulk when he does touch the ball for a running play.  Waran, you're right: Faulk is NOT Jerome Bettis and containing him will be a huge challenge.  If Faulk has a big day it's all over but the crying.<br />
<br />
3) I honestly believe Bledsoe is the answer to the Patriots.  I think the guy can step up at this point and get the job done.  Brady isn't bad but this is his first time in the big dance and the pressure all week is relentless.  As long as Drew stays out of the mosh pits he'll do fine.<br />
<br />
4) I'm really really hoping to not see a replay of Superbowl XX with the Bears.<br />
<br />
This should be a good game and I'm looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree with you here, Aeneas said that during his Free Agent visit that he heard that the Rams were installing a Bucs style defense.  He jumped at the chance and instantly became a team leader in the locker room, someone to look up to etc.  I see him as a Ray Bourque type of influence for the Rams D.<br />

<br />
You obviously missed the games where Bruce and Holt blocked for eachother when the other has the ball.  The last time the Rams receivers were called &quot;Soft&quot; they rammed the ball down the 49ers throat.  <br />
<br />
But by all means, keep using that, I'm sure we'll prove you wrong, like we did to everyone else this year.<br />
<br />
2) Faulk won't run for a lot of yards in this game.  What killed that Patriots in their first meeting was Faulk catching the ball out of the backfield and getting into the open.  The Patriots are going to need Bruschi to step up and shadow Faulk on passing plays (Bruschi is probably the fastest and most energetic of the Pats linebackers).  If the coverage against the receivers holds, expect Lawyer Milloy to move up and punish Faulk when he does touch the ball for a running play.  Waran, you're right: Faulk is NOT Jerome Bettis and containing him will be a huge challenge.  If Faulk has a big day it's all over but the crying.<br />
<br />
I don't expect him to run &quot;A lot of yards&quot;, I mean it's the Super Bowl.  Not many games are dominated by one style of Offense. But the thing about Marshall Faulk is that he's proven time and time again that he is &lt;B&gt;the man&lt;/B&gt; if you give him the ball.  Take the Eagles game for example.  They hardly used him in the first half of the game and were losing at half time because of it.  Once they said &quot;Here you go Marshall...here's the ball&quot; in the second half, he ripped the Eagles apart.<br />
<br />
As far as him getting &quot;punished&quot; did you see the Eagles defense in the Endzone rip Faulk's helmet off his head, then push his face down with their hands?  Faulk walked out of that &quot;punishment&quot; with his mouth guard still in.  Punish?...please :D<br />
<br />
What killed the Patriots in the previous meeting, along with the Faulk factor, was that they couldn't contend with the amount of Total offense and time of possession the Rams were putting up on the board.  482 Yards and 33:54 Time of Possession for the Rams was a major factor of why you lost.<br />
<br />
Controlling the football and keeping the other Offense off the field = A key to success.<br />
<br />
3) I honestly believe Bledsoe is the answer to the Patriots.  I think the guy can step up at this point and get the job done.  Brady isn't bad but this is his first time in the big dance and the pressure all week is relentless.  As long as Drew stays out of the mosh pits he'll do fine.<br />
<br />
I really don't have an opinion of which one should play or not.  It doesn't really matter to the Rams really.  As long as the Defense gets the job done, we shouldn't have to worry about who starts.<br />
<br />
4) I'm really really hoping to not see a replay of Superbowl XX with the Bears.<br />
<br />
This should be a good game and I'm looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
Yep ditto on that, I'm hoping for a great game to watch as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Patriots are going to win because they have the momentum and the heart.<br />
<br />
They have a very good defence especially in the Red zone. They have a very good special team. Their offense is good, they do need to improve their rushing skills.<br />
<br />
Also their defense are playing very aggressive. They gonna beat Rams into submission like they did to the Steelers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Having watched Belichek with the Jets for a couple of years, I can say that he always found a way to take the other teams &quot;thing&quot; away. When no one could beat Flutie and the Bills, the Jets could. We always did well by eliminating the other teams strength, and that's what the Steelers game looked like. Pit ran the ball well on everyone, and Kordell won the games when the running game was only good, instead of dominant. Pats managed to eliminate the bus, and contain Kordell.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't think anyone can take away the balance of the Stl Louie offense. I saw that first-hand at the Jets game this year. Now that their defense is also winning games for them, I don't think it's going to be much of a contest.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that it's a speed team playing in a dome.<br />

<br />
Complete agreement.  The Patriots are going to need to hit with a heavy dose of Antowain Smith, push the Rams fast but undersized DL off the line of scrimmage and end up with at least 35 minutes in time of possession to win.  The Patriots will probably also utilize a lot of screen passes and short passes over the middle to Troy Brown and Jermaine Wiggins, where both of them excel.<br />
<br />
And like I said, the key to the game is stopping Faulk.  You were right...there were two different Rams teams we saw against the Eagles, one where Faulk hardly did anything and one where he dominated the game.  If the Rams go out trying to pass on every down, they are honestly going to have issues.  Ty Law is one of the best corners in the league and Lawyer Milloy is one of the hardest hitters in the league.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">hmmm Amarin, I believe that the only reason the AFC has won 3 super bowls recently is because the NFC Championship game should really be the Superbowl. Our guys arrive so beat up to the big show that it became much easier for the weaker AFC teams to compete. Bwahahahahaha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, since our QB has already shown that bruised ribs, a sore larynx, a half-healed sprained thumb and back spasms won't keep him form winning, I am NOT worried about the Rams getting beat up.  ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
And what was with yanking Faulks helmet off anyway?  I know it's a physical game, but it's been a long time since I have seen an uncalled technical foul caught so blatantly on tape.  (Well, except maybe for rushers pushing themselves back to their feet using Warners ribs as a crutch.)<br />
<br />
<br />
What will win the game is depth in the offense.  Take Faulk off the field.  It'll hurt, but someone else will carry the ball.  Knock Williams for a loop, we can find eight or nine other people to run patterns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look for our offense in the first half, and I mean from the first kickoff.  Look for the defense to make some plays in the second half.  They don't have the size, but once lineup positions are sorted out and assignments made, they get the job done very well.</div></div><hr />
