I am going on a small Hate Raid soon (first time there for all on the raid except for 2 peeps out of 24) and need some help.<br />
<br />
I have been placed incharge of organising the Buffers, there will be 4 groups on the raid, but unfortunatley we will be low on real Tanks.  <br />
<br />
What I need to know relates to Buffing, is there anywhere out there that contains a list of who should recieve what Buff?<br />
<br />
If not can some of our more experienced colleagues out there please advise me on what class to Buff with which Buffs? And if possible include some reasoning.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing special to know about buffing.<br />
<br />
The only thing special for hate is you are going up usually by groups of 5, unless you have several wizards: one for each group.<br />
This means you usually end up making groups on the plane and not before.<br />
<br />
I explain:<br />
<br />
since you need a wizard to go up, if he has to disband to make the taxi, your group is made of 5 people and not 6 up there...<br />
<br />
usually groups go up and run to SS...if a cleric can camp at SS then your raid is nearly safe.<br />
<br />
First group goes up (with monks/rogues) to check the entrance.<br />
then run to SS...if they aggro, they should give enough time for the cleric to camp at SS.<br />
<br />
depends on the level of your members: if you have a good level 55+ group he can do it alone. If most of your people are around 50, try to go up with 2 groups and protect one cleric/one monk at all costs.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the more people you bring at a time, the most difficult it is if they have no experience...they will bring adds, they will die everywhere and train other people...try to explain those people the RULES that are important on a hate raid (you can find some pretty good guides on the net)<br />
<br />
You can also try to fight at entrance but it s a bit more difficult IMHO.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, explain to people that when you say CAMP!, they immediately camp without asking questions...mobs from second floor are nasty ones :)</div></div><hr />
