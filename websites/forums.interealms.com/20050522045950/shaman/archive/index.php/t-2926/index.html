<br />
trying to buy one the last few days and not getting any takers, so I figure I will burn my own rubys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Krakster, instead of blowing some rubies, why not work on getting an earring of the Solstice?  There is also a super nice earring that drops in ME (a cleric friend just got one last night).  <br />
<br />
The Solstice earring quest isn't that bad now that everyone is getting into it.  Sickles and robes (the two most expensive pieces) are down to 3K each on Emarr, but they would be much cheaper if you have a friend thats a high level smith or tailor.<br />
<br />
One of our guild tailors is making the robes at 176 skill, we just bring her tons of the parts (40 plat + gem studded chain which is returned upon failure) and cross our fingers til she gets a combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I guess that hoop is, like, totally nineties. I got so many quests bouncing around in my head now as it is I was shying away from that one. The earring in ME, is proabably the one the vamps drop right? Guess I could try soloin a few of those, heh my faction is pretty good with them from all the katta fools I have killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think an ivandyr's hoop is actually cheaper to get than the costs incurred doing the cabbage quest.  I easily spent 6k getting junk for that quest while I got 3 ivandyr's hoops out of 10 rubies (1.3k).  Of course it doesn't always work out that way.  The item you get back after turning in a ruby is completely random... but more often than not you'll have yourself a hoop without turning too many in.  Plus the other items you can get sell for about 30-40pp each so that further cuts your losses.<br />
<br />
But.... I wouldn't try the quest atm.  It appears to have been nerfed/broken with the last patch.  I've heard stories of people blowing 5+ stacks of rubies and not getting a single hoop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, sure, it's probably easier to get an ivandyr's hoop than an earring of the solstice, the solstice earring is far superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I useIvandyrs hoop and the earring of solstice.  Info on Ivandyrs:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to wait near the entrance to Guk for a Troll named  Lynuga.  She hangs out in the swamp genrally near guk along the river toward the bashers.  Bashers do not like her FYI.  In fact that is a way to get + Basher faction.   Give her a ruby and she gives you either a hammer an axe or the hoop.  The items are lore so if you have a friend start handing the axe or hammer to them to sell to the merchant if you want to cut your costs.  You can also recharge the 6 charges of insta-spirit tap if you have a friend using the ole sell 1 depleted and 1 full earring to the merchat routine...or so I have been told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the earring of the soltistice is great.<br />
<br />
/hug Earring.<br />
about 70hps, 100 mana for me.  Plus ft1, saves, 5ac...<br />
<br />
<br />
that Lynuga lady was really mean to my friend Uggok too.  Don't give her any shinies, she bad person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Indeed the earring of the solstice is a very nice earring but I never said he shouldn't do it. ;) <br />
<br />
Just saying that he shouldn't discount getting an Ivandyr's Hoop simply because the solstice earring is so nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahhhh, Ivandyr's Hoop, me crusty old self remembers dat quest well.<br />
Here issa sum info if ya issa interested in goin fer one:<br />
Ya lookin fer a troll named Lynuga, she wanders da area around da Guk entrance, froggy island.  She a rare spawn, taken up ta 6 hours ta git her sumdays.<br />
She on da same cycle assa da Noble Hunters/Troll Slayers, so keepin dem cleared makes her pop fasta.<br />
She kin be up, but no be on track cuz da swamp seems ta mess wit trackin sumtimes.<br />
Once ya find her, ya need ta feed her rubies tilla she gives ya an earring.<br />
Wolf form will make ya indifferent to her.<br />
When ya hand her a ruby, ya git back either a hamma, chopper orra Earring.<br />
Now da thing ya need ta know issa dat the odds of gettin the earring are based on ya faction wit her.  Da more she likes ya, da betta da odds of ya getting an earring are.<br />
She issa on da same faction as da troll anda Ogah guys in da outter Neriak area.<br />
Each ruby ya turn in gives ya +dem faction - Troll warroir anda SK faction.<br />
If ya kill her, ya git a quest ruby fer sum INT caster item I forgetten.<br />
I woulds advise findin sumbudy who dun da quest befores ta turn in da rubies, or ya kin jus feed her rubies tilla ya git an earring.<br />
If ya gots a budy, ya kin sell da choppa anda Hamma back not lose dat much cash per try.  Keep in mind dat the weapons are all lore, so ya will need sumbudy ta run to da merchant a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Me got Ivandyr's Hoop finally afta 68 rubies... 68!!!  So now me kill dat she-bish wheneva me sees her (she high on me KoS list).<br />
<br />
Yzzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It took us 3 rubies for one hoop and something like 3 stacks of rubies for the next... <br />
<br />
She is on the same spawntable as the nobles. Bring a tracker and kill them as they pop, it has never taken us more than 15-20 mins to make her spawn. There are 3 nobles that spawn pretty close around Guk entrance, kill one and next pop in 7 mins or something the like - just concentrate on killing them and all the froggies on the island in the meantime. <br />
The stupid red bard is not on same spawn table, but you should kill him anyway just because!<br />
<br />
We used a level 1 troll mule to do the actual hand ins to Lynuga since we didn't want to loose our precious faction with the trolls. A shaman can buff him well enough not to have to worry about the froggies, and then sit there letting the pet kill the froggies all around.<br />
<br />
You can minimize the cost buy running back and forth selling all those stuff you get but since it's lore it's just annoying. We found that the time it took was not worth it, compared to killing some HGs after instead for the time you 'gained' by just destryoing the stuff.<br />
<br />
If it's true that your faction with her gives you better rate for hoop to drop I believe troll mule is better than wolfform. Just, you can't do it solo then.<br />
<br />
After a while she despawns, so don't count on sitting doing hand-ins for hours and hours once you made her pop.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm pretty sure troll slayers are not on the same spawn table as Lynuga - I've seen both mobs wandering the swamp at the same time. So don't ruin yer Grobb faction by killing Slayers hoping for Lynuga to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i solod the vampires in ME for 3 weeks straight 8 hours a day, never had an earring drop, after a patch they also seems to do more dmg, and even at 60 with torpor i had some close fights, also some resists even when i pulled with malo.<br />
<br />
But get a 3-4 party down there and u can easily kill them and get xp from the surrounding mobs to, anything that gives decent xp and the chanche for a great item is good imo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would bet that Lynuga is KOS to you, but you can do the quest with a mule ez anyhoo.  You will want to do the turn-ins with a partner who can gate to the vendor at the hand and sell back the junk so you can recoup some of your costs.<br />
<br />
The old average that farmers used to post for rubies spent per earring was ~ 20 rubies, but keep in mind that is the AVERAGE and you can get some nasty streaks of Midnight Mallets/axes. <br />
<br />
Unless you can get an Earring of Pain or one of the other CT ear items, the hoop makes a nice pair with the Solstice earring.  Why compare when you can get both?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had an almost identical experience as Ysgwyrthyr, and I kill that ***** every time I see her now.  If you look into the Happy Love Bracers quest, you will see that she is also a two-timing cheat who broke the Grobb shadowknight guildmaster's heart :/  which is another good reason to plant her.<br />
<br />
Glorianna, I think Krakster has 2 ears ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do this 2 times... the first was 68 rubies and the second was 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
First time I did it with an Iksar shaman...  had to kill lots of slayers for faction with her and get wolf form.....  then SOE did a faction patch and I could no longer do the quest.<br />
<br />
Second time I did it with a lvl 7 troll shaman I was using for a mule to check vendors for frog blod (part of iksar cultural smithing).  Troll shaman had no faction problems at all.<br />
<br />
I have noted a lot of ideas about what makes her pop but have not found any of them to be true.  If she is up she is up.  Kind of like the AC in SRo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Glorianna, I think Krakster has 2 ears <br />
<br />
Yep, which is why I suggested the solstice and ME earrings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oopsie.  I think I blanked that ME part out because of the millions of hours I spent there when Luclin came out camping that godforsaken thing =)  I would not suggest that crap xp hell to my worst enemy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Think I will go with the hoop for the time being for &quot;ease&quot; of picking one up. All my time in ME atm is spent at the goranga tree. Eventually I will do the solstice earring for the other ear...just too dang buzy with other stuff atm to worry about it. <br />
<br />
But great suggestions, thanks =)<br />
<br />
btw I have 3 ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I didn't think you scaled types had any ears?<br />
<br />
Have someone pull her all the way up to the DoT guy and you can do hand ins and sell easy. Something like a 60% loss instead of 100% if you just chuck the hammers/axes. He's indifferent to everyone as far as I know, so you only need 110 charisma for the best price (thanks Opal Stein!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anyone get an Ivandyrs Hoop lately?<br />
<br />
I've been popping into the swamp on daily basis to  check if she's up, can find her at least once a day. I've done around 20 rubies in the last week and maybe another 10 from before. I am amiable to her and still amiable to Da Bashers, I don't know about SK, I figure I never go there anyway. I was doing fire beetle eyes to off-set the basher hits but if it's true that better faction with her makes the earring come sooner I won't do  anymore, doesnt seem the basher hits are all that big anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway it's mostly axes with a hammer now and then. The junk weps sell for 76pp and change at 100 cha, for my Troll 100/150 cha works out the same and the rubies cost 131pp and change so I still have a way to go before I hit the bazaar prices, I've seen them for 4k up to 6k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I gave up on the Ilvandirs hoop long ago... after spending 40-50 rubys over 3 different Lynuga spawns I gave up...   Thankfully I have a solstice and raptor tooth now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah but it's a Troll thing, once I get it she gunna die everytime I see her. I just need to know if the lousy thing is still being given out and if anyone got one in the last few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I turned in easily over 40 rubies to Lynuga on 2 seperate occasions. I did these turn ins with my Troll shaman alt, and my girlfriend helped with her Enchanter using her Troll illusion. <br />
<br />
The first time i found her i was all excited and handed her about 4 rubies and she promptly despawned on me, so dont sit still for long because she doesn't seem to like to wait around. The second time i found her i just handed in Rubies as fast as i could and gave up on the notion of selling the lore weapons to a merchant 1 at a time to recoup my plat losses.<br />
<br />
For all my troubles i received NO EARRING. During my second series of handing her mass amounts of rubies, there was also another player giving rubies to her as fast as she would take them, he got stiffed too.  I kept at it for a while hoping i would luck out and get the earing, but the random number generator just wasn't going to give me a break.<br />
<br />
I  gave up after that and just bought  the earing off a player.<br />
(found a player selling one with no charges he said it took him around 20 ruby hand ins to get it)<br />
<br />
Note the classes and usable races on this earing:<br />
<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop<br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
AC: +6 Wis: +6 Int: +6 HP: +6<br />
Weight: 0.1<br />
Classes: Necromancer Enchanter Magician Wizard Ranger Shaman Cleric Shadowknight Rogue Warrior<br />
Races: Iksar Ogre Troll Gnome Dark Elf Erudite Half Elf Human<br />
Inventory Slot: Ear<br />
<br />
A few key shaman races like Barbarians and the Kitties won't be wearing this earing. It does look nice on my Troll shaman alongside a forrest loop though.<br />
My girlfriends High Elf Enchanter was not able to equip one either much to her dismay at the time.<br />
<br />
A little while after this a guildie told me he had a system down for getting these things, and much to my amazement he actualy managed to get one trading in less than 10 rubies. He seemed to believe faction had a big amount to do with it, or maybe he was just really lucky. He also mentioned that Werewolf form wasnt KOS to trolls with his Enchanter for what its worth.<br />
<br />
He got his earing a couple weeks ago, so yes she still works and isn't broken as i feared at times. She MIGHT give out the earing in under 10 rubies, but if the random number generator doesn't like you that night you can blow many more than 40 rubies on it and still get shafted.<br />
<br />
My advice is to turn in a few rubies and if you don't get lucky cut your losses and just buy it from a player. If you do get lucky congrats on winning Lynuga's Ruby Lottery and your new Ivandyr's Hoop.<br />
