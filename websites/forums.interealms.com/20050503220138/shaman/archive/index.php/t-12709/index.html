<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just needed to get opinions on this matter. Persoanlly, I don't have this spell and the current market rate of this spell on my server is about 2Kpp.<br />
<br />
I have not bought it so far and I feel I can put the 2kpp to much better use than for the 10hp per tick regen and marginal wis increase.<br />
<br />
I used the earlier bear fomr briefly in my low 30s but stopped when I found it prevented me from bashing and just seemed to slow skill increases.<br />
<br />
Well at 61 now, is this spell worth getting especiallly since I still don't have Tigirs, Pox, malo, Topor and a host of other 58+ spells. Also another negative part about this spell is I can't use my lizard mount if I have bear form on.<br />
<br />
For those that have bought and ussed this spell, what is your impression of this and how useful would you rate it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's 2 hp regen and 10 wisdom.  It's not worth 2k imo but I still use it on raids.  But I'm a regen freak.  Wish I made a troll instead of a barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is not worth it, especially if you have a horse.  It really has no practical use, but it's a nice spell to have just for goofing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's 10 free wisdom and 2 free regen..sorta like maxing out your defense for free ac imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makagis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The spell drops alot in PoG, you could make 2k when your there too =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use it whenever I can't use horse, i.e. indoor raids. I figure every little helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's my favorite spell, as it facilitates the majority of my RP'ing in-game.  However, 2 per tick and 10 Wis isn't gonna make a HUGE diff.<br />
<br />

There are SEVERAL ways for you to have a great time with bearclothes:  shrink yourself, go /role, put on walk and follow the polar bear cub line to Everfrost n00b area  (OMG!  he's unkillable and red!).  Shrink yourself once, cast bearclothes and grow twice (now you're the same size as Iceberg), cast lev on yourself, run through the Everfrost n00b area and watch 'em scatter!  And ALWAYS cast bearclothes when around dr00ds and ask them to follow you inot any city, in wolf form! (they HATE us cause bearclothes doesn't make us instanly KoS to guards)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, greater bear form is great fun :) I really like it, and use it on all my indoor adventures. Its also good when you're on a corpse run, saves the embarassment of all your mates seeing you naked and trying to look up your kilt.<br />
<br />
In terms of powergaming though, no its probably not worth 2k to have 2hp regen and 10 wis, especially if you are still saving for all those other 58+ spells. That's really quite a list you are missing, and with a bit of time you should get most of them. Go to sebilis and camp the emperor (easy to duo with a rogue, or a bit tougher but still doable solo if you get a rogue to drop you off there), you'll get many of those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was fun at first and I used to use it all the time, especially when my armor didnt match.  Been a long time since I used it though and dont anticipate using it anymore except for fun.  <br />
<br />
2k really isnt that much, not like you cant make it back relatively quickly if you wanted to, or just wait a bit and see if you find a copy for cheaper or get one to drop, I paid 5k when it first came out so you should be able to find it cheaper than 2k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you do any tradeskills, the 10 wis is a nice bonus to KEI. Every little bit helps, especailly doing Alchemy or other expensive combines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As posted by Halycona, I also use it when indoors and can't use the lizard. The extra regen and Wis is nice, but not 2k worth. I got lucky, a Guildie found it for me for 500pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ack, I saw it for 400p the first time I looked, and I passed since I'm a level away and hoped to get a better price.  Now it's gone. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think I payed 850p for it waaaaaaaaaaay back when I hit the appropriate level for it.  <br />
<br />
Until I got Torpor, regen was a huge issue for me (being a Barbarian) so I used FoTGB all the time.  <br />
<br />
After I got Torpor, regen started to matter much less.  After I got replenishment at 61, it was almost a non-issue.  <br />
<br />
As the other posters said, it all adds up though so I use it when I am in an indoor area and using my resist gear (which lowers my wis and hp a teeny bit).  At all other times, I use the horse or just stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I only use it when I cant use my lizard. plus on raids it makes it easier for the dim tanks to find the shaman  =P<br />
<br />
*edit* heres a fun trick when you're very bored and want confuse some n00bs. cast bear form, click off sow ( I know! it burns! ) and crouch. now when you move you'll move &quot;gumby style&quot; kinda funny watching a big bear slide around on the ground. even more funny going over hills! impress your friends with your bordom!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To add to the fun tips:<br />
<br />
Cast bearform then equip a fishing pole and some bait.  Walk up to people and hit the Fishing button.  You'll roar and take a swing at them.<br />
<br />
Fun to do on raids cause people think you are getting hit so everybody starts looking around for a mob in camp.<br />
<br />
Sparring with other bear shamans can be amusing too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At times, I'll shout to my group or my raid, &quot;GOING POLAR!!!!!!&quot; and start attacking....  they always laugh  :)<br />
<br />
And I have to say it.....  when we're swimming, we're DAMN cute!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used it quite a bit when I first got it, but have pretty much stopped using it altogether since KEI became widespread and horses were introduced. Back in the early velious days it was pretty good, but, as with most things in EQ, sort of gone by the wayside as newer spells were introduced. Most raids I couldn't use it if I wanted to because my buff slots are usually always full. I think I've used it a grand total of 3 times in the last month, when I'm soloing or duoing mobs where every little bit helps, like guardian wurms / west wastes mobs / mobs in PoP that mitigate slow. <br />
<br />
As a side note, I think an improved version of Form of the Great Bear for 61+ would be a nice idea, maybe make it 4 regen per tick / 20 wis and incorporate Spirit of Bih' Li into it, giving us the SoW speed and 30 ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's really quite a list you are missing<br />
<br />
It's the same list most of the Shaman I know are missing, including myself. Nothing strange about that. If you have them all, I'd say you are lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I used Form of the Great Bear briefly when it, and Velious, were still new and then forgot about it.  Now I use it when communing with druid pets, to impair gnome/Linger line-of-sight, and anytime I find myself in Rathe Mts.<br />
<br />
I would pay between 500-1K for it, but no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I personally get a headache from bobbing up and down all night long in a grind group, so I use bearform to stay at the same height. I'm also too cheap to buy a horse :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I love this spell and use it quite a bit.  Anytime I don't want the horse I am a big brown bear.<br />
<br />
At one time it was more of a shaman milestone before they put in the little gimp bear at 39?<br />
<br />
All that said,  You should be able to either find it for a lot less then 2k or just go kill in PoG for a while to get it to drop.<br />
<br />
I also love the bear when I put on all my *gasp* wis gear for tradeskilling.  No way in hell do I want to be out in public with all that druid looking crap draped on my big ogre frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Like Halcyona and others, I always put on the bear when indoors.  I personally really need the WIs, and I am addicted to regen.<br />
<br />
But I had to comment on Juka's suggestion.  That sounds cool - maybe higher than level 61, but wahtever.  BUT - lose the Bih'Li/Say/ScoW idea.  bearform is best for indoors for all of us that have a horse.  The SoW component would render it useless for many of us.   <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, do I want to use an ethereal or a spectral to get Form of the Greater Bear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I want form of the horse riding bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The reason I stopped using bear form is that you cna't tell whether you're sitting or not.  Nothing worse then trying to get a quick slow on a surprise add and &quot;you have to be standing to cast&quot; Now all I use it for is the quick 10 wis buff for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I had a friend say to me the other day &quot;OMG, when did you get your Epic??&quot;  I've had it for months and months, at least 6 months.  &quot;Oh, maybe because I always see you in Bear form....&quot;<br />
<br />
I like being smaller and the vision.  The wis and regen can't hurt.   Lasts a long time.  Shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks for the replies guys.<br />
<br />
Ok so basically this is a &quot;fun&quot; spell with minimal uselfulness. I think I am at the stage where Spell effectiveness is more crucial than fun.<br />
<br />
I'll eventually get it after I get the more critical spells. Spent 4 hours doing GW hunt in SF and 6 spells dropped and of which one was a shammy spell jasinth urgh!</div></div><hr />

 One other thing you must not forget, when in bear form you can CLIMB things much easier. I always put on bearform when I zone into Nadox at the Lava river. That climb out by the bridge is a killer. Plus, in bear you can climb the wall and just about walk to the bridge, without even going in the lava.</div></div><hr />
