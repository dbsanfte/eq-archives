Hail Friends and Travelers:<br />
<br />
We hope you will aid us in seeking* the safe return of a wayward Ranger. His name is Sithrin Sol’Belenus and he was last scene traveling through the Karanas on the Rodcet Nife server. He had many delusions, one being that he was a froglock, quote: “I AM THE FROGLOCK KING!  Ribit…Ribit.” We all hope for his safe return.  It is believed he was pretending to be a shaman on Morrel Thule.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veranna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We are old friends, we used to adventure together when the game was first released and for a long time afterwards.  We lost touch over the years and are trying to locate him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hope you find your friend...<br />
only advice i can give is try posting on the sever message boards.  you could post on the morris thule boards (http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards)<br />
or try the rodcent knife boards (http://pub59.ezboard.com/bguild75784)  (not sure these are the main server boards, just best I could find on short notice... anyway you get the idea).</div></div><hr />
