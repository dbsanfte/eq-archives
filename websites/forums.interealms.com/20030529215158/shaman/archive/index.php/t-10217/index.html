<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, i'm on the final part of the canni 2 quest to get the greyish bone chips from KC, i'm wondering how do i get there from FV zone becasue ove seen the map in eqatlas.com but i can't see any particular entrance. Also when i'm in there how hard is it to get to the warlords corpse?? and do things see invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To get to FC from FV, go across FV bridge, hug the wall past the swamp zone. It's hard to find, I suggest looking at a map first www.eqatlas.com (The zone entrance is on the map, look again).<br />
Then go through the tunnels, going generally west till you zone into the Dreadlands.Go straight out of the cave/tunnel till you see a large, rectangular building. KC's entrance is on the south (I think) side.<br />
<br />
Getting to the warlaord can be problematical, as most of the mobs there see invis. I suggest going when KC is the busiest, like Fri or Sat evening US time.<br />
<br />
Good luck, I skipped cann 2, just waited till cann 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
KC is easy gettign to hands room is not that hard plus ppl pull warlord to other camps liek capt (where i got mine actually) lcy or rcy and rarely in the moats so u may not need to go to hands for it.<br />

If u are evil the big dogs won't aggro. GL<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, I have no idea what Morrighan is talking about.   Here's how I get from FV to KC.<br />
<br />
From the bank, look approximately toward the bridge, but a bit left.  There's a sidewalk leading to a building with two guards and an open doorway.  Go in there and take the tunnel under the bay.<br />
<br />
Run out the tunnel entrance and go west to the zone wall.  Move north along that wall until you reach the two iksar statues guarding a cave entrance.  Stick tight against the zone wall, there are spiders nearby, but you have to leave the zone wall a bit to get to the entrance.  Tunnel entrance is at about -200 (first loc number).  NOTE: if you keep going a bit you will come to the stream and the LOIO entrance.  This is a much safer way to get to LOIO than straight up the stream, IMO.<br />
<br />
Once in the tunnel, keep going straight, ignoring all turns, until you zone into DL.<br />
<br />
Once in DL, invis if you have it (about half the mobs don't see invis) and run straight out (west).  Right where the green grass gives way to brown dust, you'll see two kneeling Iksar statues; THIS IS YOUR LANDMARK FOR THE RETURN TRIP.  Go to those statues and run EAST and you get back to FV.<br />
<br />
But you're still trying to get to KC, so keep running west and veer a bit south to get around the ruins.  This is a wide, dry plain with LOTS of mobs, many of which see invisible.  But since it's wide open, you can see them as well, so just avoid them.  The aggro radius is pretty small and the plain is hunted heavily so it's often pretty clear.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the plain is a huge rectangular building - KC.  There is an &quot;apron&quot; or patio all around it that is free of wanderers on the east, north, and south sides.  Hit the apron on the south side and run west along the apron to the west side.<br />
<br />
There are two static drolvarg spawns outside the entrance to KC, halfway up the western side.  You should be able to hug the building behind them and get in if you move quickly.  If not, well, just zone it.  It may depend on your server, but on my server the rule is TRAIN RIGHT at KC - i.e. the entrance swings to the right and the left, and you should always go to the right to enter.  Usually zonein is safe, as long as people remember that rule.<br />
<br />
While you are there keep your ears open for rotting Jarsath armor, and make it known that you're looking.  The stuff is not bad for a midlevel shaman and it rots ALL the time.</div></div><hr />
