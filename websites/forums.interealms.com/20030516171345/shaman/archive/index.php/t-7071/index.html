<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ha Me troll mojo user, but me want to try to make gudz things with my skillz ...<br />
<br />
Me need smarts, but me not have lots of shiney coins, but me can get to bazaar to buy but too many choices maake my head hurt<br />
<br />
me hope you can help me get more wizdom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You trolls were at the front of the queue to get hit with the ugly stick, but were having too much fun to bother even joining the line where they were handing out brains....<br />
<br />
Anyway, if I understand you correctly, you are wanting to purchase some cheap +wisdom items to assist you in your trade skills? (Assuming that you realise hp &gt; AC &gt; wis for general use)<br />
<br />
It will help people who want to offer advice if you can post a list of your current wisdom gear, and so that we can see where you are currently at - what level you are will effect what we suggest because your ability to earn plat is so exponential depending on level.<br />
<br />
Until you post your gear and level, I am not going to recommend anything too radical. But for tradeskills, you can't go past player made +7wis rings (platinum jasper?). There are also the +wis player made earrings. Either find a high jewelcraft skill enchanter, or check out prices in the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ha me no need brains  .... ah   wait.<br />
<br />
Me know opinion of AC/HP/Wis  me got my mad skeelz gear in seperate bag.<br />
<br />
ok troll speak makes my head hurt<br />
<br />
I'll post gear here in a later post.  Is magelo the best method?<br />
<br />
Mez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your best bet is to use the bazaar search window, select race, class, set stat to wisdom, press search. Then click on the price column to list items by price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">About Bazaar and/or info sites:<br />
<br />
What I want to make sure of is that I'm not missing a perfect piece, that doesn't happen to show up in the bazaar that day, and the price is bad on the sites so I wouldn't know to wait for it.<br />
<br />
I will be glad to take recommendations on Jewelry, the guild enchanter has been off a few days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please, do us all a favor...and go sell that wreath to a druid :).<br />
<br />
I'll make a magelo later for mid-level gear which I would wear, look for me to post it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What level are you?  How much money do you have?<br />
<br />
It matters quite a bit.<br />
Like whether I would suggest an earring of the solistice, or a forest loop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry lvl 29, money probably less than  1K to work with.<br />
<br />
wreathes are nice cause they impart a nice taste to toasted halflings :-)<br />
<br />
Mezuggh<br />
lvl 29 troll shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your gear is pretty darn nice for level 29.<br />
If you only have 1k theres not many things you can upgrade.<br />
<br />
Very shortly, level 34 or so you can solo for your epic shield upgrade.<br />
<br />
Get rid of the nightshade wreath.  if you want a new hat with wisdom, go camp the polar bear for the totemic one.<br />
<br />
Chipped Bone Bracers would be better bracers because of their focus effect.  Because you have Kromriff Military Leggings I assume you are someones twink, so if you can also do the Coldain Military Wristguard thats even better.<br />
<br />
Honestly your gear is far beyond your level at this point.   My emphasis at lower levels would likely be on saving for a regen tunic, or getting whoever twinked you to get you one.  Iksar Ceremonial Chestplates are going for under 5k now.  Then next I would look for items with mana preservation and afflicition enhancing focus effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're just looking for cheap wis items to trade skill with I would recommend platinum jasper ring (X2),  a platinum ruby veil and an othmir fur cap.  you should be able to pick up all four for less than 1kpp easily with some money to spare and all have +6 wis on them.  Just don't use them as combat gear, they suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">YUp  I'm a twink  .... oh the shame ....  and reason I'm restarting shaman is just for troll cultural smithing  thats why needed wisdom gear.<br />
<br />
but right now I'm finding my shammie is more fun than my twink monk, and a lot more fun than my non-twink chanter<br />
<br />
edit: to change word armor to smithing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you are just looking for the items that are shaman wearable with the most wisdom per slot, rather than items that are good for shaman everyday gear... well, the searches on Allakhazam and other sites should work quite well for that.  Allakhazam even gives a rough estimate of market price of the items.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mezchant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes thank you I was looking for specific smithing gear with the post.   My hope was to see if there was &quot;a jewel in the rough&quot;,  that might have been great for shammies, that I might overlook otherwise<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for their input<br />
<br />
Mezuggh<br />
<br />
now lvl 30 on Cazic-Thule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darkmane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Might be able to get an arctic wyvern cap fairly cheap.  9ac and 10 wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Smithing uses not only WIS and INT as a checker for a skill increase, but also the STR stat.<br />
<br />
So it might be a valid option to just buff your STR with your spells, before you start a smithing session. My troll can achive a STR of 170+ at lvl 22 buffed. Which is quite a bit higher then my WIS of 137. <br />
