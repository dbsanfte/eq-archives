It procs &quot;Light Healing&quot; but according to the discussion some say its a lifetap, and some say it heals the wielder...can someone confirm its proc please thank you.<br />
<br />
P.S. As long as its not healing the mob itself it'll be fine<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The proc will heal the wielder.  Its only a 33pt heal though so not all that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well at level 55.. with stacked buffs from hell.. kragg infusion.. haste.. str.. dex.. sta.. agi.. rage.. AC.. and a couple others people were dropping on me.. i was tanking on boats in dulak thanx to this spear..<br />
<br />
they couldn't pull agro off me and they were trying too.. he.. procs like mad.. gives you hit agro.. proc agro.. and heal agro..<br />
<br />
so when you're slow pulling and wanna thump things.. it's a great stick..<br />
the AC on it is nice too.. 2/3 of the AC on my POS totemic BP.. haha<br />
<br />
i picked mine up in bazaar for around 3k.. and i'm loving it.. i can say if i paid more than that for it i wouldn't be really thrilled..  most people i've talked to said to get a REIF instead.. but as much of a statslut as i am.. i still fill a need to keep my gear in character a bit.. which is why i have a kobold shaman's pouch.. a alchemists bag.. and a herbalist pask as WR bags heh..<br />
<br />
the one thing i truely love about it though.. is the look.. it's very distinctive.. not many people have them.. and it stands out in a crowd..<br />
<br />
although like any other piece of gear.. unless you KNOW you want it.. don't buy it till you try it..  see if a guildie or a friend has one you can borrow for a while.. try it out.. see what happens..<br />
<br />
that's becoming my new philosiphy for gear.. seeing as prices on 7th hammer are TERRIBLE..<br />
<br />
anyway.. ya i'd say it's damn tootin for 3k.. 5k (what they originally went for on 7th when i first saw them) i'd say is steep.. and 7k (what they're asking now) is way too much..<br />
<br />
anyway.. gl.. hope you find something that suits you well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would imagine this weapon would really shine in the hands of a<br />
Healing Gift/Healing Adept enabled Shaman. From my understanding,<br />
those two AAXP skills work on healing proc weapons.<br />
<br />
That *COULD* potentially put this weapon at 72 pts. per proc. I have<br />
one without those skills yet and it does proc quite frequently.<br />
<br />
Very cool weapon  to have in the right situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow spiffy spear. What does it look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Imagine a bronze harpoon.  Very modest but unique graphic.  If you added one hooked barb to the REIF it would be the TLS.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think this weapon is silly because of the required level of 55 and the tiny heal.  Either lower the first or raise the second to let it appeal to more players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow REIF up to 9k on 7th hammer now.. glad i got the loyalists spear when i did..<br />
<br />
well after i finish run3.. i'll try that healing adept and gift (i wanted them anyway) and see what happens.. a 72 point heal would be a free Canni3 just about..<br />
<br />
mmmm...<br />
