<br />
You might be an old DOS DInosaur diehard if......<br />
<br />
<br />
- you go out of your way to avoid the use of the word &quot;Folder&quot; and encourage others to do the same.<br />
<br />
- you view the folder as a graphical representation of a Directory.<br />
<br />
- you install a game and automatically rename the directory to 8 character's or less with no spaces purely out of habit but mainly because you feel safer about it.<br />
<br />
- You have personnal issues with the defualt install directory of C:\Program Files\....<br />
<br />
- you remember when windows first came out and thought of it as a fancy menu system for users too stupid to learn DOS.<br />
<br />
- you can tell the difference between IBM DOS and MS DOS; and you thought 4DOS was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
- you can remember loading various TSR's into your autoexec.bat<br />
<br />
- you know what a TSR is.<br />
<br />
- your thankful you know longer have to make boot disks for Extended and Expanded memory configurations but at the same time curse windows.<br />
<br />
- you can build and configure a new PC with nothing but a single floppy disk, and have it running without never inserting anything Windows related into the machine.<br />
<br />
- you remember when 3.5 floppys came out<br />
<br />
- you remember having to park a hard drive.<br />
<br />
- you remember when a 20 meg hard drive was ALOT of storage.<br />
<br />
- you know what a Hercules graphics adapter is.<br />
<br />
- you remember flipping dip switches to configure your machine.<br />
<br />
- you remember when upgrading your computer involved installing a Math CoProcessor.<br />
<br />
- you've ever configured and ran a TCP/IP connection without windows on an IBM PC machine.<br />
<br />
- you still think of pentiem or AMD PC's as IBM clones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok im out of steam.. this hit me while i was installing Dungeon Siege ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few more:<br />
-You know what system memory is, how much a computer has, and why it's not enough.<br />

-You know the SET BLASTER config line by heart.<br />

I started programming when the TI99/4A computer came out.   That computer was the bomb because of the two manuals that came with it.  One was a huge book of sample programs and the other was a huge book of the break down of all the basic commands.  I was 12 at the time.  =)<br />
Moved on to C64 where I learned to program in its basic language and tried to learn how to get the sound capabilities to work.  ADSR anyone?  Switched over to assembly language using the Merlin assembler.  Woot this was big time programming.<br />
Then came the high speed 286 with a 10 megabyte harddrive.  More storage than you will ever need!  I can still hear the distinctive tink tink sound the harddrive made while accessing files.<br />

That's what started me on the fine art of debugging, and it's served me well, even as I realized I hated programming and moved into the IT field.<br />
<br />
Most annoying feature of that mac = the reset and the interrupt buttons on the back left of the machine.  Those that owned these comps know what Im talking about.  The reset button resets the computer.... the interrupt button resets the computer AND corrupts the disc.   Two very indistinct picture labels, and me being 7 years old, that interrupt button was responsible for a LOT of lost data.<br />

Learned how to use an abacus for kicks.   Later learned slide rules... they're really not too bad once you learn how.</div></div><hr />

First computer was the very first TRS-80 availiable in Utah. (Parents managed Radio Shacks back then) It had a whopping 4k of ram, and a cassette tape drive.  We moved all the way through the TRS-80 line.  We were very Uber with our 16k machine with a 5 meg external HD that was as bigger than most PC's now days.  Then came the TI-99's and the CoCo-64's.   I remember Lotus/Intel compatable memory cards.  Upgrading my 8086 to a 286 with an overdrive processor and having 1meg of memory and using part of that as a ram disk and cutting a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet macro/calculation from a 12hr process to a 4hr runtime.  My first IDE HD was a huge 40 Mb and thinking I would never fill it up.  It cost me over $500 btw.  Using Memmaker to squeeze ever last K out while still loading all my drivers.  The Soundblaster 16 that came with the CD that plugged into the Soundcard.<br />

On top of all this I must really be a dinosaur because I still have my DOS 3.1 disks somewhere along with DOS 6.22 upgrade disks.  I still find a lot of my navigation easier in dos box than Windows but, I am slowly changing.</div></div><hr />

DOS 3.2 had just been released<br />
The UNIX 6150 with 1million pixels was launched with 1mb ram<br />
You used an expansion box with an XT to make the best 640K RAM system<br />
You played Gato and Decathlon on the PC AT at lunchtimes<br />
<br />
Or at school you typed in on a TRS80 some basiuc programs for games and saved to cassette...</div></div><hr />

You formatted your tape by running it over the screen and the static would erase your program.<br />
<br />
I actually made a very cute little program to teach division of fractions, with a little man who hopped a step up a mountain when you got a correct answer. If you got him all the way to the top, a little flag went up, and it played Ride of the Valkyries.<br />
<br />
That's actually the last program I wrote that did everything I wanted it to - in 1984.</div></div><hr />

I think with that release hard drives could go up to 32 MB as well.<br />
<br />
That was right around when I switched over to the IBM compatible PC's from the TI 94/A and Apple //c.</div></div><hr />

But there was a cure: OS/2... now that one I mourn.  Did someone mentioned Win95 and multitasking in one sentence earlier?!?<br />
Set Blaster? Yeah, part of getting the Gravis Ultrasound to work... but SBOS worked better than any real Blaster at the time... and native GUS beat that easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm only 19, so I think I was about 4 when we got our ol' Commodore.  I didn't get much into the programming, but ah, the games!<br />
<br />
Let's see if I can remember:<br />
Anyone ever play Karate Champ?  Hahahah, that was the coolest game, one of the first two player games ever, I think.<br />
<br />
Monta Zuma's Revenge?  Very cool.  Had to get those keys, beware the snakes!<br />
<br />
Quickball?  I think that was the name.  You use the controller and bounce your ball over obstacles on the course on an ever increasing speed each level until you finally lost total control around level 19.  I think it was impossible to actually beat, but it was my favorite of all.<br />
<br />
Professor I.Q.  -  The only reason I can spell today.<br />
<br />
Bard's Tale - Wow.  The ultimate RPG.  Still one of the best ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trash 80's, Atari 400/800/1000's, and Comodore 64's.<br />
No hard drives, and being cool because your computer screen was amber instead of green.<br />
<br />
Back when saying you were going to build your own computer really meant something!<br />
<br />
Text adventure games were the coolest (ZORK), and we can't forget about nibbler or throwing bananas at each other, lol.<br />
<br />
Games like Wizardry were awesome.</div></div><hr />
