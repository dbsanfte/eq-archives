<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been &quot;clean&quot; of EQ fgor a month or so now, and yet, at work I am still refrred to as the shaman. Arrg. I expressed dismay at this today, and we got on a &quot;You know you play EQ too much when..&quot; discussion. I cannot take credit for any of these, as all of these belong to my co-workers, most of whom still EQ avidly. Cheer or flame, by my guest. <br />
<br />
<br />
You know you play too much when :<br />
<br />
You refer to your &quot;less exceptional&quot; co-workers as bards or druids. <br />
<br />
You accuse your co-workers of &quot;zerging&quot; when you see them approach a problem with more than one person. <br />
<br />
You think everyone at work is a n00b, even your boss, because you can tell he e-bayed his position. <br />
<br />
You accuse your co-workers of &quot;training&quot; whenever they leave you a problem. <br />
<br />
You mutter something about ph4t l3wt when you get your paystub, only to find this funny dollar sign near the sum. <br />
<br />
You refer to Wal-Mart as the Bazaar, and the cashiers are &quot;vendors&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
These get old, but after a month of being clean, I thought they were pretty damned funny.</div></div><hr />

The evolution of game terminology will some day be a recognized branch of Linguistics. Funny how a concept in Starcraft has been found relevant in so many other games(and real life).</div></div><hr />

Actually there are a gajillion theories of where &quot;woot&quot; came from, ranging from rap to gaming to some kid in a small town.  This link (http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&amp;id=189002) has by far the best compilation of possibilities that I've found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I constantly say &quot;ACK!!&quot; when something goes wrong/screws up. Guess it's better than &quot;F**K!!!&quot; when theres kids or parents around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enapay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was at a party with some friends and about five of us played eq.  We had been drinking a lot when one of our friends came to the party late.   One of my eq buddies said hey we need to Power Level him.  Meaning we had to make him drink to get him to the same drunken state we were in.  Of course only the EQ people got a laugh everyone else in the room stared at us with a confused look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alot of the guys at work EQ, I got them hooked last yearish. Course, now that I am gone, they don't ask me for anymore favors, but we still gab about EQ. <br />
<br />
And we still referr to our &quot;less gifted&quot; co-workers as dr00ds and b4rds :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For someone who is now &quot;clean&quot; of EQ, you sure are posting a lot here, Kkrush.   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pwning the boards while the wifey is away. EQ aint easy to let go of, becasue it wasn't the toons keeping me glued to the game, it was the people. Like these clowns in here. *megahugs*<br />

This is my &quot;nicotine patch&quot;. <br />

<br />
1) You say &quot;WOOT!&quot; in real life.<br />

3) You threaten your friends buy saying &quot;I'll Train yow ass!&quot;. (But not meaning in EQ).<br />
4) Anyone you see doing something stupid is a &quot;noob&quot;.<br />
5) You were asked, &quot;what are the names of all the continents (in rl earth) and you say Antonica instead of Antarctica (really happened to me).<br />
6) You wake up and log on for 5 min Just before leaving to go to work. (I still don’t know why I do it) <br />
7) You leave your toon in PoK idle for over 72 hours because you don't want to lose a Mage summoned Item.<br />
8)  You look up stuff on EQ at work.<br />
9) You think about EQ more than sex<br />
10) You have given your girlfriend an excuse to make her think your cheating on her when all your really planning on doing is Playing EQ all weekend. (Guilty)<br />
11) Taken time off work with the sole intent to play EQ (I suck)<br />
12) Your wallpaper is EQ related!<br />
13) You would buy a new, faster, computer Just to play EQ.<br />
14) You thought about going to an EQ convention dressed as your toon.<br />
15) Have tried to get your girlfriend, mother, and next-door neighbor to play.<br />
16) Have downloaded the &quot;If I had a mill Plat&quot; song from Kaza.<br />
