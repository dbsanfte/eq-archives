<br />
Hey all. I was playin around with my froggie tonight when I decide to go into befallen and get some of that uber dungeon exp. Well just as I zone in, I see a dwarf cleric npc standin there. never seen him before so i decided to hail him. This is the conversation<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;Hail, Zeek&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeek says, &quot;Ah, so many undead to slay, so little time. What is it you want? You come about the potions perhaps?&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;I come about the potions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeek says, &quot;Give me the four clues.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That's as far as i got.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any more info on this?  I'm not at home so I can't log in and check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is basically the revamped Kaglari doll quest for newbie/lowbie trolls now that they live in Neriak.  It starts with Bregna in the Neriak Foreign Quarter and involves killing various mobs in different zones to get riddle clues to turn in to Zeek to get back what he stole from Bregna (or similar, not 100 percent up on the backstory for this one.)</div></div><hr />
