I wanna 2 box, with my wife, but do i need to go and and buy annother copy of the game and its expansions.  That would seem pretty expensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you do, however its not too bad. They have the gold edition which includes every expansion except LoY for like $49.99.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can probably order it from amazon.com and not pay shipping on it either! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait... gold has PoP too?  BAH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The nice thing is, you don't have to actually install the CDs you buy.  Just snarf the key and start a new account with it.  You can use either account on either computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently bought it for my second account (which only had old EQ) got it at best buy for cheap. it was 45 after tax, and tax in houston is like 9%.<br />
<br />
so it was a good deal. may want to check them out. paying $20-30 for each expansion would suck, but it isn't so bad to get gold. anyway, hope that helps..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just got the gold box from SOE, as Amazon was out of stock (said it was discontinued) - total with NYS tax &amp; shipping was about 63 bucks.  Now if only PLing my SK would go faster &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is getting harder to find as sony only made so many of them and a lot of places are sold out now. I talked to a friend at Fry's and he said they've been out a few weeks now so get it while you can.</div></div><hr />
