<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to ask a few questions on this quest.<br />
<br />
~Can I do it more then once? So I can have it in both of my wrists<br />
~How hard is it? Approixametly how many hours or days?<br />
~Do I need faction with it? If so could I just bring a bard to make them all amiably to me or do I need even higher?<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying. Any other information or strategy to complete this quest would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  It's not lore, you can get two.<br />
2.  The battle will require about two groups of highly competent people.  You'll also need a few people to harmony.  Scout Charisa must be up and not have the bag.  If you bring adds along with the captain, you'll need more people.<br />
3.  You need at least amiable faction in Skyshrine, possibly higher.  They start off KOS so you'll need to build faction with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two groups of 55+, and 1 group or less of 60+ can do it.  I got my second bracer with myself,  60 cleric, 60 monk, and 60 shaman.    <br />
<br />
The giant captain can be slowed 25% using plague of insects (or up to 40% with a higher level shaman), I think normal slows don't land.  I've never had EC land even after tash and malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lowest I've done it with is 4 people.<br />
<br />
Ranger(me...tank)<br />
Rogue<br />
Cleric<br />
Ench<br />
<br />
He's really not tough at all....just a lot of hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dravack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Takes 2 people =p<br />
<br />
I did it 3 times in a row with just me and my cleric(had c3).<br />
<br />
Both me and my cleric were 62 at the time.  Got 2 bracers and a talisman for the lil dorf.  Used a blade of angels to avoid getting too many ripostes.  Had cleric use his lil pet to add some dmg too.  Just a pain to find scout up, and if you need to get people there, it's sorta a pain too.  Getting hit for 300 or something is nothing these days, haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The hardest part is catching the scout up / holding the camp.  She spawns right above the entrance from SG.   Once you know the time of last death she is a 10 hour spawn.<br />
<br />
Did it with 62 clr 60 rng (me) 58 sk and 60 mnk the other day.  Monk pulled the captain cleanly twice for us.<br />
<br />
He has decent hps, but otherwise is easy enough.  Be careful of wanderers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can single pull at 60 or use Harmony if less then 60. He has 100,000 hitpoints and double hits for 270. He only stays up for about 10 or 15 minutes at most. If you fail to kill him within that time you have to wait 10 hours to try again. If the scout is holding a bag that means someone has already triggered the giants and attempted the quest. The note that you get when you complete the quest only results in more faction hits and maybe a few plat.</div></div><hr />
