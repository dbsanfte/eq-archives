<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tamuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone tried to turn in to rak with max faction after skipping tear and have it still work, or am I going to be the guinea pig soon?  Would hate to lose a tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean skipping Hole? Rak needs a tear, from someone with the correct faction in order to spawn his aggro version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tamuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have my truespirit faction maxed out, but i didn't know with the other problems people are having with their faction if Rak would still aggro me when i turn in the tear.  I have skipped the hole since i maxed out my truespirit.  I'd hate to lose a tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yoo can go back and do the hole now....  After the patch the hole uses Kunark rules and is significantly easear to do now...  one strong group with a chanter can kill all the way down to kern without much trouble.   Chanter can mez adds just like in Old Seb now so a pull of multiple mobs no longer be a big problem.<br />
<br />
A single group in mez guild did it last night without any problems, and without using any fancy CoH tactics to skip da city.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That hasnt been a problem for a very long time.  The hole has always been fairly easy for a well balanced group.</div></div><hr />
