<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was goin through shadohaven the other day and realized, hey bunch of these guys are blue... I never go there except to go to a few select zones. So why should I care about faction? I saw it might be connected to katta faction.. not sure, just stuff I saw on alakhazam's site. while running around this place really looked like it would be a great place to solo, if gaurds don't agro through walls you could run in a abanded building to med saftely. Has anyone tried this? I figured I'd see if anyone else tried it and said.. no way! those guys hit too fricken hard. Ok.. thx for your input</div></div><hr />

You can do a search to confirm, but I remember someone saying at one time they were the target of some AE groups, so they got nerfed to have very high HP. YMMV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea, I toyed around near the zone lines. They don't hit too terribly hard 156, but they were pretty magic resistant took me awhile to land turgurs, also I hit it with  BoN, full length or close to it, it's hp didn't even budge 99% hp I didn't even see the bar move. I also tried one more in the middle of the zone, but with my monk, I got him pretty buffed up fought till bout 20% and had to feign, again it's hp didn't budge.</div></div><hr />
