<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a shaman on tholuxe and i've never actually fought any of the golems.  I've been at the step of getting the iksar tear now for 3 months, and i'm tired of not having my epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
What i wanna know is, what kinda force is needed to take say dread?  4 groups minimum? 3?  My guild never raids fear but i have some friends in a smaller guild, just don't know if there's enough of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on gear and levels, two of the golems death touch.  Other than that they arnt tough, they have low hp so just throw a horde of melee at him (requires little strat).  Bad gear and levels 48-55 id say it would take 20-25 people, mostly melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most everyone i could throw at him is 55-60 with a few 50-55, no one lower.  Probably only have 2 55+ clerics, both have clickers.  Have 2 60 chanters as well and a 60 mage and then of course a bunch of warriors.<br />
<br />
I saw someplace that dread doesn't pop the iksar child?<br />
<br />
The golems are all slowable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd add that the one with the Cold AE debuff (forgot which) can be a real pain if your resists aren't high enough and you don't put up enough 'useless' buffs on people.  Bring more for him.<br />
<br />
Also, a clicker cleric is nice (obviously) for ones that DT.  I wouldn't say essential, but REALLY helps.<br />
<br />
Took me 5 months (with about a 3 week break from trying) to get my tear, rading Fear usually once a week or more and only saw about 5 golems in that whole time.  My guild is not Fear capable by itself.  Just hang in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah i can relate, my guild is fear capable but they spend all their time raiding rhag1/2 and HoT and just don't care about a shaman epic evidently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of them has an AE spell.  Makes it a pain for guilds just getting into fear.  If you're 55-60, 2 groups can lay waste to probably all 3 pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Got mine off the ae guy in a pickup raid, probably 6 groups I think.  We cleared fear and all the golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can confirm that Dread does not spawn the Iksar Child.  He was the only golem up on the last Fear raid I was on.  He didn't even drop any of the other golem stuff for the other members of the raid, the stingy bastid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Am I just being insanely lazy?  I have everything for the quest completed (including the tear that I got way back when the child was a 2-minute constant spawn).<br />
<br />
I just need to go kill Kirn, and the two Ashiirs ;P  Of course it would help if I just go play EQ again, been several months now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I understand, any of the 3 golems can spawn the broodling when slain.  It is apparently random.  Although I have heard that the broodling spawns after every two golem deaths.  Used to be that she spawned after every golem kill.  I think it is Dread that has the AoE.  The broodling spawned after killing him for me.<br />
<br />
I am now an epic holder, as of Wednesday.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is the spawn time on these bastages? Guild went last night and they were not up. I've been told 3 days and then I've been told 7 days. Anyone have any info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am pretty sure it's 3 days for golems, and 7 days for CT himself.<br />
<br />
PS - Gratz Zatriz :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IIRC, Fright and Dread are the deathtouches, and Terror is the aoe.  We've had raids where we've taken 1, 2 or all the golems out.  Most iksar we've ever had spawn was 2, when we took out all 3 golems.  The Iksar broodling seems to be pretty much random.  From our experiences, Fright tends to spawn the broodling more often that not.  Probably all random number generator though.<br />
<br />
The aoe demi CAN for a fact spawn the broodling as well.  I earned my first tear (sigh, dont ask) from a broodling that spawned from the aeo demi.<br />
<br />
I've also never landed a spell on any of the demis.  Although after the first 2 or so, I quit trying.<br />
<br />
We've used a variaty of tactics on the demis, some worked better than others.  The one we finally settled on, and seems to work well:<br />
<br />
Send in a druid to take the deathtouch.  A monk, right behind the druid, immediately pulls the demi (and friends) back to the raid.  Enchanters spend their time keeping the adds mezzed (usually 2-4 amalgems).  All the melee wade in and start killing.  We've dropped them without taking a deathrouch (besides the druid sacrifice), and we've barely won after 5 extra peeps heard their name called.  I guess you could say we're still refining our tactics :D <br />
<br />
I guess I probably think of the aeo demi as an unslowable faydedar.  Not the same, but that is how I think of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm at the stage of needing the Tear, but can't seem to get on a Fear raid, and my guild isn't big enough to do one.  If any kind Shaman out there is on Xegony, and either has a spare tear (!!) or is in a guild that raids Fear regularly, could you be in touch?  I'd love to go to Fear anyway, and desparately need the Tear.....<br />
<br />
Thanks guys</div></div><hr />
