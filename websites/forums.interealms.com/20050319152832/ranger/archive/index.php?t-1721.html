Part of growing up is learning you don't have to cuss to express emotion.  Wil Smith/Fresh Prince commented that his grandmother, upon hearing one of his early efforts made him feel about 2 inches tall in her comments on his use of vulgar language.  The comment he quoted was &quot;A gentleman doesn't have to use foul language to get his point across&quot;.  <br />

Go Grandma!</div></div><hr />

 Agree. There are times when cussing is needed, like when under fire from the enemy.<br />
 But on another note. Conga Rats on your achievment. Now does any other important knowledge count? Like... History and English.<br />
 Good luck. Stay away from those wild Canadian women. lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, some may notice I didn't congratulate Kullaas, well here's the explanation whether you want it or not. I hate Kullaas, I'm not entirely sure yet as to why, but to me he's mostly a self-righteous, arrogant prick. I may be an evil bastard, but I'm quite up front with it.</div></div><hr />

Grats to you, Kullaas... remember to learn more than just what the classes teach you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, fine, I'll stop spewing hatred, I've made it perfectly clear how I feel about someone now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with Kullaas on several things but I think hating him is worth the effort.  Hate... true hate takes effort and strong reason/emotion... Frankly Vader I doubt you know him well enough nor are willing to expend the proper amount of effort to &quot;hate&quot; Kullaas.<br />
<br />
You may dislike him and dislike him strongly but to me Hate means you actually will go out of your way to spite him.<br />
<br />
Personally I kind of like Kullaas.  Sure he and I can get into it pretty fierce but its his tenacity I admire... I always like a determined a opponent and quite often off the &quot;field of battle&quot; they turn out to be pretty good friends.<br />
<br />
At any rate I will repeat myself and say congrats Kullaas and more over good luck with Canadian women :D</div></div><hr />

I've held grudges for years, even when it couldn't be considered wise. It's not effort, I relish and embrace the hatred.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm gonna stop bothering him like when I called him the son of the devil (aka Bill Gates hehe). I prefer quiet fury so I won't be talking about it anymore.</div></div><hr />

Dude do you relize how cool it is that you'll be near the Canadian border.  Legal drinking age in Quebec is 18!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
While the rest of your buddies can't get in to a strip joint or night club you can be getting legally trashed on better beer and it'll cost you half as much cause canadian money is almost free.<br />
<br />
And I thought you were smart :)</div></div><hr />

Pull over man! You're hating too fast! Whatevers. I'll go read the rules again, cause I'm pretty sure I play by them.<br />
<br />
Kullaas, you don't need to tell everyone you're intelligent everyday. You should add a line in your sig that says...<br />
<br />
&quot;BTW, I'm smart, probably smarter than you&quot;<br />
<br />
that way you don't have to subtly slip it in all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are mean, a jerk, and an *******, and honestly I don't understand why you are still even permitted to post here.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Congrats Kullas. Don't listen to Vader, he is insecure of his own intelligence. I for one will always promote youngsters to expand thier horizons and learn as much as possible. Keep it up!</div></div><hr />

You only have your opinion of me based on my comments against Kullaas, while I base my opinions on Kullaas on what I've seen, and I've seen a lot. All you've seen of me is my bad side, which is unfortunately, very bad.<br />
<br />
Besides, I wouldn't hold it against you if you said things like I said if I were bragging.<br />
<br />
I don't generally hide what I feel, and I'm sorry if that pisses you off.</div></div><hr />
