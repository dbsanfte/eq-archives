Every raid I have to go thru this. I wish they would add the commands to the list so ppl can read!<br />

<br />
To join a raid, you have to have PoP, period.<br />
To join a raid, the raid leader must invite you, and you must accept the invite in the Raid window (alt R). This will make you a raid group leader.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
To join a raid, a raid group leader must invite you to his group and you must accept the invite in the group window. You will then join the group and automatically join the raid.<br />
<br />
To speak in raid, type /rs and your text<br />
<br />
To leave a group, but stay in the raid, disband in the group window.<br />
<br />
To leave the raid entirely, you MUST disband in the raid window.</div></div><hr />

I know, I know.  But it's the only decent writeup I've found. =)<br />

The one thing about the raid window system that irks me is that its logical course of use does not provide the raid leader with handy class and race info of ungrouped members for *initial* raid forming/group assignment, and it's the one phase of raiding that needs the list most!  We're still using channel lists or the dreaded /who, and this was supposed to fix that.  There's a workaround, but it's not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if you could invite everyone into the raid as an ungrouped raid member, as their names would appear in the Ungrouped field.  You could take a look at your available classes and levels, and THEN assign group leader status to a few and form your groups.<br />
<br />
Now someone's going to tell me there's a damned toggle for inviting people as group leaders or as regular members.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kind of expanding on what was said earlier, it would have been more useful to put in a /lfr (looking for raid), like /lfg.  Then the raid leader could open the raid window and it would show all people in that zone that were /lfr.  Of course it could show all the usefull info like class and such, and the list would need to be able to be sorted.<br />
<br />
Then the raid leader could highlight a name and assign group leaders and members.  ex. Mr. X is group 1 leader, Ms. Y is assigned to group 1, Mr. Z is assigned to group 3, etc.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could be completely off base.  I am not at a high enough level to go on raids, but it seems kinda logical based on what I know.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just invite ppl to the raid and then organize groups. Because of the way our guild works, I know in advance mostly who is coming...class and level, etc. With the new guildmanager window, this makes grouping even easier; I can see who is coming, and look up class and level and then issue invite orders:<br />
<br />
/rs Plaague, when Vortoc gets here, he's your healer, invite him!<br />
<br />
What I would LOVE to do is moderate the raidchat like I can moderate regular chat channels. For now, we still use regular chat channels for raid commands because some ppl don't have PoP and can't join a PoP raid. So, /rs is just for chatter, and chat channels are for commands (Like assist calls, incoming warning, etc...)<br />
<br />
Unless you're on a team PvP server, I don't see why race info matters.<br />
<br />
Just for clarification, if you invite someone using the invite button on the RAID window, they will be made a raid group leader. The only way to stop being a raid group leader is to disband from the raid and get invited into a raid group.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad tool, but it could have been better designed.</div></div><hr />
