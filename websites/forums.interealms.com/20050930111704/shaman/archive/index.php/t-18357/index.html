<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started looking for places to twink out alts.  I know I can clear Kael's arena with no prob, but was wondering if anone has tried yet to solo parts of ToV?  I know most of the encounters are quickly becoming trivial- HoT one group easy and much of WToV and NToV can be done with 10 well equipped peeps or less.  Haven't seen any recent posts so figured I would ask.<br />

I think you could probably solo entrance to HoT, but you would have to get lucky pulling (root/gate splitting maybe?).  Wouldn't be very efficient at all.  I think soloing cash drops and buying MQ's would be easier if you are looking to twink.<br />
<br />
Did Sleeper's Yesterday w/ only 2 groups for Final Arbiter and the easiest (slowable) Ancient.  Next time I'm bored I'll give HoT a whirl and let you know.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the quick replies.  Currently I am working on twinking a monk and a druid.  Druid almost has a full set of elysian gear and the monky is still twinked enough until at least late 30's early 40's.  Once I am through with UP I will prolly be moving on to the Grey for a few more items- then maybe Kael, so the HoT idea is something down the line.  Its more of a challenge really than a need for the gear ( I like to see what I can and cannot solo.)  I sometimes do farm for plat (Droga, Acrylia, Hate), but it gets dull quickly.  I am prolly going to wait a ways down the line before attempting HoT- would like to knock out a few more aa's and upgrade some more of my gear (would link my magelo, but the site is currently down.)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help, and if you find out anything let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kittybuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have soloed a Mob in HoT, Not worth it at all. Mobs have to many hps and hit to hard to be soloed effectivly.. Also the Ae can be trublesome hurts the pet..the Tactic i used to pull (use Bear form and Shrink to smallest) Now u can look through the wall and see into the pit, now you wait till pit is clear besides the 2 guardians,Q pet, Pull with MAlos, Now he is Inc, Casting Malosina, ur pet is begging to die, once u land slow the wurm is on you, and now it is just an endurance fight... i do not have the numbers on the ammount of hps. I was raid buffed and it seemed quite difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Resists on slow even at 65 after malos can be somewhat patchy, and unslowed AEing mobs are rather painful.<br />
<br />
Plus the issue of gating mobs... ouch. <br />
<br />
It all sounds rather painful to me. Utmost respect to anyone that can kill more than 6 mobs solo in HoT before repops though :) I'd imagine you want EP gear as a minimum, and the likes of time's antithesis would certainly be a bonus :)<br />

Keep us updated!</div></div><hr />
