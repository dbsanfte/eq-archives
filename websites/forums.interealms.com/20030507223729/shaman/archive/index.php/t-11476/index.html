<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 50, you would seriously be an exp leech in pop. Get chloroblast and then go. I know I wouldnt take a 50 shaman in any of my groups. Echo caverns is a nice ride to 52 or so, seafury cyclops, or perhaps some of the new legacy fo yakesha zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Com and the Hole entrance will take you to 53 fairly quick. From there I'd do katta solo until 54 then hit the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hated the early 50's. I would suggest soloing to 51 in the dreadlands, using the plaguebone theives camp. 52 and 53 are extremely tedious levels. I was fortunate of being able to get through these levels in PoP. Really, At 51 you get the only spell people really expect out of you for the rest of your time playing as a shaman - turgurs insects. Once you reach 51 you will probably be able to slip into PoP groups, but if not CoM is the second best place. again these levels really suck, just because you're a bit too young to really be wanted in PoP groups, but old enough to feel the sting of the 50's experience... change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been fortunate enough to have an RL friend start an SK.  We've been duoing now for about 15 levels.  While I realize that duoing isn't quite the same as grouping, you can see a lot more xp a lot faster with a good partner.  From 49 to 53 was a cakewalk for us, even though it has started to taper off now at 53.  Keep in mind that my SK partner is very very good at his character.  He's cautious and does his research on every zone and how to pull it before we go.  If you can make a partner out of an SK who knows his stuff, I highly recommend it.  Here are some of the zones we frequented when we did 49 - 53:<br />
<br />
49 - 50:  CoM -- Stables and the courtyard (get your pages!); Plaguebones in DL;  Trak's Teeth<br />
<br />
50 - 51:  CoM -- Temple and Gazeebos and Goos (oh my!); Plaguebones in DL; Bloodtribes in SD; Entrance to the Hole; Dulak -- Dirulia Boat (take the boats to the North if grouped)<br />
<br />
52:  Can still do Plagues, but the xp starts to bottom out; Dulak -- The Dirulia Boat; Bloodtribes in SD; Giants in BW; Dragons in Skyfire (kinda crappy but beats nothing in a pinch)<br />
<br />
The thing to note here is that if you follow this path you will be accomplishing more than just XP.  1.  You'll have your pages and your idol from CoM.  (Not to mention I got my Ghiosk drops while a raid was taking place there)  2.  You'll have your Stoicism spell if you do the do the drunken pirates while you're in Dulak.  3.  You might just get to mooch a Shaman Powder in Trak's.  4.  You'll be looting Acrylia in SD (Sells very well on Zeb).  5.  You can also get your Strange Ochre Clay in CoM when doing the temple.  6.  The pirates on the ships in Dulak drop nice loot like Blue Diamons, Diamonds, Sapphires, Star Rubies, and nice gear (from the captains).  <br />
<br />
If you absolutely must group, then I'd imagine that the harder ships in Dulak would be good for you and you would still get some decent loot.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this isn't the only way to go, but it worked out very well for us.  I hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just an Update if anyone still cares about this thread:<br />
<br />
We finally found some decent XP again at 53.  Still in Dulak, head for the Armory.  The armory is that big fort-ish looking building on the left when you come out of the Gunthak zone. It's right beside the hidden entrance to the tunnels.  <br />
<br />
Lotso mobs in here and it looks a bit daunting.  There is a &quot;safe&quot; spot at the north end wall that really is just a rock face.  You'll see what looks like a lamp post back in a nook.  We camped here for about 3 hours and never aggroed anything we didn't want to.  I think the reason no one wants to hunt here is the pathing, it's HORRID.  But, it can be managed.  First of all, don't worry yourself with the West wall.  These mobs tend to get really lost and will run up and down the wall trying to find a way to get to you.  This is really unnerving.  Instead, work clockwise (facing south from the pull spot) pull wanderer's first, then the ones in the middle that are in your way, and then just clear that East wall and work your way around.  The mobs don't path out to the middle even though it's a vast area. Instead they run down the walls to get you.  <br />
<br />
The xp here was great for a duo and these bad boys don't just drop gems, they drop jewelry which sells even better to vendors.  Be prepared to get used to the pathing the first time out, but it's definitely worth the hassle.  As a duo, we didn't quite clear the entire armory before the repop.  With a group, you should be able to clear all the pops and have little downtime before the spawns start again.</div></div><hr />

HHK - hunt the nobles.<br />
<br />
I went here late Friday night 3 yellow into 52 walked out Saturday evening ding 54 with enough padding that if I died I wouldn't unding and banked about 2k.  Nobles on 2nd floor have about a 4 minute respawn rate, the room I camped has 2 that spawn and aren't social, although once you are KOS (Highpass guards is faction I think) they will attack Dogdog if he's in range.  Isabella will wander into the room as well, she won't assist nobles if you are attacking them, she just sits and waits for hers.<br />
<br />
No KEI, have a horse and JBB, although JBB wasn't crucial.  Haste HOS Dogdog, give him 2 FS swords.  Made a hotkey:<br />
/pet attack<br />
/cast &lt;slow&gt;<br />
Dogdog can easily tank in this setup.  If 2nd noble spawns and attack dogdog, slow him to get agro to you then just root him and move.<br />
<br />
Plenty of guards on the way that are green and drop FS swords to give Dogdog or sell.<br />
