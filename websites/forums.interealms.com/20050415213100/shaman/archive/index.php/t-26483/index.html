<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to clarify a point that most people don't seem to mention about this line of spell. It's power is relative to the person that is using it. <br />
<br />
When this spell line is discussed, it is mostly using raw data and the maximum potential of the proc.  Sustained DPS of this spell is relative to the user.  SOE and other people are leaving this variable out of the equation. <br />
<br />
To maximize the DPS of this spell and use to use it to the full potential you have to target a DPS melee character and cast this spell on that person with in a sustainable pattern to maximize DPS duration.  So the question one needs to ask is how effective are people in a raiding situation targeting players and casting this spell?  I would like to ask this question of the community because it seems to be a question that might change the thought process about the recast time.  Are people effectively targeting melee and casting this spell the entire raid?   <br />
<br />
Everyone knows that shaman play multiple roles on a raid.  I could see the recast time being an issue if you just had multiple shaman targeting melee and casting this line constantly, BUT how often does that happen?  I ask the question because this really is the key in my mind about the effectiveness of this spell.  If you don't have shaman that are effectively contacting melee targets and casting this spell constantly you loose effectiveness on this spell. How many people are organized about targeting and how many are maximizing the potential of this spell? <br />
<br />
One way I have made this spell work for me in the past is by organizing a system of deployment.  I have rangers, rogues, and other pet classes send a specific shaman tells during a fight.  After that I have the shaman set up an /RT key to target the sender and continously spam them with panther. Does't matter if you miss someone as long as the tells are coming in and you can /RT.  That way you know the spell is landing on someone. Now unless every shaman on other servers has devised a system like this, they really aren't sustaining the talked about damage.  So I would really like to know in reality how many people are actually maximizing thier DPS in a raiding situation with this spell.  Do they keep on some melee most of the time, all the time, or just what they can target every so often? This is the question that should be looked at before we implement such a harsh recast time.<br />
<br />
The other question is how many shaman want to be this effective at raids.  There are some people that just want to go to a raid and buff and debuff occasionally, so unless you get every shaman out there working out some system to use this spell effectively your hard data is not accurate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True, but unfortunately with this spell line, it is what makes it effective or ineffective.  So, I think its a ligitimate arguement...just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are still working our way through possibilities.  <br />
<br />
On a typical raid for us we have four shamans.<br />
<br />
Three of us will have assignments for leopard:  one has dps classes, one has pets, one has plate classes.  (I'm the one doing plate classes; it's the most annoying, because plate classes -- especially SKs -- are typically not up to speed about how to get this thing to work.)<br />
<br />
We each make a list of who we are doing in our individual private chat buff windows.  This maintains a constant automated onscreen list that tells me immediately &quot;who's next.&quot;<br />
<br />
During the plow I /target PlateClass_04 and then tap my hotkey, maybe for two or three players from the list, every couple of mobs.  I don't try to do all 9 or 10 of them.  But they all know that I am thinking about them, because they get the buff every few minutes.  <br />
<br />
During a boss mob fight, the shamans agree on how to debuff the mob.  Someone may be assigned to help the healers.  Then we go to buffing.  It is not hard to keep 9 melees buffed, cure the group, and tap a spot heal for someone in the group who is low hp from an AE spell.  Keeping the buff cycle going fast does require getting underneath the mob, so that all the melees are in range.  I hate chasing melees around to buff them.  But they know I hate that, and they try hard to stay in range.</div></div><hr />
