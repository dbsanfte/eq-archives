<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HeroOfNoBounds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new to the shaman, play an enchanter who is level 30 but was getting bored so I started my shammy and am level 8.  Didnt twink him with anything besides a crystal screaming star (something like that.)<br />
<br />
Now my three questions are as follow:<br />
<br />
1.  I am confused about DoT stacking as I only had one kind with chanter, but at 5 I didnt get the spell sicken because I didnt know I had a DoT till level 9.  Should I go pick up sicken and if I do will it be worth it (I.E. does it stack with tainted breathe?)<br />
<br />
2.  Is froglok a viable race for shammy?  All I mainly see at higher levels are Barbs with a lesser mixing of Trolls, very few ogres and frogs and almost no Iksars.  Should I transfer equipment and start over or am I fine?<br />
<br />
3.  Should I be looking to group at my level or just soloing?  With those options was wondering if you could throw me some hunting areas (the 1-10 board is kinda slow and not to detailed about it.)<br />
<br />
Well thanks for help and see ya in game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iksars in general seem sparse.  That exp penalty is harsh.  You'll mostly see Barbarian Shaman followed by Frogs.  The rest have major penalties (Barbarians actually have a 5% penalty as well).<br />
<br />
Get Sicken.  You have 2 lines of DoTs.  Poison and Disease.  The great thing is that if you have the time and mana, you can stack every single one of them on a mob.<br />
<br />
Froglok is a very viable race.<br />
<br />
Shaman are great when it comes to solo or grouping.  You can do either.  Whatever you want.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Froggy Shaman should be Fine.<br />
<br />
Barbs Are most popular for the look and the fact they have a much less Exp Penelty.<br />
<br />
I think Froggs look incredible though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1.  All shaman dot's stack with each other.  As mentioned we have two lines, disease based and poison based.  Generally the diseased based will have a skull graphic and the poison based will be the knife and bloody finger.  Perhaps those are the old pics but I don't think so.  It is worth picking up Sicken at you level, it's a great spell to pull with.<br />
<br />
2.  Any of the shaman races are viable, they all have their ups and downs.  Pick the one you like best and you've made the right choice.  Barbs are popular because they were the only good race shaman until cats and frogs came out.  It's all personal preference on looks really.<br />
<br />
3.  Well seeing as you're a frog you'll be in the swamp area.  I don't know how it is with the froggie revamp in Innothule though.  I can tell you that if the mobs are getting to easy you can head to south ro.  With planes of power you have the benefit of easy travel all over the world.  You can head to crushbone, blackburrow, shar vahl, paludal caverns.  Probably just about anywhere you went with your enchanter.  Grouping is entirely up to how you feel that night.  Although it will be easier in groups once you hit lvl 9 with sow and light healing.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HeroOfNoBounds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool, thank ya all for the help.  Currently I am at CB and need to figure out how to get those DoTs, I didnt see them on any merchants in Gukta.<br />
Thanks again, good to finally find a stable and huge community.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2.  Frogs have two downsides, neither of them that major.  They're the new kid on the block, and seen as a resort for Shaman l33t d00dz, but that's not you (at least yet).  Also, as you cast spells, you do a little flip.  You don't see this, but others around you might get tired of it, after awhile.<br />
<br />
3. No.  Just not enough peeps around these days at the level you're looking for.  I'd wait until 9 or 10 and then start looking for them, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Search on these boards is your friend.  I've gotta say, these here on Crucible are the most lenient board junkies I know.  If you had asked those questions on any of the other boards I frequent *cough* SKO *cough* you'd be skewered and left to cook over a red hot flame . <br />
<br />
1. Dots stack.  Get them all.  They are like Pokemon only they don't destroy the intellect of millions of our youth every day.<br />
<br />
2.  Troll &gt; All.  Other than that, they're all viable.  Pick one that looks cool and go with it.  The XP penalty puts hair on your chest.<br />
<br />
3.  Sadly, the newb population on Zeb is such that you pretty much have to go to EC to get a group.  I saw a surprising number in Kurn's tower though.  Might be worth a try.  Get yourself some Iksar Skulls with an 'X' while you're at it.  <br />
<br />
Try soloing.  Then try duoing.  Then try grouping.  Which did you like the best?  That's the one to do.  When you get bored with that, you go do something else.  Rinse and repeat for 57 more levels.  Actually, at level 8, FJ is on target.  I stayed in the swamp through about level 10.  But, if you are dying to group and flex your l337 shammy sk33lz, you could probably get one at Orc1.</div></div><hr />

1.) All Shaman DoTS stack on each other. No matter if they are all poison all Disease it doesn't matter so get them all. <br />
<br />
2.) Race is really irrelevant, in the end it just doesn't matter. Froggies are viable and they do a cool backflip when casting. (Truth is Iksar are the best, but since you had to ask you're not worthy of being one.) JK<br />
You see alot of high level barbs because when most older players started Barbarian was a wise choice because of faction purposes. Them not being KOS, with PoP and the Nexus that's a moot point now.<br />
Experience penalty is the one thing I hate about Leezards and Trolls its way harsh at upper levels.<br />
<br />
3.) What I did was when I got a new level I would solo until I raised my weapon, casting, and defense skills. I would then group or duoing as grouping and duoing may leave some of your skills behind and they are a beast to raise at higher levels. Max them first then group. If you can travel to Kunark you can level up to 18 in Kurn's Tower. I stayed in the Field of Bone pit until 10 then went to Kurn's until 18. Crazy exp there and I made a killing selling bone chips. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>HeroOfNoBounds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">haha I did use the search, those are just the 3 topics that I couldnt find or figure out but thanks for tip.  Oh and are we needed in raids at the high end of the game?  One thing I liked about the enc was the level of request I had for him on my guilds (before it died) mini-raids and Im hoping shammy is somewhat the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman is an essential raid ingredient and at upper levels the class really shines even with most PoP mobs mitigating slow.</div></div><hr />

Oops.  Sure enough.  How could I forget them?  :)</div></div><hr />

/sniffle .. forgetting us ..<br />
<br />
Edit:  Doh sig is too big, will fix it later, late to work LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play a Iksar shaman that is now level 62, but now that they have...<br />
<br />
a) 50+ Levels<br />
b) AA ability for regeneration<br />
c) Major regeneration spells<br />
<br />
I would never pick that race... The experience penalty really hurts.<br />
<br />
Once you only had the ability to do a cudgel quest, now all races can do it.<br />
<br />
So stay clear of Iksars and Barbs for that matter.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">With regard to finding the spells, the DoT line of spells are only available from a limited number of vendors. The one I always used as a Barbarian is in Everfrost Peaks in the ruined temple, close by to Megan's Tower. I've no idea where the evil equivalent is, or if there are others around. <br />
<br />
Later on, summon companion is only available from the EC tunnel, and I got my pet spells from the Barbarian fishing village in West Karana, by the river. I think its west anyway. Not sure if they might be in the library now or not :) There's also the spell vendor in FV, who will trade a few of the higher level spells with you for a random different one (of four) in return.<br />
<br />
Are frogloks a good race? If not, I'm sure a search for &quot;Evil spell vendor&quot; or something similar would throw up the evil equivalents.</div></div><hr />
