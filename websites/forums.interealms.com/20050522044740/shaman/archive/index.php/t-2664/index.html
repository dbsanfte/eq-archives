<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I need some help figuring this stuff out, I'm hearing conflicting reports about these three things.<br />
<br />
I have an earring with Enhancement Haste III and I love it.  18 second group focus!  Faster casting invis!  It only works on buffs and does not work on torpor, which is a serious drag.<br />
<br />
I've heard that Spell Haste III does work on Torpor, is that true?  Do focus item effects stack?  Spell haste III + Enhancement Haste III would make group focus cast even faster?  I also heard that the focus item with the greatest benefit would take precedence, confirmation?  <br />
<br />
I also heard that the fastest reduced cast time for any spell (casting time reduced via focus item or AA point) is 3.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
Okay, now on to the AA skills!  AA quickbuff DOES work on torpor...would it stack with Enhancement Haste III?  Would it stack with Spell Haste III?<br />
<br />
Basically, I've been looking forward to the Quickbuff AA skill since I first heard about it, long before focus items.  A 3.0 second torpor cast time would be incredible!<br />
<br />
My enhancement haste earring has kind of taken the luster off of the quickbuff AA skill, since I'm already getting a really nice casting time deduction on buffs using the earring.  If quickbuff AA doesn't stack with enhancement haste III, that would be way too many points for me to invest in order to receive benefits for just one spell (Torpor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno how AA works in (I don't think it stacks, but I could be wrong).  However, for focus items the best effect is used.  So if you have enhancement haste (15% or 20% haste on enhancements only I think) and spell haste (10% on all spells, or something like that), you will use the enhancement haste when casting buffs, and the spell haste when casting other spells (i.e. Torpor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At one point, quick buff was conflicting with Focus Effects.. I'm not sure how and if they have patched that.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste 3 affects EVERY Spell....  I had Spell Haste 3 on an Item or two when the effects were first patched in, but within a day, they redid the Focus Effects and Spell Haste was gone, trust me.. it was Godly.   That's why they removed it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my head hurts.<br />
<br />
I have afflicition haste 3 and for the day it worked on malo and turgurs... wow was fun.<br />
<br />
I drool over spell haste 3 and I pester mages for Naki's rings.<br />
<br />
regarding quickbuff oh Miss Skyshrine Hottie...<br />
are you saying you were getting it for something *other* than Torpor before?  That's the only reason I am working on it.  Shorter gFocus would be fine and dandy, but not worth all those points to me.  3 second CT on Torpor IS worth all those points to me.  :)<br />
<br />
I also have an ODS with mana preservation 3.  It had been rotting on a twink but now I am wearing it full time again... it's really quite noticeable.  I kinda like focus items.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesnt stack with AA skills.<br />
<br />
Tried the mage naki ring, even though it said 2.1 sec, I timed it and it still was 3 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
Tried with Quickbuff 3 and Spell casting haste 3. Time shown as 3 seconds I believe.<br />
<br />
So yes, the focus items kinda negates the usefulness of QUickbuff 3 :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fatsow, that doesn't necessarily mean they don't stack, but that they don't stack together to provide a casting speed reduction under 3.0 seconds (which seems to be the minumum).<br />
<br />
So, for something like group focus with its 26 second cast time, would enhancement haste III and quickbuff III stack to create a casting time quicker than 18 seconds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Enhancement Haste III + QB1 = 15.1 second Khura's Focus.  I have not timed this with a stopwatch, but that's how it reads.  Naki's Studded Ring does not stack to help this further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks, Megumi, that was what I was looking for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Should have been 15.6 seconds.  Bad memory.  In any case, the stacking is as I stated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It looks like two focus items won't stack (the focus item with the greatest benefit takes precedence) but a single focus item will stack with quickbuff AA to a minimum casting time of 3.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this also works with the extended duration focus item and AA skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">During the 1 day that my Onyx Gauntlets had Spell Haste 3 they did indeed work on Torpor. Eventually I'm getting an Essence Lens for spell haste 3 (have scale and key already).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Enhancement hastes are ment only to effect buffs that have actual duration of some sort as per min effect 72secs (sure can always dream of getting torpor upgrades left and right till it's insta cast ;) )<br />
<br />
As they were explained when they came out, I guess no significant changes to these:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Enhancement Haste and Spell Haste Does not affect Spells with less than a 3 second cast time.<br />
for focus stacking, similar focus effect won't stack, only the best % will taken;<br />
<br />
like Fungi tunic will stack with regen spell;focus effect will stack with AA skill like Quickbuff too, but remember Quickbuff is passive skill so it will alway calculate first before Focus item(trigger effect);<br />
<br />
so this is 2 possible cast time after Quickbuff :<br />
<br />
1, cast time &lt;= 3 sec ; both Enhancement Haste and Spell Haste require 3 sec+ cast time min, so focus not work, this doesn't mean it dont' stack<br />
<br />
2, cast time still &gt;3 sec ; focus haste will reduce cast time by 30%/10% which possible make final cast time below 3 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2 focus items that cause the same effect do not stack, as has been mentioned. Any general focus effect will be superceded by a specialized focus effect. I.E. affliction efficiency focus items will be used while the general mana preservation focus effect won't be.<br />
<br />
Spells that have a cast time of 3.0 or less are unaffected by spell haste. Hybrids have an innate spell haste of about 7% at level 60. This doesn't affect any of our spells with casting time of 3.0 or lower.<br />
<br />
There is also a maximum spell haste of 50%. An example is the mage quick summon AA stacked with a summoning haste foci. Quick summon AA by itself raises puts casting haste on summon spells at 50%. Focus effects cannot increase this haste percentage.<br />
<br />
This about equal to melee haste. Melee haste is capped 105% at level 60. This is measured in speed increase, not delay decrease. If you are going to measure delay decrease, it would be 51% delay decrease haste. That's only 1% faster than spell haste is capped at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is also a maximum spell haste of 50%. An example is the mage quick summon AA stacked with a summoning haste foci. Quick summon AA by itself raises puts casting haste on summon spells at 50%. Focus effects cannot increase this haste percentage.<br />
<br />
Okay, so using group focus as the example:<br />
<br />
Since group focus has a cast time of 26 seconds, no combination of Quickbuff AA or enhancement haste focus item could lower the casting time below 13 seconds?<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to figure out if I still want to blow 18 points into Quickbuff AA..I want a three second torpor, but 18 points is A LOT! It would be a lot more palatable if there were other benefits of sticking points into Quickbuff AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maxed quickbuff will give you 50% buff spell haste, which caps you. If you have a buff speed haste focus item, it really isn't worth it to go beyond level 1 of quick buff until/unless you loot a new shiny that just HAS to replace your focus item, regardless of losing the effect. <br />
<br />
Level 2 in QB and a enhancement haste focus will cap you. Level 2 in QB and a generic spell haste item will take you pretty close to the cap (40%). Level 1 in QB and a enhancement haste focus will take you 40% as well. The QB2 and generic spell haste foci is the most versatile, obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have the enhancement haste III earring and the potential to get a spell haste III item (like Jing I have the ST scale and key to get an essence lens).<br />
<br />
I'm actually pretty happy with what you wrote, Graal, I was kinda dreading 18 points into Quickbuff AA.   The fact that I'll be pretty much capped with a fast cast torpor at 9 points is a big advantage (at least to me, since I'm not great at racking up AA points).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Same plan for me Gloriana, I dreaded dumping 18 points into quickbuff to get that 50%. Now putting the first 3 points into it and getting my Essence Lens will have a huge bonus and I won't need to dump 18 points.<br />
<br />
I'm still working on maxing healing gift. I'm at healing gift 2 with 3 points to spend right now. Then I'll do 2 points into quick buff and get an essence lens I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gloriana: Well it stacks, but as I have 18 aa points in spell haste, it wont help me. /rude verant<br />
