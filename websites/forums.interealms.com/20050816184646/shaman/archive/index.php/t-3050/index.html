<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many aa-points have you raked up? ( just curious to how my measly 12 are compared to others )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Got myself to Baron whilst in 54.  Have since put xp back on normal 100% until I hit 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I'm going for baron in 55, not sure what I'll do after that :)  Probably level a bit until I get bored of it then go back to AA ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
??? There is nothing more boring than getting exp for AA. The 12 points minimum you need in the middle group - god thats boring! Atleast when you could critical blast with the jbb there was something almost fun to look forward too but working your way through MC 1 - 3 and not noticing any difference at all sucks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silsisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have 2 points..i got tired of taking forever to ding &quot;i dont play that much&quot; so sometimes i would rather work on AA and get to use it on a skill..then to have to grind through 57..but now that i have been having more time..i piut it all back into regular exp.<br />
    I kinda wish i had runspeed now though because in the dungeons i like to play in..everyone that i group witth has them and i do not which means when they run from a train..i am usually the one that gets beat on.<br />
    I put my 2 points into regen since Iksar used to get the 2 points instead of one..if i would have known it would have only been one point i think i would have put them into runspeed then gone back for the regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since I have Torpor and Malo in the bank (and my playtime is limited), I felt I would be much more powerful getting to 60 then working on AA... so zero AA here :(.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've stopped leveling 1 kill short of 53. I've switched to 100% AA exp so that I can still do Vox and Naggy raids. I've got 4 points so far (Run 3 and 1 Regen) once I hit 6 then I'll switch back to Leveling and head for 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Zero baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">52 and venerable ... won't get elder tag until 57 pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">45 I think.  It's funny I have this many though, because in the past, I usually just logged in to get to raids or to get raids going, in my old guild.  XP'ing is boring, but I've had time as of late.   I do kinda suck though, I put 3 points in Alchemy Mastery, so I could get Elder (waaaaay too many Venerables on my server, think only 3 elders).   But, I'm halfway to QB2.   QB ain't too bad, it lowers invis cast, so I cast it in 3.8 instead of 5 seconds (with spell haste too), it'll be even lower soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">3.5 points ATM.  Concentrating on my monk and just having fun with my friends.  Should be a baron...... sometime.  Grinding xp solo in a place like fungus grove is not fun to me, so I don't do it!  I try and come up with duo-box challenges for my Monk/Shaman combo.  Doing the Warlord room in KC with a 50 monk/60 shaman combo was interesting :)  Got my KC pipe out of the deal too (for the monk epic).<br />

/shrug  Everyone likes to play the game a little different way I guess :)</div></div><hr />

don't even have rabid bear yet  :-)<br />
<br />
don't even think to get that skill,until they increase the lenght of the buff to at least 20+ minutes or having maybe one hour or less refresh time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">101++ is quite impressive, courious as to if anyone is holding points with the anticipation that new skills will be added, or are you just putting them in anything you want</div></div><hr />

After I got Canni5 I just haven't been really excited to grind out more points.  Maybe I will get motivated again, or maybe I will remain Venerable and lazy forever.  :p</div></div><hr />
