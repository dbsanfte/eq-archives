<br />
Mana Stones dropped a lot more than Mammoth Cloaks is why.<br />
<br />
I remember going to the camp and getting 4 stones in around 2 hours, and several bags also.<br />
<br />
The Manastone was much better to have than a Mammoth cloak so whoever called you a sucker was clueless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Checked the prices in the bazaar and found Canni IV for 500 plat and SotH for 2000 plat.<br />
<br />
Paid about 20 plat for each, placed the first two in my bank and sold the druid spell for 500 plat.<br />

Not bad for a few minutes shopping.<br />

<br />
Recently tho I was in bazaar to check out the merchant that was selling the mage spells up on the balcony, someone shouted first person to hail me gets a windblade. I didnt take much notice of this but he was sitting right next to the merchant so I Hailed him and to my suprise the trader window opened up with a windblade.<br />
<br />
These wasnt trades really but fun non the less :)</div></div><hr />

I bought a purple headband (monk epic piece) for 10pp from someone in EC tunnel.  I think he was a recent Ebay or something...  He offered it up for sale with a list of things, I sent a tell, he said, &quot;make offer&quot;, so I did. :D  I was in shock when he said deal. :cool: <br />
<br />
I've managed to trade duplicate shaman spectral and rune spells for something I needed in the more recent past.  I did get a few good deals, but just getting rid of stuff I didn't need for stuff I wanted always leaves me feeling good. :)</div></div><hr />

tell me about it! sheesh been searching for a decent price on those words for weeks now.<br />
<br />
my best trade was helping someone who was twinking an alt and put too much plat and gear on him- needless to say when he zoned out of the bazaar he was stuck and I was the only person around to help him :)<br />
he rewarded me with about 1k worth of gear or so when in was level 20ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Malo in the bazaar for 1 k. Nothing else ever came close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Back when I was in my Mid 20's, I was sitting in EC looking for anything I might be able to afford (I was pretty broke), when someone from one of the uber guilds on my server asked me for a sow and sta buff.  I gave it to them and the trade window pops up with 18kpp and change in it.  Still not entirely sure why he did that, although since I never saw him around after that, I think maybe he was quitting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, found someone that'd take the 18k and 5-10-dose sow potions for a Fungi (this was pre-nerf), so got myself a fungi, which I wore for a long time and then sold for 80k and bought malo and torpor.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>leillanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I guess my best has been 3 copies of Agony, 3 days running from LDoN merchants. Then yesterday buying Ornate Bracer Mold for 35k, selling it to another trader for 20k + Ornate Gaunt Mold and swapping Ornate Gaunt Mold for Ornate Silk Sleeve Pattern which sold for 35k in 5 minutes. So in about 15 minutes of trading I made 20k.<br />

While its not quite as impressive as some of these, I got Circled Toe Bones off some guy for 30 plat.  I was pretty happy, since all the rest of his junk was hilariously overpriced.</div></div><hr />

Bought an AoN a week ago for 48k and sold it this week for 80k.<br />
<br />
Bought a charged locket of escape for 15k, still have it.<br />
<br />
Worst.... This is back before the fungi tunic nerf. Bought Fungi tunic for 35k (life savings) and then traded it and 10k for a Stave of Shielding  (pre chardok revamp, they were going for like 50k). Fungi gets nerfed, end up buying another one for ~50k and then they revamp chardok and SoS ends up costing ~5k each.<br />
<br />
But I've done lots of bazaar trading to make up for all of the screwups I've made.</div></div><hr />
