<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For all you Sullon Zekkers and those that might be interested in what its done for us... <br />
<br />
1.  You can level in peace without pvp'ing or getting ganked, which means alot more fun.<br />
2.  You can conduct raids without fear of having one bard, monk, cleric or pally ruin a 50+ person raid.<br />
3. increases team unity because you of pickup groups between your team.<br />
4.  Gives the good team and newt team chances to catch up to Hate in gear/levels.<br />
<br />
Even though on bluebie servers (no disrespect intended) you guys might think this expansion is just okay... this is a godsend to sullon zek.  it brings back pvp to zones like bbm, everfrost, e. common where there are no books or far away books and allows goods/newts to catch up in level and gear =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sorry but why the hell are you on a PvP server if a godsent is PvE without any chance of PvP?<br />
<br />
To summarize the above post:<br />
<br />
&quot;LDoN is great because I dont have to PvP on my PvP only server.<br />
<br />
You guys who don't PvP are lameo bluebies but I hate it when people try to like PvP me and stuff. Its great cause I can hide from them in dungeons.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Penny, you're showing your ignorance by a lot more than you'll or most people on this board will ever know.  <br />
<br />
p.s.   The good team on SZ is outnumbered by around 15 to 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think that makes Penny's point all that much stronger.<br />
<br />
If you hate the rules on your server, move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, thanks for that mighty fine bit of wisdom there Bigmeeno.   I'm so glad that you have given me the insight of myself hating my server.  (sarcasm btw)<br />
<br />
I happen to love SZ, and the team I am on.   This isn't the first server I've played on.   What you guys are ignorant of is the fact that the other 2 teams on SZ have had zones to level in without interruptions for quite awhile.   Evil being the only team EP flagged for example.   <br />
<br />
LDoN kinda balances things out a little, but not much.   I've probably spent more time PKing on SZ than 99% of the people on the server, so it's not like I dream of pvp free zones, it's just a welcome addition of options for our server/team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignorance aside (and I'm certainly one of the ignorant when it comes to pvp) you have to admit it's ironic that a &quot;godsend&quot; to a pvp server is non-pvp content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause PvP is fun, being griefed is not :)   It doesnt take much to wipe a raid out single handedly.(sp?)<br />
<br />
So its not that they don't like thier ruleset, just a little extra breathing room hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At the time I was leveling up a goody beastlord before I gave up stats were like this:Evil 70%, Newt 23%, Good 7%. If you read the post carefully he says there's still pvp going on in the zones where you assemble for an adventure. Assuming you survive that part then you can level up in peace. I don't see a problem with that especially when you consider Evil owns so many zones that they can level in peace already.<br />
<br />
It was pure hell trying to level up a good on SZ. Evil had it way too easy, they could level up in so many zones without worry of being pk'd. It sounds like LDoN brings some balance back to help the goods level up so I'm happy for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the point is that PvP was horribly unbalanced on SZ and that LDoN helps to balance things out.  If you play on a server where only one team can access all the good xp areas or farm areas without fear of being killed, then you level faster and get better gear to lock the opposing team(s) out of more areas, thus increasing the gap.  LDoN gives all players a chance to get to a more relatively even level in gear/AA thus making the PvP playing field more level/balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PvP servers aren't FPS where its non-stop fighting.  They're the same EverQuest you play, just you can gank each other.  You still need levels, AA's, gear, etc just to compete with others PvP.  Personally, I don't care much for the &quot;team&quot; concept, which is why, ironically, I play on Tallon lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Probably the most important thing which NinthSZ brought up in his post is the fact that all LDoN access points are:<br />
<br />
-located in old world zones which are good for pvp (low lag, low level mobs = no trains)<br />
-void of PoK books that usually allow for easy escape from pvp<br />
-meeting points for all teams, regardless of their PvE prowess<br />
<br />
This means more pvp. Clean non train pvp. More fun for everyone. Which is something the very low pop Zek servers (and especially Sullon) really needed. Gives those who thrive on pvp an injection.<br />
<br />
Because I think the whole LDoN concept blows I am not going to purchase it. However, even without it I'm having more fun now than a week ago. More action, whenever I want, with a mixed crowd. I can even use the Magi ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry but your all flaming and bashing this guy little little ignorant children.<br />

The problem with your vast misinterpretation, Penny, is that SZ is hardly a PvP ONLY server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">before you blue guys make snap judgements about red play, you should walk a mile in their shoes.  I have had no desire to play on a red server, since griefing and unequal class balance have been and still are the norm.  That's not fun to get griefed, and it's not even that much fun to be the person griefing.  It's just petty and stupid.  Real PvP is way fun tho.  And I think this enhances that.  After all, people might be able to level in peace while in an adventure, but they have to come out of their holes sometime!!!!   And then it's PvP time. <br />
<br />
EQ PvP has always seemed like an excercise in frustration and disappointment.  If I wanted that, I'd have never left Ultima Online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can't really add anything other than what other pvp'ers has said.. PennyAntics sorry you just don't understand because you don't play on a red server... but to the rest of you.. isn't it awesome =) that gfay zonline/bbm zoneline is littered with dead bodies hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I see your point man. What I think is funny, is how all the pk's have forgotten how to pvp in wide open zones where they have no non-pvp zones to use as a crutch. I have seen quiet a bit of the goood ole lame zone camping though. Placing these camps in these zones does bring a breath of fresh air to the red servers though imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, I have seen more pvp on RZ in the last week then I had seen in ~6 months.<br />
<br />
Some of the OOR of 65th gimps even dinged in range of 65th for a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't play on a PvP server (I tried it a long time ago, I didn't like being killed repeatedly for no real reason), but I do find this interesting. I can appreciate how some people enjoy PvP, but still want some breathing space to level or raid where what you're doing can't be spoiled by other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So on red servers are players grabbing an adventure, then PVP ganking near the adventure zone?  That would allow them to duck into the adventure zone without being followed if things went bad.<br />
<br />
Yet another red server sploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">While I really like LDoN as an expansion, I am afraid of what it will do to me regarding pvp.  I am quite certain that people will fill up augmentation slots with resists and pvp will become a nightmare against even lesser guilds.  Even the common +6 MR augment goes a long way when you fill up 10 slots with it.  And the way that I see it, since you can upgrade augmentations later, no reason not to fill up your augmentation slots with whatever drops now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That is kind of the point though... before only uber guilds could afford to have 250+ magic resist and it was almost impossible to take out that person with an MR like that unless you were using lures, spells with neg resist factors, lifeburn, manaburn, deathtouch or arrowburn.  Now every person, no matter the raiding skill of their guild, or even if they have a guild can become a better equipped player.  Its kind of hard going up against the only guild that farms the elemental planes when you are still doing 2 year old content i.e. kael arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The only problem with attempting to pk in the various Wayfarer camps is that, in fact, there is a quick way out for any one.  The Magus.  On TZ, players have started making hotkeys for the various zones<br />
<br />
/hail<br />
/say East Commonlands<br />
<br />
And thus...they can escape, heal, and return.  If you are not paying attention to their spam, you'll miss which zone they pop to, and it brings an entire new dimension to PvP.  Case and point, I was fighting a lower level twinked frog shaman...and it got to the point where he would only be able to zone in and cast Venom of Snake before I landed it upon him, and nuked before he gated.  Unfortunately, I was never able to find which zone he kept poping to, due to all the spam.  Thus, we have more PvP...but once again there is an easy out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">At least this gives the neutral team a chance to beat up on the evil team more, now they cannot train and must leave their blue zones to actually (gasp) fight.  Good team is nothing more then a majority of evils twinking alts.<br />
<br />
Lifeburn, Harmtouch and manaburn need to be made resistable with resists more then +250 in magic, disease and poison.  As it stands now, a necro comes in and LBs you or a SK gets you to 75 and HTs you, requiring 0 skill whatsoever, and then sits in a nonpvp zone for 2 hours for refresh.  <br />
<br />
Bards on the other hand, need to have certain songs made more resistable, such as dispell and mana drains, as well as bard rapture needs to increase in mana cost and have a recast of like 6 mintues, as well as bard DA being made about ever 45 mintues vs 3, which is quite overpowering if you have ever fought a bard.<br />
<br />
I am glad overall, it has brought back PvP to old school zones and made the game more enjoyable overall.  Too bad shaman do NOT get bane as a LURE dot, which at 512 a tick for 4 ticks, at -300 mr would ROCK, hell make it steal 512 mana a tick for 4 ticks at -300 mr :)  Make us more feared while keeping us out of the one hit wonder club.<br />

<br />
As for Good team being mostly evil team twinks, that isn't true.. what does happen though is that good teamers trade/sell their characters for evils.. but its impossible for them to be in Hate and Bp due to raiding duties in both... but yes.. some Bp go to Hate... but i've never heard of Hate going to Bp... i mean.. why go on Team Impossible when you are on Team EZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was actually going to post something similar to that.<br />
<br />
I haven't had much experience with PvP in EQ either to be honest, but one of the reasons I decided to play EQ over UO was that you at least had an option as to whether you wanted to play PvP or not.<br />
<br />
PvP can be a rewarding experience.  If you are fighting someone and it is one on one, down to tactics, it is fun.  When you are ganked by a group of people, or attacked when fighting something and already at a disadvantage, it is frustrating.<br />
<br />
I understand where the original poster is coming from.  In an unevenly matched world, the good team has been thrown a bone.  Shame on him for being happy about it, and posting here. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cause PvP is fun, being griefed is not :)   It doesnt take much to wipe a raid out single handedly.(sp?)<br />

So its not that they don't like thier ruleset, just a little extra breathing room hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's lots of stuff to respond to here but this post above basically summarizes what other people in defense of the Zek servers have been saying. &quot;PvP is fun, being griefed is not.&quot;<br />
<br />
????  :confused:  ????<br />
<br />
Okay lets take an example of PvP that is not grief.<br />
<br />
Bob says: Tee hee I bet my shaman can kill your warrior<br />
Joe says: Is that a challenge?<br />
*PvP ensues*<br />
Bob says: Hah I win your warrior is teh suck.<br />
Joe says: t.t you may have won the battle but you haven't won the war!<br />
<br />
Okay Above PvP can be done on any server by using the /duel command.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Example of PvP that is grief:<br />
<br />
Bob is happily soloing, root rotting.<br />
Joe is angry because his math teacher humiliated him in front of all the other 6th graders, so he dispells Bob's Root Rot process, roots bob, and then nukes him to death while the monster beats on him.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between the two above? Simple, consent. Beat around the bush all you like, but only added element to PvP on the PvP servers is the fact that you dont need consent from both people to kill someone else. All servers are open to everyone who enjoys PvP, the PvP servers just open it up and make griefing possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Penny, while I do understand where you are coming from, I would like to make a point about the red servers. Yes, we all enjoy the game and the content and sense of progress it gives. We can all go about our business and do trade skills, solo, group, raid what ever the case may be. But, the one option that we have on red servers, which is the biggest reason I play here, is because if we have an issue about anything that can come up, be it a guild that is doing the spawn you wanted to do, a player is bugging you about a spawn you are trying to camp, a different player is just being an outright chump to you, what ever. We play on these servers because it allows us the recourse to handle these situations right there, no gm involvement. No sulking about it later saying I wish I could have done such and such to this guy for being a moron to me. Granted, there are a good number of idiots on red servers straight out of Counter Strike, but there are also a good number of folks who play the game for the content it gives as well. Personally, I enjoy having the ability to handle my issues with players in my own way. I know there are quite a few red server folks who feel the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Your example penny is not that of a griefer.    Why would you still be focused on that rooted mob if that guy was anywhere near you?  If you didnt see him coming, mabey you should think twice about playing on a red server.<br />
<br />
I see your example as one on one pvp.  Bob has a choice to take it head to head or start running. <br />
<br />
I could make this a long post, but like said earlier, walk a mile in thier shoes, you'll see things abit differently.  Its that simple :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">First of all, PvP is almost never consentual. That defies the whole point of the exercise.<br />
<br />
Second. PvP is very seldom an even matchup, be it because of numbers, gear differences, timing or skill. Despite this, there are people who enjoy the pvp fights even when they are the ones receiving the beatdown. Normal people who just happen to thrive on the excitement of insecurity and the rush of the fight. I think you would be surprised how much you would enjoy it yourself if you gave it an honest shot. <br />
<br />
There are even those who charge into superior odds because they want to test themselves.  Crazy? Sadomasochistic? No, they just enjoy an additional aspect of the game and are able to distance themselves from it far enough to realize it is all just for fun. At worst they get xp killed in 10secs. They pay a cleric for a rez and lost 20mins time. More likely they'll have half an hour of pure bloodpumping action. I've had five hour battles that left me in a similar state of mind you had when you were five years old and went on a rollercoaster for the first time in your life.<br />
<br />
As for your Bob and Joe scenario, what prevents it from occuring on a non-Zek server? And what is the difference in how it is handled in both cases? I know that if I were Bob I would prefer it to happen on a Zek, cause even though I would be logging off with less xp than I thought I would, there would be a grin on my face. And I know that Joe knows he better watch his back now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually, for anyone who wants to see what group pvp is like, make a character on a Zek (preferably non Sullon to stay safe) and get going to one of the Wayfarer camps. There is almost always pvp there, and these zones are safe enough even for a lvl1 if you bum a sow. You can even use the Magi ports to get around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In agreement with above posters, being on a pvp server does not really automatically mean a person wants 100% pvp all the time. So by taking the view oh you are on a pvp server what do you expect, is pretty shortsighted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I took on a group of 6 evens yesterday, almost got 2 down before I went down, was fun.   Sucks to die, but knowing I died to PC's is &gt; dying to mob10001.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoever posted this., the same thing applies to blue servers, the difference is, when someone pulls griefing on you, you have no recourse and no way to handle it other then go &quot;oh well Im ****ed, but hey at least 10 hours from now some gm might, maybe put a warning on his account&quot;<br />
<br />
I on the otherhand, will come back and dogburn his sorry ass =p <br />
<br />
Frankly 9 out of ten methods of griefing ALL HAPPEN ON BLUE SERVERS TOO. They are not a &quot;Zek problem&quot;. And you all blue players KNOW IT. But you continue to post tripe as quoted above. You continue to deride pvp players, by making the completely false claim that pvp servers are for griefers, and normal servers are happy fun huggy time. I played on Xev and Thoxule, and Morell Thule and there was just as much, if not MORE grief play then there is on RZ.<br />
<br />
Coltrane summoned up my opinions 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Since i have alot of high level shamans here... i'd like to ask a question... considering our dots rarely land in pvp combat, i was thinking about nuking and getting the AA's for crit Nukes, would that be a viable way to pvp?  and also would that work on rains?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Often times our DD's and pet are all we have to do damage, the problem is, our dd cast times are so long(cold dds.. poison dds resist as much as poison dots in pvp imo).

<br />
I wouldnt really call it &quot;viable&quot; but.. sometimes its all we can do heh. The way our spells resist kind of ****s us on doing damage in pvp. Any gimp with 60pr/dr will resist most of our dots =/ Was hoping Bane would be a great new tool that maybe resisted like a druid dot(ie not at all heh) but le sigh.. it was not to be.. from all reports =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">my experiences are this:<br />
<br />
Tears of saryn almost always lands one out of 3 times for 460 to 500, on a crit its almost 600.<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment lands 80 percent of the time as well.<br />
<br />
Veilum strike is strong as well, landing 50 percent of the time.<br />
<br />
All of these are done after a malos, fear me after I get done tradeskilling to 1680 for the aid grimel quest and focus on getting to FoM3 :)  <br />
<br />
Blood of saryn at the moment is the only effective dot for me, peroid.  Everything else, resisted.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If you do not PvP do not bitch bout PvP cause it is not your problem, especially to people who do play on PvP.<br />
<br />
Its a simple concept, and it makes people so happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">So outside of the differences of opinion, looking down of noses, the intracacies of the mechanics behind PvP and the old world, and the benefit LDoN has brought to the Zek servers there is something to be pointed out:<br />
<br />
LDoN Nerfed PvP  <br />
<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
1. You can level in peace without pvp'ing or getting ganked, which means alot more fun<br />
2. You can conduct raids without fear of having one bard, monk, cleric or pally ruin a 50+ person raid<br />
3. increases team unity because you of pickup groups between your team<br />
4. Gives the good team and newt team chances to catch up to Hate in gear/levels<br />
<br />
Just who the hell told SoE to put the fun back in the game? I mean really?!?!? <br />
<br />
<br />
I plan to /feedback this daily until bards, monks, clerics or pally can ruin 50+ person raids again on PvP servers. Oh the humanity!<br />

The previous was an example of Dry Humor. (http://dict.die.net/dry/)  Had this been actual humor, most of those people that posted flames on this post after this would have gotten it off the bat.</div></div><hr />
