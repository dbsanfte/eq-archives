<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a follow up to the guild Summit, an idea was struck to invite all EverQuest healing classes to come together, discuss our healing and balance issues and hopefully be able to present a more unified list of issues, ideas and solutions to SOE dev's. <br />
<br />
While difficult to host on any of the four healing class class sites, The Druid's Grove has stepped forward and is now inviting all healers to join together and talk, civilly and constructively, in our new forum The Priest's Covenant (http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=54). <br />
<br />
The staff and community of the Druid's Grove would cordially like to invite any of you with thoughts and concerns on this matter to join us. <br />
<br />
If you are a moderator or administrator on this forum, please PM Stormhaven or any of the other Mods/Admins of TDG and we will give you a unique title to make you easily identifiable as a &quot;class representative&quot;. In addition, we will grant some of the users moderator rights to &quot;maintain the impartiality&quot;. Please supply a URL to your “home” forum and an example post so that we can verify your identity. <br />
<br />
Note: This particular forum will be heavily moderated, regardless of class (we WILL make no exception for anyone!), against flaming players and SOE alike, &quot;classism&quot; and other negative statements. We are here to be constructive, not destructive. <br />
<br />
Thank you and we look forward to seeing you there!<br />

One of the reasons our heals are so gimp is because the devs think that making our heals on par with druid heals would piss them off.  Wouldn't it just throw EVERYBODY for a loop if the majority of druids came out of this joint forum saying, &quot;No, I really don't care if a shaman can heal as well as I can.  I bring a lot to the group that a shaman can't do.&quot;  (just making up an example)<br />
<br />
It's a great idea, if people don't devolve into idiocy.  I'd like some of the myths to be dispelled - for example, I don't WANT to take anybody's place in a CH chain!!  For that matter, do you ever wonder how many CLERICS like CH chains?<br />
<br />
Great idea, and thanks for the invite!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It would be interesting if it led to less hostility rather than more, but I have my doubts.  It's just not buman nature to wish the other guy well, even if it subtracts nothing from your own station.<br />
<br />
And shamans are already firmly established in the healing pecking order(among others) as dead last, so I'd guess you'd mostly see shamans saying we need some improvement, and others saying either HELL NO outright, HELL NO because shamans have great things like buffs and slows, which to shamans are part of the problems by themselves and assuredly not a balancing factor to their miserable heals, or saying maybe shamans should get something trivial enough that it doesn't make any real difference at all.<br />
<br />
It's a very rare cleric or warrior that I don't see all in favor of the holy trinity in perpetuity, so I don't imagine many clerics will show the slightest concern toward other healers; rather, I expect their concern to be that nobody improves even a bit.<br />
<br />
Druids, being halfway between fantastic and miserable healers, might be able to communicate with both, so they're probably the best class to host discussions like this.  Clerics on their forums would likely just fight with everybody they perceive trying to pierce their lock on what they tend to view as their franchise, as they have already demonstrated previously on their boards, and shamans would simply be laughingly dismissed by other players in the same way they are by the developers, if anyone even bothered coming to their boards at all.</div></div><hr />

Basically, it might be ok for druids to heal a bit better, but no way should shamans heal better because it wouldn't be fair for us to be able to get groups both as a viable (but third best) healer and a viable (but 4th best haster/slower).  Bah.<br />

Oh, neither should paladins be a viable healer.  Basically, he wants only one class competing with the cleric stranglehold on healing.  Clearly he is more concerned with maintaining cleric status than the overall health of a game that desperately needs a second and third viable main healer.<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least he's not consigning us to &quot;no upgrades ever&quot; land.  It's ok if we take groups from enchanters, beastlords, and bards (better pulling, cc, dps), as long as clerics only have to deal with druids as possible alternative main healers.  I'd actually be fine playing a version of a shaman that did all those things better, but I'd still be pissed I couldn't find someone to main heal my GoD trials....</div></div><hr />

No clue about your view on things but I can asure you that this forum will be one happy place if shaman healing is upped to 70-80% of cleric healing in all heals as suggested in that thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The first post was fine; I'd be doing the happy dance if I could heal 80% as well as a cleric.  It is the cleric reply to it (second post) I was objecting to.<br />
<br />
But you guys are right, &quot;crap&quot; is too strong a term.  Editing myself to be less annoyed.  I suspect this was an overreaction to some other stuff I've seen the same guy post in other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well I do not see many problems with his view on things, YES he does take a different route to adjust our issues but by not focussing on our healing but to the suggestion he makes <br />

offers maybe even a better path then upgrading healing alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The point of that forum is to evaluate healing &quot;for all priest classes&quot;.

<br />
Suggesting a bunch of upgrades for us in other areas is great.  I'd like to have every one of them, especially better DPS.  But the fact remains that that would leave the game still with only 2 viable healers where it needs 3.  For overall game health, we need to be able to main heal in more content, even if some of us would prefer to be cc/puller/dps machines.<br />
<br />
But in fact, according to all the polls we've done here, most shamans want more healing over those other things anyhow.  And a very vocal cleric voice is dead set against us being a viable third best healer.<br />
<br />
If every one of our attempts to discuss healing issues end up being met by &quot;but you can get groups as a haster/slower, so you shouldn't be able to get groups also as a healer&quot;, then every thread a shaman wants to be productive on is going to degenerate into a pointless debate on that one issue.<br />
<br />
I'll quit my complaining now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Clerics are insanely booring, but at least they are insanely in demand.<br />
Burnout is a problem for them as they dont get sow or invis so you spend your life dependent on other people to get you places, then all you do is stand there and watch your watch to ensure you dont miss your turn in the cheal chain.<br />
<br />
Shamans on the otherhand get the opportunity to try and slow a mob, and once its slowed they have a few minutes to run around, try a couple of nukes, heal the overnukin wizzy and generally have fun.<br />
<br />
I find the shamans insane mana regen allows me to heal almost as well as my cleric did if I have time to heal, the long cast times of the heals screw me over all the time, and the small value of them, but i can chain cast them all night.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have is when a mob gets in a few rounds of burst dmg, I cant counter it.<br />
<br />
How about this........<br />

Life canni.....<br />
<br />
Give x hit points to your target instantly.<br />
<br />
Or a heal that stacks a massive defensive boost for a short period of time to allow me to catch up in the heal cycle.<br />
<br />
That would make my life less risky as a sham.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Kazim, evaluate does not equal improve.<br />
And I do agree that the way EQ handles healing is very wrong but maybe I am spoiled by the way healing in WoW works (where all healing classes have at least 1 other asset they bring to a party)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I can actually see how Druids would come to the aid of the Shaman in this question.  Most Clerics I see in game are idiots.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
I had one player 2-boxing a Warrior (MT) and Cleric.  This jerk had the nerve to tear into me in /g for not helping to heal after the puller (Monk) died for the second time.  Sad thing is I WAS HEALING.  My pathetic Shaman heal was just so weak he could not see it without looking at the spell messages.<br />
<br />
Second situation.  Had a Cleric who thought he was a Warrior jump my tail because I needed to add DPS with DoTs.  He could take care of healing.  End result is other slower died while idiot stick was playing at melee.<br />
<br />
Most of the LDoN adventures I have lost have been because of a clueless Cleric.  These idjits are militantly stupid.  Not all nor most but a good portion and these will be the asshats who raise such as fuss that such a summit will never yield any fruit.<br />
<br />
I can't count how many Druids I have grouped with who say &quot;I love grouping with a Shaman who knows how to cast Q and FA.&quot;  Druids have come a long way from the anti-social, Quadders of yesteryear.  They know that Druids and Shaman have different utilities and that a Shaman cannot keep healing, slowing and Canni-ing, but IF something goes wrong it would be nice for the Shaman to have a chance to heal.  <br />
<br />
I can see Druids helping us, but not Clerics.<br />
<br />
Pallies don't want the issue looked at too closely.  What if the Devs and the community actually figured out that they are better healers than a full fledged priest class?<br />
<br />
Beastlords are just keeping their claws crossed that they are not nerfed out of existance, so they are being quiet.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a druid and a cleric, I say NO! Yes, I want the cleric to be more rounded. I do not care if they get some of the druid abilities. I would not mind being able to solo with my cleric, from time to time. My play time during the day, when I do most of my leveling is solo, due to afk times. I would love to have that for my cleric. <br />
<br />
My druid wants only slightly better heals. She does not want to heal as well as a cleric. No one should. She does not want rez. No! No! No! I may be the minority, but I am happy with my druid. I do not want slow. I do not want haste. <br />
<br />
Give clerics snare, slow, and better solo style spells. Give clerics a little more utility. Improve druid healing to about 85 to 90% of what a cleric can do. Give them a group heal. Improve shaman healing to 85 to 90% of what a druid can do. <br />
<br />
Giving all priest classes all the others abilities will be my retirement from the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's this kind of post which makes me not want to get involved in so called cross class discussions, because moronic posts like this will occur which do nothing except incite people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A few friends of mine got togethor once a while ago over a few beers and came to a few conclusions.  While we are conscidered part of the priest class, in a way we arent..Now before you jump up and down and start screaming read on.  We dont rez.  We deal with shamanistic magic, like a medicine man.. Sure we heal and we buff and slow, but our magic is based on the spiritual world as well and the natural world much like the Druid.  IMHO the only true Priest classes are the Pally and the Cleric and the SK.  Pally's and Sks are the strong arm of theyre God and Clerics are the Voice of theyre god.  Priests denotate a God to worship.  Shaman are agnostic, we have no god so to speak of, so how can we be Priests?  I dont believe that Shaman were ever supposed to be healers in the way the Clerics are.  If anything we should have better DPS, and damage spells and buffs.  Our heals are fine for what we should be.. Now what we should be is severly lacking and needs to be fixed.  If I could this is what I would do..In general.<br />
<br />
1. Keep the clerics as is..They are the masters of the heal and the rez..bottom line.<br />
2. Maybe bump up the Pally heals a bit..After all they are strong arm of theyre god..Holy Knights..This also applies to the SK's..They too are the strong arm of theyre own gods..Weather we call them good or evil they serve the same purpose just in different ways..<br />
3. Increase the DPS of the Shaman ie Better cheaper nukes, DoTs, and more such..Mostly make the spells cheaper to cast. Do not change the heals.  <br />
4. Make our slows more effective and less mana expensive and harder to resist.  And fix out bloody invis...<br />
<br />
     Well thats about it, I know some of you are going to scream bloody murder but like I stated earlier this is my opinion only.  Shaman are the medicine men of EQ, Tribal in nature who bow to no god...<br />
<br />
Nuff Said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I keep coming back to the same question for all of those who feel shamans for whatever reason (in this case some sort of pseudo &quot;realism&quot;) should not be viable &quot;third best&quot; main healers:<br />
<br />
If not shamans, then who?<br />
<br />
Since the game clearly needs more main healers for overall game health.  Finding someone to main heal in GoD is a major PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've read the cleric boards to give myself a perspective of other healers ever since the &quot;shamans get better heals&quot; firestorm, and the general attitude among most clerics is rather simple:<br />
<br />
Give the other priest classes stronger heals SO LONG AS clerics gain some extra abilities to make them less one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
In this, I really see no problem.  Clerics are one-trick ponies...they heal and they rez.  That's about it.  They can't invis, they can't lev, they can't SoW, they can't do much of ANYTHING by themselves.  They are utterly dependent on items or on others for many things.  Clerics rule the roost in healing, and they jealously guard that domain because they believe, and rightly so, that if shamans or druids gained their healing power without giving them anything in return for relinquishing that crown, then clerics would suddenly become nothing but rez-bots, for they offer little else to a group.<br />
<br />
Does that sound familiar, my shaman brothers and sisters?  That is OUR gripe concerning our own role in the game.  We too are one trick ponies...we slow.  That's about it anymore, because the change of the game's style of play has reduced or eliminated the other things of value we used to bring to groups.  Clerics are very much in the same boat as we are, but in their case they haven't been made effectively obsolete in the new game content or playstyle yet, where we HAVE.<br />
<br />
Now, personally, I do NOT want to see shamans become &quot;main healers&quot; for groups...though we CAN main heal in tier3 PoP or before.  Shamans have traditionally been brought to groups for slowing, buffing, and to act as secondary healers...and I do not wish to see that role change.  All I personally wish to see for shamans is strengthening our heals to make us solid SECONDARY healers, with enough healing &quot;oomph&quot; to keep the tank up or keep someone that got aggro up while the cleric or druid is healing the tank.<br />
<br />
Druids, on the other hand, I would not object to having their healing strengthened to near-cleric ability.<br />
<br />
BUT:<br />
<br />
In return for this heal increase, clerics most definitely should be given new tools--REAL TOOLS-- to make them more rounded.  They need the ability to solo.  They need some utility spells to make them less dependent on other people.  They DESERVE some good old fashioned class adjusting to compensate them for the druids infringing on the cleric's fundamental, and ONLY role, in a group or raid...to heal.<br />
<br />
And SoE has a track record for giving clerics the short shrift, even when they promise to do things...such as the cleric proc hammers, for example.  So excuse clerics if they're VERY wary of any talk of &quot;balancing&quot; without seeing some REAL evidence that they're not going to get ganked again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Fine.  So who should be the third healer class then?  Paladins?  Rangers?  Because here's yet another &quot;shamans shouldn't main heal&quot; advocate who doesn't propose a viable alternative to fill that often too empty main healer slot.<br />
<br />

Turn that into a -attack, -avoidance, -5% off max hit and I will be MEGA happy with heals at 60%. <br />

I dont think its best to equalize us by upping our heals, I think its better to get our other abilities to approach the &quot;usable&quot; stage so we arent just standing there spitting in the hurricane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking for my druid self, I personally think it'd be awesome to see shaman's healing improved. Shaman healing has saved severals raids I've been on - y'all kick ass. =)<br />
<br />
So com'on over, kick yer boots off and let's talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think it's past the time where we use a possible improvement on our slows as one of the key things we want.  Our slows have lost their unique, class-defining power over a course of years.  Now many classes can slow, can slow very close to as much as we can, and slow is more commonly mitigated than not, and some mobs are being put into the game that are outright slow immune.  Now mobs die so quick that they often spend little time slowed at all even if they do slow for full.<br />
<br />
Slow is being effectively taken out of the game as a factor outside of raids, for which a shaman bot or two will suffice.<br />
<br />
If we ask for a bit better slow, it's just going to cloud up getting things we need.  What those things are is a matter for discussion, flames, whatever.  But that all should at least work toward getting something done, instead of draining our energies uselessly.<br />
<br />
Shamans getting better slows won't be done, and better slows don't matter at this point of the game anyway.  Other classes whose effective slowing has been brought to within a hair's breadth of our own, similarly, will NOT have their slows nerfed, so stop wasting time asking for it. <br />
<br />
To me, the class is on its last legs and we can't afford to waste time and divert our energies.  Asking for what's not going to happen, and for what will have little effect even if it does, will hurt us.<br />
<br />
That will play into the Brenlo/Rytan school of dealing with problems --seeming to be engaged while really just wasting time and blowing out the energy we DO need to keep strong to actually have even the smallest hope of getting anything done.  By now, it seems about the smallest it could get in the first place.<br />
<br />
So let's not waste energy on things that will never come to pass and that have already been purposely designed out of the game.  <br />
<br />
More DPS?  Better healing?  Whatever.  As long as it's something real, not pie in the sky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Fine.  So who should be the third healer class then?  Paladins?  Rangers?  Because here's yet another &quot;shamans shouldn't main heal&quot; advocate who doesn't propose a viable alternative to fill that often too empty main healer slot.<br />
<br />
I'm cool with shamans not being main healer as long as we can get a group doing something else.  But I'm NOT cool with sitting on my butt praying a cleric will log in so I can make progress in the current expansion.<br />
<br />
I'll start contemplating shamans not getting healing upgrades when someone selects another class for huge heal upgrades.  Because there certainly should be three main healing classes available to the game, even if one is not shamans<br />
<br />
There doesn't really need to be a third main healer class, IMHO.  We've got along just fine with clerics and druids before, we can get along fine with clerics and druids in the future.  Two classes will suffice, said clerics and druids, with shamans fully included as a primary healing class, just not a MAIN healing class.  Though this is one less class than the usual &quot;triumvirate of overlap,&quot; the sheer numbers of druids out there makes up for the loss of a class possessing an overlapping attribute.  Increase a druid's healing power so they can main heal in endgame content, and you just got a whole lot of new main healers.<br />
<br />
This makes shamans occupy a rather unique position, I admit.  A healing class that doesn't main heal.  A priest class that isn't in the same actual category as other priest classes.  But our lack of overlap as a main healer matters because main healing hasn't really been part of our job description for a very long time.  We do need to be able to function as healers, but my own personal desire is to have us hold our current title as a secondary healer...someone with a good strong blast heal that can jump in and patch a tank when the cleric or druid needs some backup.<br />
<br />
Should shamans be strong healers?  In my opinion, yes.  Very strong, but not so strong that they officially become main healers in endgame content.  We should be one step below &quot;main healer,&quot; strong backup healers in endgame content, which allows us to function as main healers in older content...much as it is now.  I can't main heal in GoD or LDoN hard (remember, I'm talking about ME, I'm fully aware that some shamans out there CAN), but I can easily main heal in LDoN normal or tier3 PoP.<br />
<br />
Do shamans need healing upgrades?  Oh most certainly YES.<br />
<br />
Does the game need a new class to be able to main heal close to the power of a cleric in endgame content?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Do I want to see shamans become main healers?  Personally (mind you, PERSONALLY, meaning MY OPINION ;) ), no.<br />
<br />
But, as per my original post, let us not forget that clerics need to be compensated for this introduction of druids as competent main healers, compensated with more versatility and functionality both in groups and in solo situations than they currently possess.  This needs to be done so they will still be seen as desirable additions to a group, and also gain the ability to do for themselves when they want to...just as druids and shamans can do.  When shamans and druids don't want to group, we can always go solo.  Clerics should also have this option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hey Chenier!<br />

I wish I could be more active on your new forum, I'm kind of swamped in boards right now. I think it's a great idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Clerics are one-trick ponies...they heal and they rez<br />
<br />
That's two tricks. Two *VERY* powerful tricks, I might add. Let's not forget similar cc ability to ours via root; pacify, nukes, etc... on a plate class with increasingly higher hp and ac than we can ever hope to attain. Give them invis (please! They always seem to be out of potions =P), increase the functionality of CH to counter higher tank hp's and faster mob dps, and a few fun things they can use situationally whether they be AA or spells. The class needs to see some vivification. <br />
<br />
As for druids, I really can't see where they have much room to squirm. They got what they wanted... group, raid, and solo ability all in one package; and on a level we haven't seen since velious. <br />
<br />
Our problems are not something they want to fix, nor are they something they can understand. Having a shaman bot does not qualify them to identify these things either (just a side note for those incoming &quot;I have a shaman I 2-box!&quot; posts). <br />
<br />
I think our dialogue with, or rather our fervent destruction of, Rytan has allowed him to look at what our spells do and why we take umbrage at more of the same. The changes on test are very positive, and even though I would like them to change a wee bit, I'd be happier to mem those spells as they are now than I was when I memmed Malo and Torpor. <br />
<br />
My basic feeling can be summed up as this: I want to be able to make a difference again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Giving slow to anyone isn't the answer to priest &quot;balance&quot;.   There are already a ton of slow options if you want it.    Finding a slower is typically not a problem.<br />
<br />
75% - Shm<br />
70% - Enc<br />
60 (or is it 65?)  - Bst<br />
55% - Bard<br />
<br />
There's more of a problem when you go for healing.    As the differences are much greater.<br />
<br />
Clerics bring the best pure HP buff (Yes, Paladins can attain technically better using more slots).     But no one really cares, because you can get Virt before your adventure.     So this really isn't a reason to bring a cleric along.     If you're doing something that takes a long time, sure.<br />
<br />
Clerics bring Res.   But we can make do with a Paladin... and even a Necro although that's more costly.    <br />
<br />
Clerics bring the best heals by far... that's why we want them.<br />
<br />
It really is unfair to up the priest healing... without truly compensating clerics... heal and res are the number 1 and 2 reasons to take one... with buffs being a smaller reason with today's durations. <br />
<br />
Suggestions like &quot;Give us shaman slow, druids snare and ports, etc....&quot; don't get the job done.   You have to look at what options are available.<br />
<br />
Take snare for example... there's a lot of choice in snare if you need it... off the top of my head... bards, druids, rangers, necros, sk's.<br />
<br />
I don't really think &quot;snare&quot; fits in clerics... nor slow.<br />
<br />
This alone isn't good enough, but one things that clerics have really wanted... (note: wanted, not NEEDED!!!).... is to be truely kick ass against undead.<br />
<br />
Let them nuke better than wizards against UNDEAD only.    Let their hand of the gods proc do double damage against undead.    Give them a couple more DOT lines against undead so they can stack on massive damage.     Let them even have snare and slow against undead.... maybe not all of that, maybe more... let the cleric shine against undead when they get the chance.<br />
<br />
But now what else? <br />
<br />
SoE had a really nice idea with the Vie line of spells... &quot;partial rune&quot; ... mitigate 10% of every hit, until x damage has been taken.   <br />
<br />
They could expand upon this line.   Tweak it so it can be used more often (in terms of cast time, mana cost, duration, etc...).     While Shamans slow and mitigate damage that way, clerics can help with the Vi line.    (I'm not suggesting at all that Vi be as good as Slow... just a little more useful, a little easier to cast than it is now... some tweaks).<br />
<br />
Clerics often call for better melee skills... I'm not really down with that... honestly with the proccing hammer they have, they do better than most priests period.    <br />
<br />
I'd love to see them get some better defensive skills though.   There's this whole &quot;plate class&quot; thing... I actually do buy into that a bit.<br />
<br />
I think , in terms of taking damage...<br />
<br />
1 : Cleric<br />
2 : Shaman<br />
3 : Druid<br />
<br />
and in terms of avoiding a hit... (think light, easy to dodge in armor)<br />
<br />
1 : Druid<br />
2 : Shaman<br />
3 : Cleric<br />
<br />
Maybe it's that way now, who knows with all of SoE's hidden calculations for 1 and 2%.... but let clerics get some better defense.<br />
<br />
So if Druids and Shamans can almost heal as good as a cleric, and mayeb even get like an 80% res... I think a few updates to clerics are needed... because I really really do see the general everquest population max-mining to find the best groups... and I see Shamans and Druids as more valuble if they could heal virtually as well as a cleric... plus the added bonus of being able to solo when they want.<br />
<br />
I played a cleric before my shaman... clerics don't suck... but they are pigeon holed into that one role... hard to deviate from it... and lots of pressure to do it well.   Of all the classes I played, it was easiest to be bored as a cleric.  I think a priest rebalance could work.... but it has to be looked at by what's needed.<br />
<br />
We don't need another slow class.   We do need more healing classes who can do the job of a cleric.   <br />
<br />
Most clerics truly don't want to be Shamans and Druids... if they did, they would.    When they say &quot;Give me slow&quot; ... what they really mean is &quot;I don't want to lose most of my groups when you can do my job almost as good, and bring so much more to the table&quot;.<br />
<br />

This is an opportunity for shaman to educate other classes on our experiences and state of play. If we fail to take the opportunity to change the perceptions of our class where possible then we really can't complain about those same perceptions of us as they currently exist.<br />

I remember back when north Tov was the end game and shamans were at their glory. Guilds would fight over you; groups would love to have you around. Then sony said hey bst do not have anything of value let’s give them really good slows will be great class balance. <br />
<br />
Fast forward to my God groups or my hard Ldon groups, guys I have a shaman friend, group goes get a bst they can slow be dps mana buff and off tank. Yes shamans have the top slow in the game but that does not really matter much to the typical exp groups. They gave you upgrades to your healing, which helped a lot, but they replaced shamans as a group’s first choice for a slower because all you have to offer is slow and buffs. If sony really wanted to help shamans out they would give you better nukes and dots because I doubt they will boost your pets dps. <br />
<br />
I really do not like how sony keeps tinkering with the game by taking people like shamans who spend years building up their chars only to have their rolls replaced and told to accept this new reality or reroll which keeps the hostility between the priest classes high. People should not HAVE to keep rerolling every time sony gets worried we have been playing the same class to long time to forced you to reroll i.e. most bards are former monks who gave up their class because sony forced them to with their class balancing.

SanDiego (UPI)<br />
<br />
Sony Online Entertainment, owners of the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG), Everquest, in an unprecedented continuation of their recent interaction with a diminishing playerbase announced a series of changes to their &quot;healer&quot; classes.<br />
<br />
Company spokesman 'Brenlo' said the changes were in respose to a recent coming together of the aforementioned healing classes in an attempt to provide balance, fun, and groupability.<br />
<br />
Brenlo outline the changes as follows:<br />
<br />
Clerics: Will now be given double attack, a new line of undead direct damage spells and an upgrade to their existing direct damage spells.  <br />
<br />
Brenlo said about the Cleric changes: We really felt we needed to make Clerics equally balanced in their desirability for groups, raids and solo play and these changes are the first step in that direction.  <br />
<br />
Druids: Were given a new spell - Virulent Paralysis - which can be bought off a vendor and is useable at level 60.  Additionally the Druid 'pet' will be upgraded so that its damage per second (DPS) is nearer to the Necromancer pet.<br />
<br />
Brenlo on Druids:  We felt that Druid AA's were nowhere near balanced in comparison with other classes and their pet was also very unbalanced when compared to Magicians and other 'pet' classes. <br />
<br />
Shaman:  <br />
<br />
Brenlo on Shaman: We are looking at ways to balance Shaman. We will continue to look at ways to balance Shaman. And in the future I will tell you we are continuing to look at ways to balance that whin - er Shaman.</div></div><hr />

It should be previous one.<br />
   we can heal..but not so good ... so.. killing pace is .. reduced (it means not the time to kill 1 mob but total time to kill mobs.)<br />
<br />
Some clr claims to us.. 'If you get improved healing, pls give us slow'<br />
Prob they don't understand our feeling about mitigation.<br />
If most of mobs cast AE like.. Heal mitigation... they might know our feeling. (practicaly I don't want to experience such a miserable AE)<br />

<br />
.... I snipped the totally obnoxious part of your post....<br />
<br />
I disagree.  Having two knights on the thing means that the mob has to kill two tanks (close to twice as many total HP) before it can start going after the rest of the group.  That means two unlucky spikes of damage instead of one slightly larger one.  Add in the damage mitigation from paladin stuns, the ability to self heal of the SK, patch heals from the paladin, the mob getting slowed immediately rather than a few seconds into the fight due to knights superior agro, the fight being shorter due to more DPS, lay on hands if needed, extra healing from two heal-over-time spells (2 targets), and a number of other factors.  And if the tanks are good at tank switches, it means that cheals may actually be usable in some cases where they wouldn't otherwise be.  All these advantages would seem likely to overwhelm the mitigation advantage and slightly higher HP of a warrior.<br />
<br />
I still think two skilled knights can &quot;out tank&quot; a warrior.  Tanking may not stack as easily as dps or healing, but it certainly stacks somewhat if you're willing to use some tactics instead of mindlessly standing there mashing the taunt key.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem here, and the largest cause for this whole affair, is the stupid percentages SOE applied to healing ratios, then decided to make OTHER important ability ratios MUCH closer. We heal 47% of a cleric, yet Enchanters slow 93% as well as us, BLs over 80% of ours. There is no appriciable &quot;gap&quot;  in slows, like there is in healing. <br />
<br />
I dont want to heal like a cleric, or even a druid. I would be content with 100, 80, 60. But at the same time, I want to see Chanters max slow nerfed to 80% of ours, and BLs max slow nerfed to 60%. After all, 60% slow over 20 seconds of a 30-second fight MUST be incredibly powerful if 70% slow over 10 seconds of the same fight is so awesome (/snicker)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some groups;<br />

Outside of slowing, shaman don't have any role to fall back on unlike other classes. Beastlord can fall back on to doing dps, Enchanter can fall back onto doing crowd control and Bard.<br />
So ideally shamans either need a new role or a enhanced fall back, ie dps.</div></div><hr />

I also notice a common theme among shamans is that we dont WANT to heal &quot;as good&quot; as a cleric, we just want to heal BETTER than we do now, and these stupid changes and adjustments to our HoTs really arent cutting it vs 1K hitters who quad and flurry. <br />
<br />
For myself, I am MORE than willing to give Clerics some more utility in exchange for more healing for us. Clerics should be better soloers, IMHO, every spell casting class should be.

I agree that clerics should heal best, and that druids should have some heals or abilities rather, which maybe heal more then shamans can, but all in all, shamans for their respective races are the same as druids for their races (and clerics for other races) and thus, being the MAIN HEALER for respective races, shamans shouldn't be getting jacked.

There are a large number of posters here who fully appriciate the situation and aren't really interested in creating an UBER shaman class again. All most want is SOME form of balance in todays EQ, be it heals, nukes, buffs, debuffs, or (prefferably) a combination of some or all of the above. <br />

<br />
Look, since making that post, I've changed my mind.  As I've already posted over there on the priest's covenant, I can see now that there's a case for upgrading shamans as healers rather than in the way I first suggested.<br />
<br />
Formerly I didn't believe shaman healing upgrades were the right way to go - but now I do.  The reason for my change of heart is that I've spent some time talking to the people who play shamans about class balancing.<br />
<br />
Also, I didn't say that shamans don't need upgrades.  I was careful to say that I did think that upgrades are necessary.  I thought that then, and I think it now.<br />
<br />
The point, and purpose, of that forum is to give you guys the chance to put your case to people who don't play shamans.  If you won't do that, you won't change any minds - but if you do come over and state your case, maybe you can.<br />
<br />
The reason druids have done so well from priest class balancing in the past is that they get together, talk, form a consensus, and then present that consensus to SoE with a single, unified voice.<br />
<br />
This is your chance to do the same.<br />
<br />
It's a pity there's no real shaman advocate on those boards.  As I understand it, the reason for that is that no shaman class leader has come forward.<br />
<br />
I urge you to choose some people to represent you, come forward, and talk to us.<br />
<br />
I know you're bitter.  I understand that (and I understand it much better now than I did before I heard you).  But try to leave that bitterness behind when you come over to the Priest's Covenant, and help us make it a constructive place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Shadowfrost, I actually agreed with your original post other than the fact that I think we should be viable XP group healers; although, I'm in the minority.

<br />
Seriously, if we aren't able to change Rytan's mind, a dev that is impartial, what makes you think that Shamans will change other classes' minds? Oh I know the answer...changing other classes' minds means supporting their own request for upgrades. <br />
<br />
I am asking for reasonable upgrades in order to *fix* my class that has been neglected while others received their upgrades in the past. We both know that stating ones case isn't going to convince anyone from another class, especially when you are basically asking for upgrades that &quot;infringe&quot; on their status quo.<br />

<br />
Well, I think the real problem lies in what I replied above. Nothing is going to come out of it, because Druids and Clerics certainly didn't participate in that discussion to *fix* Shamans. The reason they are coming together is very pragmatic. <br />
Both of you are trying to get support from the other 2 classes by conceding them some of their own perceived needs in trade.<br />
<br />
When and if the Shaman class gets fixed, I am willing to make that kind of deal. Shamans need to be brought back in line with the other 2 priests before we can start talking about &quot;supporting&quot; each others' wishes.<br />
<br />
I know you're bitter.  I understand that (and I understand it much better now than I did before I heard you).  But try to leave that bitterness behind when you come over to the Priest's Covenant, and help us make it a constructive place.<br />

<br />
If you're going to insist on shaman issues being dealt with before druid and cleric issues, then frankly it's probably best if you don't take part.  :)<br />
<br />
I agree that shamans probably have more problems than druids and clerics do right now, and I think that if a consensus does emerge, it'll probably involve a relative increase in power for shamans.  But it isn't going to be &quot;shammies first, druids and clerics later&quot;, no.<br />
<br />
If you're prepared to agree that druids and clerics might have issues of their own, and if you're prepared listen to those druids and clerics and discuss a solution which would deal with the issues of all three classes simultaneously, then please do come on over.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">While many of us may feel that we're the worst off of the priests, Clerics and Druids have issues too.  Demanding that we get fixed first and then being willing to sit down and talk ballance is totally unreasonable.  Any upgrades we get effect that ballance, and while not all upgrades are made equal clerics and druids both deserve their issues to be answered too.  I've talked to cleric friends/guildmates in the past about some of their issues, and very much simpathize with them.  From this Priest's Covenant forum I've learned much more of the problems that druids also have, and can also simpathize with them now.  We all need fixes to make us all wanted in groups and raids.  We all need fixes so that we compliment each other, instead of compete with each other.  This problem is especially true with druids and clerics as oftentimes they compete for the main healer roles, while we get many groups from our role as a slower.  My only problem with the priests covenant forum is people keep leaving paladin's out.  They are healers, and I've been saved by a timely heal from a paladin more times than I can count, and as such need to be addressed as well.  They currently see everybody asking for tons of upgrades and nobody really suggesting anything from them, and I'm sure they feel very threatened that they might lose their role as a good choice for emergency healer when the rest of us are done with our wish lists.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that Druids and Clerics have already recieved powerful upgrades in recent expansions. I don't think I need to list them. Shaman, however, have found our abilities being minimalized (slow mitigation, shorter fights), diluted (enchanters and BLs slowing as well as we do for all intents and purposes), obsolete (stat buffs are meaningless in todays gear mudflation situation) and downright ignored (where is OUR burst DPS? Lowest nuke of any caster class, thats where). <br />
<br />
I am not ignorant or unsympathetic to the problems of Druids and Clerics, but honestly, those 2 classes are a LOT closer to &quot;balanced&quot; than some others that need some serious attention, mainly Shamans, Knights, maybe Mages. Sure, we can discuss the other priest deficiences, no problem. I 100% agree that clerics should be given more soloing tools. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is this. Since Kunark, Shaman have paid for the power of slow and the mana regeneration of Canni by being given slower casting, more expensive spells than other classes. Since Kunark Shamans have been given baby-step upgrades, while other classes are recieving Double-Giant steps. This has been fine until now. Shamans were extremely powerful right up through early PoP, LDoN, etc. But now, in higher end POP and Gates, the game itself has adjusted AWAY from a shamans main strengths, and simply left us standing there wondering why. Its time to answer that question. Clerics, Druids, Warriors, Enchanters, Rogues, Wizards, Necros, we can answer their questions later. <br />
<br />
First things first. This isnt some quid-pro-quo. We arent asking to be as powerful healers as Clerics, or even Druids. We arent asking to nuke as well as Wizards, or even Druids. We arent asking to DOT better than Necros, just to keep the rate the same (look at the 2 LDoN class DOTs, then the OoW proposed upgrades, and tell me who got bent over the table). We arent asking for some outrageous uber slow, or that asking that Chanters and BLs slow be nerfed so we can be &quot;Kings&quot; again. None of these things are on our list.<br />
<br />
Heal a little better, and not just HoTs. Buff a little more effectively (this looks like its happening). A little more fast Burst DPS to keep up with the changing &quot;super fast&quot; environment. Please explain HOW these are unreasonable, or WHY we should not have these GLARING defects corrected before ANYTHING else happens. We need some attention, the attention that we have been lacking since Kunark. No one minded the lack in Velious. No one cared we were ignored in Luclin. No one suggested that we needed more and more in the beginning of POP or LDoN when basically we got nothing but small upgrades to existing spells. But now, its obvious, and its time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I have a few simple questions for those thinking the request of fixing core issues with Shamans, before actually moving to the balancing between the priest classes is unreasonable:<br />
<br />
When Slow, our main ability, was nerfed through mitigation, immunity and shortened fight durations, what did they give us to compensate for this?<br />
What upgrade have Shamans received since we have voiced our concerns? The only thing coming to my mind was giving us an ommited upgrade to Tnarg's and an upgrade to our HoT. <br />
<br />
For every upgrade Shamans have been receiving, the other classes affected somehow have been receiving the same upgrades(Look at the HoTs for Clerics, Daluda's was as well a direct result of a plain healing upgrade for all priests across the board with GoD).<br />
Now let me ask, when Slow was *nerfed* did they nerf other classes' main abilities across the board as well?<br />
<br />
Edit: Read Blazz's post and can't but agree. That's exactly what I tried to explain, when I said that first you need to fix Shamans and then we can discuss about balancing, or we end up with getting fixes for Shamans and upgrades for Druids and Clerics. The &quot;gap&quot; needs to be closed or we end up getting the shaft again.</div></div><hr />

What I am saying is that you can't walk into a discussion and say, &quot;Right, you lot, I don't care what your problems are, because my problems are worse.  So I'm only prepared to take part in the discussion on condition that we ignore your problems until mine are fixed, and if you won't agree to that condition, I'm leaving.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is why I am not taking part in the discussion.<br />
<br />
In other words, Druids and Clerics want Shamans to support their requests and wishes and I can't do that. I will keep trying to get my own issues fixed, which, to be fair, do not require any consensus from Druids and Clerics imo.<br />
<br />
Once that happened, there's nothing wrong with coming together and discussing the path the different priest classes should be taking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">The real shaman problem is time.<br />
I cant cast fast enough to dilute my mana pool.<br />
<br />
Whats the use of having super insane mana regen if you never use it?<br />
The only time you may use it is soloing tanking in teh face where you have to heal yourself a bit whilst stacking up them dots.<br />
<br />
But if you stop typing for a sec, your mana regen halves.<br />
<br />
I go on LDONS and i can slow, heal and nuke non stop and never drop below 70% mana, and if i do, I just start canniing.<br />
<br />
Most of the time I do LDONS on just canni 5 alone.<br />
<br />
My real problem is its hard to fulfill the role of healer if all of your spells take a long time to land.<br />
<br />
IT used to be like that with clerics, but they have tuned mob dps so its bursty, and given clerics fast cast heals that counter that.<br />
<br />
This has indirectly effected shamans as well.<br />
<br />
I think reducing the casting time on many of our spells would go a long way towards making us more viable at the higher end.<br />
<br />
Often on raids, by the time you get a slow on the mob, and start casting your nuke, the darn thing is dead.<br />
<br />
I think decreasing the cast time of our healing spells, canni and nuke would go a long way towards making shamans more desirable as a healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">It's a pity there's no real shaman advocate on those boards.  As I understand it, the reason for that is that no shaman class leader has come forward.<br />
<br />
I urge you to choose some people to represent you, come forward, and talk to us.<br />

Hello. Welcome to the Crucible and welcome to a class that historically has a very difficult time reaching consensus, due to the VERY NATURE of the class.<br />
<br />
I would love to hang out more on the Druid's Grove, but with all the other things I have going on, I just can't take on anymore game-related responsibilities.</div></div><hr />
