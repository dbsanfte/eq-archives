<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">quick question from a newbie shaman...<br />
<br />
In another post I saw someone mention quading...how does a shammy quad?  I have a 55 druid and I quad all the time, but I use ensnare and AE blasts...what does a shammy do?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heya, <br />
No, he is right, some other guys said that he was Quading the specter's in Oasis.<br />
I wondered about that myself.<br />
Trust me it was on this forum, i dont go anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, well I can quad spectres in Oasis.  Three beat on me while my pet kills the fourth.</div></div><hr />

In that Barbarian is da heart of a true shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i belive if someone was quading specs in oasis it was becuae they sued to move prety slow, while unsnared so a shaman could quad but now they move ant normal speed so it's harder. Othe than that it would be quite hard to quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh a long time ago I made a post about quading mamoths on Everfrost. I was a n00b who wanted to be a druid at the time....  I would gather 4 mamoths and use my aoe poison spells and disease dot them all. I dont think it ever worked becuase I ran out of mana and my rain spells only hit one time. It was fun but didnt work out. You are a shaman why quad? If you want to quad make a druid or wizard. If you want to be a bad ass make a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol wrong class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can quad if you Root / Rot.  :)  I used to take on 3 Sarnaks in LoIO routinely when I was in my 20's and low 30'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No no it was me...<br />
<br />
I dont know the true definition of quading, I meant it to mean kiting 4 + Mobs.  And yes Im doing it easily with no death as a 43 shaman with good gear.<br />
<br />
Fresh Sow, Fresh Chloro.  I have regen BP.  No pet.  Pull all spec with scourge.  Focus on one they will all come.  They are SLOW.  Pull past Inn to Derv Camp in South Oasis.  1 Scouge + 2 Venom = 1 dead or near Spec.  Use Frost Strike if you need.<br />
<br />
The key is the specs are so slow you can Can 2-3 times at the end of a run.  At 15 regen per tick you can slaughter them with NO damage, if you do it right.  You can do this until you run out of Specs or Sow or Chloro.<br />
Usually run out of Specs. I 've done 5 db Specs np, takes 8-10 min tho.<br />
<br />
I have spell haste II, manna pres II, afflict effic II and extend afflict III.<br />
<br />
Finish at 80% HP 20-30 manna.  Just takes time.  HP+REGEN= endless manna.<br />
<br />
Its easly. NO BS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why not just do it one spec at a time? Seems like you're doing more work than needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cause they all come till you break the camp.  After that its 2 at a time mostly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use to quad aviaks in south karana, and Cycklops in Mnt's all the time when I was a young shaman. Of course this was back before anyone knew what quadding meant and my disease dots all lasted for 10 mins  :p<br />
<br />
Oh yah, I regularly kill 3 mobs at a time in HoH. It's not 4, but it beats killing them 1 at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorgeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">what about the snare necklace?  innoruk trolls could feasably pull it off to a point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phleggma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's slow casting, easily resisted, easily interrupted and very short duration.  No we can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Geez wasn't bragging or anything....but its a nice trick for the appropriate level Shaman.<br />
<br />
A shammy can prob only quad kite in limited circumstances.<br />
<br />
In Oasis-<br />
1) No other dangerous Mobs to aggro on you while you kite.<br />
2) Specs have to be some of the slowest critters out there, you remember where the Specs drop and casually loot them on the turn-around.<br />
3) Specs have low HP for their level.<br />
4) Specs drop nice loot so its worth the effort, about 200 +/- plat per hour, 20-40 plat per drop of 4, depending on your luck.<br />
5)  Its almost danger free, if you take the path I outlined above you are also close to the S Ro zone line, so even a high 30 shammy could prob kill 2 or so then zone.  Of course the Specs will wander home, but I always send /ooc to zone several times.   <br />
<br />
To try this with say, Frost Giants in GD is invite a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also and most importantly I have maxxed out off/def/weapons for my level.  Don'y ever kite until you do.  And its in the back corner of Oasis so nobody sees you, like I said in my original post I do this only to get through 43 quickly.  It aint no fun.  I like like a dirty lil dr00d.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used to Quad all the time in Fungus grove.<br />
<br />
Pull one shroom with slow. Root it and mut starts munching. <br />
Pull the second third and fourth. All with slow<br />
<br />
Spear dot a could of the later ones. Then break out the Poisen Wind censer (AE Rain proc 122 to me and you. And I have 120ish poisen resist)<br />
<br />
If you can take one monster beating on you unslowed and live. then pretty much you can take 4 slowed ones at the same time as well. Add in a damage sheild And a Wind censer for the added damage and it is almost efficiant. But more importantly Fun.<br />
<br />
Also at the time I had Spell casting fury 2  So the Censers Procs would crit alot. And due to the +14 Points of dex I had added in char creation I have always been pretty much max dex when buffed up. <br />
<br />
That is one shamans Version of Quadding. And I really kinda miss it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did fungus almost the same way.  I cant call it quading, more like a production line of death.  I would have as many as 5 stacked up at one time around me and as one died, I filled it in with a fresh pull.  Only problem with this was that you ran out of shrooms quicly and if some smart arse wanted. they could easily cast dispell magic on them and wipe you out.  I had someone do that while I had 4 lined up and I never saw him casting due to all the spam going on.  Just a bunch of Red and Dead. <br />
<br />
I could clear 2 patches like that and not run out of mana if I cann'ed during the fights.  I never had to use torpor much so most of my mana was used to DoT.  I got 27 AA doing that before PoP came out.  Ah, the good old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I used to pull the spec island in oasis to S.Ro zone line and use CT initiate or desciple neckless to fear (panic dead) adds while I root rotted one and med. Did not work well as I usually had to zone after killing 2 or 3, but it was always fun trying. With CT necklace you can kill one by fear dot even at less than 1 bub of health.<br />
<br />
A little tip that was given to me ages ago when I was trying to single pull island (don't know if it still works). Lev up and then agro a zombie and take it over to one corner of the island. Only one spec will come to assist. Best to run back to shore and fight though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've done something similiar with Frosties in GD and EW, but only up to 3 Frosties, never did 4 Frosties at once.  Done 4 mobs at once in EW, 2 Frosties 2 wandering various mobs.  Use the old root rot for the Frosties, used Malxx to drop their resists, and started blasting with JBB.  I could only do this with KEI and JBB, take away KEI and I could only handle 2.  It always made for an interesting encounter.  At the time I used a Cerimonial Iskar BP, and a Fungus covered Greatstaff to get HP back up and canni back mana.  All in all worked pretty good.  Did this from 44-47 and the lvls flew by as well as built up my faction with Coldain and CoV.</div></div><hr />
