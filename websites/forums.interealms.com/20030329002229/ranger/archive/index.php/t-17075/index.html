<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerDave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Headed to Velious, but I'm not clear on what all the faction issues are. I remember something about Dragon, Dwarf and Giant factions, but I can't recall which ones Rangers are supposed to be concerned about. Seems reasonable that Dwarves would be friendly, and should probably be kept that way. Can someone fill me in?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Each race (giant, dwarf, dragon)  has at least two factions -  the faction for the entire race, and the faction that only the King and a few other mobs are on.  Eg, all coldain are on coldain faction, but King Dain and some other dwarves are also on Dain faction.<br />
<br />
Everyone, regardless of class or race, starts out apprehensive to the dwarves (Coldain faction).<br />
<br />
Everyone, except for ogre warriors (deity Rallos Zek) start out KoS to Giants.  The ogre warriors will be dubious to almost all giants, but  they will be KoS to mobs on Tormax faction (Tormax is the giant King).  Giants actually have three factions - Kromrif, Kromzek, and Tormax faction (our ogre warrior is KoS only to Tormax-aligned giants)<br />
<br />
Everyone, regardless of race or class, starts out KoS to dragons (Claws of Veeshan faction).<br />
<br />
Killing of each race will increase your faction with the other two.  IE killing giants increases faction with dwarves and dragons (depending on the mobs you kill - not all of them will increase faction with both other races).<br />
<br />
Selecting what faction you want to be on will usually depend on the guild you're in.    If you're guilded it's probably best to go with whatever faction your guild as a whole is on.  If you're unguilded, it's generally easier to stick with what you have, and work on increasing coldain faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on a bunch of different factors.  I don't have sigs on so I can't tell if you're guilded, what level you are, etc.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you're guilded, see what your guild is on factionwise.  My guild is on CoV at the moment (got a lot of folks doing HoT currently for armor drops).  Since that involves killing a lot of giants (and I do mean a lot) I've got fairly decent dorf faction.  Good enough to have gotten a runed scouts BP anyway.<br />
<br />
If you're guildless, that's a tough call.  I never really saw a lot of pickup groups in the time I spent in Kael, so I'd imagine the same is true for other armor drop locations as well.  <br />
<br />
I think most guilds go CoV/Dorfs at first, and then when they move into ToV they go giant faction (since you're trashing CoV faction anyway), but YMMV... <br />
<br />
As for one being better than another, well, the dorf armor is the lowest AC stuff, and I think the giant stuff is the highest, and dragon armor has nice resists.  Been a while since I looked tho.  It's all good kit, just depends on where the folks you hunt a lot with are going.</div></div><hr />
