<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Is a writ of dragonkind in the primary hand then considered a no no?  If so, i need a suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That depends... how's your hand-to-hand skill?<br />
<br />
To refrain from the silly at the moment, I have no objections to folks using whatever gear they want for how they play.  I strongly recommend a weapon and a shield, as much for AC and damage output as for roleplaying purposes.<br />
<br />
If you want to hold a pair of items that bump your Wis way up, go for it.   Use your mana down to below the extra &quot;reserves&quot; the items give you, and switch to AC/HP.<br />
<br />
When you're faced with down time, switch back to mana items.  Very effective if you've mistakenly timed your Harnesses.  4xHarness=Big drain.  Ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Verata ,<br />
<br />
Seems obvious i know but what about your epic ?<br />
Is that an attainable goal for you or not ? If not im really a fan of any weapon over running around defenseless.<br />
Granted tho our melee is not substantial but what do you do when you run out of mana on a mob ?<br />
Im guessing you group almost exclusively or you use the root and rot method of soloing.<br />
But really with a decent weapon in hand you can still throw a few hundred pts of melee damage onto a mob over the course of the fight.<br />
You could use the above suggestion of swapping out gear during the course of a fight but personally im not a big fan of that.Its a hassle and theres always the chance to accidentally drop something in the heat of the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Not to down your play style because for a Shaman there is no clear cut &quot;right&quot; way. But there is something very Druid-ish and strange about a Shaman not having a Poker or ugly stick to whack people with. What if you run out of mana fighting a mob ? You gonna read him a bed time story ? Teach him geometry ? <br />
<br />
All jokes aside, play the way you like if it works for you there is nothing wrong with it. But IMO a Shaman with a book is a cardinal sin. <br />
<br />
Get a poker like the Epic and make a mob a walking pin cushion !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What if you run out of mana fighting a mob ?<br />
<br />
I guess with that much Wis you *don't* run out of mana. It's all part of the playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Also play a bard, from time to time.<br />
<br />
I was SO happy the day they put in the switches to prevent dropping things.<br />
<br />
Currently, I switch between epic/shield and my whackamole mallet.  2 open inventory slots and my main/off hand slots on the bottom of a hotkey bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From the non-torpor world, if your going to OOM on it and wont have the juice to kill it, you shouldn't have picked the fight :)<br />
<br />
Usually I go LOH before I go LOM as my only 2 dots I use are EB and VOS (COME ON BON!!!!) with epic and Jbone to back it.. but if the mob is a big arse kicker, I'm not too embarssed to switch to Druid mode and let him rot away either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">what would be so bad if you were to use a book?  I use the book of obulus for the better heals I can put out...  I was thinking of getting a Crystal Chitin Shield, but am not sure if it was worth the amount less I can heal.<br />
<br />
I have a mana pres 2 neck plus book of obulus = more heal for less mana...<br />
<br />
should I go ahead and get the shield?<br />
<br />
(sorry if I am hi jacking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Zenyn - depends on how often you heal.  I *rarely* heal, esp when soloing.  In a group, I make sure Slows and Chloro get most of my mana.  <br />

ps - 25 lines of signature for a 2 line post isn't the coolest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The point I was making was that his mana is his saving grace, he goes LoM or OOM he's screwed !. At least if I go LoM or OOM on a Slowed Mob I can tank him for a while with my pet. Because I have the AC to take a beating and I'm not using a book. With a book you have to run for the hills. Resists can add up. I know I've gone LoM a few times just to Slow a mob or make a DoT stick. <br />
<br />
But if your playstyle is working stick with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">First off, I wish every shaman could get themselves a hottie, avoid the trolls .../shudder<br />
<br />
Second, what goods a book if you can't read?<br />
<br />
Lastly, A shaman can get away with that wis caster crap for only so long.  Join a Kael raid or dungeon crawl.  If you're ...<br />
<br />
-waiting till the mob is half dead before you slow so you don't get the snot pounded out of you, then you might be a wis shaman.<br />
-running away from a mob while a madly taunting tank is chasing the aggroed mob on your ass, then you might be a wis shaman.<br />
-refusing to go to the velks pit without a cleric and an enchanter, then you might be a wis shaman.<br />
-a group of green angry gnolls fill you with terror for the interupts and force you to zone or plead for help, you might be a wis shaman.<br />
-getting summoned means you'll likely find out where you're bound, you might be a wis shaman.<br />
-cleric is actually using their mana to keep YOU alive, you might be a wis shaman (or you're in CT ... whatever).<br />
-If you've EVER been mistaken for a druid, you might be a wis shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as when I need a poker, I have a howler in the bag, but I never solo (which is why i sold the JBB) and my wife is 51 enchanter, so I always have clarity, and a group to support.<br />
Epic is... shrug, a bit off.  The alliance I am in, I am about 4th or 5th back in getting a tear, and even then, shrug, I dont care too much about it.<br />
<br />
So, as I asked before, Writ of Dragonkind, with 25 hps, 100 mana and 15 whats going to be better in primary hand besides epic?<br />
(and dont tell me a spear, because I should be sitting my bottom down in a group situation and canadancing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If you are primarily a group Shammy then your gear is just fine. So I really don't think anything other than the epic is going to be better in your primary hand then what you already have.</div></div><hr />
