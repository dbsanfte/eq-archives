<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I got the first level of it and I am loving it. I went to NToV and it's getting rid of most of the AE right away.<br />
<br />
There is still some effects it is not getting rid of, though. Mostly Acid Jet and Sliming Mist, by example. Will RC2 or RC3 help with those or are they just impossible to get rid off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will RC at any level remove Malo or Mal&quot;x&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">RC1 *can* remove the Malo line of spells, along with Slime Mist, but it sometimes takes two shots of RC1, sometimes not.  Not quite sure why, but I can confirm firsthand it's gotten rid of those.  I didn't have any other detrimental effects on me besides Malo when it took 2 shots.<br />
<br />
I'll be getting RC2 soon and will test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RC1: has a CHANCE to remove 1 detrimenial effect (malo or other crap ae)<br />
RC2 can remove 3<br />
RC3 can remove 6<br />
<br />
It is based on luck, so u can succeed on first try or not. RC 1 can remove malo with luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What's the re-use time on RC ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Ah, I see... it's not a guaranteed removal of an effect but a chance.<br />
<br />
Okay... let's say this situation: the only detrimental effect on a player is a effect with more poison (or curse, or disease) counters than the  RC can removes. Does the RC still has a chance of removing the detrimental effect in one shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont remember RC counter exactly but i think RC 1 is 9 counters in curse, 9 in poison, 9 in disease and 1 detrimenial effect.<br />
<br />
I tried on myself, and the effect are added. means u can remove 1 detrimenial + 1 poison dot with RC 1 for example<br />
<br />
RC 1 remove 9 poison + 9 disease + 9 curse + 1 possibly detrimenial.</div></div><hr />
