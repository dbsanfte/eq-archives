<b>This is Step One of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Garadain Glacierbane'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hrmff, what's this? A spy sent from the giant heathens, or the selfrighteous wurms perhaps? Either way, you'd be no [friend] of the great Coldain. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a friend of the great coldain'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A friend, you say? That remains to be seen. Much more to being a friend of the Coldain than just sayin' so. Anyway, I'm too [tired] to argue about it. I haven't slept in days. <br />
<br />
You say, 'why are you tired'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Did I say tired? Exhausted is more like it. Ever since that blizzard last week I haven't slept a wink. I came back from huntin' snow orcs to find that my [blanket] had blown away and now I'm just too tired to rustle up a new one. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what blanket'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Not just any old blanket, mind ye, mine was made of the finest tundra kodiak hides and snow panther skins, two of each. When I was wrapped up in it ya couldn't see me a bit, no, I blended right into the snow, I did. Say, if you be a friend, here's yer chance to prove it. Sew me up a new blanket so I can get some rest. <br />
<br />
<b>Now you need to collect the pelts to make the blanket.  You kill Tundra Kodiaks in Eastern Wastes and get two High Quality Tundra Kodiak Pelts.  Then you can kill snow cougars in Eastern Wastes OR Iceclad Ocean.  The cougars in Iceclad are a lot easier to kill and seem to be much more plentiful.  Kill them til you have two High Quality Cougar Skins.  Once you have all four skins, combine them in a sewing kit.  My tailoring skill was 28 and I did not fail on this step the first time.  The second time I attempted it I failed.  It probably would be best to raise your tailoring skill to around 50 or 60 before attempting the blanket since the tundra kodiak pelts are so uncommon.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-ColdainHuntingBlanket.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Hand in Blanket to Garadain</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Ahh, that'll do fine. Take this, it is but a trinket for now, but continue to serve the Coldain and it will grow in power. I must get some rest now, for I have been told my [nephew] has disappeared again and I will need to track him down tomorrow. <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Two of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'Who is your nephew'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'My nephew, Boridain, keeps running away from home to kill a bothersome [beast], thinking this will prove to all of Thurgadin that he is a great hunter. Every time he does this my sister gets hysterical and I am sent out to find him. <br />
<br />
You say, 'What beast'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A rabid tundra kodiak has been feeding on our people for weeks now. If Boridain ever stumbled across the critter I doubt he'd stand a chance. I have a solution, but it would require the [assistance] of an outsider. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will provide assistance'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'I'm taking a liking to you stranger. Your eagerness to help us will not go unnoticed. Find my nephew and give him this axe. It should keep him from hurting himself. Return to me with the <font color="red">ring</font> and proof that he is safe. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-DullBladedAxe.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Go to -2500, 1500.  Boridain is on a flat spot of a mountain and several giants, wolves and orcs path through this area.  Boridain is on Beta-Neutral faction at this point so he is not KoS to anything.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Boridain Glacierbane'<br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hello stranger, I am Boridain, master hunter of the Coldain. Glad to meet you. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand in the Dull Bladed Axe to Boridain.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Say! This looks just like the axe my uncle uses. With this I can kill the beast for sure! Now please, be very quiet, I must track my prey. I won't return to Thurgadin without the hide of the rabid tundra kodiak! <br />
<br />
<b>At this point Boridain despawns and then respawns with an axe in his hand and is now aligned with the Coldain faction.  People have charmed Boridain and buffed him up to give him more HPs to keep him alive.  I attempted to do this with an enchanter friend but we buffed the wrong one (the one we buffed despawned <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  After running through this step I found the best method was to use harmony on both Boridain AND anything in his path.  He is a madman - he'll attack anything and everything.  Just keep him harmonied and he'll be a bit more calm.</b><br />
<br />
<b>He walks from his plateau for a bit then emotes this:</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hmmm, fresh prints. They're HUGE! This must be it! This hunting stuff is easier than I thought. <br />
<br />
<b>Now he heads to the Frost Giant fort entrance.  Be sure to harmony the giants at the entrance before he gets there!</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hmm, that wasn't him.Let see now, if I were a rabid tundra beast where would I go? This way! <br />
<br />
<b>Now he walks towards the prison camp area and stops to get a bite to eat.  His stopping point is -1150, 1000 and stays there for 2 minutes.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Boy, all this hunting sure does make ya hungry! Time for a snack. <br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Ahh, that's better. Back to the hunt... I think I hear something over yonder. Stay low. <br />
<br />
<b>Now he goes to a corral thingy in the Prison Camp area.  Sometimes there is a giant and an orc here.  I just harmonied them and kept harmony on Boridain and they all ignored each other.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Where did that vile beast go now? Wait, what's that over there? Could it be? Only one way to find out! <br />
<br />
<b>He starts off towards the Orc Fort and stops midway to take a little rest <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  His stopping point is -2000, 1400.  He stays here for two minutes.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane yawns, 'All this tracking is makin me mighty sleepy. Time for a little nap. You keep a lookout. <br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane stretches, 'Ahh, refreshing! Back to work... I think I smell the beast! This way. <br />
<br />
<b>Now Boridain goes to the Orc Fort entrance.  Make sure you keep him harmonied as well as any orcs at the gate.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'I just don't get it. I thought that was him for sure. I don't see any sign of him now. <br />
<br />
<b>Now Boridain goes back to the spot you originally found him and sits down at the corner.  (-2300, 1600)</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Who am I kidding, I'm no hunter. I'll never be a hunter. I may as well give up and become a miner like dad. <br />
<br />
<b>A Rabid Tundra Kodiak spawns and starts to creep up to him from behind.  Kill it before it gets to him and have someone guard the dorf so he doesn't get killed by passing baddies.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-RabidTundraKodiakSkin.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now you hand in the skin to Baradain and he gives you his axe to give back to Garadain.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Yes! I've done it! The vile beast is finally dead. I will at last be revered as the mighty hunter I am. Here is your axe back, I broke it on the killing blow. Take it as proof that you are a friend of the greatest hunter in the history of the Coldain! <br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-BrokenAxe.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now go back to Garadain and hand him the Broken Axe and the Copper Coldain Insignia Ring.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Excuse me, Chromite , aren't you forgetting something? <br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Well done friend! My nephew is safe at home and his thirst for adventure is quenched for now. The beast will claim no more of our people. I couldn't have handled it better myself. Now I can get back to the business of [hunting]. <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Three of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'What are you hunting'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'My camp here boasts the most proficient hunters in the recorded history of the mighty Coldain empire. We alone could feed an entire clan. Things have been frustratingly [slow] lately, though. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Why have they been slow'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'After years of skinning the hides of the giantmen, my hunting knife has lost its edge. The dull blade has slowed me down considerably. It has served me well, but a new [knife] would make me a much more proficient hunter. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I can help get you a new knife'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hunt a wooly rhino and take his tusk, then take a flawless hide from a walrus. Combine them in a forge with a skinning rock and bring me the new knife and the silver insignia <font color="red">ring</font>. <br />
<br />
<b>Now you go and hunt wooly rhinos until you get a horn (it's not a tusk).  The horn is not too uncommon.  Then hunt walruses until you get a High Quality Walrus Skin.  After getting those items you need to search around the Sleeper's Tomb entrance (the sleeping dragon statue) and look for red dots on the ground.  Those red dots signify a skinning rock.  Pick one up and then you have all the ingredients to make the knife in a forge.  My smithing skill was 33 when I made my knife.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-ColdainHuntingKnife.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now you hand in the Coldain Hunting Knife and the Silver Coldain Insignia <font color="red">Ring</font> to Garadain.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Excuse me, Chromite , aren't you forgetting something? <br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hrmm, not quite the work of a Coldain.  Barely functional, in fact. I'll be needing to touch this up a bit. Fetch me a Coldain [smithing hammer] and I'll be sure to tell my associates in Thurgadin of your deeds. <br />
Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Four of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'Where do I find a coldain smithing hammer?'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says '[Tain] Hammerfrost can get you one. Find him and give him this.<br />
<br />
<b>Garadain hands you a Note to Tain.  This note is useless, Tain just takes it and does nothing for it.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-NoteToTain.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Tain Hammerfrost'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Tain left a short time ago, he said he had a score to settle with a particular Kromriff. <br />
<br />
<b>Tain Hammerfrost spawns over the hill in front of the giant ice bridge.</b><br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost lies bleeding on the ground moaning, 'Ohhhh, someone...help, please...' <br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Tain Hammerfrost'<br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'The bloody Kromrif ambushed me! I escaped, but I am near death. They'll be tracking me down to finish me off at any moment. Without [help], I'm as good as dead. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help you'<br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'Thank Brell! I hear them approaching from just over that hill! Slay the leader, Ghrek, and give me his elixir. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point Tain Hammerfrost falls to the ground and 4 giants spawn.  One is Ghrek Squatnot and the rest are 'a frost giant'.  These range from like level 43-level 45.  Aggro all 4 of them and pull them away from Tain.  Kill Ghrek and loot the Frozen Elixir from his corpse.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-FrozenElixir.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Hand the Frozen Elixir to Tain Hammerfrost and he will give you a Coldain Smithing Hammer.</b><br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'I will report your selfless actions when I return to Thurgadin. Take this for your troubles, friend. I hope you find it useful. Fare thee well. <br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'The bloody Ry'Gorr, friends of  the frost giants, plan to raid our encampment. Their captain, Scarbrow Ga'hruk is leading the raid. I need someone to intercept his [orders] so we may prepare for the attack. Without them we could be in serious trouble. <br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'Find the Ry'Gorr messenger and cut him down. Bring the message he carries to my lookout. When the attack is thwarted, return to me with the head of Scarbrow and the platinum insignia <font color="red">ring</font>. <br />

The fifth orc is Scarbrow Ga`Hruk himself.  He is a 45+ Shadow Knight and can be solo'd by a level 60 ranger.  Scarbrow often has a nice caster/priest item on his corpse.

Garadain Glacierbane says 'For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force. Bring me proof of their fate and proof that whoever was responsible for their loss is no more. <br />

<b>Find Korrigain the ghost.  He spawns at 10pm game time.</b><br />

Korrigain says 'Who dares disturb my rest? If ye be a friend of the mighty Coldain, then show me proof and I shall tell you of my plight.  If not, then be on your way. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand him your Obsidian Coldain Insignia <font color="red">Ring</font> and he hands it back to you unchanged.  Icefang in the hut nearby will respawn and come out to be buffed by Korrigain.  Icefang takes off running around and eventually leads  you to the orc camp by the big Ice Bridge.</b><br />
<br />
Korrigain says 'Many seasons ago I stood here in life with my comrades, the best warriors Thurgadin had to offer. Along with our faithful wolven army we were poised to eliminate the Kromrif presence in the region. Somehow, the enemy was made aware of our plans and just before our attack, a group of Ry'Gorr oracles charmed our wolves, forcing them to tear down their own masters. We were caught by surprise and died a savage death. <br />
<br />
Icefang whimpers as he approaches. <br />
<br />
Korrigain says 'All that remains from that battle is my loyal Icefang. He will not rest until I am avenged. Follow and watch after him. He alone knows where our attackers lie and he cannot overcome them by himself. May Brell bless you with success, farewell. <br />
<br />
<b>Just before you get to the camp Icefang stops and sniffs at the ground and growls.  At this time Poxbreath Yellowfang spawns beside the campfire at the orc camp.  You don't need to wait for Icefang to get there to engage him.  I recommend that you clear the orc camp before handing in your <font color="red">ring</font> to Korrigain so the camp is clear and Icefang doesn't get killed.</b><br />
<br />
<b>*** NOTE *** The above has changed slightly.  Now 3 oracles of Ry`Gorr spawn along with Poxbreath.  A level 55 monk and level 60 ranger were able to take them out with no problem.  Poxbreath and the oracles all conned blue to a level 60.</b><br />
<br />
Icefang sniffs at the ground and growls, baring his teeth. <br />
Icefang  wags his tail and howls in victory. <br />
<br />
<b>Poxbreath Yellowfang is a level 45+ shaman and was easy to kill for a level 60 ranger.  When he died he had 4 items on his corpse.  I am not sure if it's random as to the number of loot but he had 3 pieces of normal orc loot (Orc Fang Earring, Orc Fang Necklace, Ry`Gorr chain armor) and the Note from Kromrif.</b><br />

<b>Now you need to find Rodrick.  In the note it identifies him as Rodrick Kotrad, but that might just be to try and conceal his true identity <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  Anyhow, Rodrick spawns after a scripted sequence that happens near the orc fort.

Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'He was supposed to be here hours ago! <br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'I don't know why the chief tolerates this insolent fool. If he is discovered he'll betray us for sure. <br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'If he makes me wait another minute I'll gut him myself... <br />
<br />
<b>After a bit of pacing back and forth for the Emissary, Rodrick finally spawns.</b><br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Ahh, good to see you my little friend, I was beginning to think something had happened to you. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'I had to take extra measures to be sure I wasn't followed. I sense that someone is on to me. You know I am risking my life for this. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'You are just a paranoid little man, Rodrick. That's not your fault, it's in your blood. It's what makes your kind weak and unworthy. As for the risk, that's what you're paid so well for. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'Yes, the rewards have been most generous... But what good is money if I am discovered by the Dain? After the massacre he is already suspicious and... <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary interrupts Rodrick, 'Chief Ry`gorr himself told me to assure you that the time draws near. When the Kromrif invade Thurgadin there will be no more Dain. The citizens will be enslaved and you will be placed upon the throne to govern over them. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'Okay, okay, please do not tell the chief of my anxiety <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'You have my word, now what news do you bring? <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'You have taken a prisoner, one that is very dear to the Dain. His name is Corbin Blackwell. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Yes, our interrogators are working with him now. He is sure to have some valuable information forthcoming any time now. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'You had better hurry with him, the Dain has made his recovery a top priority. A team of elite Coldain will be attempting to rescue him in a matter of hours. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Very well, we will be prepared. Again you have come through for the chief. This will not be forgotten. We will contact you again soon. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point the Emissary walks away from Rodrick and then into the orc fort.  He stands in front of the Oracle of Ry`Gorr and the following is said:</b><br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'My liege, I have spoken with the Coldain informant. I have some urgent news for the chief. It seems the Dain takes a special interest in our new prisoner. He has dispatched special forces to rescue this Corbin Blackwell from our interrogators. <br />

Oracle of Ry`Gorr laughs, 'We will prepare for this rescue party. They will not be heard from again. I will inform the Chief, dismissed. <br />

Corbin Blackwell glares at the orc,'I know not what you speak of, vermin. Your kind isn't worthy of our attention. Kill me now and reunite me with the heroes who have gone before me. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Guard! Get me my tools. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'This is your last chance pitiful scum, when is the attack on Ry`gorr Keep planned? <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'Listen carefully vile beast, if there were an attack planned there would be nothing you and your pitiful clan of inbred halfwits could do about it. If and when the Dain attacks, you and your kind will be no more. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Well see about that, the Dain will have a little surprise should he decide to invade our lands. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Your stubbornness is only going to make things worse for you. Now, we know the Dain is planning an attack on Ry`gorr Keep. When is this to be? <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell spits in the face of his captor and says, 'Kill me now and get it over with, stupid beast! I'll tell you nothing! <br />

Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Suit yourself tinyman, we can do this the hard way if you insist. <br />

<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'You mean to tell me you don't have the key to unshackle me? Wonderful... I'm being rescued by a half-wit! I am stuck here until you find a way to unlock my restraints. <br />
<br />
<b>The key is carried by a named frost giant named Warden Bruke.  He spawns in one of the stone structures in the prison camp.  His placeholder is 'Kromrif Prison Guard'.  The spawntime on this placeholder is 6 minutes.  Just keep killing the PH til Warden Bruke spawns.  He is 100% immune to magic so snare/root/slow won't stick on him.  He is able to be hit with fire based spells.  When he is aggro'd anywhere from 2 to 13 'Kromrif Guard' mobs will spawn and run into the stone structure.  He has a lot of HPs and hits for 130 max.  When he dies there will be a key and a Frost Giant Femur on the corpse.</b><br />

Corbin Blackwell says 'Uh oh, looks like they were tipped off somehow... I hope you can handle them. <br />

<b>At this point Commander Bahreck, 2 Kromriff Soldiers and 5 Ry`Gorr Bashers spawn.  The bashers come in from all 4 sides and 2 soldiers come from one side and the Commander from another.  You need to aggro them all and get them away from Corbin.  Having a snarer for this stage is pretty handy.  At level 60 trying to get these mobs aggro'd on you is pretty tough.  It's probably a good idea to have a level 55 or so warrior to aggro all the mobs then have someone pick them off him with snare.</b><br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'Good work friend! The Dain will hear of this right away. We couldn't have defeated the Ry'gorr  without your help. Take this <font color="red">ring</font> as proof that you have served the Coldain well. You may wish to show it to the Seneschal should you ever stop in our fine city. Farewell, Chromite , it has been my pleasure knowing you. <br />
Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br />
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br />
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br />
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
<br />
<b>You are awarded the Velium Coldain Insignia Ring.</b><br />

<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Nine of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
<b>Head into Thurgadin and then go to Icewell Keep.  Find Seneschal Aldikar and hand him your <font color="red">ring</font>.  He was dubious to me but I snuck behind him to get him to indifferent just to be safe.</b><br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Well done, Chromite , I have heard of your victory over the Ry`Gorr. If you are willing to assist the crown further please follow me. <br />
<br />
<b>Seneschal Aldikar walks to a room and waits there.  Shut the door and listen to him.</b><br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Please, shut the door behind you. What I am about to share with you must not be overheard. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'My army stands prepared to launch an assault on Kael itself, but one task must be completed before this can happen. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'It seems Rodrick was not alone in his treachery. There is a faction of Coldain who believe that a treaty should be signed with the Kromrif, ending our hostilities with them. This, of course, is impossible. If there is one thing our history here has taught us it is that the Kromrif simply cannot be trusted. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'These traitors are poisoning the minds of our citizens, promising great rewards to those who will betray the Dain. It will take the unbiased eye of an outlander to flush out the masterminds behind this plan. Once again we turn to you. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Will you accept this task outlander? <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will accept this task'<br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'In this box, place the accursed dirk of the fallen Rodrick. With it combine the heads of every traitor you dispose of. When this is done give the box and the velium insignia <font color="red">ring</font> to the Dain directly. On behalf of the crown and all good Coldain, I thank you ... May Brell be with you. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Farewell. <br />
<br />
<b>You are given a 6 slot container to put the Dirk of the Traitor and 5 heads in:</b><br />

<br />
<b>Now you head to the Great Divide.  There is a tunnel at -5500, 3500.  Inside that tunnel are several dwarves that con dubiously to me.  When killed they give no faction hits at all.  Wait around for a while and Murdrick Tardok will spawn.  Alternately, you can just kill Davin Fatfist and Murdrick will spawn soon after Davin respawns.  You'll need to kill Murdrick to get his plan and his head so as soon as he spawns you need to pull him out and do damage to him.  I've found that harmony doesn't really work too well in this encounter but if you can manage to pull Murdrick out with none of the female dwarves aggroing, you can snare all the other dwarves and just kite Murdrick away to be killed by your group.  You must kill Murdrick fast otherwise he will despawn.</b><br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'Good day my friends, it is good to see you all are alive and well. <br />
<br />
Davin Fatfist says 'Well, we are alive, but I'd hardly say we're well... We have heard of the death of Rodrick, and the Dain is calling on all citizens of Thurgadin to flush out any opposition to the throne. If we're tied to your dealings with the Kromrif we'll be sent to the bottom of the well for sure. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'The Dain knows nothing, and I have a plan to keep it that way. I have given the matter much thought, and I have gathered you all here to ask for your help. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin says 'We all saw what happened when Rodrick agreed to help you. I, for one, am none too eager to take on these new friends of the Dain. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'Rodrick knew what he was getting into, and so did you. It's a bit too late for second thoughts. I don't recall seeing any hesitation when the loot was being passed around. <br />
<br />
Lapker Geynion says 'Go ahead Murdrick, what's this plan of yours? <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'As I said I've thought long and hard of our situation and I feel  we are indeed in danger. My cousin Berradin is a captain in the Dain's army. I've always been uneasy about him, but now more than ever. He could easily betray many of us and take credit for destroying the rebellion. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'My plan is to poison him and plant a suicide note on the body, a note in which he would take full responsibility for the actions of the rebels. This would both ensure that he could never betray us and would give the Dain closure. We will be free to continue working with our Kromrif friends without fear of discovery. <br />
<br />
Davin Fatfist says 'Sounds good boss, but how do you plan on poisoning him? <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'Berradin has a weakness for drink, one drink in particular... Avalanche Ale. I have had the recipe altered slightly to include a deadly poison. I have much to do, I need one of you to brew the drink and bring it to me. I'll handle the rest. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin  chuckles, 'Once again, Murdrick, you've put us at ease in the middle of a treacherous predicament. I will volunteer to brew the drink. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok smiles, 'Very well, take this recipe and follow it exactly. It won't be easy, but you'll be richly rewarded for your efforts I assure you. Send word to meet me back here when you are finished. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin says 'Consider it done. Be sure to watch yourself Murd, the Dain's gotta be suspicious of ya, being Rodrick's brother and all. And those outlander friends of his are dangerous, chopped down the Ry`Gorr chief like he was nothin! <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'I must be off, be well friends. I will send word when we are to meet again. Until that day, be strong! Together we will overcome any obstacles! <br />
<br />
<b>When Murdrick is slain he has the following on his corpse:</b><br />

<br />
<b>Captain Berradin is in a hut in Eastern Wastes.  He is surrounded by 4 or 5 bodyguards that all con blue to a level 60.  The captain cons green to level 60.  When attacked, the captain shouts.</b><br />
<br />
Captain Berradin shouts 'Yer messin with the wrong Coldain, prepare ta meet yer ancestors! <br />
<br />
<b>There is also a new and very suspicious looking dwarf in the giant fort in Eastern Wastes.  She casts invisibility so make sure you have see invis.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Peffin Ambersnow'<br />
<br />
Peffin Ambersnow gasps in astonishment, 'Oh, I uh... err, hello there. Umm, thank Brelll you're here, those bloody Kromrif were going to torture me! Yes, yes, and you've saved me! How can I ever repay you? <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is murdrick?'<br />
<br />
Peffin Ambersnow looks away and stammers, 'Ehh, ahh, Mur who? <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is captain berradin'<br />
<br />
Peffin Ambersnow goes even paler than usual, 'Hmm, Berradin you say? Sorry, but I've never even heard the name.</font></p>

<br />
I have been following this over on the Safehouse as well, this is as up-to-date as the thread there was when last I read it. They were still working out the ingrediants for the tainted ale as there seemed to be some contention as to the seashell component.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there is some question as to who gets the brew once it's made. As well as the seemingly HIGH levels of skill needed to make the components, Mind Melt particularly.</font></p>

<br />
you say:<br />
<br />
After about 15 seconds Dobbin Crossaxe will respawn and tell you to hand in your Mithril Coldain Insignia <font color="red">Ring</font>. Do NOT hand it in until he says this! And don't waste time handing it in after he says it, either  <br />
<br />
.........<br />
<br />
do you get the note for the 7th <font color="red">ring</font> still? so that would mean you have <font color="red">ring</font> 6 and then get note for <font color="red">ring</font> 7?<br />
<br />
<br />
so when you hand in note and get <font color="red">ring</font> 7, you will also have <font color="red">ring</font> 6?</font></p>

<b>i kinda have a question to chromite:<br />
<br />
you say:<br />
<br />
After about 15 seconds Dobbin Crossaxe will respawn and tell you to hand in your Mithril Coldain Insignia <font color="red">Ring</font>. Do NOT hand it in until he says this! And don't waste time handing it in after he says it, either  <br />
<br />
.........<br />
<br />
do you get the note for the 7th <font color="red">ring</font> still? so that would mean you have <font color="red">ring</font> 6 and then get note for <font color="red">ring</font> 7?<br />
<br />
<br />
so when you hand in note and get <font color="red">ring</font> 7, you will also have <font color="red">ring</font> 6? </b><hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
When you hand in your <font color="red">ring</font> to Dobbin he does NOT give the <font color="red">ring</font> back.  Instead he gives you the note.  Then you take the note to Garadain and he gives you the 7th <font color="red">ring</font>.<br />
<br />
I'll see about updating that portion of the <font color="red">quest</font> to be more clear.  Thanks for pointing it out.</font></p>

Note that someone with 195 brewing failed on the combine of the tainted ale.  He might have been unlucky, or this might indicate that the ale is extremely difficult to make.  Since nobody has come forward with a successful combine, the trivial level of the ale is unknown.<br />
<br />
Also, in one of the final fights for <font color="red">ring</font> 8, Firbrand spawned with 2 Dark Embers, which he dual-wielded.  Made him a bit tougher than usual.  Also, I've seen Rodrick dual wielding as well, exercise caution.<br />

Just a note on Peffin Ambersnow.<br />
<br />
I saw her, and thinking she was one of the traitors, pulled her out of the giant camp to try and solo her.<br />
<br />
She hits for 137 max, has a ton of hps (parsed 8k melee damage, none of the non-melee from thorns or spells showed up), did around 5.5k damage to me, even with her being slowed most of the fight from the Earthcaller, and dropped nothing -- just a few plat.  I was hoping for a No Drop head...<br />
<br />
No faction hit either.<br />
<br />
Either her head is a random drop, or there's some actual conversation/questing that goes along with her.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just something I did today, and I remembered you mentioned her in your write-up.  Heck, gotta try to solo these Velious blues every now and then. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

One question, has anyone tried giving Murdrick's plan to Berradin? It doesn't make sense for us to be poisoning him; perhaps giving him the plan would make him rat out his buddies and give clues to obtaining more heads? (Can't try it myself; was a hair too late pulling the last giant; damn dorf got himself killed.  Now I have to wait for another person to do the war so I can turn in Rygorr's head...)</font></p>

<br />
As for step 9: The note (Murdrick's Plan) has been given to Captain Berradin, Peffin Ambersnow, and the guy who volunteers to brew the drink; all with no results. Berradin is one of the traitors, I think - how else would he know enough about them to betray them?<br />
<br />
No dwarves other than Murdrick drop anything of interest (heads in particular) when killed. The assuption is that they have to be respawned. The bottleneck is the damned ale.<br />
<br />
The poison is not trivial for a rogue at 250 poison making skill. Annoying, but we can overcome that.<br />
The runed seashell (clouding) is a rare drop off of sirens in Sirens Grotto and only in Sirens Grotto. The ones in Cobalt Scars never seem to drop it. SG is populated by closely packed 51+ mobs, some that are fully MR (i.e. no snare, mez, slow), bad pathing, and very few players (on E'ci, at least). Very hard to get a shell.<br />
<br />
If you manage to get a shell, the brew is a royal bitch. No reported trivial yet (or success, for that matter, though it's not that unlikley that someone's done it and just isn't sharing). Failures have been reported at 195 and 198 brewing skill. Narsty.<br />
<br />
I have to assume that it's a brewing skill check, as it's put in a brew barrel. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Also, one of the components of the ale (ice wyvern stinger) is no drop. Not all that hard to get though. Still no idea on whether the combined ale is no drop or not.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a note and wants to give it to the Grand Historian in ThurgA, I'd be amused to see if he says anything, though I wouldn't expect too much.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the most amusing Rodrick I've seen had 2 daggers (Dirk and velium) and 2 heads (traitor's head and coldain head) <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />
<br />
GL to all... it's a VERY fun <font color="red">quest</font>, outside of the competition and farming. Been trying to get <font color="red">ring</font> 8 for weeks now.<br />

<br />
Mind Melt poison is not trivial at Poison 225.. and it can take several hours to collect enough components to attempt several combines at once, if you can find a rogue who has bothered to move their skill up that high. <br />
<br />
The Ale does not appear to be trivial at brewing 200 as nobody has yet posted a succsesful combine despite many brewers with skills in the 190s trying. Anyone who has been practicing brewing knows how hard it is to get skill up that high. Shame I wasted my one shell when i tried at skill in the 120's... sigh. <br />
<br />
The Shell(clouding) is damm rare. 10 hours hunting in SG pulling Sirens did not yield a single shell. <br />
<br />
The hope is that either the final brew is not NO DROP ( but i would be surprised ) or that the step where you hand it to Berradin can be split quested. Otherwise every single person doing this <font color="red">quest</font> will need to become a Grandmaster Brewer.</font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Just a comment on step 5.  <br />
<br />
I did this yesterday and a lot more then 5 orcs spawned.  I brought an enchanter, druid, and another ranger (levels 59-60), figuring we could handle this easily, since the enchanter can mez 5 mobs no problem.<br />
<br />
It was more like 10 mobs, but I didn't get an exact count.<br />
<br />
We still did it alright, killed and looted Scarbrow, and then we ported away (leaving our dwarf friends to be slaughtered by the rest of them, sorry guys!).  We could easily have just run away instead of porting (Ranger Gate = run away!), but my friends aren't too familiar with EW so gating out was safer for them.  Heck we probably could have killed them all, but I think my friends got nervous about how fast my health went down (hadn't warned them about the HT).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the best way to handle this is probably Harmony,.  Try to stop them from attacking and then just pull out the one you want.<br />
<br />
Harmony is a useful tactic for many steps in this <font color="red">quest</font>, but the exact way to use it isn't obvious until after you've already done it once or twice ;-P<br />
<br />
Right now I'm on step 7, planning to ask the advice of friends who have done this step, about the best tactic.<br />
<br />
- Reandn<br />
<br />
P.S. Great Walkthrough!</font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Actually, the best way to handle Scarbrow is to park someone on his spawn point (next to one of the trees down the hill and west of the dorfs, I forget which one exactly unless I'm there looking at it).  The other mobs don't pop right away, and if you aggro him immediately and keep him from running up the hill, none of them will spawn <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  Spent an easy evening collecting Frozen Orbs that way.<br />
<br />
I did step 7 with just the help of my cleric to heal me during the fight with Bruke.  I used my longest-range bow and arrow to pull him and got him without the other giants aggroing me, but it'd probably be safer to pull him from behind or to the side (assuming you can hit him through the wall, haven't tried)...the giants spawn outside the front of his building and run towards him; if you can aggro him from behind and back up immediately, you ought to be able to get out of their aggro range before they get to him.  Anyway, killed him, went to Corbin...didn't have to kill the orcs/giants there, someone else was doing it...buffed up and parked my cleric safely out of the way and triggered Corbin.  Followed along, and aggroed everything I could when the mobs attacked him.  I got all the giants and most of the orcs, Corbin managed to survive the other orcs.  Snared all the stuff chasing me, kited some of it past the dorfs to kill it, and ended up with a couple of mobs I let chase me around while Corbin beat them up from behind...Dorf Pet! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

Ya ya ya.. I know it's solved :-P  I don't like to use other peoples' info/logs though.  I use my own. I  Had someone take stuff from my ranger epic walkthrough a long time back and it kinda irritated me so I don't wanna do that to anyone else.<br />

I'm trying to get the shell from Siren's Grotto still.. am just stuck there.</font></p>

They only drop off the high level sirens so there are not many MOBs to choose from especially if you are doing it with a small group. Larger raids can pull more of them per cycle though. <br />

Got the dirk, murdricks head and sitting at brewing 225 at the moment standing by to make the poison. Just a couple of thousand mouse clicks to go. <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">i had the same problem, but then after a patch, i went in, and waited 10 minutes for him.<br />
<br />
The next couple of days i saw him regularly, but then again he was gone.<br />
<br />
So all i can say, safe yourself some time, place your char in the area, right before a server patch, then get on as soon as the patch is done.<br />
<br />
<br />
kinada sad you have to do it this way, but oh well it works.<br />
<br />
btw i spent 5 hours a day for a full week waiting for him, and about 20 hours in a weekend, no sign of him what so ever, even petitioned it. they didnt do anything, but the same day i gave up on it, i found out they patched the next day <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Well I got lucky with the Messenger.  I camped out on the ridge in line with the gate to the fort and when I logged on last night I saw the Messenger making his run into the fort.  I got nervous, but I was able to target him and put an arrow straight into his back!  Luckily I didn't have my Idol on...hehe<br />
<br />
On another note, we triggered the giants with Tain Hammerfrrost, but instead of killing them all we snared each of the frost giants to get Ghrek alone.  After he was dead, we went back to where Tain was but he was gone.<br />
<br />
I searched for him for about an hour or so and no sign.  Do the giants really kill him?  Now that I have the Elixir, do I have to trigger the giants again and run them away from Tain so I can hand in the Elixir to the right one or is he the same spawn regardless?</font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>Just before you get to the camp Icefang stops and sniffs at the ground and growls. At this time Poxbreath Yellowfang spawns beside the campfire at the orc camp. You don't need to wait for Icefang to get there to engage him. I recommend that you clear the orc camp before handing in your <font color="red">ring</font> to Korrigain so the camp is clear and Icefang doesn't get killed.<br />
<br />
*** NOTE *** The above has changed slightly. Now 3 oracles of Ry`Gorr spawn along with Poxbreath. A level 55 monk and level 60 ranger were able to take them out with no problem. Poxbreath and the oracles all conned blue to a level 60.  <hr></blockquote> <br />
<br />
I tried this last night and it didn't quite work as intended.  Main group was at orc camp and I had them clear it before I handing in the <font color="red">ring</font>.  When I turned in the <font color="red">ring</font>, Icefang got buffed and took off towards the bridge, but then started getting whacky.<br />
<br />
He ran around for a while, sort of lost.  He even went for a swim in the ocean.  He poofed and ported back near Kael.  I was tracking him the whole time.  He did this twice (10 minutes or more) before I decided to aggro him and "lead" him to the camp.  I rooted him and camped.  Still no Poxbreath. <br />
<br />
When I logged on again root broke and he took off away from the bridge AGAIN (mind you, no orcs at camp).  About half way to the Orc Fort, he turns and heads for the bridge camp because some orcs had just spawned.  I told the group to leave them up.  As we approached, THEN Poxbreath and Co. spawned.<br />
<br />
I assume Icefang was confused because there weren't any orcs up. We wiped them all out and finished that step, but only after a lot of needless running around.</font></p>
