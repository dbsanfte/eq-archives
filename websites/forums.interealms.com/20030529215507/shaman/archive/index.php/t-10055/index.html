<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My only real problem with shaman DoT's is that you cannot land them on many if any raid level mobs.  Most shaman, as far as I can tell, go in and Malo, Slow, Cripple, etc... and then just sit and watch the fight. They might heal a little bit but there isn't much else to do. DoT's would be great for additional DPS and I know that I would at least feel that I had more to do with the fight. Maybe this would be over powering. Maybe I'm just crazy. I can't for the life of me understand why NToV dragons, most Ssra mobs (The Creator is easily DoT'd), etc... have insane PR/DR. <br />
<br />
Please feel free to comment even if it's to call me a friggin retarded newb ebayer! But if you do that pls leave your home address so I can come fire bomb your house. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dots land on most things in NToV.<br />
Dots land on most things in PoP.<br />
Dots land on most things in Ssra.<br />
Dots land on most things in VT.<br />
Dots can't land on everything, everywhere though.<br />
For those, help heal rampage tanks, and throw extra heals on the main tank.<br />
What kinds of targets are you hitting that you can't dot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess I just have really bad luck. I have yet land a single DoT on Arch Lich, or High Priest, or Aaryonar, or Feshlak. Haven't tried many boss mobs in PoP. And I am talking about boss mobs, not just the yard trash.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do heal when needed. There just isn't much of a need for shaman heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the last 'raid' mob I bothered dotting was the construct of nightmares in the hedgemaze (High hps, zero damage output), otherwise I'll always be found healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can land Blood of Saryn on almost everything I fight. Ultor if that's resisted; and nuke if that doesn't take.<br />
<br />
That's assuming you've got the time on your hands to do damage, which is rarely. I'm usually slow/cripple/dead and that occupies most of my time.<br />
<br />
Also assumes we're not screwing around on a gimp mob and I'm the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aaryonar - just slow and spot heal stupid!  You shouldn't be out in the AE possibly getting mana hosed when you might be needed to reslow!  <br />
<br />
Arch Lich - curse = bad,  stay out of AE and spot heal people who need it.  There will be lots of people who do.  <br />
<br />
Feshlak is pretty resistant to anything.  Whatever, just sit back and enjoy the show.  Can't land spells on every boss mob.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with DoTs is the poison counter aggro.  Since the disease counter aggro has been removed, those work just fine on fights where they can be used.  <br />
<br />
I think the fight that makes shamans shine the MOST with respect to DoT damage is the Cursed fight.  Cursed has a nasty AE that's uber hard to resist.  So ppl stay back and shoot at it and nukers nuke while a couple of tanks stay in there and get healed.  This leaves a mob with a lot of hps that are going down rather slowly.  Enter the shaman.  I kept 4 DoTs on Cursed the last 3 fights almost the entire fight.  I'm sure that helped.  I alone could tally up almost 50k dmg.  Tell me that's not significant!  <br />
<br />
I am liking the new cold nuke and poison rain.  <br />
<br />
I nuked Trakanon 3 times tonight with it woot!  He, on the other hand, couldn't scratch me.   Boy if that isn't a fight that's been trivialized by PoP!  Was ridiculous how easy he was to down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High priest is really easy to dot.. everything land on him, the only problem is not getting aggro / summoned and smaked down =)<br />
<br />
on PoP encounter, using dot is hard..  A lot of mob have something to make MT lose aggro (slow proc/shadow step/ etc..) and without a good aggro, doting is suicide.<br />
<br />
For the record, it's kinda fun to make a transfusion to death to Saryrn with her Blood :p<br />
Also, Berty is kinda resistant to disease hehe but fight is too fast to worth casting a dot =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When we did HP I did pox, bane and epic. Had very few resists. We used to average 4 to 6 shamans on our SSRA raids and our dots did a lot of damage ;)<br />
<br />
In PoP I find a lot of stuff resistant to our DoTs.. sigh!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What I want to know is why are you trying to dot mobs anyways? there's always someone to heal, and healing a rogue or a monk for 1500hps (tnarg's+healingIV) will add more DPS than pox I'd say anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turbosilk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are getting that many resists you are probably hitting the 20 spell cap limit on a mob.<br />
<br />
Most fights if done properly result in MT and/or whoever has rampage taking all the damage.  Of course you'd want to do some damage instead of sitting around.<br />
<br />
DD is the way to go tho.<br />
-Much less taunt.<br />
-No worry about the 20 spell cap limit on a mob.<br />
-More dps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i find that i almost never have the spell slots for damage /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You hafta be uber like me and then it'll be ez!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On most luclin ubers, especially ssra and VT, using DoTs is recommended. On most  VT mobs I end up doing 40-50k--remember, every point of damage you do shortens the time you have to stand there and be bored.<br />
<br />
Faster kills = less chance of people nodding off = less chance for mistakes = shorter raids in mind numbing zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For a good time, I suggest hitting an aten blob with every poison dot you have.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I often find that I can get in a lot more heals on people before being summoned than I can if I both heal and DOT.  Or DD -- but aggro tends to be  much less a problem when I DD.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have a moment or two when I feel I am not maximizing my mana, and looking around for the guy lacking hitpoints can occasionally be frustrating in a big crowd, especially if he moves and I have to start typing /target or get another look at him to target him.<br />
<br />
But maximizing my mana use is sometimes less important than being able to continue healing if all hell breaks loose and it becomes a struggle not to wipe or to reacquire aggro before all hell breaks loose.  In those tough times, not having built up aggro from DOTs can be pretty valuable, because all it takes a lot of times is a heal or two at just the right time to turn the whole situation around; it almost never works out that there's anything I can do with DOTs that has anywhere near the utility of that.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I do DOT, but often I'm either flat out too busy healing everyone in sight to save the druids and clerics mana(I'm used to being in guilds short of clerics), or trying to keep aggro low, or just using my DD's instead, small though they are.  <br />
<br />
Torrent, though can add up pretty darn quick.  Oh, I critted for 1021 on ice strike with the first level of spell casting fury and raintraveller's overcloak the other day, was kinda cool.  I'm not hating our DD's super much in raid situations.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHAH OMG Jenamdar !!! You Evil )<br />
<br />
I did it once for fun )<br />
I stacked Bane, ancient scourge and blood..<br />
Nice dps for the 84 firs sec.. after that Blamm !!<br />
Aten blob says :&quot;you will not evade me you st00pid doting shaman!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Those blob hit hard lol....<br />
<br />
And to reply to the person that was asking why doting and not healing.. <br />
When rampage does 4K+ per swing of rampage, I don't heal the dead monk corpse that was f00l enough to not FD =)</div></div><hr />
