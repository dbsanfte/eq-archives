<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gulu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This is happening on Rallos Zek as well, but by the time trader was found naked at bind all there was was a screen of &quot;You are hungry, you are thirsty, etc&quot; and a corpse on top of the wizard tower in Cazic Thule.   :mad:</div></div><hr />

Here is the thread the quote is on Graffes Thread (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=11546&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=2)  and here is what he said on the thread:<br />
I've looked at those pics. Looks to me like an emulator. I've never heard any NPC shout &quot;LOL&quot; for as long as I've been playing...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Simple fix.<br />
Replace your current vendor with a level 1 vendor.<br />
Now you cant be PKed and looted.<br />
<br />
At least on Rallos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's the point here.  The point is that new hacks are appearing almost daily and that the integrity of the game is badly compromised right now.  This stuff is cropping up faster than SOE could reasonably be expected to deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">its a snowball effect.. before there was a (fairly) small group of hackers, who kept to themselves and rarely abused it.. now people are abusing it, other people see that its easy to do and go looking for hacks themselves.. with that comes more people who can make new hacks.. now you have thousands more people then before who have no self control working at new hacks to fool sony</div></div><hr />

On a whim, I decided to investigate. It took me a whopping 10 minutes of searching to come across every single tool they are using, and DOZENS of articles describing how to use them.<br />
<br />
Now any idiot with a hex converter can be a script kiddie. The end is upon us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Toggil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">on sullon even if you are level one unless you are in a newb zone you are pvp active</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yeah its possible to loot even a lvl1 in the right zone but it would take a lvl 6 or lower to do it.<br />
<br />
and yeah this is really about rampant hacks, sony can **** off if they think I am going to play a game where raid loots get ganked from places like tactics by lvl1 alts...yeah unflagged and to low to even be there at all looting raid mobs from the zone in. <br />
