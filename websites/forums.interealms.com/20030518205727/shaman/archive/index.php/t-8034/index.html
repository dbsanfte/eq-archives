<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Giladari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The main is a 63 cleric.  Gil has gotten a bunch of her cast offs and had most of the rest of her gear made by the cleric working on tailoring skill ups.<br />
<br />
Wis, I think, is pretty good for 51, but since most of the gear was cleric oriented I'm not sure how the other stats are.  I'm thinking AC and Charisma might be a little low? I have a barbed rubicite bracer that I can steal off my ranger is that would be an improvement or can spend probably up to 10K total in the bazaar to hone her gear.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear is pretty good, but as you did have  alot more wis then you need :)<br />
<br />
For rings: Shadel Bandit and a 6/65 ring will be good<br />
<br />
For Back:  Ancient Seahorse hide Cloak, or Hiero/Lodi if you have cash<br />
<br />
For Chest: Fungi/Iksar BP.  Sell the current one to help finance if you need too.  Regen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wis, and losing 20 wis hardly hurts your mana pool anyway.<br />
<br />
For Wrist:  Jaundiced Bone Bracer, or Coldain Military wristgaurd.  Bracelet of Beauty is crap for shamans, get rid of it.  JBB is a huuuuuge asset for us shamans, and if thats out of your price range(14-20k on Saryrn), then do the Coldain Military Wristgaurd quest.  Takes an hour, and has extended Affliction 3, which is really nice.<br />
<br />
For Arms:  Barbed Ringmail are good.<br />
<br />
Your head piece is ok i guess, but I'd suggest getting a thurg piece if you can.  Its much better.<br />
<br />
For Face:  Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
<br />
For Feet:  Tribal War Boots<br />
<br />
Legs:  Get something with more AC.  Shaman legs are hard to upgrade, as theres a huge gap from Jarsath quality, to 20k legs.  SS gear is great if it ever drops.</div></div><hr />
