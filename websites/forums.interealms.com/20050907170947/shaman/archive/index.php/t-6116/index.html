<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all- Anyone else having this problem? I have a Iksar shaman that looks like crap visually! Anything I wear it all looks brownish/orangey color and I have tried 3 different video cards all approved by Verant ( currently using a Radeon 8500 ) . The wierd thing is the day after the Patch ( most recently ) I was hunting in UP and lo and behold my Armor looked tight- it loked really cool, the next day I played it was back to crap look :( any  ideas or suggestions? Thanks for your time reading this.</div></div><hr />
