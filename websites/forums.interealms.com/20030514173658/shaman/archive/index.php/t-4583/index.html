<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay so I've been hitting ST with my guild recently , we usually have bout 10 folks and we get up usually early morning and nail the 3 named. Well 4am this morning the Master of the Guard droped prismatic dragon scales and I was the lucky recipient of them. They changed the quest with the prismatic scales so now theres a turn in npc right outside ST in EW, and to get the reward he doesn't require a ST key , just wants the scales. So anyhow I am having a hard time deciding what piece I should use. The 2 items I'm stuck on are Essence Lense 15ac 75hps mana 15sv all range slot (Spell Haste 3), and Essence Pearl 10sta 10int 10wis 65hps 7sv all ear slot. I have Earing of Cleansing and a Solistice earing , and right now I am using Benevolence Talisman in my range slot. So I'm looking for some suggestions on which piece I should use use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How can I say this in a way as to not hurt your feelings Fenweir?  ST is NOT a pickup group zone.  If you want to get fistwraps for your monk, or better yet even see the inside of ST, first of all he better be your main.  Second he needs to be in a fairly strong guild, able to take down first brood dragons.  Then when you have 15 to 20 of you with keys you can start to go in and kill stuff.  Then after you kill there for weeks and weeks if not months, maybe you will get a primal hammer to drop and possibly be awarded this item to turn in for your handwraps. <br />
<br />
If you knew how many monks who already had keys were waiting for that hammer to fall, you would not even ask such a silly question.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">75hp, 15ac, 15sv all and spell haste 3 on a range item sounds pretty damn nifty to me, I hate losing HP to wear mage rings. If you're getting aexp to reduce the casting time on buff type spells then you need to evaluate the usefulness of this effect, combined with the fact that affliction haste seems to be having a similar effect on some spells - likely to have an item with this on anytime soon?<br />
<br />
Earring is a nice HP add what with the sta, as a Barb you will eventually be hitting a buffed stamina cap if you continue to upgrade items.<br />
<br />
Presumably you can cycle your reward at a later date so can live with the earring for a while to see how you like it.</div></div><hr />
