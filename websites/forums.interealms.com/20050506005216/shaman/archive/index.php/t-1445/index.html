<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh today I found myself in Qeynos Hills. The zone was full of people that were really new to the game. <br />
<br />
I quietly summoned a pet, and bearformed myself.. buffed the tar out of us, and made a hotkey!   Line1: /roar   line2: Leave these lands, the animals are taking back what is rightfully ours!<br />
<br />
and then ran around and killed everything!! I found that if it was easy for me and my pet to kill most everything straight melee (should be its a newb zone) and for the tough stuff (guards and such) I could slow them, then straight melee, using my hotkey every once in awhile... (I tried not to use spells as I figured it would be easier for people to figure out)<br />
<br />
Anyway I ran around killing everything but wildlife (bears, wolves, rats, snakes, bats) and all else died to me and my pet! The only hard ones were the pally that runs around (cause he hits hard,and loh + heals himself was a close fight but thats ok) and Guard Nash and Leopold (cause they are very high MR and I know from past experiance I can't land anything on them and they hit 100+) <br />
<br />
anyway, eventually a higher than me lvl druid came in and tried snaring me twice.. then stood there for a minute while i finished off chanda miller, and sent a tell &quot;ROFL!!!&quot; then he gated out.<br />
<br />
Was fun hearing the newbies shout about &quot;Watch out for the named bear!! HE&quot;LL KILL YOU!&quot; and  &quot;Where's the bear at now!?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Was definatly a fun day in Q Hills today! :)<br />
<br />
Just wish Pyjzin or Hadden would have spawned while I was there...<br />
<br />
did this at lvl 42 btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice!<br />
<br />
Get any good screenshots?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got a few screenshots, but the place I used to put pictures up with (Homestead) won't let me edit my site anymore :( It always freezes up when I try.. I'll try and fiddle around with it some...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Always love to hear tales of people taking roleplaying to some decent levels. :)<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha pretty good, but still that shaman that posed as a rog in KC has got to be one of the funniest ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I should have my Rogue-monk story done soon :)  it involves a (non existant) iksar hide mask, a piercing and slashing weapon, and some bone arm/legplates :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No matter what anyone else does, the funniest thing I have seen so far is when a necromancer summons his Spectre Pet and transforms himself into a Spectre then goes running around in oasis.<br />
<br />
Never seen lower levels scatter so fast.<br />
<br />
One Necro in particular does this and goes underwater to the docks and then pops right out on top of the people there... they never see him coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im working on my own &quot;rogue-story&quot; but giving it a bit of a warrior touch with my Frost Giant femur.. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think this is cool just because it shows there are still people new to the game. Ahh, fresh blood :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One funny thing I did with my character was a prank I did on my guildmates in Everfrost. I walked up to a Mammoth and cast Befriend Animal. I then ran to the Mammoth ramp screaming for help. All my guildmates jumped up to help but none of them were able to help me. I would stop once in a while and cast Canni to make it look like I was getting damaged. The guild channel was filled with messages like &quot;...I'm bugged, can't hit it!&quot; and &quot;Stop running so I can root it or heal you&quot;. When the charm would break, I would let guild get the mob down to half hit points, I re-charm it and start running around again. The best part was that nobody in the guild caught on and we all had a great laugh when I informed everybody in what I've done.</div></div><hr />
