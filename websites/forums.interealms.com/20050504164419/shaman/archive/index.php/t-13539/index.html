<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey gang! I am curious about cazic-thule and was wondering if I could get some info on it. I duel box a 58 monk with 20aa and a 58 shaman. I am curious on what I can kill in the zone to make some phat plat. I can kill all the entrance mobs with no problem and can kill 2 at once if I need to. I can duo the 2 in PoD NCY and SCY to give you an idea of what I can take. I have been reading on eqatlas but it doesnt really say where all the phat lootz are at. Also you guys think I can take the slime area where the boots of flowing slime drop? If any of you know what I can farm and tell me what area the items drops I would be really happy! Got both of their magels below. Any info would be great.<br />
