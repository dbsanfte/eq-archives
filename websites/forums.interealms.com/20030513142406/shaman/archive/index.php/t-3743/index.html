<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a long time lurker of this board i would like to thank everyone for all the excellent tips and advice that i found here.<br />
<br />
I recently completed my shaman epic quest at level 58/59 on 07/18/02 mainly because of all the great tips, strategies, and advice that i read on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Gloriana for all the great information, <br />
(I especialy enjoyed all the tips on CoM and killing Rak'ashiir)<br />
and to everyone else who took the time to post an answer to a players question.<br />
<br />
If i ever had any questions about Tactics, Gear Selection, Epic Quest, Alchemy, Spells or the current nerf on patch day... There was a pretty good chance it had already been asked here and i found it using the search feature or by just reading through alot of posts. <br />
 <br />
Often the answers that you post here will help out alot of other players who like to just lurk and browse these forums. <br />
<br />
So, i would like to send a big thank you out to everyone who bothers to take the the time to contribute, you should feel secure in the knowledge that your advice has helped at least one lost shaman finish his epic. /cheer  <br />

<br />
Well... Im pretty sure my guild would not appreciate my doing a tear MQ at this time. Since we currently have members who are still in need of a childs tear, its a pretty safe bet that i can not help you in that way. However, i can tell you what i did to obtain my Iksar Childs tear. <br />
<br />
Go to the Fear plane, go ALOT. Go to Fear some more, with friends, pickup raids, or guildraids whenever you can. Then go some more still, and hope the named are up. When the named are eventualy up and you take down all the golems realize that only 2 of the 3 Golems can spawn an Iksar Broodling. Warn the kill happy melees ahead of time not to kill the Iksar Broodling just because.<br />
<br />
(This actualy happened on one raid that i was on, during a bad pull that happened while there were 7+ mobs in camp and in comes one of the named Golems, a melee killed the Iksar Broodling that popped after the golem death with alot of dead players around, and the tear rotted while the Shaman were being rezzed - pickup raids, just say no) <br />
<br />
Wait for a few other Shaman in front of you to get their tears as well. After a bit of this, through either blind luck or sheer perseverence and determination you will eventualy receive your tear, probably much sooner than me too, unless you happen to be extremely unlucky.<br />
<br />
Eventualy i learned to check the rotation calender after making a handfull of trips to Fear and finding out that none of the named were up once it was broken.<br />

That should help give you a better idea who is doing Fear, and when. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iscadia Starhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frankly, my problem isn't the Tear.  As you've pointed out, it's mostly just a matter of patience, persistence, and attending as many raids to Fear as you can.  MY problem is that I can't get people interested in going into the Hole.  <br />
<br />
There are plenty of people that dabble at the front of the Hole...and maybe go down to the front part of the city.  But the impression I get is NOBODY wants to struggle all the way down there &quot;just&quot; for Kirn.  Even though the Ghost of Kindle (a chanter epic mob) spawns right in the same building in the next room over, I've been somewhat underwhelmed by the number of people who wish to go along with me.  ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, that's been MY impression.  I know that I could get around Kirn by redoing the Shield of Woe about a zillion times, but for roleplaying reasons I'd rather do it the right way.  Of course, I've waited this long...a few more months isn't going to kill me.<br />
