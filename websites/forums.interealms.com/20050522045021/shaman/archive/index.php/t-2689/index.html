<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
How many of you would like to see the following additional forums:<br />
<br />
Equipment (discussion, recommendations, upgrade choices, etc.)<br />
<br />
Epic  (discussion, faction, problems, advice, etc.)<br />
<br />
Your thoughts?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMHO... If there is an equipment forum, no one will read it.<br />
<br />
If no one reads it, people will post their equipment questions in the general forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Bigguss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree with Bigguss<br />
<br />
This has been said many times before, everyone is fine the way things are.<br />
<br />
If you dont like the equipement threades in the general forums ( I know some people complaine about them ) just simply ignore them. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No one would use these &quot;extra&quot; forums because all the traffic is through General and John_Q_Newbie_Shaman would get impatient when thier question is not answered within minutes.  at least IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There would need to be some more moderators to move threads and enforce proper use.  Which I don't really like.  The Safehouse is just rediculous in its moderation (I'm also banned there, don't know why though! (well, no, I really don't  :p )).  Monkly Business does okay, and they need the moderation as their board is more active and visited by many more people, which is also true of The Safehouse, but I think their mods are on a power trip.<br />
<br />
There's the saying, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  Which applies well here, no need to really bother with things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I'd love to see an equipment forum and the currrent quests forum becoming soley about quests - epic included.<br />
<br />
You'd need some pretty active moderation to smoothly achieve it tho and I think everyone enjoys the more relaxed approach round here so change would be difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oddly, it's the Epic Forum that I'd like to be seperate from other Quests.  Would like to have more walkthroughs and hints on something OTHER than the epic :\<br />
<br />
Equipment; again; wouldn't mind having it in a seperate form so it's easier to find things.  Maybe work on compiling a shaman equipment database like the Monks have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Apart fom the odd genuine newbie popping in to ask about the test of patience and the killer sharks, the only question that ever gets asked in the quests forum is &quot;How can I cheat my epic&quot; anyway  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
First, I'd like to thank those of you who actually voted.  Such a high number of views with a low # of total votes cast is a little surprising to me.<br />
<br />
The obvious conclusion is that the majority of those voting feel the boards aren't broken, so they do not need any fixing. :)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind a little board moderation myself, if merely to shuffle the equipment/epic posts into the categories I described.<br />
Not the heavy handedness that is seen on some other boards, but more of an organizational moderator to help steer things to the right area, not to act as a censor.<br />
<br />
I think there are enough regulars here that WOULD frequent the equipment/epic sections (if created) to take care of the standard questions we see pop up every week.  I also think one or two well written sticky topics might help reduce the # of threads a bit.  So many good equipment thread responses (by Bigguss, especially, but also many others) get buried so quickly in the existing forums, and then they don't get found by those seeking the information even a week later. :(<br />
<br />
Grippa,<br />
I really think there is more to the epic topics lately than just &quot;how to cheat&quot;.  The faction issues continue to bring out new posts.  As I'm watching these threads, I'm seeing the same type of posts with the same questions again and again.  There are many little detail questions that come up from time to time.<br />
<br />
Once again, I came up with this poll to get feedback.  Thanks for providing it.  I am in the minority, and will bow to what the majority view as essentially a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkkels</div></div><hr />

Mez thaught the number one rule in taking a pole was to try hard not to bias da sample in how joo ask your questions, or in stating joo own opinion.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Biggus.<br />
<br />
Everyone will still post many of the questions in general forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frekkels - you're right, sorry that was just my cynical side showing through  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">need a separate forum for EPIC's<br />
<br />
i enjoy alot of quests but see so many epic questions on the quest page <br />
<br />
i dont see how people can have a probelm with  a quest that has such easy to follow walk thurs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>thyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's my opinion that people will still use the general forum and ignore the equiptment forum, so I voted no.<br />
