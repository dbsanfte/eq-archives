<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not a very specific question..  Should EPs be opened to any 65?  Not so sure about that... Should there be alternate access quests for the EPs &amp; SRT implemented?  Yes, I do think so.  Also would like to do the only good quest that's been put in the game by these clowns at Sony.  Voting yes under the assumption that it not just be handed out; that there be a quest for it, and based on the fact that I don't like the flagging system at all to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Make the question more specific, giving options, and I would vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Elemental plane mobs at minimum hit for double 800.  Pretty similar to a LDoN hard adventure at 65. From anything I've read here at the board, non - elemental equipped folks find LDoN hard to difficult.  So opening up the elemental planes for everyone is not going to help the &quot;casual&quot; player a lot.  And elemental gear does not drop of casual mobs but of minis with powers on the level of the tier one and two gods.  So there is nothing to gain for the non-flagged player in the elementals,  if your guild cannot handle the flagging gods it cannot handle the loot carrying mobs in EP.<br />
And you will not successfully experience in an EP wearing less then ornate/VT gear.</div></div><hr />

Got to wonder if it's part of a larger plan by SOE, the first step being to legitimize 8+ hours a day in front of a monitor (without a salary).

<br />
In the end, if your not in a guild that can acces the EP then there is nothing you could possibly do in the EP. Understand? If you don't have the power/Equipment, YOU CANNOT HANDLE THE ELEMENTALS PLANES.<br />
<br />
What you complain about is exactly the same as being able to zone into ToV without being able to handle a single Drake at zone in, let alone two.<br />
You either bring a guild up there or join one who does. is that so difficult?<br />
<br />
People like you are Diablo-like players, where the game is meant to be finished solo. Everquest isnt, its a social game, a MULTIPLAYER game.<br />
<br />
Is it so f-u-c-k-ing hard to understand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me explain the idea behind PoP a bit to you.<br />
<br />
People want hero's!<br />
<br />
Read that again and think about it.<br />
<br />
SoE understood that people want to feel special, hence they created a system where it is very clear that some players are better then others.<br />
They also know that a lot of people actually dream of becoming like those über players and that that is what keeps them playing.<br />
<br />
So they created a system like PoP where it is clear how über one really is.<br />
<br />
In LDoN they took a different route but the Masterboard is actually based on the same system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't totally agree with some of the things said.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Then what a load of blithering nonsence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am a level 65 with 9 AA. I am in a guild that can not handle the Elemental Planes right now. <br />
<br />
The things I and my guild are doing right now are challenging and fun. The Elemental Planes would be frustrating and decidely unfun for us at this point. Why would I want to be allowed to zone in to a plane where I can not have fun? <br />
<br />
I have about 4700 hitpoints with raid buffs. I am in no hurry to bounce a slow off a mob that doubles for 800 even if I am allowed in the zone.<br />
<br />
Seems like a silly thing to be concerned about IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No way. Hell no.<br />
<br />
I can picture it now ... A guild is fighting a random mini in fire when a Dreadlands/Plane of Valor idiot trains them with 10 mobs, or worse, another mini. Or, a guild is splitting named mobs like Blazzax and Babnoxis and in the process trains a crapload of idiots who have no clue what a raid mob is. Same thing about Plane of Water.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Plane of Air is going to be loaded with a crapload of corpses and GM queue going to be full with petitions because idiots can't zone in before being destroyed by the roaming recluse or flying troll.<br />
<br />
And of course guilds will be pissed off when XP groups are triggering ring events in Earth without having a clue what each mob does. This again will amount to a huge number CS calls.<br />
<br />
A majority of EQ players would train zone in instead of taking a dive. This alone would turn Elemental Planes into Dreadlands 3.0 and Plane of Valor 2.0 or even Karnor's Castle 2.0. No thank you.<br />
<br />
Instead of giving them access to Elemental planes, redesign Plane of War (no boss mobs whatsoever, or secluded like Valor), up ZEM and put in mobs that are Elemental difficulty and open them to the public.<br />
<br />
And there is the problem of guilds who can't kill RZtW yet but could easily kill lesser named in the planes ... how will you deal with them? They will be able to farm elemental loot without having the need to kill one single pre elemental god. Not to mention, they will be able to get to time skipping ALL pre elemental content. No thank you.<br />
<br />
And finally, do you really think that average Joe who sometimes has trouble killing mobs in PoV and BoT where there is very little or no slow mitigation and mobs don't hit that hard, will actually do XP in Earth or Water where most mobs mitigate to partially and hit much harder than PoV? No, I don't think so. After maybe 2 weeks of being &quot;the new stuff&quot; the majority will flock back to PoV and BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't see much difference between a flag, a key and a quest.  Access is a reward for completing the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Perhaps my meaning was mistaken - looking back, I see I certainly could have worded it better - it wasn't a general statement aimed at all who play a lot or are in big/advanced guilds - indeed I'm guilty of playing a lot myself - it was aimed at those few who feel that their progress in EverQuest somehow makes them better people, more important, etc... people who look down on the more casual or unguilded players, who feel the need to have zones all to themselves, etc.  It's an obvious reaction to RL insecurity in the cases of those few people, who in no way represent the majority of people who play a lot or are in 'uber' guilds.  Sorry if I unnecessarily offended anyone.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm frankly amazed at some of what I'm reading here:<br />
People like you are Diablo-like players<br />

a system where it is very clear that some players are better then others<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aye, very wrong to want access to more than 50% of an expansion I paid for and to want to be able to do the only decent quest since Velious.  Wrong to be upset at bored ubers ganking old world stuff just to destroy the loots, etc...   It's cool, I understand.  Not everyone can fit on the top, and even if they could you wouldn't feel so special, so warm &amp; fuzzy inside about how leet you are, if the top were more crowded ;)  You're the type better-suited for Diablo son, not me.  Before SOE began fishing for powergamers with PoP and the changes made to the game to cater to them, EQ was an RPG.  An RPG is the type of game I'm suited for, and it's unfortunate that EQ has come so far away from its RPG roots.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />

Not sure what else you want in the elements if your guild isn't able to take down the mobs that would get you there.<br />

Oh yea, the gear that you wouldn't be able to get cause the mobs would kick you but.  Work your way there and have fun doing it.</div></div><hr />

Whoa there, um, EQ is an RPG?  Hell ya could have fooled me back in the days of VELIOUS, um Luclin had roleplaying content? yea, bout as much as PoP, hell PoP has more.  Forget the timesinks and go back to roleplaying, just cause ya see something nice and sparkly and shiny doesn't mean you have to reach for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">should it be formatted to the high end raider?<br />
<br />
Litgruv, he asked if the entire game should be formated to the average player, not 5-6 zones out of what, 100+?<br />
<br />
What is so difficult to understand here? There are a slew of zones for every level. There are quests to grant folks access to some zones that they wouldn't be able to see before but can now single group into. The playerbase is made up of all sorts of people. From those who &quot;don't like to gind xp, or raid&quot; to those who log on to raid hard targets that require a bunch of folks playing together.<br />
<br />
If SoE didn't cater to everyone they wouldn't have a game. They do though. The problem is that those who can't get to the EP's and Sol Ro feel slighted. It's all BS. Anyone can get to those zones. Anyone. You don't have to play 11 hours a day either. You just need to find a guild that matches your playtime and maximize your online hours.<br />
<br />
I don't Tradeskill. Should that preclude my ownership of the Aid Grimel piece? Hell no, just give it to me if I do a quest please. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Last time i played EQ ( 5 seconds ago) 90% of the zones could be entered by anyone lvl 65 without any previous requirement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like how some people feel that just because they are in certain zones then they are automatically better players than the ones who aren't in those zones.

50% of PoP is raid content, 50% is exp. You can change numbers as much as you like counting the various tier 1/2 gods which are raid oriented.<br />
<br />
Everyone know its all about people who dont have the will to commit in a strong guild wanting EP armor handed on a silver plate.<br />
<br />
The only thing i would agree on is making Solro Tower more easily accessible since ou can find ornate armor there.<br />

You can resume the whining contest.</div></div><hr />

Well, judging by LDON and the fact that they provided zones for everyone I would disagree. LoY - same. Yes, the raid zones in LDON were for high end raiders but why not? There are a whole bunch of progression flag mobs that go up in difficultly. If people can't raid those to get the flags they need for EP access why provide other raid zones?<br />

<br />
*KNOCK KNOCK*<br />
Hello? McFly!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
LDoN has been designed FOR the casual player. You do fast adventures, get ok experience AND good loot after a while. There are a few raid encounters ... oh wait ... a guild management nightmare after elemental progression requires 100+ man rosters. Last friday, we had 63 people online, 36 were heading to a &quot;raid&quot; the rest were told to sit out. <br />
<br />
Do you realize that a causal player in LDON can get easy gear that is VT/Ssra quality WITHOUT ever killing a goddamn raid mob? Not to mention loot in hard missions is very nice also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">No.<br />
<br />
This game has always been designed to have &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot;. Straight from the mouth of the dev team even before sony was a part of it.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think they need to look back at the ornate drops. When they fixed them the first time they nerfed them back again a short time later..they need to undo that second nerf. <br />
<br />
As for runes...well..a little tweaking couldn't hurt(be nice if GODS dropped them instead of ethereals or specs), but they are still slowly trickling out to those that need them and the prices on almost all 65 spells are dropping(on my server anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Prices on most 65 spells still sky high on Torvo. <br />
<br />
I don't think the elemental planes should be opened. I do think they should remove some of the more annoying preflags though (Hedge, HoH tirals, Carpin, Saryn preflag, maybe some others)<br />
<br />
My guild has done all of them, many of them repeatedly and they are just annoying wastes of time (as I'm sure any higher guild thats done them 100x over would probably agree to).<br />
<br />
Another option I'm sure I've seen people mention before (and could be possible with the new leadership things they implementing I think).<br />
<br />
When a flag granting mob is killed give all of their available flags to the raid leader to assign to whomever they want whenever they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The above poster stole my thunder =(<br />
<br />
On ARo we have a group of people in lower end guilds and non guiled that get together in a channel and do flag mobs 4 to 5 times a week.<br />
<br />
Instead of complaining about how unfair it all is and wanting Eplanes access given to u why not work inside of the system?<br />
<br />
The system is set to insure that the 01noobie doesnt ruin events for those that have progressed to the end game. <br />
<br />
Eq has always been a game of progression... you earn the right to go from one zone to the next by putting in the time to level up. You earn the better loots by killing more and more difficult mobs as you learn tactics and skills.<br />
<br />
1 Newbie zone outside your city<br />
2 Zone attached to noobie zone<br />
3 LOIO<br />
4 Fmountains<br />
5 OT<br />
6 Dlands<br />
7 Karnors<br />
8 Seb<br />
<br />
Just a example of the progression back in Kunark days...These examples can be seen in every expansion.... In POP its the same thing.... everyone is maxed level pretty much or well on thier way to getting it so they institued flaggs as the new way of earning the progression to move to the next zone is all.<br />
<br />
Flags are as much a road block as leveling up was back in the day.... Sit around in Seb as a 54 shaman for hours on in OR you can stop bitching and whining about how unfair it all is cause theres a 60 shaman in every group there and MAKE YOUR OWN GROUP!!! Its the same thing as the flag problem.... You can cry and whine and bitch about how unfair it all is or you can get over it, and put together the tons of people that want the flaggs but have no guild that can get them it.<br />
<br />
Put in the work for gods sake people... There are tons of spoilers out there u can spend 30 mins looking up a flagg mob, talk to others in higher guilds and get the specifics down and then advertise to kill it.... Once u kill a flag mob you will be suprised how your little group of killers will get recruits coming to help you... AOR (our servers kill group of unguilded or lower level guilded) Has developed a life of its own... any time of day u can join the channel and theres 100 to 200 peeps there....<br />
<br />
Guess the point of my long winded post is to stop whining about your supposed fate and just be proactive and get your flags... You say u want a quest that will allow alt access... This is the same concept just DO IT and stop bitching about it for god sake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Should they open Howling Stones? Sebilis? Veeshans Peak? Vex Thall? Same concept. The idea is you accomplish certain things and you are rewarded. If it's handed to you then what's the point? It shortens the life of the game much as putting yourself into God mode does on a single player game. It has nothing to do with who is better than who etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The biggest problem, as I see it, is that they put the raid content and the xp content in the same locked zones.  These zones need to be locked to allow the raiders to progress.  Opening it to xp'ers would be disaster to some events.<br />
Perhaps leave them locked and drop the zem a bunch.  Best xp would be in the open xp zones, and the locked zones would be mostly undisturbed for the raiders who require their use.<br />
I realize the highest end people would scream bloody murder about having to xp at the same rate as the rest of us, but since they're the people putting the most hours into the game, they will still have the most.  And being able to look down your nose at people is the reason a great many people are 'serious' players.  Sad, but true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I can see it already. Guild_01 shows up to kill raid mob_A.

Start /shout /ooc /tell /petition. They hit the fourms with crap about how Guild_04 stole thire mob.<br />
<br />
I can come up with meny reasons off of the top of my head. Has to why the elementals should not be open to the masses. Trains, idiots, cockblocks, events that get messed up, ect ect. And non of this has anything to do with loot. But how people are and the things that would happen. There is a saying that fits perfectly...<br />
<br />
If you cant stand the heat. Stay out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
And thats pretty much what it comes down to. Anyone that works hard on thire char dose deserve to have the equipment and such that goes with it. They have the right to feel proud of what they have accived. Be it full time armor. Or a full set of auged Ldon armor. But gear reallys has nothing to do with this subject. If people cant handel the pre req to a zone. They cant handel the zone. Nothing good would come from opening the elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Voted no and i have no elemental access.<br />
<br />
But  ;) <br />
<br />
it is NOT the same concept as the keys stated by Litchebane. All of these 'old' keys are attainable by single groups or small dedicated guilds.<br />
<br />
A necessary requirement for EP access is pure and simple to have enough numbers in guild to achieve your goals. How is gathering enough numbers an accomplishment for the single player (except the overworked guild leaders and officers of course)?<br />
<br />
To be clear, i am not opposed against the general difficulty of such key encounters, they SHOULD be top hard. But that they are scaled for such obscene large numbers is dumb.<br />
<br />
Personally i would love it, when they would extend the raid system (that x numbers of flagged people could invite y numbers of unflagged) to group level, so that 4 or 5 EP people could invite 2 or 1 non-EP players. I highly doubt i would regularly hunt there, but visiting and hunting on occasion without the support of a 100+ guild sure would be nice.<br />
<br />
That would also address the issue of many ubers ;), that some noobs could disturb their hunting. They still would have control over EP access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Lol, that's rich to hear someone in EP gear speak out against god mode ;)  The zones you mentioned aren't a large portion of the expansions they're in and aren't required to do one of the only quests (and probably the only good one) in the expansion they're in.  Maybe I'm making too big a stink over Grimel, but my best memories in EQ are of working on the Coldain rings &amp; shawls.  I think I'd greatly enjoy Grimel - but I can't do it.  I'd enjoy it just as much if the reward was half as powerful as it is; I'm not after god-mode gear, just have fun doing tradeskills &amp; questing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I'm 100% against EP's being opened to the public, even if it is via a hard single group quest.  Two primary reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  The zones just aren't built to support a large population of random expers.  PoAir is completely unsuitable for exp, no one would ever use it.  Occasionaly I see some people exping in water, but if that group doesn't contain an EP quality tank and cleric, you're going to get creamed, especially if you're doing regruas (the only camp in zone that is worthwhile, imho).  PoFire has three areas where you can exp.  The zone in mobs give exp that's about on par with povalor, but there is a lot more risk.  The first castle gives pretty decent exp, about an AA every 45 minutes with a decent group.  Problem is the mobs hit for like 700ish and mitigate slow.  You need a strong tank and cleric.  Castle2 gives the best exp in the game, but it can really only support one group, since you have to kite and there's only one area to kite in.  PoEarth gives good exp and tradeskill drops, but the mobs there have nasty procs, hit pretty hard, and mitigate slow.  In addition to all this, there's the basic problem of having random idiots in the zone.  I could easily see random people who are clueless about the raid content screwing up pulls, accidentily training nameds on guilds, and blowing ring events.  Another problem is lag.  These zones just aren't designed to support a large population, as anyone who has tried to raid EPs with two guilds in the zone can tell you.<br />
<br />
2)  The second, and biggest problem, that I have is that it just isn't fair.  I spent months of my EQ life flagging for EPs.  I did all the preflags for EPs more times than I can even begin to count.  We spent weeks learning the rallos encounter (and other encounters, but rallos was the hardest), and then when we finally beat it, we got access to EPs.  But it wasn't over once we got in to EPs, oh no.  We had people leave the guild for various reasons, and we had to replace them.  Then, we had to go back and do all the backflag mobs AGAIN.  How many times did I have to do complete backflag cycles in order to assure that my guild had enough flagged people to raid EPs?  Probably a dozen.  Now, you're telling me you want to be given these flags for free?  Hell no, you haven't earned it.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the EPs, join an EP guild.  If you're in a small family guild, then tough luck.  Stop crying because you can't exp in earth or fire.  That's one of the bonuses we get for having spent hundreds of hours working for these flags.</div></div><hr />

FYI, I believe using spacing/punctuation to avoid the language filter is an offense that can warrant suspension/banning of your forum account.  I'll let the mods answer for sure on that.<br />
<br />
I'm indifferent to the topic.  I'm in an incredibly well-tuned and skilled group of folk, but we don't like guilds and all the crap, raiding, etc.  We do hard ldon missions in about an hour typically.  I'm 100% certain we could handle exping in there, and to be honest, probably better than a lot of idiots who have managed to join up an EP guild who needs numbers.  I'd like there to be an alt quest for it, even if it's incredibly hard / time sink.  I have a lot of friends in guilds that are now in EP's and often looking for a shaman for groups.  Plus it'd be a few new places to exp in, outside of LDoN and living in tactics.  I think the design of raid mobs in there (from what I've heard from others) can make it potentially very easy for single groups to mess up raids, and so therefore I don't think they'll ever do it.<br />
I'll avoid the rest of the flame wars here about &quot;skill&quot; required to be in an EP guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I am in one of the smaller family type guilds and I love my guild. Right now there is no way that my guild could get EP flagged on its own and I'm not willing to leave and join a guild that could. Here's my problem with the flags... I'd like to be able to see and explore these zones. I honestly don't care if I don't get a single piece of EP loot or a single pixel of EP exp. Without flags (and before zones were opened up to players of a certain lvl) your average player had 4 tier 1 zones and PoK out of PoP, that's 5 zones for an expansion you bought... almost like another LoY in scope. I didn't like flags to begin with. Although now, I don't see a way that SoE could allow me or people like me to see these zones without completely screwing up the raiding aspects of the zones. So, it looks like half an expansion is closed to me for the most part for a very long time if not for the rest of the days that I play EQ. That is my problem with the EP flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Sure, why not?  We pay our 12.98 a month.

Face it, your losing your player base day by day, and well, people want to zone into these plains.  Not saying they can handle it, because some can, and some cannot.<br />
<br />
But since we have rampant /megawarping, looting mobs from zone-ins, exploitation of the z-axis, the ability to warp ANY character into the plane of time A or B if they are level 46+ and other various hacks running out there, I cannot see why not.</div></div><hr />

People want hero's!<br />

Read that again and think about it.<br />
<br />
SoE understood that people want to feel special, hence they created a system where it is very clear that some players are better then others.<br />
They also know that a lot of people actually dream of becoming like those über players and that that is what keeps them playing.<br />
<br />
So they created a system like PoP where it is clear how über one really is.<br />
<br />
In LDoN they took a different route but the Masterboard is actually based on the same system.<br />

SoE has a vision for the game i think and thats the problem. I mean its good to know what your product should be and have general outlines, but for a product like this you need to listen to the consumer more and try to bring the game to them, not force them to come toy our game.<br />

Just because NOW you can do it with single groups or small guilds doesn't mean it wasn't appropriate at the time. AAs and levels and gear have made stuff in expansions past a lot easier but at the peak of the particular expansion it was the top. No difference with PoP aside from them releasing a lackluster expansion or 2 as a followup. In fact LDON was aimed at letting those who couldn't get into EPs gear much closer in stats. And that's doable with one group.</div></div><hr />

I would like to see the PoK books made one-way the first time you use them, so you have to use the book to get into PoK before you can use it to get out. I would however like to see some quests implemented to allow tradeskillers to have the chance to get the materials for their recipies. <br />
<br />
I'm not flagged for the EPs, am not likely to be flagged, and would most likely end up quiting the game if I tried because the large scale raids I have been on have left me bored to tears. My biggest problem with the Planes is in fact that if I want to earn my 61-65th lvl spells, I HAVE to spend time in zones I have as much or more than Dreadlands<br />
<br />
I am assuming that tradeskill components drop like vendor trash in other zones. If they don't, my mistake and forget I said anything. If a quest were implemented, I expect it to be a massive timesink to get just one chance to make an item that will likely have a 50% fail rate.<br />
<br />
I like others am sick of meeting people who consider that time played determines somones ability to gain EP flags. I have a lot of respect for people who have worked through the flag progression and gotten to the EPs or Time. But then there is a need for backflagging to keep the numbers up. I have meet people who's entire EQ experience is<br />
<br />
Newbie Zone-&gt;Crushbone-&gt;Paludal-&gt;Maras Seru/ Overthere-&gt;Dreadlands-&gt;PoJ-&gt;PoI-&gt;PoD-&gt;BoT-&gt; High end raiding guild. <br />
<br />
Once they are there, they get backflagged through on the work of others. One of the biggest rewards for being flagged/ keyed for a zone IS being flagged/ keyed for that zone and the loot that drops there.<br />
<br />
Ifyou do not play in the EPs, you do not NEED EP level eqiuipment. It just trivialises the content you do take part in. People who take on earlier content still make their own accomplishments regardless of whether 1 group, or 2 people in EP equipment can do the same encounter, and just because you are in an EP guild does not mean that you have full EP equimpent either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I'd have to agree that there should be some type of access to get to the elementals for those that put forth the effort.  That is, something else besides killing each individual hard mob.  However, to implement this.. you need to make this an extremely hard thing to do, with extremely rare drops.  That way, the random newb around cannot just got on his computer one day and be elemental the next.<br />
<br />
I'm serious, the elementals are really no joke.  If you don't know how to handle encounters, then you have no business being there.  By this I mean, there is exactly 2 zones that you can run around in fairly safe while invised.  There is one zone that you aren't even safe at the zone in.  These aren't your average mobs that the normal person can solo.  These are mobs that hit you harder than anything you've ever faced, and move faster too.  Let's put it this way, if you get into trouble, there won't be time to get evac off before your party is dead.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I myself have fallen under the spell of only wanting to group with people that are of my guild or close to it.  By this, I mean, I would rather exp or group with someone that I know knows how to play the game, and will not be afk most of the time, over agro every pull and run around, evac when more than one mob is in camp or if they get hit, cleric knows how to heal me.... etc.  Some people may not see it, and I can't vouch for all elemental guilds, but I know that people in the three Time guilds here can play, or else they wouldn't be in that guild.  There are none of the leet dudes in these guilds that run rampant and get pissed and leave their guild every week.  I know that when I'm in a group of guildees.. I can expect to be in a group with competent people that will come to play.<br />
<br />
I have times myself when I get a bit of attitude in me.  But, realize that it's not cause i'm Time flagged or have such and such gear, it's cause I dislike seeing the same stupid things over and over again, or seeing the dumb things that people do.  It's the constant training in places like BoT/PoV/HoH.  It's the yelling in public channels about how cool someone is for whatever reason.  It's the just dumb things that people do when they aren't thinking of anything more than themselves.  This is why I like the elementals.  I know that if I go in there, I can go in there to hide.  I can go in there and usually not worry about some person training me if I go afk for whatever reason.  It's because most of the time, the people that have gotten there have put in the time and effort to help their guild out to get there and are competent people (this does not mean everyone that is EP flagged, i know some people that just got to EP on my server do not have the skills to handle the normal exp mob).</div></div><hr />

Keeping your guild and your recruits flagged for Elemental Planes sure as hell is work.<br />
<br />
Do you think I've helped kill Grummus 15+ times because I like seeing loot drop that even some of our alts would laugh at using?<br />
<br />
Do you think it's fun to drag your guild up to PoSuck to clear Saryrn's Tower for 2 hours because you have a few new guildmembers or recruits that need that flag?  The effort me and another guildy put into getting keys for the stupid tower just to be able to raid it are more work than some of you have spent doing quest access to multiple zones.  I've spent approximately 8-10 days of camping spawn points for the Avatars dealing with immune to slow mobs, mobs that proc silence, mobs that proc root, mobs that proc slow, mobs that proc snare, mobs that aggro through walls into trains of 5+ mobs, mobs that cheal and gate, and all the while getting the asstastic xp that is on par with a tier 1 zone.  My guildy with the key lucked out and 3 of the 4 Avatars were all up after a patch one day, so we got that rogue 4 out of the 5 parts including stomach event.  The last piece I think he had to camp 9 days to finally get it to spawn, and even then, it was only up after a patch another day.  Naw, it's not work doing this, it's fun!<br />
<br />
How many of you even know the joys of dealing with the graveyard/zone in that is hohob?  Newsflash for you poeple that haven't had to deal with it.  There FIVE aggro mobs that spawn INSIDE the graveyard where you have to do your CR if you wipe, which is incidently exactly where you zone into the zone from hoho.  Oh, and did I mention that the respawn time outside is relatively fast when you are trying to get all the non-flagged people raided into the zone and usually end up having a few die to the 4+ guards to the zone to hohob.  And doing CR in hoho because you accidently backed up a step and zoned out of hohob into 4 600+ hitters.  I bet some of you didn't know that the zone out of hohob can be clicked OR just walked into to zone out.  How's that for a whole bag full of fun raiding!<br />
Learning how to do the RZ script is a chore too.  You have TZ, VZ, Fake RZ, Real RZ, masses and masses of adds, and annoying mobs that split and proc knockbacks on you, as well as repops to deal with during this whole event.  Learning the script completely properly took our guild about 2 weeks of work.  Doing the RZ script is something you have to learn how to do, and you have to learn to do it flawlessly.  If you lose too many people on any section of the encounter, you don't have time to recover to do the next section in time, and have to start over again.  It's very draining having to clear to the named and trigger the event multiple times in a single evening because for whatever reason you wipe on a section.<br />
<br />
We got free AAs as a partial reward for being flagged for zones that were opened up.  Getting 1 AA for each zone being opened up is kind puny compared to the amount of effort that's gone in to getting those flags.  To be more appropriate, I probably should have gotten about 150+ AAs for the number of backflags I've gone through and the number of times I've effectively reflagged myself on encounters.  But instead, we get rewarded with the same bonus that anyone that just does the flag raid once and then never raids again gets.<br />
<br />
If you put effort into something, you get better rewards from it.  EP rewards are more xp zones and loot raiding zones than you'd get in zones that don't require the work to get into.  Same can be said of Seb, VT, Charasis, VP, and other keyed zones.  You want the rewards, you do the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Juujuu's post is an excellent example of how and why PoP access design sucks.  I can't believe a game developer for SOE is going to read that and think &quot;hey we got it right!&quot;  <br />
<br />
This is about game design.  People like to see some differentiation, and there must be some difficulty for goal setting.  EQ is all about goal setting.  This principle must be respected; it's the core behind EQ's success. <br />
<br />
However, I think the number of flagging events is way too excessive.  As a matter of degree, it goes too far.  <br />
<br />
The old theory was to let the content drive who hunts there - the NToV idea.  That's a good principle, and it does a better job of encouraging cooperative gameplay (and skill IMHO) - rather than just people who happen to play a lot.   There's a time guild on my server where folks clearly hate each other, but they remain guilded because that's the crew they need to be with to kill Quarm.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who says the elemental planes and Time aren't littered with poor players is sadly deceiving themselves.  <br />
<br />
Just because it's the way things are now doesn't mean it's the best design principle.  <br />
<br />
I don't think it is.  I think killing a fewer number of mobs accomplishes the goals of encouraging the pioneers.  And that's what they should be, pioneers, the first but not the only.  <br />
<br />
All I need is RZ for EP access, and we got RZ to 33% our first shot.  He'll drop soon.  Fine, keep RZ as an event for EP access, but reduce the number of other silly encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">We had 60 people on when we dropped RZ, I dunno where you're getting these Zergy numbers<br />
While killing RZ with 60 may be an impressive feat, if you step back a bit it just seems absurd to need 60-72 people to do something.  I think that's what the poster meant, not that doing RZ with 60 was 'zerging'.  At least, that's how I read it, and that's a sentiment I agree with.<br />

If folks hate backflagging (and the other drudgery involved with pre-EP EQ) so much, there's no rule that states you have to stay in your guild and do things you hate, or that you have to chase after the carrot Sony dangles in front of you.  I could easily have joined (and still could) any three of my server's Time guilds, as I have friends in each who are willing to sponsor me, I have the required level and AAs, etc...  I choose not to, seeing the detrimental effects PoP has had on people, friendships, guilds, and the game itself.  That being said, if I could change my vote I probably would - I have no desire to be in the same zone(s) as people who have the mentality toward EQ I've seen displayed so prominently in this thread.  I basically voted yes because I'd like to do Aid Grimel, and for the fact that it's a quest - a tradeskill quest to boot - not because the result is nice.  As I've mentioned I'd be tickled pink to have a similar quest without the EP flag requirements with a 75/75 earring as the reward.</div></div><hr />

you made some good and certainly true points about issues, that suck with PoP design.<br />
<br />
But your conclusion is to take it as an 'accomplishment' and demand from every other player to get that same 'accomplishment'.<br />
<br />
But dealing with crappy design should not be an accomplishment in a game. Surviving hard and well designed encounters, progressing through varying and interesting content should be.<br />
<br />
I don't want to belittle the game accomplishments of anyone in EP, but as i said you should demand from SoE to improve their pseudo expansion, not from players to go through the same treadmill, you endured.</div></div><hr />

My guild is a raiding guild.  My guild is also a guild I've been with for 2 full years.  The people that are in my guild are most of my best friends that I have in game.  Why would I ditch my best friends just for the chance at joining a guild that's slightly further along in Time?<br />
<br />
News flash for you.  Backflagging is a necessity for high end raiding guilds.  Guildies have to go inactive due to RL stuff, or leave the guild for various reasons, or just quit playing.  Regardless of the reason, if you don't backflag, the number of flagged people in your guild will slowly dwindle to the point that you can't even raid a named target in an elemental plane anymore (that number of required people is roughly for 40 for say a pofire named or earth ring).  The guild needs to match the people leaving the game/guild, so that's why you have recruits for your guild.  Recruits are people that have interest in your guild either by reputation of your guild alone, or they have friends inside the guild that want them to join.  Recruits generally are people that have not come from another major raiding guild, and thus they lack flags.  Sooooo, while the recruits might managed to get a guildinvite at some point to keep your average guildmember totals roughly the same, it doesn't change the fact that your flagged guildmember total isn't going up.  You have to continue to do backflags here and there so that your recruits and new guildmembers can continue to stay flagged, and can actually, you know, RAID with you?<br />
<br />
Backflagging isn't something you can just shrug off and pretend you don't have to do it because you don't like it.  A guild STAYING elemental plane flagged is nearly as much work as GETTING flagged in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I'm just saying it's not the only way to play the game.  You like raiding, being in a raiding guild, you have to take the good with the bad.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Ya.  That was me.  I refuse to refer to that zone by anything other than PoSuck.  If you haven't hunted there with any regularity, you have no idea the h8 that I have for that zone, as both an xp zone and as a raiding zone.<br />
<br />
you have to take the good with the bad<br />
That's exactly it.  You have to take the good with the bad.  The good part of working hard at flagging etc is access to more zones.  The bad part is the maintenance of keeping up all the flags for people in the guild.<br />
<br />
POP is an expansion for the high end of EQ.  The gods of the first tiers are about as hard as the hardest mobs in the rest of the entire game.  While you can zone into the planes at level 46, there's only 1 zone that you'd of any use in hunting in (poj).  The expansion is designed for the upper end of EQ.  The requirements for raiding Gods that hit for 2-3k in order to be able to hunt in most places in the expansion clearly demonstrate this.  The goal of this expansion is to make people work at obtaining the flags they need to get the most out of the expansion.  Opening up EP because some people don't want to do the work isn't fair to the people that have done MASSES and MASSES of amounts of work to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Just for the record, after having gone through the keying process for Vex Thal and helping many guildies and recruits get keys, and having gone though the flagging process, the keying process is much much superior IMO.  It's something you can do in groups.  Only put requirements on raiding a few key targets here and there.  I'd much rather they never had the flagging process from the very start due to how much effort it is.  But it's in place, and it's there for reasons, as sucky as the outcome is.<br />
<br />
The ele planes are not really meant for people that can't get there.  The trash in the pofire zone (which is the most friendly for xp hunting) hits for up to 750s and is only partially slowable and many are not rootable (like PoV wasteland on uppers).  The harder stuff in zone hits for 900 to 1200 and only partially slowable.  The raid targets in zone hit for 2000 to 3000 plus ae effects.  It's like having Aerin'Dar wander the wasteland in PoV instead of being behind his locked door.  The zone requires decent gear and decent skill just to be able to properly hunt in the zone without training the zone in with mobs every 5 minutes like happens in BoT and HoHo.<br />
<br />
It goes both ways.  The zone xp and tradeskill drops and raid targets are a reward for the people capable of getting there.  But also, the hard process of getting there is a filter that needs to be in place to let only the people capable that can handle it in.  The process of getting access is a poor process, but it's there to stay and needs to stay.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Opening up EP because some people don't want to do the work isn't fair to the people that have done MASSES and MASSES of amounts of work to get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
I honestly dont care about having access or not but this argument is flawed. Its like saying that because you paid $3000 for your PC 1 year ago noone is allowed to buy the same PC today for $1000 (or less). It just doesnt make sense.<br />
<br />
Whatever happend a year ago in EQ is history and you did what you did at that time because of the rules that were in place at that time. Now is a different time and there is nothing wrong with discussing other rules.<br />
<br />
PS. I actually agree with you that most people that dont already have access arent meant to be in the elemental planes. But I personnally know some hardcore people in small guilds that would be able to hold their own there yet they have no chance in hell to get there through flagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">To be fair Jin, pretty much most people used your second argument to bitch at Sony when they opened up teir 2 zones last year. And yes, I was one of them. I was livid that I'd gone with my guild from the off and worked and worked at the trials with our average-equipped chars until we started scoring wins, and I was mightily miffed that suddenly those that hadn't were going to get handed a freebie instead.<br />
<br />
That said, why would people want in to EP? Yes, I read what Namurd typed, but I'd say access for the majority would be bordering on irresponsible tbh and certainly unnecessary. I've got a mixture of ornate and ornate-level armour, I count myself as a pretty good player and I don't get fazed by mobs that are above the level I usually play at. But that doesn't mean I want to go getting fancy by grinding away at EP-level mobs for xp when I could kill sub-EP mobs much faster and for better xp. I've done 2 hard dungeons, won one and got the second in the bonus time. They were challenging and it was good to push myself, but I didn't really enjoy either as I was having to work too damn hard. And, given that as has already been pointed out, most of the decent drops are off boss mobs, I'm never going to get the gear to allow me to improve that statement until I have a capable guild with enough numbers - in which case I can go flag up like everyone else and earn my right to do so.<br />
<br />
Yes, it annoys the bejesus out of me that I have to buy my 65 spells as we don't get anywhere near enough runes drop outside of EP zones. I'd be all for upping the rate of those. Other than that though, let the EP players go do their thang, makes no odds to me. It's just an opinion, others will disagree and that's cool, people have the right to do that. Just thought I'd add a perspective in other than &quot;I'm EP and no&quot; or &quot;I'm not EP and yes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Sure!  Switching factions from +dorf/cov to +giant was many days/weeks worth of work, but they haven't changed the amount of faction hits needed to swap factions.<br />
<br />
Getting to 250 in all tradeskills was insanely difficult a year ago when they first gave the tanaan AA, but they haven't really changed how much farming of crap you need to do and how many combines you need to complete to get the max skill.<br />
<br />
Key quests for all of the zones in the game are still intact and as long as they ever were to camp the parts (VP, VT, seb, HS, etc).<br />
<br />
Epics still need the same number of drops from the same locations.<br />
<br />
The quest to get flagged for Ele planes shouldn't be gimped either.  It's not like having to walk to school in the snow when you were young, and having access to public transportation now to get there.  There aren't any new technological advancements or anything that says things should be easier for people today compared to a year ago.  In fact, things are already a hell of a lot easier for people of today.  The details on many encounters are available on the net and through talking with friends in other guilds.  The average level of gear on a person is a lot better than it was for guilds just breaking into POP.  People doing flaggings at the beginning didn't have access to hoards of Ornate armor, and gear from BoT tower bosses, and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
The people that aren't in major guilds can still get flagged.  Having good friends helps a lot.  There's 2 friends of mine that I party with all the time that I've brought to our backflagging runs and are both ele planed and have some gear from each zone.  Either of them have pretty much an open invitation as an invite to our raids.  Another option is to look for pickup or open raids on targets you need.  I know of someone on Brell that's run pickup raids that have gone all the way from Grummus and TT raids, all the way through to RZ kills.  If you have a few people that can come up with a basic battle plan, and a bunch of people that can follow directions well, you can get flagged yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Should EP's be public ? No way...<br />
<br />
Public with a quest ? Only if this quest can be done by one group only (like the Tribunal Trials) with a max of 2 players already flagged and need to kill several mobs who equal the trash mobs in EP's. And even, I'm not sure if it would be enough.<br />
<br />
I won't see the mass pile of corpses in PoAir, raids/events ruined in a way or another by some people who don't know where they are (training, trigering by mistake, etc, etc, etc...).<br />
<br />
As I know, there isn't any &quot;target help&quot; saying you &quot;killing this mob will trigger the Devoteer ring event&quot;.<br />
<br />
Until I got the chance to get incrusted in the floor by a EP mob, I was crying it was not fair that I coudn't go in EP... then I meet the mobs... and understood very well why these zones are closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Did people cry to have Veeshans Peak, Sleepers Tomb and Vex Thall opened up to the public?  If not those zones, why bother to make it an issue now?  Seems to me is just that there are more people playing now than before, and thanks to how quickly you can level in PoP, you have a lot of level 65's crowding the few zones they have access to that do not require any flags.<br />
<br />
Those zones were designed for raiding guilds, in the same manner that most of the PoP expansion itself had raiding guilds in mind.  People in raiding guilds aren't better people than those that are not, but they put in a lot more time towards their goal to get where they are today.<br />
  <br />
This is also a way for SOE to keep the high end players playing longer and not finishing current content as quickly...design content that is a major timesink.  Opening up the EP's would be like handing out college degrees without any tests.  Sure, some people would be able to handle it, but then the vast majority who think they could, probably can't, and the zones would become a total wreck, and it would also trivialize all the effort the people currently there put into it.<br />
<br />
I wanted to see the higher end game content, therefore I joined a raiding guild...and you can too if it really means so much to you to get into these zones.<br />

The only way they could possibly do this and somewhat satisfy both camps, is to make it instant and private like LDON.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they should throw open the doors, with a simple level requirement.  But I do think they should have an alternate means of advancement - some kind of time consuming group key quest.  Heck, make the charm upgrades only for the raid flags, not keys, I wouldn't care.<br />

How many non guilded people or non raiding guilds do you think frequent VT?  Next, if they opened up the elementals, people will cry that it &quot;isn't fair&quot; that you should have to kill the god from each ele to enter time, that everyone should be able to rush right to the end game.<br />

<br />
Just because you might get access somewhere, doesn't mean you are ready to be or should be there.<br />
<br />
EP flagged does not equal playing ability.<br />
<br />
That is true, but if you are in an ele flagged guild, they generally got there due to cooperation and leadership.  PoP is all about mass numbers no matter how much you might not want to admit it.  No matter how &quot;skilled&quot; a player you are, you won't be getting into Time (if that is what you want) without a lot of people online at the same time and very often.  It still takes a good plan to get there regardless.</div></div><hr />

Read that again and think about it.<br />

SoE understood that people want to feel special, hence they created a system where it is very clear that some players are better then others.<br />
They also know that a lot of people actually dream of becoming like those über players and that that is what keeps them playing.<br />
<br />
So they created a system like PoP where it is clear how über one really is.<br />

In LDoN they took a different route but the Masterboard is actually based on the same system.<br />

I'm your typical casual gamer, tactics flagged, and am thankful for hoh and bot, but that's plenty. I am glad there are zones that take work to get into, it gives me something to look forward to and work toward achieving, not to mention the experience gained by the time you get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Imma have to say no.  But, elemental access from a quest?  Very hard quest, maybe.  It's not that I want to sound stingy with the content, but what good is being able to see a zone if you would be owned by the yard trash, and thusly cuasing headache for others.  Sure some folks talk about great exp in the elementals, but those folks doing it also have the hp's and gear from the elementals and VT that will allow them to be, at the start maginally successful.  For the most part, those zones are still raiding zones with 36 plus raids.  In earth, exp groups can seriously fubar up the raiding areas for killing the wrong stuff.  I really wouldn't want to trust joeshmow in there to not screw up the events.  I would moreso trust someone that stuck with a really hard quest that proved committment though.</div></div><hr />

That maybe still lends itself to the no side of it.  As for trusting the new guild, I remember some things on Bertox where the previously ele guild would say, YO! don't kill mobs around such and such as you screw up such and such.  Not telling em much, but enough for the new folks to most likely not fubar it up and get the rest miffed at em.  The trust thing comes into play, with me moreso with how easy something is earned.  If it comes to you very simple, a person typically doesn't have that much respect or concern for it.  Something harder to come by, typically means a person will have greater respect and concern for it.  Typically.  It's all grey areas.  I mean if I was the developer and got asked, 'elementals are fully closed, fully open, or questable entrance, I'd still go with the way it is now, fully closed unless you've done the content boss kills.  Every zone is not a gimme zone.  VP, ST, NTOV, VT.  I mean SURE you can go run and zone into ToV but then what?  By yourself or in a single group for the most part,  you can zone in and say cool, a big roundish room.  Evac/gate.  Been there seen that.  VP, do a really long quest that can be gotten solo/duo.  What do you do when you zone in.  Pre-change, make a corpse outside of it then, zone in and stand at entrance, say, cool, been here now ask for a rez to get out.  Though now, you can just gate/evac.  VT long quest of shards.  Cool, I got my scepter but still need my rift to make it into a key.  Oh, cool, I was able to tag along with someone and got a rift (not likely but possible).  Zone into VT, stand at zone in and go, cool been here, now zone gate/evac out.  ST, get lucky to be able to loot the talisman for the key from a raid that isn't yours (unlikely) and then what? Same as before, zone in say, I been here.  Now gate/evac.<br />

No way in hell should EPs be opened even a crack. No level, no quest, nada. The current method isn't great with the need for constant backflag, but that's how it is, and that's how it should stay.<br />

People who haven't done the work have no concept of just how much work it is. You are not entitled to see the whole game just because you pay the monthly fee. Ever since Kunark there have been zones where you had to put forth substantial effort to get into them. The elementals are no exception, and there's also no REASON for them to be an exception, except pure old fashioned greed. You want what other people have, without doing what they had to (and continue to have to) do to get there.  It isn't about skill, it is about time, effort, and reward. If you aren't willing to do the first 2, then why on earth should you be handed the third?<br />

<br />
Something like a quest to gain entry to the places would be nice - not something extreme, but not a pushover.  I agree with you on that, you should have to work for it.<br />
<br />
In the end,  all zones aren't meant for everyone.   But I paid for it!  I paid for some stuff too, that I'll never use.  It's not all fair, but it's life. =(<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with this idea and PoP, is that it applies to the majority of the expansion.  With Kunark, Velious, and Luclin (and even hard or raid in LDON), the &quot;exclusive&quot; zones were few.  With PoP, the &quot;non-exclusive&quot; zones are few.<br />
<br />
But, it's really all relative.  In the same way you know have single groups doing NTOV, you will eventually have small groups/guilds doing Elemental Planes - in a few expansions, after the typical mudflation of skills, aa's, spells, and gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
The elementals are no exception, and there's also no REASON for them to be an exception, except pure old fashioned greed. You want what other people have, without doing what they had to (and continue to have to) do to get there.  It isn't about skill, it is about time, effort, and reward. If you aren't willing to do the first 2, then why on earth should you be handed the third?<br />
<br />
The same argument could be made ranting about every single patch and expansion that has happened in the past 4 years.</div></div><hr />

I also dont like the keeping your gear when you die change (at low levels), or the meditate change. I play games for a challenge. I dont have tons of time to raid, thus i'm not in a raiding guild. My guild has no elemental plans, we get just enough loot and xp to keep us fine in BoT and PoTactics. It seems sony has taken away 99% of the challege in the game that I can aquire.

I don't think we got MM until our 4th night there, not quite sure how many attempts it took for us to get agnarr the first time (at least 5)rydda dar was probably 6 attempts, bertox was our 6th probably.  Rallos zek was probably another 7 or 8 nights.  These are 60+ man attempts for the most part, taking anywhere from 1-2 hours each, and multiple attempts per night on the events that allow it.  I imagine many guilds had similar numbers to this.  This also completely ignores camping/racing other guilds for these targets (which sucks but is part of the game).<br />
<br />
Now, that's only like half the flagging mobs...    how exactly could they make a one group quest that would put a similar time, effort, and to some degree skill requirement?  Now, even if you can think of one keep in mind there probably isn't room for more than 15 or so xp groups at a time in the eles.  Also remember that the 4 rings in earth could probably be triggered by a single group if you kept pulling the mobs for it and raids could easily be wiped out people training etc etc.  <br />
<br />
Of course EP members could easily train each other now, but they understand the effort and frustration, and they'd also have to answer to their guildleaders.<br />

<br />

I want the full expansion that I paid for- at no time prior to the launch of PoP did it make mention of the fact that roughly 80% of the expansion would be unattainable to the casual player.  Had I paid less for the expansion (e.g. a &quot;PoP Lite&quot; expansion including tier 1 zones, PoK, PoT) I'd drop the argument right now, but I did not- I paid to subsidize your enjoyment, which is flat out wrong.  Caveat emptor, indeed.<br />
<br />
You want to go explore the zones? Load up EQEMU, make a GM character, and explore to your heart's content.<br />
Yes, it makes sense to run a third party program to experience the content you already paid for.  Let me go rip the DVD's I bought and record them to analog videotape for me to watch- great idea.<br />
<br />
Do you think it was a mere coincidence that SOE relented and opened some (not nearly enough) zones to the masses already?  I'm sure it had nothing to do with the majority of their playerbase complaining and/or leaving.  Instance the zones so the raiders can continue to have their own playground to themselves, but open the zones already- Tactics and Sol Ro would be a good start.<br />

That's ten guild with an average roster of 100.  If we take typical loads from when servers were up around 2000 max, probably half of those players in are in above mentioned &quot;in or prospective EP&quot; guilds.<br />
That's a lot of folks concentrating on 5 zones in the game.  Seeing how PoFire can't handle two guilds with about 120 at the time without lagging to hell, how is it going to be with 100 + exp players spread out, and you try to bringing in your 60 to kill fennin.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
No, I actually prefer raiding, or LDON style grouping, to a static xp camp.  Static xp is boring.<br />
<br />
However, lets look at the game and expansions.<br />
Everquest - focused on grouping.  Only raid encounters were not intended for the players to be killed - if you recall, or weren't around then, Vox &amp; Naggy had no loot at first.  Why?  Because they could never be killed by a group.  The only real &quot;raid zone&quot; was the Plane of Fear. (Hate &amp; Sky added way later).<br />
<br />
Kunark - Again, focused on grouping.  There were raid level targets, mainly dragons, but the majority of the content was aimed at small numbers of players.  One zone was added that was touted as the toughest, requiring a long quest to get a key, where you could only zone out by clearing raid targets (although players found a workaround), and where GM's would not help you retreive corpses.<br />
<br />
Velious - In a suspicious pattern, the majority of the expansion was for small numbers.  The shift was being made to raids though, with more upper mobs requiring a small army to kill.  The newest &quot;elite&quot; dungeon was Sleepers Tomb, requiring a more difficult key quest, and with a single instanced script change upon certain factors.<br />
<br />
Luclin - Although a lot of solo/group area's were added, for all levels, there is a major focus on raids.  Gone for the most part are the myriad group-killable nameds that Sebilis had - now the big bosses are flat out raid targets, with a variety of tricks and spells at their disposal.<br />
<br />
PoP - Flat out, the major focus is on raiding.  Out of 19 zones, players had access to only 6.  A single group is needed to gain access to an additional 2.  To reach any of the others, you needed a large raiding force (believe there were problems with key quests at first).  Once the quests worked right, a group could gain access to an additional 4.  For the remaining 7 zones, a large, well geared raid is needed.<br />
<br />
Hmm.  It certainly appears to me that the main thrust of PoP was to satisfy the big guilds.</div></div><hr />

YES!  I just remembered that.  Any elemental zone if you have over around 90ish in the zone (don't matter where they all are) end up having INSANE lag (for instance 1 guild doing fire named while another doing fennin = hellish).  I couldn't imagine trying to raid that crap with 30-50 expers (they'd all be in fire or earth...moreso in fire since those are easier).</div></div><hr />

bot can get even worse. Was in a exp group once with the Agnarr event going with 150ish people in the zone, lag was so bad that spell effects took around 5-7 seconds to happen (aka cast canni, cast bar goes down, 5-7 seconds later, &quot;you have taken 148...&quot;).

I assume you guys want POEB access too? My guild has now done the ring events twice with non-loot dropping mobs JUST to get keys, that was a long, painful 16 hours.  JUST TAKE IT.<br />
<br />
You should also have some perspective of how LONG this process took. According to this log, our first successful guild flagging event was Aerin Dar on Jan. 2, 2003. We finally gained access to Air/Earth/Water on Aug 25, 2003 and Fire on Aug 30, 2003. EIGHT MONTHS OF DEDICATED WORK WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING ELEMENTAL. But what the heck, you pay your 13 bucks too.<br />
<br />
* Successful attempts only<br />

PS Who mentioned the hell that is the HOHB graveyard? Aint that the truth! We had a 2 hour CR there the first time we wiped on MM. What a poorly conceived idea. The best part about GYs, once the corpses go there, they can't be dragged anywhere safer!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not an entirely accurate analogy. It would be more appropriate to say you would be pretty bitter if you paid the same fee to see a movie as someone else but got a cell phone call 30min into it and had to leave to pick the kids up from school, or go to work for some overtime or any other RL errand and so then was unable to see the whole movie. If you want to see the whole movie, you will have to stay seated and dedicate  the time necessary to view it until the credits roll.<br />
 PoP elemental access is not impossible. It's been done by many people now. It just takes time, sacrifice and dedication. If you are not willing, or are unable due to RL commitments to put in that time which is needed, then your missing some great game content, not because no one will allow you to see it, but more so because no one will allow you to see it effortlessly. You didnt pay to see the elementals, you paid for the opportunity to see them. The opportunity is still there, it shouldn't be arbitrarily given to you 'cuz you say so. <br />
 I don't mean to offend anyone and sorry for singling out the one quote from izmalis here, but I stayed up way too late on way too many nights and went to work tired the next day in order to get through the ordeal of flagging, as did the majority of my friends. To see people complaining because content isn't handed to them on a silver platter seems a bit out of line. <br />
 PoP was tailored to high end content, because the previous model of 1 high end raid content zone and a couple of high end exp zones wasn't going to continue working with so many people hitting the high end game. Anyone remember experiencing in Karnor's Castle? What a zoo. Next expansion, Velk's Labryinth-you had to stand in line to form a thought in that place. <br />
 To compensate those left out of the loop in PoP SOE brought better gear and exp attainable by all with LDoN. LDoN caters to the more casual playing base-balance acheived. You don't see me complaining because there is no high end raid content(LDoN raids are a joke).<br />
 And if it's any consolation, elementals are already getting pretty overcrowded on our server even without opening them up for a free-for-all. Open them up and and the only people having fun in them would be the griefers, it's too easy to get people killed in tier4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Couple of issues here that are being clouded into one amorphous one which renders a confused ideaology. First off the mechanics of how flagging was implemented was poorly done at best I think we all can agree there; there should have been an all guild inclusive flag for the lower tiers, with the upper tiers requiring the big 4 remaining as is, it would have allowed guilds to keep from having to go though the drudgery of having to backflag people that missed, new members, etc etc. But they didn't implement that so people need to deal with things as they stand now.<br />
<br />
There has been no legitimate reason given yet why anyone should be given &quot;free&quot; access to the E-planes aside from the &quot;I want to see it&quot; argument, I would like to have my Ph.D right now too, but should I have it handed to me simply because I feel I should have it? For those that bothered to read the Planes of Power box the CD came in, it was said the expansion was geared toward those in guilds or more specifically, up to 18 new planar zones that push your teamwork abilities to the limit and those willing to challenge the gods themselves, so the arguement that &quot;I paid for it, so I should see it&quot; is out the window, there was no pressure for one to buy PoP what so ever.<br />
<br />
It has been stated many times already but there is a reason or reasons more accurately for stages of progression, first and foremost having requirements for progression elongates the time EQ runs and thusly puts more money into sony's bank accounts, secondly progression of levels and having requirements stratfies the player base so everyone isn't crowding one another which happens as the more time players without the ability to progress the more similar in gear and lvls they become which again brings crowding, social problems and unhappy customers...lower guk, loio, karnors, sebilis, velks, and now bot are fine examples of this. Lastly whichever timesink, key, flag, or lvl required gives those that put out the extra effort some kind of reward for their time whether it be loot from a raid mob, or dif XP tables due to the zone, and so forth.<br />
<br />
I ran or helped run a guild for many years, and anyone that has done this and has put in the inordinate amount of time being an officer will tell you there are typically 20-30 core people that carry the guild, these are those with outstanding skills, drive and an excellant understanding of game mechanics and over all knowledge, the the rest are pretty much just average players that fill in the needed slots; so the argument that not all players in the E-planes currently are excellant exceptional players is quite well substanciated and true, but on the other hand being average as they are doesn't mean they get attitudinal malfunctions b/c they zone into the E-planes. The fact of the matter though is the majority of those average players in the high end guilds still put in the same time(raidwise) as the rest as those who were the driving force. Everyone that is in a time enabled guild isn't an asskicker as far as EQ goes, or some brilliant strategist or leader, but there are a few in each guild or those guilds wouldn't be there in the first place. Getting to time is a hell of a lot of work, time invested and an inordinate amount of patience for the encounter and the people; it takes time to figure each encounter out, and sorry even if you have the recipe card of strategies, implementing those same strategies is another story, having a book on carpentry doesn't qualify you to make a 20 thousand dollar china cabinet without some skill or reading a book on C++ make you a bona fide game programmer, experience and ability; and every guild does things just a little different so there is no paint by numbers guaranteed way do things.<br />
<br />
Bottom line no way in hell should they open the E-planes up, it is a rite of passage from the time spent to earn the right to be there, sorry if that offends some in our instant gratification era but that need to earn something or have a little patience is disappating rather quickly. I was in a planes capable guild last year and currently am unguilded so I have been on both sides of the coin which further solidifies my feelings. <br />

Kinda blows a hole in your entire arguement...makes me wonder if this oversight was deliberate just to try to make your point.<br />
<br />
 I'd be pretty bitter if I paid the same fee to see a movie as someone else but only was allowed to see the first 30 mins.<br />
<br />
I'd be pretty pissed if I paid the same amount of college tuition, and some random person who only periodically showed up for class, skipped doing homework, and goofed off a lot graduated when I had to do everything, just because he spent the same amount of money I did.<br />
<br />
How about you ask for maxxed tradeskills, a couple hundred free AA, and the ability to nail one of the developer's hot sisters...you paid your money, didn't you? You deserve it all with no effort of any kind.<br />
<br />
Change zones to zone and you'd be correct:<br />
VP<br />
<br />
A particularly bad example on your part. Add in Sebilis, Howling stones. The key quests to those zones were nowhere near as severe as the timeblocks into other raid-oriented content, but they were blocks and they did keep people out. Consequence? Those were MUCH more tolerable zones to hunt in than say, Karnors. KC was open to the mass, just like BoT is open to the masses now. Both zones are (or were, in KC's case, cause nobody goes there anymore) horror shows of awfulness. I'd prefer the elementals be allowed their relative pristine condition which only keeping the imbecilic hordes out will allow.<br />
<br />
Your hypocrisy is staggering- casuals are &quot;greedy&quot; for wanting to see content they paid for?<br />
<br />
As I'm not elemental flagged, you will retract this bogus &quot;hypocrisy&quot; accusation IMMEDIATELY.<br />
<br />
And you're not greedy for wanting to deny your fellow players the same opportunities you've had to experience this content?<br />
<br />
Every single player in the game has exactly the same opportunities to experience all of the content. The only thing that prevents you from being elemental flagged is YOU. If you wanted to be in the elementals, you could be. You have CHOSEN to not be. Why should you be rewarded on the same level for CHOSING to not put forth the effort as other people?<br />
<br />
at no time prior to the launch of PoP did it make mention of the fact that roughly 80% of the expansion would be unattainable to the casual player.<br />
<br />
While they never gave out percentages (and much like everything else you write, your numbers are wrong, by the way. Not counting PoTime at all, the elementals are 5 out of 21 zones in PoP, which barely begins to approach 30%, nevermind 80.), it was stated repeatedly that PoP would be geared towards higher end content and raid-oriented guilds. If you somehow managed to miss that in the couple hundred times it was mentioned by the developers and repeated on dozens of class and server sites, then you have nobody to blame except yourself for being a bad consumer and buying a product for which you did no research. Either that, or you are just incredibly stupid. I'll let you pick which you prefer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a bad analogy.  A better analogy would be that you both pay admittance fee to visit a museum, and one of you choses to walk around the entire museum to see everything, while the other choses to check out one wing of the museum, then sit and and rest for a few hours until closing.<br />
<br />
You pay to have the opportunity to raid and visit every zone just like everyone else in the game.  What you chose to do with that opportunity is your business.  I spend my time raiding big targets.  You don't.  I get access to more stuff unlocked in the game.  Should we unlock Plane of Fear and Hate to level 30 and 40 players just because they play too casually to level up enough to hunt there themselves?<br />
<br />
Ah sweet, the I pay 13 bucks a month comment thus I am entitled to it. Let's see ...<br />
<br />
I have no time for tradeskills.<br />
I despise tradeskills.<br />
I have no will to do ANY trade skills.<br />
<br />
But since I pay 13$ a month, like everyone else, I should be entitled for them superb tradeskill earrings, reaping mucho profit from making cultural armor, Coldain Shawl, elemental bows, crafted armor from EPlanes and whatnot. Afterall, I pay my 13$ a month like everyone no? Hell, since people have already maxed out their AA, I want to have my AA maxed out too, afterall I pay 13$ a month too!<br />
Beautifully said!  Trh8skills!  But I'd wear one of those earrings!  Gimme it!  Oh, and my twink could use one too.  It doesn't matter that he's only level 60.  I pay for content damnit and I deserve one of those earrings just like everyone else!</div></div><hr />

If you're in a small family guild, then tough luck.  Stop crying because you can't exp in earth or fire.  That's one of the bonuses we get for having spent hundreds of hours working for these flags.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have put it as bluntly, but he's right. I voted no, hell no on the idea of opening the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
As for Time/elemental guilds thinking they deserve there own little xp playground that is wrong. Been there, done that. They should work at the very least as hard as every one else for xps and aa's. I'm sorry just because you spent crazy hours perfecting encounters doesn't mean you deserve zone modifiers for xps. Did you perfect those encounters just for fun? <br />
<br />
No, you perfected them for god darn the best loot in the entire game, leaps ahead of ANYTHING. You don't need xp bonuses to make up for that time missed raiding. Your raiding time was rewarded with items that have more hp bonuses and spell affects than most people see in a suit of armor.<br />
<br />
Its simple, your bonus for xp'ing there is everything isn't camped. You do not need xp bonuses. A guild of people that can play 20 times more hours than the average EQ player does not need xps bonues. Lose all the xp mods for the zones, be happy with the loot that sets you apart from the lower class EQ'ers(by a lot)and get on with your raids, loots the rewards, work as hard as everyone else for your aa's.<br />
<br />
The reason I said this is my friend is in a top guild. He had the nuts to tell me uberguilders should have zones that give them aa's faster than normal peoples zones. His reasoning was they raid all the time and are required to raid, so his free time is more important. He wasn't able to grasp his ft 14 and 3k and hp bonus items was his reward. He wanted to get aa's faster than the rest of Everquest as well. <br />
<br />
He's probally right, most uberguilders prolly think they are entiltled to their time lost raiding, as if they were doing public service. Make a friggin choice raid or xps. Raids net you loot you deserve for a well run 65 man guild, xps on the other hand should be on a equal level, no tier guild should be treated differently, you don't like to xp when in time? Well ****, neither does the guy in NToV or SSra you fool.</div></div><hr />

I'll just sit over by Maelin in PoK and wait for the GM to come deliver it to me. Better yet, save the GM's the hassle and patch the zones with 20-30 levers you can pull. Once you do that... *poof* level 65, maxxed AA, all spells in your spellbook, and all of the high end gear that you want.

There seems to be a lot of confused people here and this quote pretty much illustrates it.<br />
<br />
Opening up a zone in no way, shape or form equals giving people max AAs, all spells or the best equipment possible. What it does do is give people is a chance to get &quot;something&quot; or at the very least just see something new.<br />
<br />
All you ubers make it sound like opening up the elemental planes will enable people to zone into PoAir and run over and kill Xegony and get all the phat lewtz. Thats not gonna happen and most people wont be able to kill anything in those zones. But some WILL be capable enough to kill atleast something worthwhile. Why should they be artificially kept out of these zones? <br />
<br />
Obviously all zones in an expansion like PoP couldnt be free access at release but thats more than a year ago. Whatever time and effort you spent a year or half a year ago doesnt neccessarily have any value now. You did that at that time because you felt it was worthwhile. Talking about &quot;working&quot; and &quot;earning&quot; in a game always sounded wrong to me. You &quot;work&quot; and &quot;earn&quot; in real life where things are real and have value.</div></div><hr />

I think the original post was rather misleading, as it only provided a yes/no-situation.<br />
<br />
I stated already, that i am against a general, unrestricted opening of EPs, but i would find a discussion about flaws of PoP design and possible solutions (civil, even if it seems unlikely on some days) interesting.<br />
<br />
Gloriana, Jinheim in all honesty, i don't get your point - you state or describe several times, that you got screwed off valuable playtime and how crappy PoP progression design is. Should newer players also go through that fantastic design (heavy sarcasm), just because you had to deal with SoEs incompetence?

<br />
It started with the pre-elemental zones... All you have to do now is get a level requirement, and you can enter almost every part of pre-EP zones.<br />
<br />
Initially people had to cooperate in order to get that access. Now all someone has to do is spend time in a pre-PoP zone for exp, and viola!, they have access to zones in which the 'common' mobs have a *very* good chance of wiping them in no time flat. I occasionally go to PoV or other zones and they are relatively empty most of the time, because the majority of the people that 'benefitted' from the changes cannot handle the zones due to lack of experience and/or equipment. EQ does have a progression of sorts, but people don't like that... they want everything now, without the same effort as those before them.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with people wanting to go to Elementals, nothing is wrong with that, but the 'I pay 12.95 a month just like you so I should have access to everything you do' reasoning is not being reasonable. These people can get access the same way the rest of us did, by following the progression and getting the appropriate flags. No one is denying them anything. It's lack of will to do what people before them had to do to get this access.<br />
<br />
What you quoted from me was obviously sarcasm. I know that if I was not able to complete the requirements for getting access to certain areas, I wouldn't complain about it. I would however, try to put myself in the position to complete what people before me did in order to get that access.<br />
<br />
Would I group with people who don't have equipment appropriate for being in EP's?<br />

Definitley no. Simply because I would rapidly grow weary of waiting on people to get ressed after every pull.</div></div><hr />

My guild keeps track of points for bidding on items by logging the time that people are on raids.<br />
I checked my total number of hours I've raided for the past 2 months, starting from November 14th through January 13th, spending 107 hours of raiding time, but 12 days out of that I was on vacation which I would have continued to play EQ as I normally do otherwise, as well as Christmas/New Years being in there that screwed up raiding on a few days.<br />
<br />
107 hours over 61 days is 1.75 hours per day spent raiding.<br />
Considering there are 365 days in a year:<br />
365 * 1.75 = 639<br />
Considering I can get an AA in under 1 hour, I should have aproximately 853 AAs at present including the AAs I have from normal xping outside of raiding hours.<br />
(Don't even consider the minimal xp you get from raiding in that total.  I've probably gained about 1-2 AAs from raid xp alone in that time period, ie inconsequential)<br />
<br />
If we considered the the actual 46 days worth of raiding I could have been there ignoring the holiday season and vacation, it's more like 2.32 hours per day, which would give me 846 hours of playtime over the course of a year (still ignore holidays and vacation).<br />
<br />
Now consider you can get 51 points in an hour of LDON grouping very easily.<br />
Viewing the total the first way, I would have gained about 32589 ldon points in the last year.<br />
Viewing the total the second say, I would have gained about 43146 ldon points in the last year.<br />
32589 points in total is enough to buy 21 items @ 1492 points each.<br />
43145 points in total is enough to buy 29 items @ 1492 points each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">It started with the pre-elemental zones... All you have to do now is get a level requirement, and you can enter almost every part of pre-EP zones.<br />
Lol, I agreed with that change as well, and at the time was flagged for all of the 'opened' zones.  My only peeve is that I felt/feel tier 2 should have been 60 or 62, tier 3 62 or possibly 65.  No reason on earth to let 55s into a zone where most every mob is 62.  I feel this way on principle; flagging and indeed PoP as a whole was a bad idea.<br />
You are odd Gurck, you take bashes which I will take quotes if you want at the &quot;uberly guilded&quot; and yet when it comes back at you, you act is if they are the cause<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Its amazing what these threads turn into. The sense of entitlement in the world today baffles me too. <br />
   Paying your 13 bucks a month...why does it entitle you to just (you being in general) be able to walk into the EP's? IF someone states that opinion who is flagged than they are just trying to keep everyone down. its said You pay(again in general you)  your 13 bucks to be able to get to any zone in the game. If you spend the time you CAN get to ANY zone in the game. <br />
<br />
    Sony isnt making you pay more or pay less. You pay 13 bucks and you decide what to do with your time. If you cant or dont want to do raiding ( which is me i dont like raiding) than do i really need to be in ep's? Ornate armor is droppable at least so you can get around needing to actually go to pop to get some nice casual upgrades. Ldon gives me even more options and if i tired of that than i need to do what i need to do to get flagged. Sure the flagging system is redundant at times and a rework to streamline might be an answer but not just totally skipping most of it and freeing it up.<br />
<br />
   I understand the logic about not having to have your kids walk up hills both ways to and from school in the snow just cause you did it. But they also dont need to be chauffered to school and have someone carry their books for them.

Do you really think that no one have put in the effort and entered the elemental planes recently?

By completing these &quot;goals&quot; you derive &quot;enjoyment&quot;, but if you skip the effort/work step you will receive no &quot;enjoyment&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">As a study in human nature I'm enjoying this discussion.  My responses to responses to responses ad infinitum are below. <br />
For someone so fond of quoting, you sure missed the big one:<br />
Kinda blows a hole in your entire arguement...makes me wonder if this oversight was deliberate just to try to make your point.<br />
<br />
How does this refute my argument? Whether or not you wish to see the EP's is irrelevant if you're advocating that they remain closed indefinitely- that is what I take issue with. Also, I quote liberally so that there's no confusion as to whom or what I'm responding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd be pretty pissed if I paid the same amount of college tuition, and some random person who only periodically showed up for class, skipped doing homework, and goofed off a lot graduated when I had to do everything, just because he spent the same amount of money I did.<br />
<br />
Again, how is this relevant? Both paid the same fees and received access to the same opportunities, which is all I'm asking for with respect to opening the EP's.  I've never asked for equality of outcome, only equality of opportunity.  Getting access to the EP's does not mean that casuals will magically be wearing full EP armor, it simply means they have access to the zone.  Think NToV- it's open to the unwashed masses yet it's not like you're trained repeatedly while raiding there.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about you ask for maxxed tradeskills, a couple hundred free AA, and the ability to nail one of the developer's hot sisters...you paid your money, didn't you? You deserve it all with no effort of any kind.<br />
<br />
See point above.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A particularly bad example on your part. Add in Sebilis, Howling stones. The key quests to those zones were nowhere near as severe as the timeblocks into other raid-oriented content, but they were blocks and they did keep people out. Consequence? Those were MUCH more tolerable zones to hunt in than say, Karnors. KC was open to the mass, just like BoT is open to the masses now. Both zones are (or were, in KC's case, cause nobody goes there anymore) horror shows of awfulness. I'd prefer the elementals be allowed their relative pristine condition which only keeping the imbecilic hordes out will allow.<br />
<br />
Which one of the zones cited in your example required a raid force to gain access?  Killing the two frogs in TT for Seb?  Killing 2 L40ish mobs in LOIO and Kaesora?  You're not seriously comparing access to those two zones to access to the EP's? If so, I'd be more than happy if there were an alternate quest to gain entry to the EP's of the same difficulty as the zones you list.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I'm not elemental flagged, you will retract this bogus &quot;hypocrisy&quot; accusation IMMEDIATELY.<br />
<br />
Why should I? You're painting all casuals as &quot;greedy&quot; simply because they want the same opportunities as raid guilds.  I will reiterate my point that this is not asking for the same outcome (gear, aa's, etc...), just the opportunity.  This is a salient point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every single player in the game has exactly the same opportunities to experience all of the content. The only thing that prevents you from being elemental flagged is YOU. If you wanted to be in the elementals, you could be. You have CHOSEN to not be. Why should you be rewarded on the same level for CHOSING to not put forth the effort as other people?<br />
<br />
If this were true I'd be in the elementals right now, as would most casuals.  No, what prevents casuals from gaining access to the casuals is a variety of problems, mostly revolving around the time requirements to join an EP guild.  At no point in any of the EQ manuals or marketing material (particularly not for PoP) did I see verbage to the effect that you must play 4+ hours a night, 5+ days a week to qualify for a guild that is capable of unlocking these zones. Only  6/19 (roughly) zones were open to all at PoP's launch.  I didn't realize that there is only one way to play the game if you wish to see the majority of the content- join a top end EP guild and devote your entire free time to this pursuit.<br />
<br />
And it's not that time is the issue by itself- it's not like a casual can play 20 2 hour blocks and get the same rewards as an uber does who plays 8 5 hour blocks.  The rewards are not handled linearly, you are exponentially rewarded for investing your time in large, contiguous blocks.  <br />
<br />
<br />
While they never gave out percentages (and much like everything else you write, your numbers are wrong, by the way. Not counting PoTime at all, the elementals are 5 out of 21 zones in PoP<br />
Yes, but more than just the EP's are denied to casuals.  If this expansion were to follow its predecessors, PoTime alone should have been flagged/keyed/restricted.<br />
<br />
<br />
, which barely begins to approach 30%, nevermind 80.), it was stated repeatedly that PoP would be geared towards higher end content and raid-oriented guilds. If you somehow managed to miss that in the couple hundred times it was mentioned by the developers and repeated on dozens of class and server sites, then you have nobody to blame except yourself for being a bad consumer and buying a product for which you did no research. Either that, or you are just incredibly stupid. I'll let you pick which you prefer.<br />
Please show me the quote prelaunch where only 6/19 (or 21, not sure if you count subzones like PoNB) of the zones would be available to the average player.  You know why there is no such quote?  Because SOE knew damn well that no casual, which makes up the vast majority of the playerbase, would have paid to subsidize the enjoyment of a tiny minority of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Keep the discussion going, it's entertaining if nothing else.  I'm pleasantly surprised that no personal attacks have been made yet.  Those advocating the country club mentality have nothing to fear- EQ is geared 90% towards the hardcore raider and is not likely to change without serious competition that draws away the casual playerbase.  As that game does not yet exist, you have nothing to fear.  We proles won't be invading your country clubs anytime soon.<br />

I was very proud of her guild and her when they killed RZ because they deserved to be in the elemental planes. For those that want a way to quest your way into the elemental planes there already is one its called gather all the flags. If you can't complete this quest you have not earned your way in and quite honestly have no right to be there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, pretty sure on our server every flag mob but RZ has been killed with pickup raids. I am sure he will fall before long because, people not in uber guilds on our server  decided that it would be more effective to get together and try to kill their way into the elementals than cry their way in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, you are asking to skip the effort required to enter the elemental planes which is an entirely different thing. Acquiring access to the elemental planes is the reward of a repeated serie of encounters. Some of these encounters are incredibly dull and some are more challenging but almost none produces enough loot or are enjoyable enough to do them for any other reason than eventually getting into the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if your comparison to a raidzone that is 4 expansions old was supposed to be comical or not.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Everyone DOES have an equal opportunity to gain access to the elemental planes, that's what many are arguing.  There's no artificial barrier preventing anyone from gaining access.  It's kinda like saying, I only have time to play for an hour at a time at most and LDoN is BS because it takes any group I can join over an hour to do an adventure.  The opportunity is there, but your personal situation doesn't happen to allow you to fully experience that content.<br />
<br />
EQ is designed to be a social game, where your interactions with other people matter.  PoP took that to a higher level than before.  For raiding guilds, in many cases, that meant recruiting more people or forming alliances since many of those EP+ enabled guilds didn't sport 72 man raids regularly before PoP.  <br />
<br />
For the more casual player/guild it means the exact same thing.  If you want to access the higher planes, then you need to either recruit more people for your guild so that you can do the encounters required to get there or form alliances with other smaller guilds to allow you to do so.<br />
<br />
If you're completely unguilded, then you are stuck but that, again, is by your own doing.  PoP was marketed as an expansion aimed at the high end and specifically raid content.  Raid content implies guilds and those guilds are an integral part of the high level game.  There are high level 'casual' guilds with EP+ access, they just have a lot larger rosters than your more hardcore raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
That said, I do think they went overboard on the raid sizes in PoP.  What would have been ideal is if the encounters scaled to raid size.  If they made the encounters doable by 40ish people but people brough 70 then it trivializes the content.  Then if they limited the raid size to say 42 they'd be limited in what they could do with the encounters later on.  Scaleable encounters is what's missing.  I don't think anyone would be pissed if SoE managed to make the RZtWL encounter doable by 42 but at the same relative difficulty as the current incarnation, it'd also have to become more difficult for mega guilds that brought 72 people though, which is the trick.  How do you make an encounter similarly challenging for 42 and 72 people?  <br />
<br />
It would be incredibly nice if they had multiple raid sizes to choose from and encounters scaled based on your particular raid size, but that's hoping for a lot and honestly not very realistic.  Why would RZ go easy on you just because you brought 20 less people? :p<br />
<br />
RE: LDON<br />
The main reason people were upset that LDoN armor was so good was that in a comparable timeframe you could gain LDoN armor that was nearly on par with EP armor.  Now, to some that seems just fine.  You spend 40 hours raiding to get a new item, I spend 40 hours in a single group to get a new item.  The problem comes up because One of us spent 40 hours coordinating with 60ish guildmates to get that armor, while the other is doing simple xp grinds.  The level of difficulty of the encounters differs by several orders of magnitude, thus many felt it was screwed up for the quality of the rewards to be so similar.  risk vs. reward and all that.  <br />
<br />
Think back to old dungeons.  You could spend all day in Seb at the zone in grinding xp on easy frogs.  Another group goes down to the King camp.  Both groups spend the same amount of time at their respective camps.  Would you consider it balanced risk vs. reward if zone-in mobs dropped a Fungus Tunic that regenned 12hp/tick instead of 15?  it's slightly lower quality but the difference isn't nearly as much as the difference in difficulty to obtain.</div></div><hr />

As that game does not yet exist, you have nothing to fear.  We proles won't be invading your country clubs anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
90% geared towards the Hardcore raider?!?!  There are 6 zones in EQ and a handful of LDoN Raid encounters that are geared towards the current 'hardcore raider'  Pretty much the rest of EQ is wide open to more casual raiding guilds and down the scale of hardcoreness.<br />
<br />
What is only available to the hardcore raider today is the happy hunting ground for the casual player 1-2 expansions later.  <br />
<br />
Remember when everyone said only 1-2% of the playerbase would ever be able to see VP?  It's single groupable now for casual players.<br />
<br />
How about NToV/ST?  Key droppers for ST are killed with 1-3 groups easily now and NToV raids are something done by casual guilds when they can't find anything in luclin to kill<br />
<br />
VT?  The quest to get access is mostly single groupable/soloable and the rest is most certainly doable by any guild that raids with even fleeting regularity.<br />
<br />
The only thing off limits to the casual player is the CURRENT Top End, which is a FAR FAR cry from the 90% of EQ you claim, more like maybe 5% of EQ in total.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">There are a bunch of people on Brell that are now Elemental Flagged that are not in high end guilds, many aren't even in a guild.  They weren't even flagged by the top guilds.  There have been 2 or 3 people running raids against flag gods, all run on open invites.   They have gotten a bunch flagged for Elementals now.   I would not be surprised to see an open invite raid, made up of people not in the 6 &quot;Elemental&quot; Guilds on Brell, killing Elemental mold droppers in the next month or two.  Won't be long after that before they are going after Fennin as well.  Maybe its just Brell's long standing history of having people willing to run open invite raids that has helped this happen, but it is possible.<br />
<br />
So no, I don't think people too lazy to put in the effort to get themselves there should just be handed access.  If you want to play in a zone like Elementals, then you should have to do the work to get there.  If you want to play a less casual game, not raid high end zones, or not do all the flag work, then why are you even bitching about it?</div></div><hr />

Listen carefully, everybody received the same opportunities, which is receiving access to the EP's and even Time after a lot of sacrifices, dedication and time, everybody, you and me included.<br />
<br />
Everybody paid the same amount of $ for the PoP box, everybody pay the same 13$ monthly fee, everybody has a chance to gain acces to EP's, VT, VP, any single keyed/flagged zone, doing the same quest, working on their Tradeskill, leveling or grinding exp for their AA. All you have to DO is working and spend time on it.<br />
<br />
Nobody desserve free access to EP's more than anyone. You want it ? Do what's needed for it like everybody else did and who paid exactly the same ammount of $ for a PoP box.<br />
<br />
Do you have access to Sebilis or HS ?<br />
Don't you invested the time for this ?<br />
<br />
Do you have access to VP, ST or VT ?<br />
If so, don't you made the efforts of the huge time-sink quests as everybody who has access ?<br />
If not, do you think that someone else will do it for you or do you want that SoE give you free pass too ?<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, while you don't play a lot (as I understood) ask SoE to give you free AA to compete with those who spend a lot more time than you could/would.<br />
Frankly, you paid the same bucks than me no ? so you desserve the same TS than me and as you can't play (won't play ?) as much as me, SoE should give you them for free too, you paid the same bucks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">I'm sure this has been mentioned in the 140+ replies to this vote, but I think opening up the existing planes (BoT/PoV/other one) was a bad idea for EQ.<br />
<br />
I've played for a bit over two years now and have leveled a few chars to the fifties before sticking with a shaman as my main.  Although I have benefited from the opening of PoV and BoT with experience groups that sailed me from 60 to 65, I think it was a horrible decision.  As a casual player, getting to 60 wasn't the easiest to do.  Lots of grinding and dealing with the typical DL morons and such.  I planned on getting to 65 via soloing, partnering with my 65sk roommate, and working my way through the first tier planes.<br />
<br />
Now that PoV is open, people can warp from the high 50s to 65 in a week's time.  Until getting to 60, I was happy to get 10% a level a night.  The result is a huge amount of new people to the game, especially obnoxious children, who are newly 65 after playing the game for 3 months.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, I think the whole planes should only be accessed via a quest for roleplaying purposes.  You should only be able to gain access to these elite planes by doing some kind of initial quest.  It makes sense because you are essentially starting a massive quest to take on all the gods.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to the opening of the planes.  Opening PoV/BoT/CoD trivializes the original quest to get in them.  Besides loot and the charm upgrade, you don't need to follow the storyline involved.  To some, of course, that is not important, because they are not looking for the storyline, they are looking for the &quot;phat lewtz.&quot;  I would bet that the vast majority of people have no idea why things are they are in the world.  They don't understand the stories that go along with the dark elves, the conflicts in kunark between the races, or the story behind the hole.  To me, reading about these things makes the game much more enjoyable.  And I think players are missing fun aspects of the game pre-PoP like their first trip to kunark via TD or velious via IC.  The game is still fun, but different.  I'm just happy I was there to be a part of that era.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm rambling like usual.  In closing, why trivialize more of the planes quests?  Keep them closed and have people work through the process like they were designed.  In the end, is the game only about armor and weapons?  I would hope not, else I've wasted 2 yrs of my like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Why do you want to see the zones (4 zones)?<br />
Because you are entitled to it? Then the VT/ST/VP **** comes to my mind again. And if you want to come there for exp, its only fire and earth that are anything to exp in really. Sure, water can be nice too but it aint &quot;that&quot; nice. And if you dont have atleast a VT equiped (or similar) group when exping there you will be in trouble as the the mobs hit kinda hard. And if you only want to see the zones you should do as Arriana posted, way easier :)<br />

<br />
I voted no and my guild clears Time every 5 days. Why would I vote to deny people access to areas I can hunt in and have been able to for many many months?<br />
<br />
1. Some people, in fact I would say a majority of the players of EQ lack the skills, attention spans or the plain patience to play successfully in PoE, PoF, PoWater, PoAir doesn't count simply because the place is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.<br />
2. Raid mobs and events are spread around the zones and one accidental or deliberate train can derail the work of hours collecting a raid together. We have ALL of us been trained accidentally or deliberately at some point in our EQ careers, most of us more times than we can recall.<br />
3. Blanket EP access would totally derail any concept of progression which to a large extent is part of the PoP design<br />
4. Having been in Fire, Water, Earth and Air when there are more than 70-80 toons there the zones grind to a halt making play at the least deeply unpleasant and typically impossible.<br />
5. Exp spots as pointed out by others in this thread are so limited that the Ele planes simply cannot support the density of players seen in places like Valor, BoThunder and Storms.<br />
<br />
By design the Ele planes are raid zones like VT is and VP originally was. There are multiple reasons these areas are access restricted some of which I have touched on, but they are common sense when you think about it.<br />
<br />
(edited grammatical cockup)<br />
<br />
Incidentally when it comes to the exp argument I make exp not drastically worse than ele planes in decent LDoN groups and to be honest I find LDoN grouping a lot more fun than ele planes grinding.</div></div><hr />

Luclin, POP, Yeshka, Ldon?<br />

Emperor is merely 3 expansions later.  And hes doable with 2-3 groups.<br />

And to which you have yet to come up with even one single valid reason for. All you seem capable of is &quot;I pay my $13 like everyone else&quot;. You don't pay your money for access to content, you pay your money for server fees, bandwidth fees, employee salaries, and profit margin. Your monthly fee entitles you to NOTHING besides the ability to log into the game. What you choose to do with your time, and how much time you spend is entirely up to you. Some things are harder than others. Some things take a substantial amount of effort. If you are not willing to do what is required, what entitles you to the reward for doing it?<br />
<br />
Both paid the same fees and received access to the same opportunities, which is all I'm asking for with respect to opening the EP's.<br />
<br />
Well, through the magic of reality...*waves arms, makes mystical gestures, intones strange words*...There, you now have exactly the same opportunities as every other player in the game to access the elemental planes. You can thank me by way of personal check made out to cash.<br />
<br />
 Think NToV- it's open to the unwashed masses yet it's not like you're trained repeatedly while raiding there.<br />
<br />
Yea, but its not. Most of the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; can't navigate through Sirens. Or West Wastes. They can't kill flurry drakes. Sontalak wears their guts for garters. There's no key to get into ToV, but it is hardly an open access zone.<br />
<br />
You're not seriously comparing access to those two zones to access to the EP's?<br />
<br />
Are you just trying to be argumentative for the sake of it, or did you not even bother to read what I wrote? Let's try all caps, maybe it will get through:<br />
<br />
NO I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY COMPARING ACCESS TO THOSE TWO ZONES TO ACCESS TO THE EPS. IN FACT I WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO INDICATE THAT GETTING TO THOSE TWO ZONES WAS A LOT EASIER THAN GETTING INTO RAID ZONES. My comparison was what happens to zones that are restricted (The EPs) vs zones that are open (BoT, KC) as yet another reason to not open the EPs. If I had my way about it, every non-city/outdoor wilderness zone in the entire game would require doing something for access. Want to go to Befallen? Do a quest. Want to go to Unrest? Do a quest. Cazic-Thule? Karnor? Lower Guk? Sebilis? Quest.<br />
<br />
You're painting all casuals as &quot;greedy&quot; simply because they want the same opportunities as raid guilds.<br />

No, I'm painting &quot;all casuals&quot; who want the EPs opened for free access as greedy. Because you are. You already have the same opportunities. You choose not to take advantage of them. My former guildmates (as a memory refresher, they are in Time now) ask me on a regular basis to rejoin the guild. I do not, because I don't want to get invested in the whole raid/backflag/etc culture. It's one of the reasons I left the guild in the first place. My choice. The difference between you and me is that I can live with the consequences of my choice without whining for things that I haven't earned. I'm 30 points of tailoring away from having 250 skill in every tradeskill. I'd love to have the Aid Grimel earring, but I'm cogniscent of the fact that I will not get it. I live in reality, you live in a virtual welfare state where people who don't earn things through every fault of their own are entitled to them anyway. Grow the hell up.<br />
<br />
No, what prevents casuals from gaining access to the casuals is a variety of problems, mostly revolving around the time requirements to join an EP guild.<br />
<br />
This is your decision to make. You can prioritize EQ and joining an EP-capable raid guild. You do not want to. That's fine. But you also shouldn't be rewarded like someone who does want to. The real world works the same way. People who take time out for family, max out their vacation time, use all their sick days, etc...don't get paid as much or promoted as rapidly as people who dedicate themselves more to their job. Why should they? They contribute less. They deserve less. They make the choice, they live with the consequences. You make the time for what is important. If getting to the EPs was important, you'd be there. Saying anything else is just lies and/or excuses.<br />
<br />
At no point in any of the EQ manuals or marketing material (particularly not for PoP) did I see verbage to the effect that you must play 4+ hours a night, 5+ days a week to qualify for a guild that is capable of unlocking these zones.<br />
<br />
Which is a good thing, since this is patently untrue. <br />
<br />
 If this expansion were to follow its predecessors, PoTime alone should have been flagged/keyed/restricted.<br />
<br />
And if Luclin had followed its predecessors, it would have been fun. Change is the only constant. A static game is a boring game. BTW, this statement is also inaccurate. Areas within Ssra require special access, not just VT. Inner acrylia used to require the worst access quest in the game, until the devs gave up on the zone completely and opened it with a revamp that took out most of the old loot....nobody goes there. There's a good option for you. Open the EPs, remove all the elemental molds and mini-boss drops. See how popular they are from the casuals you claim to defend (as opposed to your own greed and self interest, which is what you are actually trying to defend).<br />
<br />
EQ is geared 90% towards the hardcore raider and is not likely to change without serious competition that draws away the casual playerbase.<br />
<br />
This is a joke, right? Everquest consists of some 240 zones, and you are sitting there with a straight face and trying to tell us that over 200 of these are geared towards the hardcore raider? Puff-puff-give...you clearly messed up the rotation and it is affecting your brain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Since this is becoming a uber vs. casual arguement, then how about this compromise?<br />
<br />
It's very simple.  SoE places a quest into the game that allows a single group or raid force of no more than 20 get access to PoFire, and ONLY PoFire. This quest will be very, very long (at least 6 months to complete), very hard, and would be IMPOSSIBLE to accomplish if the people conducting it did not have the gear or skills to survive in PoFire in the first place.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat that, as it sounds vaguely important.<br />
<br />
The quest would be impossible for people who DID NOT HAVE THE GEAR OR SKILLS TO SURVIVE IN THE PLANE OF FIRE IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br />
<br />
How can people who already have elemental access possibly complain about this?  If a group that has the gear to do the quest, spends some 6 months finishing the quest, and exhibits the skills necessary to complete the quest, manage to finish the quest and gain access to Fire, what argument can you pose against it?<br />
<br />
I do not have elemental access, but don't have the time to raid, nor do I want to leave my guild.  My guild is small, but it is also filled with people who are frighteningly good at this game, and we are impressively geared for a guild that does not raid.  If me and my smaller guild can display the skills and gear, and manage to complete a quest to get access to ONE elemental plane that would take us nearly as much time as it took you to get FULL elemental access, how can you complain?  After all, we don't want to do raids in Fire...all we want is the chance to see the zone and maybe take on the yard trash.<br />
<br />
And the newbie argument may not be used.  Everyone who sets foot into Fire for the first time is a newbie.  Sure, we'd make some mistakes, but we'd learn not to do that again.<br />
<br />

If no one would do all the flagging to get into the elementals then there would be too many. If people are willing to do them, and are in fact still doing them, then there are not too many. No one will argue that there are a lot and it is very time consuming to do them all.<br />

The events eliminated from flagging requirement will need to stand on their own merits.  They will probably be up more, and the slower, less fast paced &quot;family&quot; guilds will find them more attractive targets as a result.  <br />
<br />
This is a bit off the cuff, but that's the sort of thing that runs through my mind.  <br />
<br />
Less flagging/backflagging, but still some sense of separation so folks who need to can feel special.  I appreciate that sense, because it is a key aspect of the addictive power of EQ.  Things should be hard; but while they should be hard, at some point just making something a headache as way of making it hard fails as a design theory.  <br />

<br />
I disagree Zooce.  VP, ST, and VT are all still locked and in some cases still visited by elemental guilds.  The gear in VT is still better than 90% of tier 1-3 PoP zones.  The only problem I see is since there is more than one zone requiring flags people complain more.  They feel they are being cheated of more than they have in the past and now want to complain about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the reality is that SoE isn't going to go back at this point and spend that much time/money making quests that are truly appropriate and balanced with the difficulty of getting elemental access for full guilds as is.  Thus, the simple answer is to form alliances with other smaller guilds and get access that way.  There are servers out there where this is happening already and with the inevitable mudflation of GoD it'll only be easier to do with less people as time goes on.  It's sort of a tradition in EQ, &quot;trivializing&quot; older content.<br />
<br />
Your options, realisitically:<br />
A. join a a guild that's EP+ enabled or making the push and progress towards it.<br />
<br />
B. Form an alliance with multiple smaller guilds to do the same.<br />
<br />
C. wait for mudflation to make it such that a small guild can gain EP access without outside help.  <br />
<br />
D. complain loudly and wait several expansions until either EQ is dead or mudflation has gone so far as to make it possible for a single group to access EPs. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
7 flags is enough.<br />
<br />
The events I've excluded from requirements will likely require some modification so people will actually do them.  That's a good thing.  It's ass that the only reason some mobs die is for flags.  The event should be fun, interesting, visually striking, something - and the loot needs to be appropriate for the effort.  <br />
<br />
But if it's just all about flags, they can get sloppy with the design and folks just muddle through because a lot of them are sheep.  Like me, because I just wanted the flags and to hang out with the guild.  <br />
<br />
But the gameplay can certainly be improved, and it's ok to expect that out of SOE.</div></div><hr />

I guess they'll never figure out that not all people feel the need to do all those things no matter how good of a player they are.  They just have fun doing what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Better palyers?  Not necessarily at all.  Better guilds, better gear?  More than likely.  Anyone who flaunts their zone access as being a better player is immature at best.  Im a mob away from Ele access.  On most of the raids to get where I am at, it took me several times before I actually knew what to expect, and how to maximize my effeciency for the raid. The first couple times I was just trying to make sure I didint get lost or wipe the raid!   I am far from a better player than most, and certainly not as well geared as most.  (Although I'm getting there)  The issue for many and my primary concern is unnecessary crowding of zones, and those greedy peeps that will do *anything* to get a peice of gear to sell.  One poster said it would be great to have sol ro access for the ornate drops. (I am NOT calling that poster greedy) That is why BoT is so crazy.  Sol Ro at the times I go for exp groups there has been 16-24 peeps max, minus a guild raid going on.  I like  that.  (And the ornate drops havent yet impressed me)   <br />
<br />
My advice is to level and get guilded in a guild that help you to attain your goals, and you theirs.  The further opening of of any zones would be detrimental.<br />
<br />
In addition are the many numerous ebayed toons on servers nowadays that are clueless as to what they are doing.  I have witnessed first hand in tier one zones just how aggravating it is to be grouped with a tank, cleric or chanter that thinks he or she knows what they are doing becasue they have a lvld character.  omg no way do i want to see them in tier 3 and higher content.  :mad: <br />

What kind of math do you guys use?  This number is only valid if you assume that everyone who CAN log into a server DOES every night. <br />
<br />
That obviously doesn't happen.  500,000 play EQ?  What, 31 servers?  16,129 people a server, roughly.  How many have Time/Elemental access?  A reasonable percentage are bots or dead accounts or whatever.  But 2% of a server population with Elemental/Time access sounds about right to me.  Some, like Stormhammer are probably a bit higher, or maybe E'ci or Brell.  <br />

<br />
<br />
This is true.  <br />
<br />
However, in order for that guild to have earned the flags as far as they are, they have shown and proven themselves able to be organized and have their act together in killing the pre-elemental Gods.  So, having said that, once they are in the EP's, more than likely they will have a systematic approach to the encounters there and *endangering* only themselves.</div></div><hr />

Movie opens up you have been dying to see.  You arrive hours before anyone else to get a ticket and be first in line.  However, after you get your ticket the owners say they are going to allow those who bought tix last to be seated first.  Bogus?  Definitly.  It took several several times of dropping a good Xp group when guild leader gave an OTM, just to arrive and see that another guild beat your guild to the flagging mob and began the script, leaving you to wait another 3 days for an attempt.  <br />
<br />
Then, once you get the script, you wipe at say, Bertoxx, wait another 3 days,... Dadgummit!  Not enough clerics to do him... another 3 days... rinse and repeat until you finally have it together and clicking on all cylinders to beat the boss and get your flag!  Now that is an awesome feeling!  Then to see those who want access to a zone I am now in becasue they want to get some lewt or whatever, without *earning* the flag?  It rubs alot of peoiple wrong and for good reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">I don't think that just anyone should have access to the Elemental Planes.  Being level 65, even 65 with a ton of aa's isn't sufficient proof that you can handle the mobs in question.  I DO, however, think that there should be alternate access quests for the EP zones.  Preferably quests that can be accomplished by one or two groups of SKILLED players who know how to play their class to the fullest.  Further a few flag checks in the scripts for triggered events could go a long way toward making it impossible for people who gained access via alternate means from accidentally triggering said events.  (Have the mobs be untargetable to people who don't have the raiding flags and have the mobs utterly ignore anyone that can't target them.)<br />
<br />
I'm part of a tiny guild on the Rathe.  As a guild, we don't have enough active players interested in raiding to even begin to work on flagging.  (And as for pickup flagging raids on the Rathe, don't make me laugh.  The vaunted rotation system they have in place on the server keeps there from being any such things on any significant scale.)  If I were to ever want to see the elemental planes, I'd have to leave my friends and join one of the big, uber guilds.  I'd have to sacrifice time with my RL family to spend time in raids where I'm just one more shaman so that I can earn points to buy loot.  And as a casual player (I don't have 4+ hours a night to spend playing Everquest, I have this little thing called a life and it places significant demands on my time) I would gain NOTHING from having that sort of access to the EP's.  HOWEVER, there are a handful of people in my guild who are outstanding players of their classes.  This small, core group would probably be fully capable of handling xp mobs on the EP and would love to have the access just to try it out and see how we'd fare.  We're exactly the kind of people who'd make a run at completing alternate access quests for the planes we can't get raid access to, irregardless of the difficulty of said quests.  For that matter make the access quests of comparable difficulty only scaled for much, much smaller groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">No way EP should be opened up to the masses! Number one reason is these zones are designed for big raids to kill gods. There are not very many areas in EPs that can be held as exp camps. Safe spots are rare and multiple wandering adds are the norm. I cannot understand why anyone not planning on raiding would want to go there except to just see the zone and probably get killed (Edit*...while trying to get exp. The zones are small and as I said raid oriented. Let the masses in and no one would ever get a flag)<br />
<br />
I get a real kick out of the 'small family oriented guild' people who say it requires no skill, work or dedication to get into PoTime. If that is true then why aren't you there? I had to quit a guild I belonged to for years leaving friends, that go way back several RPG games ago, behind. Those people are still my friends and we love to get together and do stuff in EQ. That was not an easy decision and I fretted over it for months. Finally I decided I wanted to see the rest of the world of Norrath badly enough.<br />
<br />
As far as skills go it is not just enough to wear nice gear or speak ubertalk. My guild, Talons, on CT server has requirements that are tough to accomplish just to get in as an applicant. They require alot of work to accomplish. Once you are an applicant all members are required to report their feelings and findings about you to the membership. Believe it or not, at first, most people have no idea how to act or what to do on a big raid. We attempt to teach potential members. Unfortunately, sometimes people lack the ability to learn. For one reason or another not everyone is able to learn how to participate properly. Those people are very nicely asked to leave and wished good luck. We invest alot of our time going back to do flags for these recruits. It's a shame to see someone not fit in after you've spent innumerable hours participating in extremely boring back flagging just for them.<br />
<br />
My last comment is about people that think you cannot get to PoTime unless you have no real life. I am married with 3 children, aged 19, 20, and 22. I own my own business and work full-time. Check out my Magelo and tell me that again. And please stop your whining!<br />

I am sick to death of hearing you whiners who don't have EP access criticize those who do. Sick of it. You can have a life and get to the EP's.

Don't put those people down who have managed to use their online time effectively towards flagging. We are all different but just because you aren't in the zones you wish to be there is absolutely no need to make assumptions of the lives of those people who are there.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, just perhaps, you suck at EQ. There, I said it. Someone had to. All I see is EP flagged people arguing with non EP flagged people about the dumbest things. If you can't find a way to progress without losing your in game friends and without raiding 80 hours a week you suck.<br />

<br />
How can a casual player who only plays 1-2 hours an night, 3-4 days a week get elemental access?<br />
<br />
All I've heard from the elemental flagged people is how long and hard it is, focusing on the long.  Every single EP flagged person has harped about how they spend hour upon hour upon hour getting flagged.<br />
<br />
Some people don't have the options to take all those hours and lump them together.  They have to get in their hours here and there, which isn't conducive to raiding.<br />
<br />
You say he might be a bad player because he can't juggle real life with EQ time and manage to get flagged, but answer my above question before you answer his question again.<br />
<br />
Yes, my friend, there do happen to be casual players who are quite good at this game.  There's just some (me included) who simply do not have the time it takes to go through the flag progression.  That's why I favor the idea of an alternate quest format to get EP access.<br />
<br />
The quest can be just as long as it takes to get EP access, but more friendly to those of us who can't sit in front of the computer all night every night.</div></div><hr />

Its those leetist punks that think that you should have to attend classes *Every day* and *Do Homework* to get a degree, what a load of crap!!  I pay the same as them, I should have everything they do.<br />
<br />
Whats that? Well no I have other things to do rather than be in classes. No I dont do homework, that stuff takes *forever*!!! Why should I take a test to progress IM PAYING FOR THIS!!<br />
<br />
Its the teachers and the college catering to these leetist snobs!!<br />
<br />
Sounds really realistic like that, doesnt it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The other thing is Ya there is an XP modifier, but you do realize that only about 3 classes can solo in any EP zone and none of them are shaman. (ya ya ya stuff it about 1 camp in PoF those of us there know about it) All these zones are about High end raid targets surrounded by trash, the trash and maybe a very rare named trash, is the only thing you can hope to kill with less than 40ish highly equiped highly skilled toons. <br />
<br />
So with that said even if you did get in, you STILL wouldnt have any one to play with for the 1 hour a night your on, and you STILL couldnt kill anything that has a loot table, you would STILL get faster XP in a tier 3 zone (cause you arent gonna tank this stuff without pure VT or EP/Time lvl gear) and you STILL would be all ticked off that there was no content after you did this big &quot;Flag quest&quot;. <br />
<br />
I dont think you really grasp that, other than the occassional XP group in 1 of maybe 7 viable camps out of all the EP zones, requiring 5 well equiped toons each camp (some very difficult to get to if at all) there is nothing there, and the XP is faster in LDoN HARD and easier to get (thats why they made LDoN). Even EP lvl guilds tend to gravitate towards LDoN for XP (and points for cool Augs)<br />
<br />
Oh ya and let me clear this up to, the tradeskill thing, 90% of these mobs you will be able to kill dont even have items in thier loot table to make planar tradeskill armor (which is definatly less than ornate or LDoN to begin with). So you wont even be able to progress in that direction, you'll have to trust me on this one.<br />
<br />
 I do think there aught to be some method of questing items for the earring quest in Non EP zones though, like some med difficulty quest yields a regua claw or other EP drop and a higher difficulty quest yielding a Hope Stone. This would solve both the timesink (EQ requires any itme to have) and the access to completing the item without flags. I mean hey there enough BS drops in HoH, Torment and BoT already whats so hard throwing a few more no drop quest items in there.</div></div><hr />

You chose to go get popcorn and a soda instead of watching the movie.  That's fine, it's your choice.  Are you complaining because they didn't bring them to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">Ummm.  Exactly what do you plan on doing in the elemental planes, people?  You cannot exp in PoAir--everthing sees invis and you can't get past the first island without clearing a lot of stuff that frankly, sucks.  NO ONE exps there.<br />
<br />
PoWater--there are basically 1 or 2 decent camps here, and it's death to casters.  Got agro?  Buh-bye.  Push in water is horrendous, and you can't channel through it without being wedged into a corner (of which there are precious few).  Mobs quad 1k+ unless you're at the ZI.  Then they only hit for like 900s.<br />
<br />
PoEarth or PoFire?  Yeah, there are some exp spots in there.  If you include BOTH zones, I believe you can reasonably have maybe 10 groups there at any one time for exp, and that is really pushing it.  These zones aren't well designed for exp--they're designed for raids!  If you can't raid enough to get into the zone, wth do you think you're going to do IN the zones?<br />
<br />
Tradeskill stuff?  Maybe--though you've still got to kill the things!  Train 'ubers'?  Probably.  There are mini-named in most of the zones that smaller guilds without the equipment to actually get to the elementals might be able to kill with a couple of groups--mini's in PoWater, PoFire, and PoE (forget PoAir, really).  However, at the risk of sounding like a complete jerk, exactly why should you have access to those?  Did you have access to the NToV drops off flurry drakes back in velious?  That is, did you have access to NToV when velious was new AND without someone else clearing Aary for you?  Was there an alternate quest to get into NToV just so you could do flurry drakes?  Same thing here!<br />
<br />
Contrary to what you may have heard, the elementals are not well designed for exp.  They have good exp, but there are darn few camps, and the mobs do major dps.  That stuff is hard.<br />
<br />
As of right now, I think there are DARN few casual players who play 1-2 hours a night for 3-4 days a week that are even close to being equipped to handle yard trash that quads for 1k.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">Some of these analogies off analogies are really stupid.<br />
<br />
Can we just talk about game design and what is or is not better?  <br />
<br />
I think the current PoP flagging system is stupid and can be vastly improved.  <br />
<br />
Evidently a lot of folks think it's just right.  Whether that's because of inertia, or because they've suffered and everyone else should suffer too, or because they genuinely think it's the best design principle is anyone's guess.  <br />
<br />
Let's give the strawman indignation routine a rest.  <br />
<br />
Tuffy, I checked out your magelo.  If you play less than 40 hours a week, I'd be shocked.  Between your flags and your LDON gear with augments, that's serious time investment.  <br />
<br />
The disparity in time committed to the game is *A* factor in what you get out of it, but it should not be *THE* factor alone that matters.  Ultimately,  people who can't commit large blocks of CONSISTENT time will not advance.  A few here and there might get lucky, but as large scale rule, the vast majority will not.  Anyone who argues otherwise is simply wrong.  <br />
<br />
Reducing the number of flags lets folks commit to some raids, but not the extreme number PoP now requires.  <br />
<br />
For me, it's like old Fear/Hate raids.  Folks who never really raided could play &quot;hooky&quot; once in a while and suck it up for what then were 12 hour marathons.  It was a lot of fun.  The extreme number of PoP flags really works against people like this, and I think it's unfortunate.  <br />
<br />
I'll get my flag for EP soon enough, I just think the current design is a bad one, and it should change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">If you cannot manage to get the time at keyboard to do it then I feel for you. Because that is what is required. Opening these planes to the masses will basically mess them up the way BoT is messed up now except worse. No one will manage to kill one of the gods because not only will there be massive lag but idiot kids messing up the steps needed or just getting in the way or training.<br />
<br />
If there is a reason why you cannot get into EP, be it time constraints or whatever, then you need to get over it. Move on, explore other areas of the game, or quit and try some other game that requires less time. I'm not saying you aren't a great skilled player or anything like that. I'm just saying these zones are MADE for big raids not one or 2 group experience camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">First off, want to reply to something said two pages back, that elemental planes shouldnt be better exp then all the tier 1 thru 3 planes.  So, mobs that hit for 750 to 950, with dot procs, partially mitigate slow, run faster then sow, and have approx 35k hps (or more), should be the same exp as killing a young bat in PoNightmare, that hits for 250?  Hrmmm.  No.<br />
<br />
Secondly, as has been stated many times by many people (and more eloquently then me), paying the same subscription fee does not mean you should have access to all the same zones.  I see alot of people complaining about the time they can NOT play, and invest into flagging, to gain EP access.  That's no different then not having the time to invest to key yourself for ST, or VP, or VT.  All zones should not be equal.  If they were, you would have one set of people (either those that want to raid hard core, but the game is full of quests and GM events... or the casual people, that every zone was a quest to get keyed into, and was a raid zone) quickly leave the game.  <br />
<br />
In previous expansions, it was always 1 to 4 zones that were *raid* material.  (Kunark - Seb, HS, VP... Velious - Ntov, Dain, Yelinak, ST... Luclin - Ssra, Inner Acrylia, VT)  If you wanted to see those zones, or encounters, or kill those mobs, you had to invest time.  OR, be allied with another group of people, to have the sufficient numbers around on any given night to try.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my final point.  For all you saying you can not invest the time to be EP access, it IS possible.  I have several friends, spread over several guilds, from when we all were guilded together back in 1999.  Of the Time capable guilds (on Quellious), one is Hardcore that requires a certain number of raid hours per week, or you get booted.   A couple of us joined this guild, for their ability to keep their guild roster below 80, yet get crap dead efficiently, and we had the time requirement to give them.  Some joined another guild, where there roster varies from 110 to 140 people, with a fair amount of casual people.  They circumvent the required hours of raiding per night, per person, by inflating the roster to have enough people on each night to get crap dead.  NOTHING wrong with this, but was the approach they chose to take.  And the last guild flagged for Time, is an alliance, with both guilds having an average 70 to 90 person roster, for an average of 140 people for a given raid.  For these two allied guilds, neither have a *if you are you must raid* requirement.  You decide to do what you want with your time, and if its raiding tonight, then you head off to raid with everyone else.  If it's tradeskilling, you sit off and tradeskill while everyone else raids.<br />
<br />
Final point?  You dont have to have a certain hours per day to invest in getting to EP.  BUT, you do have to have the commitment to want to get there.  If you chose not to invest that commitment, then you have nothing to complain about.  There are many many options to getting EP access (from joining a raiding guild, to a family raiding guild, to alliances, to pick up raids, etc etc etc), you just have to have the desire to get there. <br />
<br />
PS. I didnt get into EP flagged guilds, cause currently our server has 7 guilds flagged for elementals, all with different raiding requirements, and raid hours, so it would of made the post more long winded then it already is.  The three Time flagged guild guilds pretty much convered the gambit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">I think you'd be surprised how well geared a &quot;casual&quot; player can get.<br />
<br />
Not me, I'm not quite there yet, but I'm working on it.  ;)<br />
<br />
But the point is:  if a casual player has the gear and has the skill, why would you object to him gaining access to the EPs through an alternate quest?  Or would you insist on him going through a process that he quite simply does not have the time to complete in order to take the next step?<br />
<br />
By devoting one's self to LDoN, a player can outfit himself with gear and augs that would feasibly allow him and a group of similarly equipped people to hold their own against yard trash in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Why can this excellently equipped group by denied the chance to test themselves against the mobs in the EPs because they don't have the time due to personal schedules to complete the flags?<br />
<br />
Remember, they're not there for minis, they're not there for raids.  They're only there to test themselves against the yard trash.  That's it.<br />
<br />
Again, you evaded the basic premise of my argument. What logical reason can you provide to deny a group that has the ability and the equipment to xp in the elementals outside of the ordeal that YOU had to undertake to reach it?<br />
<br />
After all, your ordeal allows you to raid and take on the mobs that drop the uber gear.  Group A up there is only there to take on the yard trash.  They know it, you know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can someone explain to me exactly why the EP flagged folks have to come up with any other reason than that? Are we bad people if we can't?<br />
<br />
I'll give you one.... so tons of well geared uber small groups have done the alternate quest and are happily xp'ing in the planes because it's candyland and the aa's are flowing up to about 12 an hour (or whatever it is you all think). Suddenly it hits you that there are a whole bunch of contented xp'ers in the zone. Why not get together and take a named on. Hell yeah! But how do we do it?<br />
<br />
Lets piss and moan that we can't raid here which sucks because we have proven we can xp here. blah blah blah blah blah. Get something given to you for next to nothing and you will want more. Not necessarily you directly Binter, but all the rest of the people who would be there but don't frequent these boards so they can't slam me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">That's the difference between my idea for the alternate quest and the flag system.<br />
<br />
If you're in via the quest, you cannot raid bosses or do events for the flags to get to Time.  They can very easily reflag bosses and raid events so that if you're not FLAGGED into EP, you can't touch them, they ignore you, and you can't activate a flagging event.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Btw, if a number of XP groups did happen to band together and drop a non time-flag named in a raid, how different is that from, say, the PoV IC group seeing the Sleepwalker pop, then calling in the extra people needed to take him out?  If the quest is hard enough to get alternate flagging into EP, shouldn't they be allowed to take on the non-raid level mini nameds?<br />
<br />
After all, the quest was just as hard as what you went through to get elemental flagged...it just worked a different way.<br />
<br />
I think that's where you and I are diverging here.  I'm not talking about a cakewalk with this quest.  I'm talking about something VERY long and VERY hard.  Something that would take at least six months to finish, and be impossible to complete if you don't have the gear to survive in the EPs in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
While that maybe an emotionally satisfying reason to leave the current system in place, its not really a valid one.  Think of every troll shadow knight you know that played from opening.  They apparently required twice as much xp to get to 50 as a halfling rogue thanks to hybrid and racial experience penalties lumped together.  Do you think every person who creates a troll shadow knight today should be required to suffer through that simply because some other folks had to?  <br />
<br />
I remember when hell levels were first removed.  People who were 60 at the time wailed to the heavens about how everybody would have it easier from then on, and how Sebilis would be full of morons and &quot;n00bz&quot; who would ruin their game experience.  Do you think hell levels should be reinstituted simply because some portion of the player base had to slog through them?<br />
<br />
There are plenty of valid arguments to leave the elemental planes closed, but the time investment of those who are already flagged isn't one of them.  Things change.  What was once difficult and monotonous becomes easy and fast, especially in something as malliable as Everquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ele planes were made for raids. If you don't have to raid to get there then how the heck are you gonna do anything once you get there? Who knows maybe a couple expansions from now the big raiding guilds will have moved on. If that is the case then I wouldn't object if they changed access to a hard quest. I suppose someone with the patience of a saint might organize a pick up Fenn Ro raid. Good luck with the Council of Rathe!<br />

Of course it might work better if they just took these near impossible god encounters out of the game and made Ele planes pure exp zones with say a medium-hard quest to gain access to PoTime....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Binter, this comment is exactly what I was talking about. You will not be satisfied. You began by arguing for a quest that would enable you to xp and xp only the yard trash in the EP zones, stating that the quest should not allow you to take on raid mobs.<br />
<br />
You end it by saying why shouldn't those folks be able to...<br />
<br />
In less than 20 minutes you have proven that it just simply wouldn't be good enough for you. Therefore I think you should have full access to the EP zones. I have never said you shouldn't. HOWEVER, knowing that you will want to try the raid content, or be able to, you will have to flag yourselves to see it. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: You said mini named/named not raid content but its the same argument. You wanted xp, now you want loot. mini's wouldnt be enough. You would want more. ad infinitum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Heck, I'd be satisfied just seeing them.<br />
<br />
I'm going under the premise that random names popping out in yard trash land are considered trash themselves.  ;)<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about the raid-level guys.  Kinda like Droga, you see, just the ability to take out the nameds that pop around the zone. A single quested-in group probably wouldn't be able to take one down, but a combined effort from 2-3 of them probably could.<br />
<br />

On the other hand when I get my thurg shawl quest done (currently on 7th) I would be very pissed if SoE decided that there should be an alt &quot;raid&quot; quest get the shawl without any trade skills needed.  So I can understand both sides of the discussion.<br />
<br />
In the end there is more than one person playing this game.  You take the good with the bad, I won't see PoT (or any of the EPs mind you) but there is about 75% in Norrath that I haven't even seen.  For some reason if SoE did some magic and made all 400,000+ subscribers happy at the same time, this game would boar the pants off of us in 30 days.<br />
<br />
I guess I am used to playing games that I can always play to the &quot;end&quot; and I feel ripped off that I can't see the gods of Norrath.  Oh well, what the hell would I do in EPs /shout lvl 65 Sham LFG.  I do that in PoI, PoJ and PoN and I can't even get a group.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but we do not need another arguement. Certain steps must be taken to get to the elemental planes. If you can not or WILL NOT take them, then you will not get access. You can ask that exact same question about everything in EQ. <br />
<br />
If you get a quest to enter the ele planes it should take you 3-4 months to complete and you need to redo it a few times a year to &quot;reflag&quot; much like what guilds have had to do everytime a new member joins  :p</div></div><hr />

Binter, this is my last post on this topic, because while you are not rude you are certainly using every post to further hone your own perfect EP experience.<br />
<br />
If you want any kind of drop from mini's/named etc. then you need to earn it. If you want xp then you need to earn it. You are formulating a quest in your own mind that gives you everything you want. I suggest you play EQ in your own mind, that is the only only way you will achieve your dream....<br />
<br />
On the other hand, join an EP guild while you wait for SoE to get round to this. It may take them a while :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, through the magic of reality...*waves arms, makes mystical gestures, intones strange words*...There, you now have exactly the same opportunities as every other player in the game to access the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Does this mean the majority of tier 3 and 4 no longer require flags, or at least provide alternate means of entry?  You have my gratitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no key to get into ToV, but it is hardly an open access zone.<br />
<br />
Slight difference between &quot;hardly open access&quot; and &quot;flagged/keyed access&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you just trying to be argumentative for the sake of it, or did you not even bother to read what I wrote?<br />
<br />
I read exactly what you wrote, which why I use quotes, so you can see exactly which point to which I'm responding.<br />
<br />
If I had my way about it, every non-city/outdoor wilderness zone in the entire game would require doing something for access. Want to go to Befallen? Do a quest. Want to go to Unrest? Do a quest. Cazic-Thule? Karnor? Lower Guk? Sebilis? Quest.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that game would sell millions of copies and be the most entertaining game ever- a true EverQuest.  Fun to play?  Somehow I doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I'm painting &quot;all casuals&quot; who want the EPs opened for free access as greedy. Because you are.<br />
Wanting access to something you paid for is hardly greed.  Let's call it &quot;self interest&quot;, though others may call it &quot;getting what I paid for&quot;.  At this point I'd be happy if they at least provided alternate means of entry a la Tactics.  Perfect solution? No, but then neither is their poor design of artificial timesinks to slow down and divide the playerbase.<br />
<br />
The difference between you and me is that I can live with the consequences of my choice without whining for things that I haven't earned.<br />
Sir, with all due respect, from that statement alone I think there's a whole lot more different between us than a disagreement over a lame barrier in a &quot;pay to play&quot; online game. Namely:<br />
<br />
<br />
The real world works the same way. People who take time out for family, max out their vacation time, use all their sick days, etc...don't get paid as much or promoted as rapidly as people who dedicate themselves more to their job. Why should they? They contribute less. They deserve less. They make the choice, they live with the consequences.<br />
I'm speechless.  I can only hope this was written in the heat of the moment as this paints a very bleak picture of your outlook on the intrinsic value of people and human life.  I will say no more.<br />
<br />
<br />
I live in reality, you live in a virtual welfare state where people who don't earn things through every fault of their own are entitled to them anyway. Grow the hell up.<br />
Casting my valid complaints over the design of PoP as mere &quot;whining&quot; and immaturity do nothing to bolster your argument.  Rather they reflect on your inability to muster a stronger defense to your own points.<br />
<br />

This is a joke, right? Everquest consists of some 240 zones, and you are sitting there with a straight face and trying to tell us that over 200 of these are geared towards the hardcore raider? <br />
How many of those 200 zones are usable by a L65 character who wants a challenge, to see as much content as possible and to keep progressing without joining a raiding gulid?  Not many.<br />
<br />
<br />
Puff-puff-give...you clearly messed up the rotation and it is affecting your brain.<br />
Again, personal or childish remarks of this sort only demonstrate your inability to wage a worthy debate between adults. I can only assume by resorting to this that you've got nothing left and have seen the merits of my case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Erm...this is no flame, just an honest question.<br />
<br />
How can a casual player who only plays 1-2 hours an night, 3-4 days a week get elemental access?<br />
<br />
1-2 hours is enough to complete most flag raids.  You could be flagged for elementals in a month.  The only raids that might take more than 2 hours for a non-EP guild are Saryrn and Agnarr.  It's not like applying to an elemental guild is all that difficult.  Most servers have half a dozen EP guilds and a few more that are very close to it.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't think elementals should be opened to the general public, nor should there be any &quot;alternate access&quot; quests to gain entry to them.  If you're a casual player, it shouldn't matter whether you have access to those planes or not, since you have a casual, laid back attitude toward the game.  If you want to &quot;see&quot; the zones, there are plenty of pictures of them out there.  <br />
<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
Many people are satisfied by seeing pictures of the Eiffel Tower in Paris or Mount Fuji in Japan, far fewer actually take the time to plan a vacation to France or Japan.  You probably would be more delighted to see those sights in person, but if you don't want to pay for the ticket, pack your bags, put in for vacation at work, sit on a plane for many hours and deal with all the other unpleasantries of traveling, then you don't deserve a more fulfilling experience.  The Eiffel Tower and Mount Fuji can't be brought to you on a silver platter, and neither will EP access.  That's the best anology I can come up with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must ask, do you mean that you spent as much time as it took for me to get to elementals in LDON or where is your argument? And if you have 69 LDON adventures done in that time I would think you would at this time be on Aerin Dar for the sake of it. I raid every day, and I have several hundreds of adv. 2 days a week are Time while 4 days a week are LDON hard raids.

Well, back to topic. Grizlor's post was a very good one btw. <br />
I think those kind of posts come just because it is so simple nowadays to get your char to maxlevel and if you want get max AA. There is a massive expboost on everything nowadays and if you are lvl 65 you want to meet mobs that gives you a challenge.<br />

It seems to me that those already flagged for EP claim to simply require casual players to put in the same amount of time and effort as they have to get to EP planes.<br />
<br />
This seems rather dishonest on their part as they must know that its not a matter of time investment but being able to amass large well-equipped forces for key encounters.<br />
<br />
If it was a matter of time investment they'd be arguing for additional alternative quests that require equivalent 'time investment' to get to EP.  So why isn't this being proposed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean the majority of tier 3 and 4 no longer require flags, or at least provide alternate means of entry? You have my gratitude.<br />
<br />
No, you trite imbecile, it means exactly what it says:<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE GAME AS EVERY OTHER PLAYER IN THE GAME HAS EVER HAD SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT EVERQUEST WAS RELEASED. All players are on even footing. Everyone can get into the elementals. Even you. But you aren't willing to do the work. You just want it handed to you. For all of your posturing, you have not even approached a counter-arguement to this essential fact. You go out of your way to chop all references to this essential fact from the quotes. Intellectual dishonesty of this calibre is what I expect out of petulant 5 year olds. Prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
Wanting access to something you paid for is hardly greed.<br />
<br />
You have such access. You choose not to avail yourself of it. Your choice, your consequences. Adapt and overcome, or accept and be resigned. I don't care which. Just stop complaining about things that you have total control over like you are somehow being persecuted.<br />
<br />
I'm speechless. I can only hope this was written in the heat of the moment as this paints a very bleak picture of your outlook on the intrinsic value of people and human life. I will say no more.<br />
<br />
Speechless eh? Hate to be the one to introduce you into the functioning of the real world, but someone had to do it. People who work more at something get rewarded more than those who don't. If you CHOOSE (there's that damn word again...almost like you aren't forced to do stuff, or something...heaven forbid) to spend a weekend with your family instead of at work on a deadline, do you expect to be rewarded like Bob, who did stay? I sure as hell hope not. You got your own compensation; time with your family. Bob got the manager job and a bonus. If you don't like that, tough. That's how it is. Elementals are no different. You CHOOSE to not put forth the effort to get elemental flagged. Yet you are demanding the same reward as people who did do the work. It's raw selfishness and greed. You cannot paint any other picture. This isn't a matter of opinion, it is inarguable fact.<br />
<br />
How many of those 200 zones are usable by a L65 character who wants a challenge, to see as much content as possible and to keep progressing without joining a raiding gulid? Not many.<br />
<br />
So, instead of trying to defend your ridiculous statement, you try and change it. Sorry, I'm not buying the crap you're shoveling. You definitively stated that 90% of the game was designed for hardcore raiding. This is totally false. Instead of saying &quot;I was wrong&quot;, you do this. You are an intellectual coward. Admit error, or get the hell out of this arguement. You have no place here.<br />
<br />
 I can only assume by resorting to this that you've got nothing left and have seen the merits of my case.<br />

One of my guildies has very nearly done it. He is what we call our &quot;Weekend Warrior&quot; ... plays 99% of the time on the weekends, and every once in awhile on the weekdays, but only until around 9:30-10 p.m. EST, as he has school, so week-time for him is rare. He's 15 years old and has a level 65 paladin. He attends nearly every open raid on the Karana server, and has even led a few. He's two flags away from being Elemental flagged. No, he certainly doesn't have the gear or the HP to head Elemental and tank mobs -- we've not farmed for gear or any such, he's equipped with decent gear and a few things he's won on rolls (ie. Blackblade of Rain). But that's not the point -- the point here is that he's done it. Hard work, too. I've watched that poor kid die time and time again, and not once has he complained. Just asks for a rez and goes about his business until the next raid comes up. MONTHS of this. And now he's taking his knowledge and helping flag guildies who need it. It's not easy ... hell no. I've watched him nearly every step of the way. But it's DOABLE if you WORK for it ... which is the WHOLE ENTIRE POINT that 95% of the posters here are trying to make ... you WORK you EARN you REAP REWARDS ... simple. <br />

I don't disagree with this statement.  But to raise the level cap, and introduce a higher rate of exp in new zones, so that the majority of old zones became gimped out and unrewarding, and then to design it so that a significant number of new zones are unaccessible to the vast majority of players is plain wrong.  I think the Design team made an appalling decision here.<br />
<br />
But it goes further than that.  The SOE blurb before PoP's release did not state 'significant amount of content only accessible to 5-10% of players'.  In fact one choice phrase I do remember them using was 'group-friendly zones'.  A statement that at best I find misleading.<br />
<br />
I don't think the introduction of LDoN repairs the damage caused by PoP either with regard to zone availability.  LDoN dungeons do not represent a credible replacement for Sebilis, Chardok etc.</div></div><hr />

I am sick to death of hearing you whiners who don't have EP access criticize those who do. Sick of it. You can have a life and get to the EP's. You can also have a wife, job, family, social life, friends, etc. You can do everything you want if you don't suck. Seriously, this is a game, a hobby, and a great place to hang out. Don't put those people down who have managed to use their online time effectively towards flagging. We are all different but just because you aren't in the zones you wish to be there is absolutely no need to make assumptions of the lives of those people who are there.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, just perhaps, you suck at EQ. There, I said it. Someone had to. All I see is EP flagged people arguing with non EP flagged people about the dumbest things. If you can't find a way to progress without losing your in game friends and without raiding 80 hours a week you suck.<br />
<br />
Good day.<br />
<br />
Wow.  Just wow.  I love how you grabbed a single comment from my post out of context and proceeded to flame me, saying that I suck at EQ.  <br />
<br />
I happen to not suck.  I'm a damn good shaman, ask anyone who's grouped with me.  I just don't particularly care to spend my limited in game time doing raids with tons of people I could care less about when I get far more enjoyment from spending time with friends doing content that requires 1 group or less.  I'd love to see a small group access path to the Elemental Planes put in place, but I'm not gonna lose sleep over it.  I'm HAPPY with my EQ experience and I fully agree that the vast majority of EQ players have no business in the Elemental Planes.<br />

<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
In a way, it's a good idea, honnestly ;), but just thinking of it a little time, I already see a flaw, a huge xploit to be made.<br />
<br />
Flag quest 6 or 12 clerics... flag all others guildmates normally.<br />
Start a ring/event/TRC fight. Your clerics are :<br />
<br />
1. unable to do any damage or action against the mobs (no prob, it's the way it's supposed to be)<br />
2. the mobs are unable to do anything against your clerics (and it's the big xploit).<br />
3. your clerics are still able to heal, cure, buffs anyone without aggroin the ring mobs. Can we say easy CH rotation with NO risks ?<br />
<br />
As the mobs ignore you, no matter what you do... exploit.<br />
If the mobs can aggros you via heals, buffs, etc..., as you can't target/hit/do anything against them... you are in big troubles and, in this case, it open some other way to exploit the game more again.<br />
<br />
Sure, SoE can make more efforts implementing the quests to preserve the old &quot;pvp cross-team&quot; situation, but... is it really worth it for them ???<br />

I play something in the region of 5-6 hours a day, 6 days a week. I don't like raiding much, so I'm not EP flagged. I have not chosen to make raiding the focus of how I choose to play EQ.

Also, from your arguements I am a casual player - times do not look too casual to me.<br />

On my first post I said that the EPs should not be opened. After due consideration of what has been posted here I have changed my mind. Open up all of the planes. There are enough idiots who are not ready to go there who will rush away from the zones I play in and become someone elses problem as they die in the EPs.<br />
<br />
We all pay to play this game. Part of that includes getting keys/ flags to zones. You payed Sony for the game, you pay Sony for the use of the servers. What you do with that time is up to you.<br />

The fact that I was trying to get a coldain military wristguard the other night, triggered the shardwyrm broodmother, called the script as triggered and asked people to leave the mob alone.

A comparison was drawn to Act5 of Diablo (i think? :P) - in that particular case the individual player will eventually see Act 5, if they put forth the required effort on an individual level.  They can play 8 hours a night, they can play 2 hours a night, their playtime will only affect how long it takes.<br />
<br />
I'll be perfectly honest here.  On my server, which is perhaps a bad example but you can just expand this example, we have one elemental/time guild.  This guild has 7 officers myself included.<br />
<br />
7 people decide who gets elemental flagged on Tallon Zek.<br />
<br />
If you're not liked, if you're not very good, if we don't want you in our guild, then you're not getting elemental flagged on Tallon Zek, period, at this time.  This is perhaps a poorer example because on a PVP server we have the option of directly interceding in any flag attempts, but what about blue servers?<br />
<br />
4 guilds so 28 people decide?  8 guilds so 40?  The bottom line is that players are deciding what other players get flagged for these zones.<br />
<br />
Now yes this is an MMRPG, so teamwork has become the status quo.  But in order to effect elemental flagging, you need more friends than you did in previous expansions.  You need whatever it takes to kill RZ.  These aren't even close to being single group encounters.  This isn't an Emp key or a VP key.<br />
<br />
And you can't draw an example to Vex Thal, because VT was the end zone of the expansion, and we're not talking about Plane of Time here.  We're talking about the zones *before* the end of the expansion - draw a comparison to Ssra Temple (oh no key requirement).<br />
<br />
How does someone that's been ostracized from his community, for example, get flagged for elementals?  Even if he's willing to put in 60 hours a week working on it?  Server transfer?<br />
<br />
Because unless he pulls pickup raids out of his magic hat, it's ultimately not his decision whether or not he's going to get flagged.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">Actually, assuming both Bob and I have similar workloads, and similar deadlines, I would expect to get the promotion because I cost the company less in Overtime and get the job done just as well. Therefore I am better than Bob.<br />
<br />
Except both get paid salary, so there is no overtime, and Bob put in the extra work load and got the job done before Monday morning meetings, where as Joe didn't put in the extra work load and spent time doing other things over the weekend, thus wasn't done on Monday.  So as far as the company is concerned Bob is better than Joe.   Bob got the better job, bigger house, fancier car, bigger bank account, send his kids to any college they choose, and will retire 15 years earlier and enjoy the rest of his life in comfort.  Joe got his average job and lots of time to spend doing other things, which apparently includes complaining about how its so unfair that he didn't get more than the guy at work that works twice as hard as him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">Kylt has a good point here.  The elemental planes are intentionally placed out of reach of any single player.  The flagging process requires extensive help to complete.  The desire to get the flags is simply not enough to make it happen.<br />
<br />
Many of you have talked about open/pickup raids to get even unguilded folks flagged for the Elemental Planes, but not every server is capable of doing that.  The Rathe server, on which I play, is a fine example of a blue server where open flagging raids simply don't happen and likely never will.  You see, at some point the biggest, most powerful raiding guilds on the server set up a gentleman's agreement to ensure that no single uberguild monopolized content.  They set up RTA (Rathe Travel Agency) which set up a scheduling calendar for Fear and Hate, and a rotation system for some of the more hotly contested Kunark Dragons and other raid content (VT, NToV, AoW, etc) and now have expanded that to include flagging mobs/events in PoP.  To be recognized by the RTA, a guild or alliance has to have a minimum of 40 members, which allows you to schedule Sky, Hate or Fear without worrying that someone else will come in and take it from you.  To get on a rotation, you have to prove that you can accomplish it by beating the guild who is currently up for it to the mob/event in question (or getting that's guild permission to make an attempt).  Pick up raids to do the content in question are permissible, but with one stipulation: no one on the pick up raid may be a member of a guild that is recognized by the RTA.  <br />
<br />
The RTA does blacklist guilds (or individuals) who violate the rotation system, making it difficult for offenders to get into guilds or even to get groups, and the community generally abides by the agreements.  Unfortunately, these very same agreements make it impossible for people who are part of small guilds to advance.  We can't do the content ourselves because we lack the numbers.  We can't organize pickup raids because we're RTA recognized for scheduling the old planes and don't want to have to deal with the repercussions of violating the agreements.  We're stuck in a catch 22.  Admittedly, I don't ever forsee my guild deciding to pursue the high end content on the EP and PoTime so it's kind of a moot point in our case, but I'm sure we aren't the only guild on the Rathe caught in this situation either.<br />
<br />
I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that server politics can be the deciding factor in who gets flagged and who doesn't.  The desire and dedication to get flagged is only one of a myriad of factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Inertia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">So with that said even if you did get in, you STILL wouldnt have any one to play with for the 1 hour a night your on, and you STILL couldnt kill anything that has a loot table, you would STILL get faster XP in a tier 3 zone (cause you arent gonna tank this stuff without pure VT or EP/Time lvl gear) and you STILL would be all ticked off that there was no content after you did this big &quot;Flag quest&quot;.  <br />
<br />
This is exactly my reply to the &quot;casual gamer&quot; who feels the need to alternate elemental access.  I work, got to school, and have a family.  Its quite a balancing act, and yet Im a kill away from the EP's.  When a flaggin mob is up I need, it means be tired the next day, or go to bed and dont whine when the rest of the guild is in the ele's.  <br />
<br />
The best advice is still this... lvl to 65, visit the webiste of a raidign guild on your server, apply.  omg I cant see a 65 shammy with and amount of AA going unguilded for very long.</div></div><hr />

They're not always synchronous and that debate is being waged ad nauseum by our political leaders, no need to continue it here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Inertia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">But the point is:  if a casual player has the gear and has the skill, why would you object to him gaining access to the EPs through an alternate quest?  Or would you insist on him going through a process that he quite simply does not have the time to complete in order to take the next step?<br />
<br />
At least for me, its truly not trying to be &quot;mean&quot; about it.  It so irritates me that I struggle time to time to get a group in BoT, HoH, or Tactics, and the people taking MY spots in groups dont even know what is required to be flagged for that zone.  <br />
<br />
Or would you insist on him going through a process that he quite simply does not have the time to complete in order to take the next step<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to say this so as to make it convincing.   I did NOT have the time to do the things it took for me to get where I am.  Most times I did not have the energy.  But, my want and will to see the higher end game content &quot;made a way&quot;.  Still have my job, classes, and family life.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Why can this excellently equipped group by denied the chance to test themselves against the mobs in the EPs because they don't have the time due to personal schedules to complete the flags?<br />
<br />
In some of the scenarios I am hearing, I really wonder if those with so limited time should even be logging in.  You have the time to devote to LDoN to get said gear and said augs....  is it that you dont truly have the time, or dont want to make the time?  <br />
<br />
Again, you evaded the basic premise of my argument. What logical reason can you provide to deny a group that has the ability and the equipment to xp in the elementals outside of the ordeal that YOU had to undertake to reach it?<br />
<br />
I dont think there needs to be any other argument.  Yet again I'll use the Bastion of Idiots as an example.  The zone is filled with greedy loot whore mongers that havent a clue what is required to be flagged for the zone, taking up groups, and adding to zone lag horribly.  <br />
<br />
Ever done the VT key quest?  It has to be one of the biggest time sinks in the game.  I would be outraged to find that soe saw fit to allow lvl 65 folk in the zone.  <br />
<br />
Having beaten the dead horse even deadeder.... I'll add this:<br />
<br />
This who are taking the &quot;i pay my money I want content&quot; , or &quot;I just wanna see the zones&quot;... you can be visad into EP's  /hint<br />
<br />
Finally, after opening up the planes to those who meet a level requirement the &quot;reward&quot; to those who have the flag is a single AA.  /yawn  Should any more zones be opened up the reward needs to be HUGE for those already having said flags.  <br />
<br />
I remember for ever and ever (casual player that I AM) wanting to level in Seb.  Try and try and die and die... kill the wrong frogs.  I asked around and found a tracker to help.  inside if 30 mins I was in Seb.  I could have cried that it was unfair, that I paid my money just like all the other folks did... but instead I took a proactive stance and sought out whom I needed to get where i wanted to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Inertia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Sorry, as usual when I read through the posts I fail entirely to understand the opposing view.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that those already flagged for EP claim to simply require casual players to put in the same amount of time and effort as they have to get to EP planes.<br />
<br />
This seems rather dishonest on their part as they must know that its not a matter of time investment but being able to amass large well-equipped forces for key encounters.<br />
<br />
In fact it is a matter of both.  Obviously it requires the raid force, and not just numbers.  You cannt approach most of the flagging encounters froma  zerg perspective, or youre gonna get alot of heartache, and really eat up time.  You must have the right numbers of key classes, and an adequate strat or you will fail.  Once you have the force, it still requres the time.  Some folks simply arent social enough to want to join a guild.  I was like that.  I love my guild and the enjoyment they have added to my gaming expereience.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If it was a matter of time investment they'd be arguing for additional alternative quests that require equivalent 'time investment' to get to EP.  So why isn't this being proposed<br />
<br />
<br />
How would these quests be accomplished?  Casually and solo?  To get the saryn and keeper of sorrows flag it took close to 3 hours.  There was a ton fo clearing to get to where we needed to go, time to rez the dead tank, rebuff him, med, re-mgb buffs... etc.  The time sink was given in a block of butt-time.  <br />
<br />
If it required a raid force to do the quest, Im all for it.   ;)   Then... you might as well get guilded now, you cold be in time before SOE ever does anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u237"><b>milkcarton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p237">My first post, and I am new at this game ; but since I have read every opinion stated here I figure I have &quot;earned&quot; a right to reply.   :) <br />
<br />
 I first learned about keys and flags in this thread, I cant begin to understand the difficulties involved in attaining entry to these zones. I must say from my perspective though -  keep the zones locked. <br />
<br />
1 - Make a side quest for people who do not have the ability/ inclanation to raid?  -  Every other game I have ever played put requirements upon the player before said player could advance. Can't do it? move on to next game<br />
<br />
2 - Let folks into a &quot;raid only&quot; zone because their gear is good enough to take on this &quot;trash&quot; and  just let the important mobs ignore them. This is some kind of solution? -  So a non-flagged person can stand next to a GOD and not worry, but a flagged person is going to invoke His anger! Try and explain that one in the storyline.<br />
<br />
3 - Sony dared to place zones in the game that a 65 character cannot enter? Cry about it, I worked my NEWBIE butt off to get high enough to get into Keasora. When I am done with that zone I will work my more experienced newbie butt off to get somewhere else. Same thing you all did to get to 65. If you want into those zones then work for it.<br />
<br />
 I cannot for the life of me understand why people are so bent out of shape about not being able to go into a raid zone. Its been said many times in this thread &quot; I spent X ammount of hours in EQ but I hate/refuse to raid &quot; - Then why do you need to go into a raid zone? Why get angry that raiders equipment is better? The mobs are meant for only large groups to take, and the drops on mobs of that difficulty should be remarkably better than something that can be soloed.<br />
<br />
 Don't forget all you 65ers out there that a &quot;vast majority&quot; of the game is not available to me at lvl 35. I could post in here about how unfair that is because I also pay the same fees *suddenly thousands of 65ers rise up and slay the heretic* , and a few of you would be nice enough to suggest I grab a few more levels before I open my mouth. Same can be said about the people who commit to getting the flags, commit to the hours of gaming required - I think they have in fact earned something you have not -  They have earned the right to go somewhere you and I cannot.<br />
<br />
 95% of the time I am confronted with group members whos gear and plat resourses put me to shame. They talk about their 65 alts and I look at the last piece of gear I am STILL wearing from the newbie quest. So I push on, saving up my plat for my next upgrade, and researching the sites to learn whats ahead of me. No complaints from me! No free flags, keys or whatever else this game has.<br />
<br />
 The way I see it is if you want into those zones as bad as you claim then stop complaining and do what is required of you. If not do something else. There is a percentage of Raiders in the game that deserve a percentage of raid areas. 250+ zones and this debate is directed at how many 5? 10?<br />
<br />
 I have read many posts from vetran gamers who have some &quot;justified?&quot; complaints about how Sony has dummied down the game from its original roots. Ya  it does sound like I got it easier in this game than the rest of you had to go through , but I do not agree that as the game ages it HAS to get easier. If I make it to 65 ( my present goal ), my next goal will be to get these flags - not because I really care, but because everyone is making such a big deal about it  :eek:  :D <br />
<br />
This is just my point of view, at the bottom looking up<br />

Have a good game everyone!<br />

Actually, assuming both Bob and I have similar workloads, and similar deadlines, I would expect to get the promotion because I cost the company less in Overtime and get the job done just as well. Therefore I am better than Bob.<br />
<br />
BUZZ, salaried employees don't get overtime. And if someone else is working more hours, sacrificing weekends, and finishing their work faster, then you aren't getting the job done &quot;just as well&quot;. Bob does more for the company than you do. Bob deserves more from the company than you do.<br />
<br />
Now, according to all of your 'time plaed' arguements, I should have EP flags<br />
<br />
All of my &quot;time played&quot; arguements also imply work done to progress yourself. Doing LDoN or tradeskills or whatever for 5-6 hours a day every day would be like going to college, taking....I dunno...french poetry, or sandskrit....all the time, and expecting an MBA when you graduate. Getting a degree in some &quot;lesser&quot; category is in itself a worthwhile thing (like being able to buy LDoN armor/augments, or having a maxxed out tradeskill that lets you make stuff for profit), but you cannot expect to jump into a 100k/year job like an MBA (like getting elemental armor molds and boss drops).<br />
<br />
Izmalis <br />
While I enjoy lively, spirited debate, personal attacks are both unwarranted and show both a lack of class as well as, quite frankly, skill at debate.<br />
<br />
Let's see, you've ignored:<br />
1) Errors in your statements of &quot;fact&quot;. Really huge ones, at that. I'm still waiting for you to admit that 90% of the game is in fact not geared towards hardcore raiders, as you have previously claimed. Do you have the intellectual honesty to say &quot;I WAS WRONG&quot;? I don't think that you do.<br />
2) Logical fallacies in your own arguements when they are pointed out to you.<br />
3) Factual statements which contradict your arguement, because you cannot debate facts, they simply are. And unlike your &quot;facts&quot; the ones brought up by those who oppose your viewpoint actually ARE facts.<br />
<br />
Who has no skill in debate? Oh, that's you. You try and cover it up with condesention and repetition, but you have yet to make even a single valid point to support your arguement.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that you are a titanic hypocrite. Coming off high and mighty about personal attacks, when you've been making snide insults the entire time. Why bother to quote them to you, when you'll just ignore them like everything else that proves you wrong?<br />
<br />
Here are 2 challenges for you:<br />
1) Come up with 3 distinct reasons, none of which involving the monthly fee, for why Elemental access should be opened for all.<br />
2) Explain why you yourself are personally not elemental flagged.<br />

<br />
 I suppose that my statement could be taken the wrong way, so let me back it up. My answer to you is yes... and no. I have played many games that I have not finished because I was either unable to press the button fast fast enough, put in the required ammount of time, or explore enough to find the secret item I need to move on. This issue is not just an &quot;amount time played&quot; situation, its about people not wanting to do the requirements involved to move on.<br />
<br />
 Some people hate tradeskills because of the repeated combines, I happen to find them relaxing compared to stressfull groups. I also take tradeskills as a challenge I have decided to overcome. If player #2 comes along and decides tradeskills are retarded then I figure he has the right not to partake, its not nessesarily a error in the tradeskills appeal more of a difference of opinion. Same can be said about raids. Since I have never been on a raid I cannot say if I love them or hate them, but I see them as another aspect of the game we have the right to choose to partake in.<br />
<br />
 I chose to get involved in EQ because of the wide range of choices. I played Diablo II for 2 years and found it to be somewhat lacking in depth. Maybe its because I am still new at EQ, but I am still amazed at the choices I am given in this game. I log on and am faced with many decisions - do I level, farm, tradeskill, write up a new character, quest? Some of you have made the choice not to raid, whatever the reason it may be. I don't think raid zones should be simplified simply because of your choice in gaming style. Same can be said about the raiders - not all areas of the game should be raid orientated that would be unfair, but all areas are not. A small percentage is, and that to me seems fair. It also seems fair the best loot is in these zones, the monster/loot scale should increase based on difficulty.<br />
<br />
 It is not as simple as &quot;if you don't like it quit&quot;, for that I oppologize. Its not like that at all. If the game no longer provides enjoyment simply because a few zones are off limits to you, then maybe the answer is to quit. I quit D2 even though I can say I was easily in the top 10%. ( Of the non-hacked community ) The game was no longer challenging so I moved on. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Thyramon, just say no to scheduling bull****.<br />
It's not how the game was designed.<br />
Schedules to maintain who can kill what and when are tedious artifical roadblocks to people that want to advance past what others aren't letting them.<br />
More effort = more reward.<br />
If something is up, organize a bunch of people to go kill it.<br />
There's nothing other people can actually do to stop you from wanting to advance yourself.<br />
Sony has no recognition of any scheduling of mobs except for $tormhammer.<br />
Reserving mobs keeps back guilds from advancing to harder stuff that push to advance faster.<br />
Mobs with random spawn times and that can be killed by single groups of people deserve no reservations at all.<br />
The only zone that really possibly needs some method of reservations is plane of sky, and only because of it's unique design layout that requires you to kill certain mobs to advance through the zone and their long spawn times.<br />
Gather up whoever wants to kill something, and go kill it, and say scroo you to whoever tells you otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Karana, the server i've been told at one point,and possibly still, had/has the most EP level guilds(meaning it's not hard to get into an elemental level guild), open raids are 1 RZ kill away from elementals. As soon as they get around all the cockblocking, the elementals won't be far behind. These &quot;casual players&quot; have killed every single flag mob but one, and that &quot;one&quot; is only a matter of time away. Some of these people have 0 AA's. Hell, some of these people arn't even level 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have to be in a high-end guild to reach elementals, you just have to put forth this little thing called &quot;effort&quot;. Go lead a raid, if you deserve to be in the elementals prove it. Having a real life doesn't entitle you to anything in a video game, much like being level 65/200 in a video game doesn't entitle you to anything in real life.</div></div><hr />

THIS IS A VIDEO GAME.  People get so fired up over who is looking down their nose at who and who has better gear than me.  They scoff at who they are not, the uber guys look at non EP enabled folks as noobs and they look at the EP folks as obnoxious freaks who havent left their moms apartment long enough to remember what the opposite sex really looks like....  At the end of the day, this is not real life.  It is a game.  If everyone just treated each other with some respect instead of mutual disdain this would have been a poll instead of a novel.<br />

Ridiculous to say the least.</div></div><hr />
