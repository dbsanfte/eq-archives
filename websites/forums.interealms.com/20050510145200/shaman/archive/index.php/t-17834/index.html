<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So whats Ldon raids like? Whats verdict on them worth doing? Esp relative to that of a elemental about to be Time guild.  For example the normal raid would 36 elemental equipped people need to be there? And what in scale of hardness are they in terms of theme.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how hard hard is but I imagine mainly elemental equipped guild that it might be a low consideration till we get time equipped. All I know about them atm is you go to a raid recruiter to start a raid and it take 3 hours I think. Oh and are they fun? Thanks in appreciation of responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've only tried Mistmoore and Rujark raids so far.  Mistmoore was a bloodbath, see-invis 900-hitters stacked like flapjacks at the zone in.  We found Rujark with its generous mob spacing to be much more forgiving.<br />
<br />
Trash mobs will hit for 900+, triples(?), and will mitigate slow a little.  Worst thing about them is that they run, fast, and they don't seem to wait until they're low-hp.  If they get away, they bring back friends.  Lots of friends.  That's the worst thing about em, best thing is their resists suck..  They are a lot worse than you would expect for how hard they hit.  Still, you'll want to cast malo first anyway, because you don't want to get any more attention from them than you have to.  Being two-rounded in full raid buffs is embarrassing.<br />
<br />
My guild is pre-VT, pre-Emp, mostly ssra and pop bosses and we did pretty good in Rujark till we came to the named.  Named was guarded by a few tough guys, don't recall the name atm.  They were hitting 1100+, either not slowable or mitigating it a lot, hard to single pull, and you gotta kill em in like &lt;60 seconds or they summon their friends and the named.  It gets ugly fast then.<br />
<br />
I'm confident my guild can complete a Rujark raid as-is with maybe some slight group changes, but if you have elemental-equipped people I would strongly suggest you bring 36 of your biggest dogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did Nro with everyone in PoP or lower gear.  Just like Flufy we got pimp slapped as soon as we zoned in.  Everyone charges... you see &quot;Loading Please Wait&quot;, the screen glitches and you see &quot;Loading Please Wait&quot; and notice you went through the NRo tunnel but popped up at your bind point naked :)<br />
<br />
Yeah the entrance had like 3 of the 900+ hitters and when you come in single file like the way you always zone in it's a cluster.  People are trying to get out of the way and are accidently zoning out.  Bodies pile up and start getting in the way.  The tank will be there but the healer for that group isnt there yet so the tank dies... followed by the healer that pops in with no tank to hold off the mob.  I think the break in is the biggest load of crap.  But then once you start pulling the mobs it's bad also :)   <br />
<br />
Not so sure how you can pull singles.  The mobs are all tethered and linked.  So you'll get 2-3 and if you try pulling &amp; split they just pop back at their bind point.  Our puller was getting one round instaganked.<br />
<br />
They are hard and our group has gotten a lot of upgrades so we might be able to do better now but the idea of completing the raid is sort of out of the question I think :)  There was a list of the order of difficulty and I think that the NRo adveture is the equiv of PoTime trash mobs.  So for a group that is in Ornate at best... we got smoked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are all very fun imo, although the plow to the bosses can be rather dull sometimes.<br />
<br />
I really like what they have done with the boss fights too, some are very unique and challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are really, fun but the loot sucks.<br />
<br />
