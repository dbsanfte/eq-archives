<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just seeing how everyone is liking the new experience in Omens of War and some good spots you have found to exp.  I love this expansion so far, i think making old exp zones Obsolete is actually good, its bringing new content and joy into the game, im more excited about this expansion than i have been about any other since velious, post your thoughts.  By the way, Proving grounds, is GREAT exp, and it brings fear back into the game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made 67 last night while xping at Castle 2 in PoFire.  XP seems to be moving okay at Castle 2.  Most of the mobs are still con yellow at 67.  We were chain pulling like crazy throughout the night; I lost count how many named we killed.<br />
<br />
The night before, I made 66 while xping in PoEarth.  <br />
<br />
I haven't stepped into an Omens zone yet.  My usual group will wait until we are 70 and go on a killing spree.<br />
<br />
We already have a guild member that is 69, and I am sure she will be 70 when I log in to play tonight.  She has been xping mostly in PoFire as far as I could tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My group tried everything we could find in OoW and C2 in fire still beats it. There are just tons more of high level mobs without having to run halfway across the zone to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">C2 fire and KT/ikkiniz here mostly. 20% xp penalty is pissing me off again ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Be careful what you wish for. If you spend your whole time in C2 of fire xp'ing to level 70 you will find most of the mobs in the zones of OOW blue or lower. Don't go complaining that the expansion sucks because it's green to you for the first 5 zones..... :)<br />
<br />
I started in C2 of fire and got just shy of level 67 before my friends mentioned that it would be more fun to level in the expansion than out of it. I decided to head out and I am enjoying it.<br />
<br />
This is not a criticism of people racing to 70 at all. I was going to as well, although I realized I wouldn't &quot;win&quot; that race. :)<br />
<br />
I hope to get my spells and the most out of the expansion as I level, and when I am done to 70 feel that I used it, rather than ran through it to get to the raid zones.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary... along those lines, Wall of Slaughter (The new BoT) is relatively good for xp at level 66. Mainly white cons, yellow cons, and the named are red cons.</div></div><hr />

if you do a /who all 65 70 lfg, it returns to many results.   looking for a cleric, tank, or enchanter, often has 5 or 6 lfgs, 24 hours a day.<br />
<br />
That wont be the case in a couple weeks.  Get the exp now, while it is still easy to find quality people to group with quickly.</div></div><hr />

While I haven't done it, I don't think it's gimp or pathetic, they &quot;get rid&quot; of the leveling aspect and can now concentrate on exploring, doing quests, farming items/spells.<br />
<br />
A lvl70 shaman w/o any spells 66+ isn't much better than a lvl66 shaman, might affect resists and a bit more stats here and there but it won't really turn them into gods or whatever. Just a different path to the same goal we all have, getting there.<br />
<br />
I dunno, is there a &quot;noble&quot; way to play this game? As long they respect other players, I don't see a problem with using &quot;old&quot; content to level faster.</div></div><hr />

Your kidding right? The AA alone make them massivly powerful, even with just Gate spells and under. Levels are everything in this game. <br />
<br />
We are up to a dozen or so 70's on Bert. All done in Fire. Its kinda lame when a 2 year old expansion offers an XP spot for increasing levels that is greater than the current expansion that has the level increase in it. I think there are some sweet XP spots in OOW though. Spent a few hours in PG last night, got 30% more of 66, but we lost the &quot;race&quot; to every named pop to another group that was in our area. The problem isnt the XP per mob, its the way the mobs are spread out. Fire mobs are packed together in Castle 2, but is easy to pull singles because the aggro radius is so low. I dont think Fire XP should be nerfed, but I do think the aggro radius should be jacked up now. High concentrations of high XP mobs is the key to fast leveling. Personally, I fully expect to do 90% of 66-70 in OoW, maybe some in KT though, since I still need spells and I only got that acces last week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't really much differ from the situation when PoP came out, where chars were lvl 65 without most of 60+ spells. I got to lvl 65 faster then I got my first lvl 63 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What I have noticed.<br />
<br />
Now you can get groups with ease in Kod Taz and even though everyone in the guild should of had all there god spells by now..they didnt and the exp push in GOD has made it so the runes are starting to rot lol. <br />
<br />
Last night we had group Wiz,Chanter,Shaman,War,Pally,Cleric in Kod<br />
and we had 2 wizards 1 necro and 1 druid that we boxed out of the group for extra DPS. Gained about yellow in 66 per 1.5 hours. Was a good time.<br />
<br />
The previous night we had spent most the time in POE which I think isnt a bad option either..we just mowed right down the middle of the zone avoiding the rings and killing everything in site. Gained about 1 yellow every 2 hours doing that in 66.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Im not quite sure why it is pathetic to be exping in Elemental zones like Fire and Earth?  How is the experience there any less legitmate than that earned in KT or in new OOW zones?  Not getting that at all.<br />
<br />
Ive been everywhere, in Wall of Slaughter, Proving Grounds, and yes Fire and Earth.  I group mainly with my guild only and I go where I can find groups with them.  I get tired of it too especially considering how much time I have spend in those zones.  However there are some pretty big reasons why alot of people chose to stay with a &quot;known quanity&quot; like PoFire.<br />
<br />
1) its restricted so only so many people can get in there which improves your odds of finding a good place to set up camp at.<br />
<br />
2) in my time grouping in new zones I would say probably half has been wasted recovering from player induced wipes.  There is always some fool out there exploring who goes someplace he shouldnt and instead of just dying choses to share his discovery with 20 other people, killing himself and them.  Thats the kind of crap I want to avoid, as much as I would like to see the new stuff as much as possible, sometimes you have to let some of the newness wear off first and let things settle down.<br />
<br />
3) alot of guilds like mine have taken time from raiding off to level up.  Many like myself who are in such a guild have playtimes that usually end up with us being on during raid times most of the time leaving little time for grouping.  So people want to make the most of it now in a relatively safe route.  Ok its not quit as fun as seeing the new stuff and different people have different ways of playing.  I know some who spent their whole time leveling to 70 in one zone, I could not do that.<br />
<br />
Everyone has their own way to play which they are entitled too.  You play your way, they play theirs, and I do it mine.  As long as neither interferes with the others enjoyment what does it matter?  Yours is not the only way.  Calling what someone else is doing pathetic or god mode (dont get that one) is ignorant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not to mention there are a large amount of mobs in the elementals versus looking for something to pull in Kod Tax or Yxtta.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was mainly in PG during  66 and 67 because I assumed fire would be all camped and found that PG mobs werent that hard anyway. I was wrong thouh, PG sucks... alot. Mobs are really spread out and you have to keep moving to get to one. The mobs also have decent HP and give about 0.30% XP a kill. People haven't had experience in moving to kill mobs in a long time (especially since people don't do LDoN much anymore) so everyone pretty much lags behind me when I pull. This makes the XP pretty slow and around 12-14% an hour depending on how forceful I am for everyone to move after every kill. <br />
<br />
<br />
At 68 &amp; 69 I moved to fire mainly because I couldn't find a groups and I was soloing fire mobs. Castle 2 was overcamped but I only kill a mob every 3 minutes so no one is going to mind (have another shaman out of group DOT'ing). This was great XP but then I got invited to a group at fort 1, and it was awesome XP. We can have like 4 mobs in camp at all times and kill one every 25-30 seconds. 1% takes around 6 mobs so we were getting 15-20% an hour (dumbass guilds kept fighting AEing fire minis near us though, which slowed us down alot... especially Quavonis punting everyone in group into mobs). I was chain pulling for 7 hours for lvl 68 so it wasn't that bad, and C1 is not very camped since everyone doesnt realise its great XP.</div></div><hr />

Funny you say this I may have to agree with ya :)<br />
<br />
I 6box and my tank is a troll. Although I didnt have all of them 1 kill away from 66, it appears (my UI is % based) that my troll is leveling as fast as the rest. I am only 30% or so into 66 but he should be 6ish% behind and he isnt.<br />
<br />
Oh and for those who care Sol Ro is not bad for 66. The ground floors are all 65 and the place is empty unlike PoFire/PoEarth/Vex/KT etc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">this is 100 percent how it always works.<br />
<br />
I swear people forget that there are 250,000 people who play this game and that this game is OLD... you're not discovering the frigging pacific ocean, whatever you experience there's 10,000 people who've already done it, just not posted on your board.<br />
<br />
people with PLing mentality are very rarely explorers.  every expansion with new levels, ppl just exp in old world zones they're familiar with to crank exp.<br />
<br />
the first guy to hit 60 when kunark came out did it at the dorf guards outside kaladim (thus engendering the guard nerf in 00 or whatever) and the first guy to hit 65 did it in lower jails in seb (before low blue exp was nerfed and low lvl mobs yeilded the best min/max exp).  of course both these guys were prior solo exp nerf and so they were both 3 box power leveling a melee (rogue if i recall) with a cleric and a chanter or other buffer<br />
<br />
the same thing here.  people are sheep... everyone hitting 70 has done it grinding pof (the slightly smarter ones are doing it in vxed for better exp ratio)<br />
<br />
grinders =/= explorers.  people who like to explore are doing it as we speak... they'll probably hit 70 in the next couple of weeks.  the grinders are a seperate lot... they'll crank out 70 and key AAs while they wait for others to spoiler the zones for them so they can move in to the nice areas without the hassle of actually exploring or figuring them out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm sorry temuchintehkhan but you are making a very gross generalization there. I got 70 in 2 days, but I still went and explored. I have been to every single non keyed OoW zone (minus the instanced one or two), and the xp just wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to get 70 and get my aa. When we took the night off to go explore in OoW and couldn't find anything that gave similar xp to PoF, we went back. We tried a few named that I guess were raid mobs and got owned, so we figured we would get some levels and come back to try later. Is that against the rules of EQ? If so I sure hope that you have never killed Trak above level 55 or whatever max lvl was when he first came out. Or I hope you never killed AoW above level 60, because if so you are no better then the people you are putting down now.<br />
<br />
I guess I disagree because I see nothing wrong with wanting to level first then go explore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>buffs_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i have found that the ruined city gives really nice xp, i solo most of the time and on compairing 100% aa kills, the ruined city xp = that of yxtta mobs. there are many spots in oow that are packed with mobs and or fast respawning rooms that u can constantly pull from. the mobs in yxtta hit for 1.2k+ and the mobs in the runed city hit for 500 or so, i love oow + new loots and spells. best part of oow = generalized focus effects. like anger of the muramte(sp) +25% to all magic based spells aka focus for bane dammage + many other types of focus like that. anyhow the main reason there is a big diff between oow leveling and fire leveling is fire is like 3 million years old and everyone knows the correct place to sit and pull and how to do it for max xp, oow is still brandnew and u have to figure it out, once its as old as fire it'll be just as easy to level here. wow almost got a finger cramp typeing that out.</div></div><hr />

I never got Elemental access. And for the last 2-3 months i have primarily been in Gates zones learnign them and upgrading msyelf and my guildmates with much of the single group content. <br />
<br />
&lt;---- not a raider. Over 18 people makes my teeth grind.<br />
<br />
And jelous nah. The levels will come. Always have. I just think it will be funny when people are 70 from old content and then bitch to get the &quot;easy&quot; Crap xp mobs nerfed. When if you were there at level 66 they would have been more challanging. It is like people going to Kaesora and bitching that the mobs there suck. At level 60. <br />
<br />
It is foolishness. Good tacticly yeah. Get the most power you can. Then advance. But in the spirit of gamesmanship I call foul. <br />
<br />
Calling it ike I see it. It won't affect anyone other than me anyways. But I wanted to voice my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The problem is,  Pop was a huge exp gain compared to anything before it.  So was GoD, especially for the non elemental flagged people.   OOW is a huge exp nerf.   Mobs are to low a level, unless you are in proving grounds, or a proving grounds instanced zone.<br />
<br />
You can easily kill 2 level 68 fire mob (tables, castle2) before you can kill 1 level 64 Wall of slaughter mob.   You can kill 3 fire mobs, before you can kill 1 proving grounds mob.  The OOW mobs do not give more exp.   The 69+ mobs in proving grounds do, but not enough to keep the ratio even with fire, or even earth tunnel mobs.<br />
<br />
There is no reaosn to be in the new expansion if you are trying to level as fast as possible.  It should be exactly the opposite.<br />
<br />
Ive been to every non instanced and unlocked zone in oow, and even to some of the instanced ones.   The instanced mobs in ruined city con blue when i was level 65.   Thats unacceptable.   <br />
<br />
It really doesnt take long to get to level 70.   If you play eq on a regular basis you will be there in a month or two.   That means you get to spend the rest of the entire expansion in zones that give worse exp than the last expansion?<br />
<br />
Thats what the power gamers are complaining about now,   the more casual gamers will see the same thing, just not quite as soon.<br />
<br />
If you spend all your time in the older zones, you will be 70 without spells.   SO?   They drop like candy, it wont exactly take very long to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">From my experience when you are only after exp PoF (castle 1) has been best spot.<br />
<br />
By best I mean here C1 have had best exp/hour rate, which for me as iksar can be as high as 12-13%/hour (15-16% for non exp penalty races). Second best has been PoE 11-12%/hours (I heard Vxed/Tipt with enchanter pet have this rate too). Third place goes to Yxxta/KT/WoS 10%/hours (exp would be better on these places if you could chain pull hour after hour, but at this point the places are so crowded that it is not possible).<br />
<br />
Castle 1 is good because at least on my server you won't run out of mobs (as you do in C2). Another thing is that mobs are &quot;easy&quot; compared to GoD/OoW mobs for example. So you just fill your group with dps and watch exp flow in. Trushar is all you need for healing (and spot here and there).<br />
<br />
My figures are based on exp sessions that has lasted at least 6 hours in each location with about same group - so hopefully they are accurate.<br />

One other option is to group in OoW, experience might be slower, but you enjoy the expansion a bit, plus get a chance to win some of the nice gear dropping if you can get a named.  Some of this attunable stuff is selling for some nice plat in the bazaars, and in a week or two wont be worth near as much.  Not to mention you can get some of your spell runes too.  Hitting 70 and not having any spells wont be as exciting.  <br />
<br />
If you want pure exp, I say PoF.<br />
<br />
If you want to level while having a chance at some gear, maybe cash, try out OoW.  Wall of Slaughter is nice, as is Proving Grounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I have been clearing the KT temples round ikkiniz trials (use ikk.trial as zoneline after clearing it), thats pretty good xp too, due to density of mobs and temple mobs seem to be 67-68 consistently.</div></div><hr />
