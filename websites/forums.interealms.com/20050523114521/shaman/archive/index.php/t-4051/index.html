<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started the epic and I goofed on the Test of Patience :rolleyes:   So I have to start the quest again.  I was just wondering if restarting the quest will mess up my final TrueSpirit faction.  I don't want to goof the final turn-in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what you mean by &quot;goofed up&quot; but in a word - no.<br />
<br />
See the other thread re Shaman faction-skippign portions (Neh, Hole) of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattyshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I know it shouldnt. To get the final turn in you need max faction that comes from turning the tear into Lord Rak Not positive but maybe someone else can confirm if it's a big deal or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">By goofed, I meant that I couldn't find the spot where I was supposed to wait.  Oogalyn didn't move after I gave her the gem, so I went to -1600, +4200 and waited for a few minutes.  I couldn't see ANYTHING and I had ultravision on (I really hate being underwater).  Then I freaked and thought I messed up, so I went back to find Oogalyn and she was gone.  So I goofed and have to start over :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm well  you do have the correct loc (Allakhazams had it as neg 1600, neg 2400 for awhile - that is WRONG)<br />
<br />
IIRC Ooglyn scoots into the water but doesn't swim very fast. Give it another whirl.<br />
<br />
If it STILL doesn't work, try this: head to Erud, look at loc 0,0 for a naked human female (Be still my heart - is there a better kind?). If she is up, according to the guide, a GM must despawn her.<br />
<br />
Ever wonder how people figured THAT one out?<br />
<br />
And yes it is the test of patience. Give it some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, test of Patience was a bit of a pain because of the time required and the damn tiger sharks that might wander by.  YOu haven't screwed up anything by missing the correct waiting point, so just go get another gem and start again.  Many shammy's have died because of Mobs there, so the tiny faction you have now isn't a problem.  BTW, when the one ghost says follow me, stay put, you're on a test of patience, not one of gullability :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that info about the nekkid female who needs to be despawned is WAY WAY out of date.</div></div><hr />
