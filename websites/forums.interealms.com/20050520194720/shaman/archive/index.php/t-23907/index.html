<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What Focus Effect do I need to get from the Tribute Master that will give me a chance to Crit on my Dot's<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's an AA, called Critical Affliction, it's not a focus item.  You can get Burning Affliction augs that will increase the damage though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone seen a DoT crit focus item or what the focus is called (so I can look for it) in OoW.  I'd like to be able to crit my DoTs when I get all of them (currently only have the 180damage disease DoT).  Also, the DoT extension focus item or name.<br />
<br />
If anyone that has all these items and the new DoTs, can you tell us that are without (ya, I was working on getting the Augs for them from LDoN, but was a few adventures short prior to OoW and do not want to risk buying them if they are not worth it) how useful the augs still are on these new DoTs.<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for any information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kanamori, I don't know how populated the databases are yet for equipment.  However, you might want to look over at EQ traders and check out the new augment systems.  You can take an attunable augment (almost any kind) and, via a process of alchemy, poison making, and smithing, create a new augment that can be a burning affliction 5 (and go all the way to 70).<br />
<br />
BA5 is only 20% however.  Depending on where you are in the expansions, if you have discordant focus items available (qvic+), even the level 70 spells are downgraded only 10% off of a 45% focus (ie, 40.5% focus still).<br />
<br />
The new augment system looks pretty sweet so far.  I'd like to make one for faerune.  :)<br />

 I have the crit AA and the extended length and added damage Augs from Ldon. Someone linked me a back item the other night that had added damage Focus on it for up to level 70 DoTs but I don't remeber what it was called</div></div><hr />
