<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else noticed the changes to the RZTW script?<br />
<br />
VZ AND TZ Autopull on the raid at the same time now.<br />
VZ brings all his buddies with him immediately<br />
We cleared VZ's buddies before spawning the brothers....they all repopped with VZ :P<br />
<br />
Needless to say, it's quite a party with TZ sticking arrows in your ass from one side and VZ and 6ish of his mates laying the smack down from the other.<br />
<br />
Fun fun....I just feel sorry for those people still wanting to flag.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this is a bug?...me thinks its a feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They did some buggy stuff with mobs following now. VZ used to be leashed, you could split him from his adds. people are reporting training up to xeg isle and all the mobs are still following, etc.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to just put a beefy tank and keep 3-4 druids/shams on them for heals and just offtank VZ. he doesn't hit particularly hard. Long as you don't cut him down you won't get the splits<br />
<br />
We always used a paladin to MT Tallon Zek anyways for better snap agro. Just make sure everyone is max distance and nobody pulls agro from him or your raid dies.<br />
<br />
With level 70, this script would be a joke anyways, perhaps this was as it was intended all along? either way, it adds some good challenge to it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Devs posted over on the Eqlive forums that yes, RTZW is broke atm and they are working on it.<br />
<br />
Didn't say exactly HOW it's broke...people are also complaing of extra adds during the Fake RZ fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, we got them for ours, adds during fake RZtW.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear they're fixing it, my guild needs RZtW for EP access.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks, we finally get to RZtW, they release OoW, the script gets bugged.  We were all highly peeved.  :(<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we worked out a new tactic to deal with the bugged script, and after testing it, we managed to get to real RZ...even got him down to 31% with only half our usual raid force, lol.  So, bugged or not, RZ goes down like the little wuss he is when our guild MT gets back from vacation.  If half a raid force can get him to 31%, then our full usual raid force should be able to drop him.   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's doable--have someone shadowstep into the locked room past the first trigger mob to clear it out, then get to the 2nd trigger ASAP, trigger the event, and go with it. 'warrior mez' VZ, knight tanks TZ, raid goes max dps on TZ at range, end of story. <br />
<br />
we did it twice during backflag week--first time, we took the ae tl out after killing RZ, then zoned back in to find (drumroll) zone crash. pp depopped, zero flags. <br />
<br />
thus the second run :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">High Sunn VZ. Mezz the 2/4 adds and tank mezz TZ.  Kill adds, Kill TZ, then kill VZ.   Kite fake RZ adds or kill them if you like.  Take down Fake RZ, TL, Kill RZTW.</div></div><hr />
