<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaanth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya crucible readers. It seems I've reached a bit of a block as far as equipment ideas go... I'm trying to find some suggestions for decent upgrades to the equipment that i've got for my shaman... Any help would be appreciated, magelo is in the signature. <br />
<br />
This shaman is dual boxed with my 65 monk most of the time, but I'm hoping to use him to duel box with my 54 necromancer at some point and to be played as a standalone character both solo and grouped. <br />
<br />
Again any help on upgrades would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say Shadel Bandit Ring &amp; Circled Toe Bones on fingers, or Valorium Ring of Gallantry if you are rich.<br />
I think Skull Charm is better than Silver Hammer earring<br />
Could get Lodi Shield for back?<br />
Chitinous belt, or if rich, Girdle of Mithaniel<br />
Tribal War boots mebbe</div></div><hr />
