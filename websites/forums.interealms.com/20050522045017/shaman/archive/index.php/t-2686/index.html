<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">#1 is it smart to give up the 75hp on Hierophant cloak for Spell haste III on Dains cloak?<br />
<br />
#2 Whats the next step up in equipment on these items: Nathsar arms, Crystal spider eyes, Totemic helm?<br />
<br />
#3 Is the Di'zok orcale Shillelagh broken? it says im not right race/class deity to equip it...im a troll/sham...?<br />
<br />
ty anyhelp would be greatly app!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll try to answer the second question:<br />
<br />
1.  Nathsar arms - barbed ringmail from VL, dragonhide from WW or Velious quested arms<br />
2. Crystal spider eyes - elysian death mask, mask of war<br />
3. Totemic helm - Velious quested helm, new barbarian cultural smithed helm is pretty spiffy, spirit talker's headdress from DN<br />
<br />
Note: I didn't suggest anything that needed a huge raid force to get.  I mean, Crown of the Kromzek King or the Ancient Burrower hat thing would be super upgrades to totemic helm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll try #3 - are you under level 51?  You can't equip it until then.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes i am under lvl 51, i know its reccomended lvl 51 but i thought items with that tag were just that...a reccomendation, i know all the stats are lower and such, i got it cheap and wanted to see what it looked like when equiped .....oh well ill try again at lvl 51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and what about Dains cloak?<br />
should i give up my Hierophant cloak for it?<br />
is Spell haste III worth giving up 75hps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope if you aren't he level on a proccing/clicky item you can't equip it.. I had the same issue myself.  Got my epic at 50 so it was totally useless to me except for learning 1hb (which I maxxed a while ago)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I replaced my mask of war with crystal spider eyes.<br />
crystal spider eyes is gud.<br />
...but death mask of the elysians is good too.<br />
<br />
If I had a Dain cloak I would wear it, at least, I think I would.  Because my limited experience to spell haste tells me it rox0rs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The effect would have to be earth shatteringly amazing to make me give up my Heiro. <br />
<br />
My reason being - cann5,  being able to fire it off whilst there are mobs being fought and not get low health aggro (a cann5 takes me to half health when fully raid buffed) is a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
There are very few tradeable items with 75hp plus some sta to boot on them, I know several warriors that wear them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're under lvl 51 and are looking for a Dain's Cloak? <br />
I hate you. ;P</div></div><hr />
