<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just want to start a post about this years halloween mobs.<br />
I know some are in qeynos hills.<br />
anyone seen any cool clickies yet?<br />
I know most of the items are low lvl twink stuff but i think one year they had illusion clickies, and i like clickies:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are in butcherblock as well.  They appear to be the same mobs that spawned for the anniversary event awhile back, so I wonder if the drops are the same?<br />
<br />
Oh and they aggro level 65 clerics = one dead greenie mob :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same basic loot tables as the 5th year anniversary.  I can confirm Butcherblock Mountains and Toxx Forest have the skeletons.  Only question I have is since they are bringing back the mobs from the 5th anniversary, any sightings of the Fabled mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was there anything good witht he 5th year annaversery?<br />
<br />
Sometihng people really love having.?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Theres some good loots for mid level (30-45) characters, mainly melee as most of the drops from commanders seem to be weapons.  Ive seen one shoulder piece that I wouldnt mind for my 43 cleric, and a ring or two that is all/all and has 40ish hp/mana and stats.  <br />
<br />
The only problem with them is that they swarm like crazy.  If you agro one, you will have 5 on you in nothing flat.  Not bad for a 65, but if you are at the level where you can use the loot that they drop you're toast.  Fun to take my wizard and clear the zone though...last night I killed 86 of them at once (MAJOR lag, by the way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A week ago or so there was a mob in one of the Karana's (Think it was North or somethng) called the Pumpkin King (red to 66).  He was killed and a GM handed out Rare Herbs to be used as a GM event on Halloween night, there are (if there wasn't already) supposed to be more mobs like this for different factions for the event (Undead Vs Haunted, Beast Vs Adventurers).  You kill a mob, obtain a peice, turn it into a lorekeeper of the opposing faction (to show you side with them), on Halloween there is supposed to  be an all out PvP it sounds like of opposing factions, last 6 standing (if i remember correctly) wins.<br />
<br />
This was all on the Nameless, not sure of other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the Fabled Mithril Breastplate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68252) was probably the most sought-after of the 5th Anniversary items. There were camps over a dozen people long for it on MM.</div></div><hr />

Quite possibly one of the best ideas I've heard so far!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fabled mithril BP was not nearly the most wanted. It was always open on our server. The most camped items were in lower guk (fabled mithril 2 hander, fabled fbss, fabled exe axe, fabled yak)  and the FT robe in splitpaw. Lower guk had a steady raid of about 30 people ganking named over and over with very long lists. I ended up getting almost all my alts at least 3 things each from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure Fabled Journeyman's Boots were more sought after from what I saw camp-wise on Bertoxx anywho.  Was a fun time, but a long wait, to get my monk's.  Zzzzzz.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fabled Robe of the Ishva has improved damage IV, not FT.  The BP was one of the few that I did not get for any of my toons.  Fabled FBSS took about 28 hours straight to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's both ID4 and Mana Regen 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry, I meant out of what a Shaman would want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The fabled evil eye bag (10 slot, giant, 100% weight redux) was pretty cool ... for me anyways... being a tradeskiller.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Isnt there supposed to be some dragon that spawns every halloween? like in Swamp of No Hope I think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One of the few pieces I didn't get for a single toon on the first Halloween event was the bard mace from east karana (I think?), which a lot of bards used for a long long time - tho I can't remember much about it now.  Anybody know if that puppy's in this event?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean the one GM event which 100+ people show up and zerg and the loot gets Ninja'd anyways?<br />
<br />
Yea....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lillad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The skeletons are spawning again. Same loot table as anniversary. No Fabled mobs. <br />
<br />
I remember my first EQ halloween in Lake of Ill Omen with a small Faydedar that grew bigger with every person it killed. I had screenshots of about 200 corpses at the frontier mountains zoneline and a GIGANTIC dragon, lol</div></div><hr />
