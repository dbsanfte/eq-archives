<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few questions. How much hp per sta over 280 and how much mana/wis over 280?  Atm I am considering innate enlightenment only because I would be able to increase wis to 330. And I believe with planar power I heard I would gain only 43 hp by bringing sta to 305 over 280. Which is pretty measly for the investment of points I have to put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You hear so many different figures about this sort of thing.<br />
The best thing I find is to go to Magelo and play about on there and that ussually gives you a pretty trustworthy answer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dunno if WIS is double gimped or not, but I know hp/STA is cut down to roughly half the gain you got pre 255... So it's roughly 1.5hp/sta after 255.<br />
<br />
WIS, if I remember right drops to about 6mana/wis after 200.  No clue if it's gimped again after 255 but IMO IE and PP are a waste of AA unless you have all the useful ones and are just looking for something to do with AA pt 250+.  Personally, I'll probably max all the resist AAs before I bother with PP or IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually  planar power allows you to get your stats to 305 each. If you get IE also..you wis/int will be 355, not 330</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You get 4 mana per wis at 255+, as far as I can tell from magelo.<br />
<br />
For stamina, the formula is:<br />
<br />
Level/20 hp per sta, then modified by your ND if you have any.  So at 65, you get 3.575 HP per point with ND3.  Past 255, this number is halved to 1.78.<br />
<br />
I trained IE5 and PP5 somewhere in my mid 100's.  It isn't a necessity, but it is worth it for the extra mana, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, sitting at 305 wisdom without IE and then getting IE5 giving me 355 wisdom, would net me an extra 200 mana.  So, that equals to about 4 mana per 1 point of wisdom.</div></div><hr />
