<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chofu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So with OOW out now, should I wait until 70 to get aa's, or should I stop at 65 until I get Canni V?<br />
<br />
Is the ideas still level is more important than aa's.<br />
<br />
50% to go for 66.<br />
<br />
only have 6aa's so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop 55 or whatever for Run3; then stop at 59 or 60 for Metab3 and MC3 and Can5, then level up, up, up. If it gets too boring, stop along the way for VP3, SC1 and RC1 for good bang-for-the-buckage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the eternal question, and I guess a lot of it depends on your overall goals in the game. If you are planning to SKYROCKET and try to join a heavy raid guild, get to 70 ASAP. But if you are just playing semi-casualy, and want to enjoy the game, I suggest you get a few AA, get a level, get a few AA, another level, etc. Set goals. <br />
<br />
But to be honest, I would stop leveling NOW and get Canni 5. Period. Its our defining self-spell. It totally changes your whole play-style. <br />
<br />
It also might not be a bad idea to stop and get a few more AA while the XP is still really good in places like WoS, Nobles, and Bloodfields. Those zones get less and less efficient for XP as you get higher, limiting your choices for good XP-zones. I suggest getting Canni 5, then 66, then maybe SCRM or VP3 if you solo a lot, then 67, then maybe some ND and some RC and some Spirit Call or whatever appeals to you. There are a lot of threads on AA for shaman. <br />
<br />
At any rate, good luck to you, and very good question. I stopped at 62, myself, and got Canni 5, then went to 65. At 62, places like PoD and PoI were outstanding XP. At 65, they arent as effecient. But I felt I needed Canni 5 to be more effective in the higher zones where the XP was better, like Tactics and HoH. Nobles and Bloodfields look like VERY cool zones to XP in. I plan to hit them on my alt when I start playing him again, just so I dont &quot;miss&quot; them, since I pretty much went straight to 70 when OoW shipped live. IMHO, players shouldnt skip TOO much of the game by focusing completely on leveling. There are a lot of groups available for 65-67 folks in a lot of nice, fun zones. Take advantage of them while you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stop for Canni 5 as soon as you have a good HoT (Torpor, Quie, or one of the newer ones).  Other wise keep pushing to 70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Different strokes, different folks.<br />
<br />
Ever since I have been able to get AA I have never had split set to 100/0 nor to 0/100. Usually it sits around 50/50 but goes to 80/20 near the end of an AA or 20/80 near a level.<br />
<br />
I like to level, I like to get new AA skills. So, I do both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fail to understand how this debate can still be around.<br />
<br />
The most important factor that has the most bearing on your ability to get XP is what zones you are flagged for.<br />
<br />
If your not flagged in a guild than you need pick up's. Pick up groups look for levels first, its a marketing thing. Once your in the group, if your a fun person they wont get rid of you even if you dot have canni V.<br />
<br />
Hunting mobs around your level has been tuned to yeild better xp. They also yeild loots that make you more powerful.<br />
<br />
If you want power then Level. Level up, get flagged for some decent zones, then worry bout aa's.<br />
<br />
I dont care what level you are, aaxp in PoF is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than WoS.<br />
<br />
Human nature being what it is, we all like some quick paybacks. So go fer canni V, its great.<br />
<br />
However dont kid yourself, spending the xp you would have spent on canni V on getting 70 will make you more powerful overall. Its just a grind.<br />
<br />
However, we dont all like beating our heads against the blue and yellow bar. I havent got 70 yet, but mainly cause i spend my time on twinks.<br />
<br />
Never get a second account, its the debil!<br />
<br />
Be well all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All depends where you want to go<br />
<br />
I spending alot of time doing 66-67 expeditions from draniks, so using the within 5 levels +20% xp bonus rule I stay at 66 and get good xp in those zones. The mobs are L61, so if i go to 67 i get less xp for my time. I currently have 184 AA and 14 banked for my 67 ding. I plan to get 30 banked then level. The expeditions are different at L68 so I may fly through L67. I play with a couple of friends regularly as a trio though so pick up groups and raids have little interest for me, its more the experience. I dont measure myself by what others have got, just by what is fun.<br />
<br />
Alot of the good AAs in OOW have a level requirement that steps up. e.g L66 for level 1, L 67 for Level 2 etc.<br />
<br />
Also the extra spell gem is great, L55 req i thjink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Canni 5 would be the one aa you shouldn't live without on the way to 70.<br />
<br />
aside from that, its personal choice. some would suggest working improving your hps (things like ND3) or mitigating your incoming damage (ID3/LR3) or improving your healing abilities or VP or MGB or RS or etc.<br />
<br />
Just depends what you are doing with your toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fastosus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in the same position you were when i was leveling up. Ultimately it is up to you, however maybe this will help. I decided to bust out canni 5  then leveled to 70. I couldn't be happiers. I am at the level cap, never have to worry about lvl exp ever again (granted the level cap doesn't change) In Pofire i get about 4.5 AA exp a kill, and those kills come fast. <br />
<br />
Now that I am level 70 i wouldn't of done it any other way, at level 70 you can concentrate on other things and have the major leveling burden off your shoulders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">many good points.  and i have to agree with most of them.  it all depends on what you're after.<br />
<br />
some points that others might have overlooked:<br />
<br />
loot:  yes, being higher level means getting better loot, but not if you dont have the gear to get the new gear.  being level 70 in gear that is embarassing for a level 60 because you power grinded has its drawbacks.<br />
<br />
spells: again, there is the argument, higher level == less resists, but also being higher level casting spells that are 1-10 levels below you because you leveled faster than you acquired spells also has its drawbacks.<br />
<br />
AA's: in some cases the boost from certain AA's outweighs the advantages of &quot;specific levels&quot;.  getting 60 is a huge level for a shaman.  arguably, 61-63 offer only modest bumps in power, but most of the 59+ AA's offer noticible bumps (canni5, spirit calling, MBG, SCR, etc.).<br />
<br />
gear: alot of good gear is level augmented (required/recommened level), so levels win this one over AA's, unless you're wearing alot of gear that has flat stats.  depends on how you're equipped.<br />
<br />
XP: as you level, the &quot;sources&quot; for XP dwindle.  having say.. 15 zones to grind AA/lvl's in offers more possibilities and variety than having say.. 7 zones that offer &quot;acceptable&quot; xp return for time spent.  so maybe spending some time in a &quot;favorite zone&quot; getting AA's isnt so bad.  or maybe you dont care about scenery, then level right on thru.  again, personal taste.<br />
<br />
i'm sure you can come up with even more concepts, but these were always my major points.  i level'ed 5 toons between 51 and 65, and only 1 did i drive to 60 [my enchanter, because before the KEI nerf, C3 was a huge cash cow].  all the others, i did various ratios of AA/Lvl xp from 51-65, depending on what i wanted at that time.  if i wanted 57 for a spell or /disc, i switched to more lvl-xp.  if i was gunning for a particular AA that i wanted, i switched to more aa-xp.  if i was missing alot of drop spells for the next level, i spent more time on AA until i acquired the next level spells, so that i didnt feel hokey casting old spells at a higher level.  but thats just me.  enjoy the game, and play how you feel best reflects you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been at 68 for about three weeks and about 75AA. Nothing sweeter than straight con xp (at least about 30-40% of time) in my favorite hunting spots like Dranik Sewers or at least 5 level range everywhere I hunt in GoD/OoW. Almost completed my desired AAs from OoW (that are available to 68). Gonna bank 30 then get 69 and re-evaluate. Course I am not in a 70 or else guild...<br />
<br />
In DH 68 instance the switch can be material. I get 3-4% AAxp per mob (non-named) and my 70 sometime partners get 2%. Until I get most of what I want (my lowest AA total is about 310 so I am picky) I am a min-maxer so it matters. If you are not a min-maxer then 70 is prob. better cause of aggro, resists, stats, etc.<br />
<br />
The clear thing is that the old level &gt; AAs is not so true any more given how much content gets semi-nerfed by the 5 level rule. Almost all the decent xp content will be hidden behind flags (Sol Ro+) or will be mobbed (WoS+).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>chofu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Re-reading my question, I wasn't really clear..but you all saw through it to get to the answer.   Thanks!  <br />
<br />
It was really two questions.  Should I stop to get canni V before I go on with leveling?  I have read how much better life is with it.  And the second part of the question was &quot;is level 70 more important than aa's?&quot;  which was a long running thread here except the top level was 65 then.  I know there were several positions on when to stop, but I had decided to get to 65 then get aa's.<br />
<br />
As far as where I am in the game, I started 5 years ago, a few days after the game came out.  Leveled a wizard to 56 and a ranger to 51.  Then about the time the bazaar started working, I left the game.  My brother convinced me to come back...he is in a big raiding guild.  I started the shaman.  I have really come to enjoy it lately.  One thing is I am ALWAYS busy doing something.... buffing, de-buffing, slowing, healing...whatever.  I have to pay attention.  Unlike the wizard where I sat most of the time then cast, then sit, then cast....arrrg.  So, I would eventually like to join the guild my brother is in, but the level 70 and MANY aa's minimum requirement will be a while yet (hate it when the bar keeps getting raised!).  I also don't want to miss places like VT and doing planar progression, so I may join a guild that would hit those places first.<br />
<br />
Most seem to think I should stop for Canni V.  I like the way Blazz put it...its our defining self spell.  So I will go to 100% aa's.  It will be like having a new toy!<br />
<br />
Frynque, I also liked the point of being in level 60 gear and playing in level 70 lands.  <br />
<br />
Groovdog got to the second part of my question that wasn't clear....I had subscribed to the &quot;get to 65 then get aa's&quot; method.  Is that still the best way to go now that the level cap was raised?  I'm not sure it is, but I am relying on the leaders of the class to advise me...as I am sure others are as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info so far.<br />
<br />
Samanna I like the idea of VP3 and RC...I want toys (aa's)  that I can see immediate results.....also spirit calling sounds like it could be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you solo at all, I highly recomend VP and Spirit<br />
Call. These are a great help in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Canni5 is the single best AA that any class has.  LR is the single best AA that every class can use.  <br />
<br />
I doubt at 60 you are going to have the hps to be able to use canni5 safely in any given setting.<br />
<br />
I prob would stop at 65 and get canni5 before moving up to 70.  Reason is that the trek through 60 - 65 is a lot shorter than 69 - 70 will be.  Canni5 will make your life so much easier, but prob will be a much bigger factor in places like MPG where you prob will need the extra mana depending on the group.  With todays' current tradeable equipment, I would think that at level 65 you can safely hit canni5 without worrying too much of low health agro.<br />
<br />
Although I do say that Ancient canni/chaotic memory is a damn nice spell to have so might be best to get to 68 soon too :)<br />
<br />
But, just remember that the higher level you are, the less places you can go to get effective experience, especially if you are light on gear.  Mobs in MPG will rape you quickly if you don't have the gear/AAs to handle them (biggest difference in AAs is get all the defensive ones as well as the hps/healing ones quickly, they will save you countless lives).</div></div><hr />
