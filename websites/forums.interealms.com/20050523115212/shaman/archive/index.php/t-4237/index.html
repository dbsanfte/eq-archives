<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking to buy a rebreather or some other kind EB piece of gear (no not Lodi Shield either). Something I could use to camp Bloodgills in LOIO. I have about 12 fish scales but if I can get free EB that would be even better.<br />
Can anyone tell me how I do a search in the Bazaar for such an item like a rebreather. Tried a fishbone earring and I couldn't find that either. Any hints ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Either search for Rebreather, or search on head slot item for Iksar shaman. That seems like the best way to find one.<br />
<br />
Kind of a specialty item though, you're probably best off sending a tell to a tinkerer on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can also do a search for items with an Effect.  It's one of the options you can filter by, I think down towards the bottom.  So  I'd limit it to iksar shaman and then to items that have an effect.  You'll get lots of things with other effects, but anything with EB should be in there.  The list won't be so long that it'll take terribly long to check each one.  You could *try* doing a search for enduring breath to see if the text search looks at effect names as well as item names, but I'd be surprised if that works.  There are also different names for the same effect (Enduring Breath, Breath of the Dead, etc.) so you'd still wind up doing multiple searches or missing things again that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">search for:<br />
<br />
knotted<br />
lodi<br />
fishbone<br />
rebreath<br />
<br />
....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually the cheapest EB item I have seen is the ornate runes seashell necklace, can be had for under 2 k on occasion. Also the waterwalker's staff is nice if you're 2HB specialized</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know what kind of faction iksars have with Katta, but there is a quest in the Grey for an EB item.  You need three Shissar organs and it should be pretty easy to let the zone know you need them and loot them before they rot.<br />
<br />
The irony is, you need EB to be in The Grey!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksars are KOS in Katta. And from what I understand its nearly impossible to raise your faction high enough to do anything worthwhile in the city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you don't get a free EB item you better get a bunch more fish scales. a whole stack sells for 1 gold 1 silver from my hometown vendor (Hrak in Oggok, 2nd room in the tunnel leading to shammy guild, north side). i've heard there's a fishscales seller in freeport too, not sure if there are any that aren't scowling at iksar but you can always have a friend or a level 1 mule get them for you. have him pick up a couple stacks o bat wings while he's at it, if you don't have a backpack full of those.</div></div><hr />
