<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gains power as the number of spells in your spell book incresses!!!<br />
<br />
(doesnt realy exist but would be sweet for those collectors like me that have to have them all)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second thought some class would bitch about not haveing as many spells as another. Damn whiners! Cry babys! deep breath. Still think it would be cool effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wizards and druids would get some pretty sick stats on that with all their damn ports. I leveled up a port/track speedbump to do some scouting and I spent more time collecting spells for some of the levels then I did getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, enchanters would be queen of the roost with that charm. My enchanter tradeskill mule had more spells at level 12 than my shaman did at 29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, it would probably be even for all casters-- say you have 98 spells out of 100 total, then you'd have 98% of your spells.  I think the charm would work from the percentage, not the number itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i can see it now, level 59 shaman's going all AA at 59.99 to avoid the loss of charm power because he's only got 1 level 60 spell in the bank...<br />
<br />
hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if it worked by % of total spells I dont see how it would be a problem. We could argue that wizards get a ****load of ports, they could argue we dont have to deal with research.<br />
<br />
That would be a fun charm.<br />
<br />
However what I want to see most of all is a charm that even contends with the stats of the Intricate Wooden Figurine. ATM nothing at all comes close to the stats on that charm, if your toon has at least 1 PoP flag. Kind of ridiculous to me.</div></div><hr />
