<br />
I know this sounds dumb, (and it probably is :) ), but I am somewhat of a newbie concerning the high-lvl game  ofEQ (my friend talked me into starting it *g*).<br />
<br />
So, now after starting a shaman and playing it to 51, I think that my gear needs some change, and since I have noone else to ask, I ask you *eg*. <br />
<br />
her is a Listing:<br />
<br />

|-Right ear: Vhal`Sera Skull Earring  <br />
|-Left finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
|-Left wrist: Supple Scale Armband  <br />
|-Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves  <br />
|-Hands: Jarsath Scale Gauntlets  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay...<br />
<br />
1) There are hundreds of &quot;what gear should I get threads?&quot; browsing them might be helpful<br />
<br />
2) go to www.magelo.com and set up a free account, I don't recognize a couple of the items on your list<br />
<br />
3) How much money do you have?  No use suggesting killer stuff if you can't afford it.<br />
<br />
Standard suggestions:<br />
<br />
Left ear: Jasper Gold Earring - imbued ivory (barbs), earring of the solstice (quest)<br />
<br />
|-Neck: Cheetah Paw Fetish I have no idea what this is.<br />
<br />
|-Face: Arctic Wyvern Mask - enshrouded veil, crystal spider eyes, death mask of the elysians<br />
 <br />
|-Head: Kylong War Helm - JB helm<br />
<br />
|-Right ear: Vhal`Sera Skull Earring Don't know what this is.<br />
<br />
|-Left finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
 <br />
|-Left wrist: Supple Scale Armband - dragon hide bracers from WW, coldain military bracer (quest)<br />
<br />
|-Arms: Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves nice<br />
<br />
|-Hands: Jarsath Scale Gauntlets - shissar scale gloves (from the Grey), coldain skin gloves, CC gloves<br />
<br />
|-Right wrist: Jaundiced Bone Bracer <br />
<br />
|-Right finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring <br />
<br />
|-Shoulder: Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl Which level is this?  Only the 7th one is really worth wearing.  IGS is a good choice<br />
<br />
|-Chest: Bloodstained Tunic - iksar regen bp, fungi<br />
<br />
|-Back: Dire Wolf-Hide Cloak - I can never think of any good cloak choices...cloak of truth?  What's that new acrylia cloak with the wis?<br />
<br />
|-Waist: Smiter's Girdle - spider belt<br />
<br />
|-Legs: Jarsath Scale Leggings - leg choices for shaman suck, these aren't so bad<br />
<br />
|-Feet: Webwalkers Boots - I don't know what these are, JB boots?<br />
<br />
|-Primary: Slime Coated Harpoon - Howling harpoon (40 mana and procs stun)<br />
<br />
|-Secondary: Charred Guardian Shield  - SBS, clay guardian shield, shield of bane warding, orb of the infinite void<br />
<br />
