<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After not seeing any movement in my exp bar 57 (mainly because of school and RL stuff), I got a tell from a lvl 65 druid friend in my guild, asking me to come to PoM.  We had to do the root/rot method but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was getting between 0.8% and 1% of exp per kill.  The mobs in the forest are stationary and they are far enough apart that they don't add.  They do hit in the 300's so landing slow and root is key.  Dogdog didn't last too long so I didn't bother using him after the initial fights.  I tried it solo at 57 - KEI was a must, but I was able to do it.  Long fights with a lot of mana lost.  At 58, Kraggs saved time and mana.  And now at 59, Pox is saving more time and mana.  At 59 I am getting about 0.8% or a blue tick per kill.  The mobs drop spell components and some gems too.  I haven't tried the castle yet, might be interesting to try with a group.  As long as you don't get too many resists, it should be cake.  Can't wait to turn 60  :) <br />
