   <br />
Well This Piece of equipment has been a dream for me for a long time now.  I recently changed guilds to one that goes to PoA quite often.   I am also one of 2 Rangers in the Whole guild.  These things add up to looking like htere may be some chance of this beautiful item falling into my hands.  just a few questions...<br />
<br />
1- How rare are the needed pieces as drops?<br />
<br />
2- Are any of the pieces dropable or all?<br />
<br />
3 - How many trips to the PoA would it entail?<br />
<br />
4- Any general info I might be missing?<br />
<br />
5- How long does the effect last?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two of the three items are common drops, and you'll likely get them both in a clearing of the islands where they drop.  These two common items, the Mithril Disc, and the Harpy Tongue,  are tradable.<br />
<br />
The no-drop Fine Velvet Cloak is very rare.  Frequent trips to Sky will increase your chances though.<br />
<br />
The effect lasts 12 seconds, I think.  I don't have one, so I'm not entirely sure.  You can bind the triggering off the effect to your kick button though, and it's triggerable from inventory as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ditopher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty sure the fine velvet cloak was droppable... yah it is droppable, cleric handed it to me after it dropped in PoA. It isn't that rare... it's just that the keeper of souls isn't killed very often =\<br />
The keeper dropped two cloaks when I got mine =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're right, it's droppable, and I need my head examined. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the fine velvet cloak used to be no drop, they must have changed it at some point.<br />
<br />
oh, and the effect last for 3 ticks... so 18 seconds.</div></div><hr />
