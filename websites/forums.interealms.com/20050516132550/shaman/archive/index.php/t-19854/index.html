<br />
When my cable goes out for a week that time is taken off my bill at the end of the month.  I couldn't get on at all last night after 30 minutes of clicking &quot;Sorry you have a 1017 error&quot;.<br />
<br />
Their servers are complete crap and this is nuts that they don't refund at all due to their incompetence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was on for a total of about 10 minutes last night<br />
on Tunare.<br />
<br />
Tried to zone, went LD, then kept getting the<br />
damn 1017 error. Tried for at least half an hour to<br />
get back in, finally gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have pretty much quit playing because of this. My guild has also had to stop trying to do anything as well. Last night we tried to do a small raid, however we lost 50% of our raid force when we zoned in. Ended up having to call it, then just about everyone else went LD trying to zone back out. <br />
<br />
Until I hear that the problem has been fixed i doubt I will even bother logging in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, welcome to what has been happening on bristlebane for like the last year. I dont think sony knows exactly what causes it themselves, they never seem to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a built in feature that slows progression so that they can write up another expansion before the top guilds kill off their lame content.  By keeping the most powerful guilds busy, they won't have time to BETA WoW ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, the cause of this problem is.<br />
<br />
The Gateway program that controls you zoneing between zones, and you going from the server select screen to your server.<br />
<br />
Why is it broken?<br />
<br />
It cannot be tested except though actually turning everything on and going I guess.  Did any of the beta testers have problems with 1017's?<br />
<br />
Same problem popped up with PoP, but not with LoY or LDoN.  So they are able to put in an expansion and new zones and new instanced zones correctly, just sometimes apparently they **** up.  Never heard of this feature before this so I guess it works pretty damn well when it works, which is most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talorn_W</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The general chat rooms and server chats, everyone is mad.  Can't say i blame them.  Folks are going 1017 on a death.  Can't come back to get the flag they we're working on. Or epic raid.  Something has to change.</div></div><hr />

Looks like a patch tonight and one coming up this week to adress it.</div></div><hr />

Oh nos 30 minutes of your precious prime time wasted.<br />
Try anywhere from 2-9 hours for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talorn_W</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This keeps getting deeper, and deeper.  All the server's down tonight 2/18/04.</div></div><hr />

We managed to kill him and sort loot real fast, but still had a few trapped in serus room as server dropped :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Talorn_W</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There was a message warning on the servers comming down? I didn't see one on Mith Marr, and guild wasnt saying anything about a server cut.  Last thing I saw was slow landing on a Kendric Slitherer in Pos.  I figure it killed me when my screen went blank.  Guess I'll find out later.  grrr.!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BB was obviously the pre-determined target for the 1017 nerf :D  Although I hear a few other servers are almost as bad.  From my knowledge, the 1017 is the result of front end over-utilization.  I guess that means zoning and logging in.  It is a fact that EQ is getting alot of new players along with some returning players since GoD, but it seems like an easy scapegoat for the errors.<br />
<br />
Only time will tell if the patch actually helped it out, but if the servers are getting so overworked, it would make since to add more than just one.  I believe that we will see more of these until the numbers are brought down on the busier servers, but Im hardly an expert on the matter.<br />
<br />
I am usually just logging in towards the end of peak on BB, so I get this every night almost.  I just sit back and join the chat watching the addicts coming down hard cuz they can't get their fix :P<br />

LDoN probably brought in more old players than Gates did, at least from what I've seen.  My guess is that they just did not do a proper estimate of the load the new zones AND the new server would put on the front end.<br />
<br />
Since LDoN was a pretty new concept they probably beefed up better for it.  Gates is the same old same old and done pretty sloppy, my guess is they made no new additions to the front end.</div></div><hr />

I don't know of ANY new players that have come because of GoD.  As a matter of fact, I have known 3 65's that have quit all together because it sucks and they are pissed they paid $30 for it.  As for useage...most people don't even zone into GoD.  We are in the same old zones we were in 2 weeks ago.  I think it is just an excuse for a crap product.  If they dont' KNOW it will work, don't release it.  I'm pretty sure people could have waited a few weeks for this POS until they got it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This post isn't a &quot;call to arms&quot; for everyone to quit their accounts, nor am I going to quit mine at this time.<br />
<br />
The simple fact of the matter is... SoE doesn't test enough, and quite frankly probably doesn't care.<br />
<br />
They claim to have arround 450,000 accounts.   That's a nice chunk of change coming in each month, plus box sales of expansions, or any other EQ related tie in.<br />
<br />
GoD should have been tested more.    They should have forseen server utilization issues... I'm 90% sure this &quot;so many players returning to EQ&quot; causing the problem is just smoke and mirrors.    Did some come back?  Probably... did some more leave?  Probably.<br />
<br />
They KNOW what peak times are like... there's no real excuse.<br />
<br />
Things like the Tribute nerf... I agreed with the nerfing of things like the 3cp tradeskill recipie bringing in tons of tribute.   I didn't agree with any other items giving too much tribute.   Great Staff giving too much?   You should have friggin tested it more.    They could have gotten a list of every cheap item being sold in the bazaar, and looked up the number of tribute  it would get.    Many testers have said they /feedbacked it... only to be ignored.<br />
<br />
- Missing a tradeskill combine worth too much Trib?  A bug.<br />
- Missing that the whole system was giving too much Trib?   A complete lack of testing.<br />
<br />
All this downtime...<br />
<br />
Look at EZboard... if they have a particular laggy day... they credit everyone with 1 (or more as needed) days of Gold status.    <br />
<br />
They have problems, they make it better with their customers.<br />
<br />
And it's exactly the same thing with EQ.<br />
<br />
If a router dies... outside of SoE's control... they can't help it... some people won't be able to log in... fine... sucks for some people... but outside of their control.<br />
<br />
If the servers suck because Sony didn't test it properly... that's not our fault, or some random providers fault.<br />
<br />
Sony could easily credit all of our accounts on the affected servers, for 1 day, for each day the 1017 happens (which on Quellious, has been every day since the GoD release, however it comes in spurts.).<br />
<br />
But they don't....<br />
<br />
Because we all hand them our money next month.<br />
<br />
Some people quit... over this... over being tired of it... over class issues... whatever... but a lot of people come back after some time off... I would LOVE to see SoE's numbers on <br />
<br />
- How many accounts were cancelled and never came back<br />
- HOw many accounts were cancelled and came back, and the average length of time cancelled.<br />
<br />
How do you treat your customers like ****?    If they keep paying you, do whatever the frick you want.<br />
<br />
The problem is we all can't come together and agree that this is bull****... my guild has missed 2 raids now... because of 1017... so it's affected the normal gaming of ~30 people.    Plus normal xping... whatever.<br />
<br />
I pay for EQ... I expect it to be there... I don't expect to come home at prime time, and see that the servers are coming down for 1 hour (which turns out to be 2 hours before most people got back on). <br />
<br />
We pay for the right to play the game... SoE has the responsibility to make sure the servers are available... except for minimal, normal scheduled downtime - which happens in almost every system.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to ask people to &quot;band together brothers and sisters! Fight the SoE&quot;... <br />
<br />
But if you truly want SoE to treat us better as paying customers... a good chunk have to just cancel their account for 1 month.... and some bean counter at SoE would go &quot;Why did we lose 2 million dollars this month?&quot;<br />
<br />
Or not buy the next expansion, and again, a bean counter would go &quot;Why did we only sell 16,000 copies of this?&quot;.<br />
<br />
10 people cancelling means frick all.   100,000 does.<br />
<br />
That's the end of my rant... I know not all servers have this 1017 problem, but Quellious does... me, and my guilds normal EQ routines are being greatly affected by this... I pay to play EQ... not to find something else to do that night because SoE fricks up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally sent SOE an email saying I was cancelling my account until they at the very least acknowledged our  387 person One Voice post (via a post here, a message on the developer's corner, whatever).  The whole 1017 thing (plus all of GoD) just gives me another reason to take a break.  Star Wars Galaxies and Warcraft 3 here I come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, I refused to pay for shoddy CS and poor development, so I quit.  So far, no urges to log in (good thing too with all the 1017s).</div></div><hr />
