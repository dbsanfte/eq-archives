<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is the Granite Face Grinder still pretty decent weapon to use?<br />
<br />
With the slew of new weapons that have been introduced with the recent expansions, I wasn't sure if it would be worth keeping up 2hb along with piercing.<br />
<br />
I love the whole big hammer/big troll look :) , but if I'm wasting my time, I could lose the 2hb.<br />
<br />
Oh..stats on the GFG are 29dmg 36dly 10str/10wis/10int<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With my new shammy, I have concentrated on piercing form the beginning.  I have pretty abysmal 2hb and 1hb scores (like mid teens).  I have seen a GFG on Rodcet Nife for 2k (not that I have 2k), and that seemed like a really nice deal to me.  The stats are pretty decent, seems like an awesome weapon to use (at least at higher levels once damage cap is lifted).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well depends. Many of the shaman weapons are situational. Once you learn a bit more about them you will understand. <br />
<br />
Also depends if you are solo'ing, in a group, or in a raid.<br />
<br />
Epic is nice but there are better 1Hand weapons out there. You will find that many people tend to switch out a lot of weapons to benifit from them all. For example if you are melee'ing you throw your epic dot on then switch out to a melee weapon etc.<br />
<br />
But ya GFG is still a good weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Water Sprinkler of life is considered by many better than epic, but that doesn't mean you're going to have to know 1hb to carry it.  :) <br />
<br />
Wearing my epic the only time i find myself meleeing is when mob is running and i decide I don't want to use the mana to nuke it or wait for the dot to kill it off.  Although Luclin's Anti-Root evilness is forcing me into the melee scene  more and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Glad to hear I didn't waste 3k then.<br />
<br />
I do like to solo, so I was thinking this hard hitting hammer would be great for that.<br />
<br />
The delay is only 1 more than a howling harpoon, but more than twice the damage so I didn't figure I could go wrong by using it.<br />
<br />
Only thing is I give up the AC from a shield, but hopefully by using it, the battle won't last as long :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh...another thing Targar.<br />
<br />
Are you the same Targar from DAoC on the Galahad server?<br />
<br />
If so, /wave  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, the GFG is one of my favorite all around 2hb's.  (200 skill finally). I carry a slew of weaponry around and the GFG is the one i use for general damage (barring really awesome no drop equipment). For larger single killing blows I use a tarmok battlestaff 33/44 +12 str. GFG aint bad at all.</div></div><hr />

Mez Have da GFG and it was great.  I sill have it but mez not equipit it at all.<br />
<br />
Pre JBB<br />
GFG + FBSS and lots of AC is very nice.<br />
<br />
Post JBB<br />
JBB + GFG was nice.<br />
JBB + Horse is nicer.<br />
<br />
To get the auto med benifit from da horse you can not turn on auto attack so no more mele for  Gerka.  Now mez just equip a slime harpoon and da shield.<br />
<br />
When mez solo indoors (no horse) mez still equip the GFG but I would rather find a higer damage weapon without reguard to ratio because mez only swing it once between JBB blasts.<br />
<br />
Overall GFG is very nice pre JBB and worth having in da rack post JBB.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">using a jbb while on horseback has been found to reduce resale value of the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are looking for a 2hb for real melee use (not just between casts), then take a look at the Tae Ew Hammer of Agression. Its a tradeable 2hb from the new CT. It also has 10 str and 10 wis (like the gfg) but has a better ratio and is ALOT faster (17/20). Talk about an awsome 2hb training weapon:) I dont believe its rare and it can be obtained by a single group right at the zone in (where I got mine). It has a level 51 level limit though.</div></div><hr />
