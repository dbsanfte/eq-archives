<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend told me that I could solo Giants in FM at 35. I am 34 now, almost 35. I am going to go do that cause he told me the loot was awesome. I have grouped up there before and fought for 2 levels so I know how to pull out of the place and such. He told me the experience start slowing down a lot around 37 - 38 but he said he did it till 39 and made around 6k in items. What do you think about it and what kind of items would I need? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With out knowing what equipment you have its hard to say but IMO if you have descent equipment it is better to press on with your levels.  Once you hit around 50 it is alot easier to make more money.  But individual results may very.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was there a week ago. For some reason the Lootage dropped considerably in one night. Like to 1/10th what it had been for the previous several nights. This was on the Fenin Ro server. I don't know if that matters or not. The whole zone was depressed over it. If you find the cash is low, they've done something to the zone. Most of us migrated to elsewhere and are pretty disappointed. To those of you elders out there...is this sort of thng normal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah when I was hunting in FM for exp many moons ago (back around the release of Kunark) some days you would get two or three Forest Loops and weapons everyother kill and the next day you would be lucky to get a couple weighted axes</div></div><hr />
