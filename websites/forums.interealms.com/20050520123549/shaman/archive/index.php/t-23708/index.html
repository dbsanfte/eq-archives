<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doctheguitarman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a LV 28 Barbarian Shaman, with no where to solo besides Splitpaw and Mistmoore. The newest expansion I have is Luclin. Anyone have any ideas of where to solo? (I've tried Marus Seru)<br />
<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hate to sound 'Old Fashioned' or out of date but I still prefer Kunark to leveling my alts.  Ill Omen has plenty of mobs that con blue near the windmill more towards the old building with the skeleton's guarding it.  You could also try in the back of the sarnak fort.  I'm old school though new people will probably say Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Crystal Caverns has always been a fav spot of mine forever around 30ish. As a shaman you should be able to fight there at 28.<br />
<br />
You can try some places in Kunark, The Overthere usualy has people still in it, though its not uber XP, its a nice place with character. Might be able to solo the sarnark fort in LoIO still or you can go to Frontier Mountains and hit the giant forts, i think you can solo for atleast another level at the fort in Warsilak Woods   too. Another place i think, that moves at a slower pace is the gorrila cave over by dalnir, but i cant remember is 28 is too high to be honest. Oh and you can go to SolA still and kill in there for many levels of nice EXP on the golbins then to the clockwork gnomes, this is one of my favorites actualy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all i can think of off the top of my head.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the places listed are good, if you hunt in Sol A try to stay away from the Wizards and Slam their arses if you get one! And make sure to root em all cause they like to run and get lots of friends which really stinks &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure how high they are, but the shin ghoul knights and such in lower guk may be doable for you.  They are pretty wimpy compared to stuff in newer expansion packs at that level.  If you can find someone to group with, then the bedroom might be a good choice too, then you can pull bats, ghoul frogs, and spiders from the hall way past that area.  <br />
<br />
Find you a melee person to team up with and you can have a ball in guk.  Just don't kill things in Upper or Lower Guk that aren't aggro to you, and you will save yourself some headache while learning the zones, and possibly for the future for some quests :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
If you happen to pick up Lost Dungeons of Norrath you can open up some more grouping options and some really nice options for upgrading your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lileann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With both my SK and Shm I soloed and/or duoed pretty close to that level at the giant fort in FM.  You may want to go to Lake of Ill Omen first till 30 (killing on the plains btwn the mountain and the water on the fort side is pretty good) or hack on Sarnak recruits near he fort and FM ZL.  Then head to FM and after a couple of more levels the fort will be easy but the killing should be fast enough that its still worthwhile.  Been awhile since I did it with my shm (he's 65 with 70 some AA's ATM) but wasn't too long ago with my SK.  There are usually a couple of peeps around the fort who may team up with you to make things faster as well.  Where you are at right now (Marus Seru) is actually a really good spot, just a little slow at times.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />
