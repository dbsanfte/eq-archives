<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after nearly 3hours of Raiding PoTime Phase 1 (phase 2 already cleared the evening before) we are through to phase 3, we get to the last batch of Named when we have a mass LD, some how, by some miracle we keep it together, and survive we log back but lose valuable time, however we have killed the last 2 Named in a shorter timeframe so feel we can do it np!<br />
<br />
Pull the first and we burn him fast! delay............the last named somehow had warped up to phase 4! and was impossible to pull! ***!! Thanx Sony for a waste of mine and 56 guildies time! get the frickin bugs out of the game ffs!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up there with killing it and the phase timer expires when they are spewing out all that weak lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/shrug.  Things happen.  I'm sorry that you had the problems with the guy.  Not sure what was the exact result or why it happened.  Some bugs still exist, but most of the time that I have bugs or mobs undernearth the world, is when i'm using EQW and it's usually the 2nd character (same computer) that is having the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we get to the last batch of Named when we have a mass LD<br />
<br />
        Same  for us ,we got a mass LD ,most of us come back and after 15 minutes another mass LD ,so we called end of raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just FYI. Mass LD isnt SoE fault every time. Ifact most of the time its not their fault at all.<br />
<br />
Just a tid bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only takes 2 hrs to get back to the point you were at by redoing phase 1 + 3.  You sound like this is the first time you've encountered a bug in EQ.  <br />
<br />
2 hrs out of your entire eq life is miniscule compared to the bugs that have plagued other Time guilds/raids.  I remember another guild being stuck out of Time for weeks.  Consider yourself lucky.<br />
<br />
also, Madalton is right.  SoE does not own all the routes &amp; routers going from everyone's computer to the EQ servers.  It's common for a router to go down and have ALOT of people lose connections or cause congestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only takes 2 hrs to get back to the point you were .....<br />
<br />
<br />
Comments like this make me realize just how different some EQ players are from others. Not dising your comment, but to me 2 hours is HUGE and id be pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I did my epic, I spent about 3 hrs trying to complete the Test of Patience quest.  It was bugged and I did not know.  The npc kept getting stuck on the underwater ship while I waited at the destination spot underwater.  He never came.  I finally realized that it was stuck and I went to help nudge it along.  I spent 3 hrs on that part of the quest that usually takes 30 min.  I wasted 2.5 hrs.  That was prolly half a year ago.  It was a bit annoying, but does it matter now?  No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah.. my guild was stuck out of time for about 3 weeks a while back.  We had two other guilds in time at the time and we were the ones that could finish it everytime.  We started phase 1 and upon finishing got sent into the 2nd guilds phase 4.  So we left, they cleared and we came back the next day and got the other guilds phase 3.  This continued with the same problems for about 3 weeks until it was finally fixed.  <br />
<br />
Btw we did clear the 2nd mobs rest of their twice.  They understood why we did it and all was cool with our guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">3 hours?<br />
Ha. <br />
When the NPC&quot;s were broken and spawning as nameless mobs at 0,0 when the quest was released and I and several SHamans spent close to, uh, eight hours waiting.. that was a true Test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Last night we had half of the CT zerg force from tier 5 warp down into tier 4 while we were killing Terris.  Terris dies and magically we're getting hit by amydgalans and phobos ... Wiped us and then proceeded to path right by the book so the clerics that ran back got owned on clicking in again.<br />
<br />
Fun huh</div></div><hr />
