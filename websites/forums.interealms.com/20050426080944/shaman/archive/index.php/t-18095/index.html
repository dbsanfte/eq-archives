In OT, if you go around from the PoK book clockwise around the outpost (town?  fort?  whatever it is) there is a dark elf in an in bulge of the wall whose name escapes me.  At 38 he con'd dark blue to me.  There is one earlier near the wall who was aqua.  Anyway, this guy has been steadly camped, but it wasn't difficult to rotate in.  In one hour of play I got from just barely 38 to 2/5 of the way to 39.  The reason?  If you kill him he respawns immediately.  No downtime and no faction hits.  It was a thing of subtle and terrible beauty.  I'm going back tonight, so if you're on the Nameless don't go, they nerfed it. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Npc's name is Vaxxim T`Quoren. Quest npc from drogna warrior/monk/rogue wrist quest. He is one of 4 slaves that get freed in drogna and afterwards respawn in their freed spots. Have seen groups of people standing around him in Ot on way to drogna. Seems boring as heck to me , no faction , no aggro til attack him , though least he fights back heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wereclown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I can't claim that it's all that exciting, but for me getting out of the 30s is worth it.  I ended up at 43 after a leisurely weekend once I finally hit 40.  I loathe the 30s now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This camp is real lame, they need to change it from an instant respawn, make him an extreme undercon, cons blue hits for thousands, or just raise his level.  There are enough incompetent players at higher levels already, we dont need another place like paludal that burns people through the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wereclown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah crap, you're right I guess.  Does that mean I've labled myself as Lame now?  If so, I play on, er, Stromm, yeah, that's it...</div></div><hr />
