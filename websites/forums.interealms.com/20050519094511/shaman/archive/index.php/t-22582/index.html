<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I must say, I'm really impressed.<br />
<br />
Last night I participated in an LDoN adventure for the first time.  I can't even imagine what the game would have been like if that were how it began.  Can you?  Think about it...<br />
<br />
- No need for lists.  People could just grab a group and go exp.  Over and over and over.<br />
<br />
- No camping for items.  I haven't done enough adventuring in LDoN to buy anything, but it certainly doesn't seem like the sit in one spot for 8 hours or more waiting for a named to spawn with the rare drop you need... a la Paw of Opolla quest.<br />
<br />
Thats just two possibilities.  Would there have been a raid element to the game?  Perhaps, I hear there's multi-group adventures.  I certainly don't have the time to do any of that, but it probably would have leveled the playing field for &quot;ueber&quot; guilds that are competing for spawns.<br />
<br />
It's good stuff at any rate.  Fortunately for me, I have a life that I rather enjoy, so I won't play much, but also just as fortunate I can play a couple hours at a time and not invest my life to the game.<br />
<br />
Two thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people have that reaction to LDoN, even the ubers that are in Tavci and such (thats a far, far away land where the best of the breed go play ).<br />
<br />
LDoN is about the only thing that I log in for anymore...everything else takes too much time from a busy life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like it too, but after 200+ adventures, it's pretty stale.  Actually, hit that point after about 10 or so in each camp hehe.<br />
<br />
The lack of variety in maps and loot makes it boring after awhile.  But yeah, it's good :).<br />
<br />
Mach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love LDoN.  I just hate the idiots who are magnetized to me in normal LDoN pickup groups.  If you can find a group of people with to dungeon crawl with on a scheduled basis though, it's a blast... the problem is, it's fun to go to different dungeons to keep it from getting boring, but to get a good item, you have to grind out the same one countless times.<br />
<br />
It is definitely one of their better concepts though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i actually considered coming back just for LDoN.. but then i realised that my character was long gone :D it sounded like a really nice addition that was long overdue.. but oh well, i can always hope emulated servers figure out how to do instances :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeh, it also allows you to play in smaller game time chunks. Not like where people finally get a good group together and then you are trapped until you can find a replacement before you leave.<br />
<br />
LDON is a great addition to the game.<br />
<br />
THe flip side is that it has eroded the draw of the guilds, and may have contributed to the guild decay we are seeing in the game at present.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better than the pre-PoP &quot;We are SO much better than all of you&quot; perception of nearly half guilded people on my old server.  And heck, not being a warrior/cleric etc made it even harder... <br />
<br />
If anybody on Xegony remembers the Chosen's rule about every guilded person on an open raid gets two loot rolls, and every non guilded gets one, you'll know where I'm coming from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like LDoN but it is slightly different from what I had expected. I thought it was going to be a huge series of dungeons put together modularly, but it's really only a small finite set of dungeons in each theme and once you get to know them well it gets kind of old.<br />
<br />
But still even with that, if they put in some more themes (kunark or velious themes would be great) in OoW, I'd cheer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeh, great concept. A few more variables would be nice, i know a couple of the themes off by heart now, makes pulling with my sham trivial. I could pull with a 0 aa wizzy in EF now.<br />
<br />
I would love to see some LDONS that scale for group sizes and allow even as low as solo, that way you could log on, have a blast for an hour and a half than log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I haven't played enough to get bored of the 'limits' of LDoN, but the concept alone is excellent.  But just think, if they had done that from the beginning there'd be a lot more variety with the dungeons :).  <br />

Maybe I'm just wishing that the game had been more like LDoN all along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LDON would only be satisfying in long-term play if each map for each theme had that hand-drawn and hand-mapped feel to them like Seb and HS, with individualized touches instead of &quot;machined&quot; textures and layouts.</div></div><hr />

    I have to agree that LoDn has many of the features that make an expansion worth while.  LoDn Spell are all accessible, if you are willing to put the time to get them. Although the gear is not high end , it is very respectable and with  the exception of PoP and GoD would be very top notch.  The idea of updating the adventure stone and having various augs and spells  at different camps was a very creative way to get people to play at different locations.<br />
<br />
  The things that didn't work in my opinion was the unequal difficulty in doing different types of adventures.  Every pickup group I ever try would now by default pick mid collections adventures. Others are usually harder with no real incentive to try risking for it.  The raid  adventure option was so badly designed that as far as I know only very few guilds have ever tried it (and most never twice).  Quirks like targeting in  south ro adventures is a real pain and  you still have to wait  on the adventure timer if you do a real fast normal adventure.<br />

Maybe, but LDoN is a set path with a time limit enforced objective.  What I always loved about EQ when I first got into it was the ability to go anywhere and do anything at any time.  And to change my mind at a momen't notice.<br />
<br />
LDoN puts this weird arcade aspect into the game that I don't like.  We had dungeon crawls long before LDoN... ever crawled your way through Crypt of Dalnir with a good group of adequately leveled peeps back in Kunark era?<br />
<br />
The only difference is now people get phat lewtz to dungeon crawl, so people actually do it (90 percent of EQ population doesnt care about fun or immersion, but optimal ZEM and Drop Rate).  Problem is, people turn it into a game of how fast can you beat it, what classes are the best for it, or something like<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to talk big?  Who me on Tribunal.  458 wins 7 losses LDoN.  Owned.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's really just a way to coax people with the rewards they want into doing something that people who wanted to actually have FUN did already years back.  Rememeber climbing your way through new Paw for the first time?  Happy necros looting Summon Corpse near the end?  I sure do...<br />
<br />
It's also great how everyone says &quot;No Deepest Guk LDoN plx.  Pulling Aggro is teh suck there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Took me a looong time just to get the cheap arse single target shrew spell to help complete my spell book, simply since it came from Guk.  People who aren't good pullers die there, and rather than try to get better, they just avoid the dungeon.  <br />
<br />
It's good to find a group of friends that enjoy the challenge and are willing to strategize... I have yet to form a full group of buddies who can actually be on at the same time each other night or whatever, for constant LDoN'ing, though I do have a lot of fun ones with guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">got my first piece of the incorporeal chain armor the other day...opted for a bracelet, since i realized that at level 65 and with 66 aa, i had outgrown my bracelet of sense (great wis, but 0 mana and hp hurts), and bracelet of the spiritcharmer. my next incorporeal piece will, of course, be another bracer. awesome getting an extra 11 ac, 70 hps, and 70 mana (i put a 10 wis aug from NRo on it to make 14 wis so i only lose 1 wis in the switch trading out bracelet of sense) from a wrist slot. <br />
<br />
stoked. i couldn't play the game if all i did was LDoN, but it's an awesome change of pace from BoT, planes raids, and making my first forays into GoD. also awesome because it gives you an opportunity to customize, and to simultaneously upgrade weak slots and mash out a bit of aa. while i was grinding out EF ldons for my bracelet, i managed to finish up most of ND3 in the process. 1 away now. <br />
<br />
yehaw!<br />
<br />
two thumbs up is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, Tala,<br />
<br />
I've ground out about 600 points in Mistmmore, on my Beastlord, starting from level 25 - Thats a LOT of time... And I am completely sick of seeing that zone. Or any of its variants.<br />
<br />
The encounters themselves aren't that annoying in LDoN, matter of fact they're pretty much &quot;just ruight&quot; (unless you're a time geared 65 bottomfeeding on an easy and calling it gimp ;) ), but seeing hte same scenery over, and over, and over is mentally draining. Imagine staying in Blackburrow for 16 levels... It's that mind numbing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, occasionally you get some that are really nice - I enjoy the scenery of some of teh Takish and Everfrost dungeons, myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A few things I like about Ldons are something that has not been mentioned here. I mainly do Ldons with guild groups, and find that we can plow through most of them in 30 to 45 minutes. more and more the guild as a whole is getting to where we don't need to talk about what is going on it. You develop a familarity with who other people play to the point you can predict who will do what and when at any given time. From doing the ldons I see our raids getting getting smoother, especially when things go bad. That knowledge of each other developed in the ldons has turned a few wipes into victories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think everything is nice when its new. Ldon in the first month got rave praise, then it disappeared as everyone realised it was cookiecutter and boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDON is a great addition to the game.<br />
<br />
THe flip side is that it has eroded the draw of the guilds, and may have contributed to the guild decay we are seeing in the game at present.<br />
The cause of guild decay these days is due to the fact that if your not a cleric, warrior, enchanter or some ultra DPS class (Rogue, mage, necro) then your a secondary citizen. This isnt a guild problem, its a game mechanics problem. You cant keep 8 shamans on your roster and expect that all 8 of them actively raiding isnt going to lead to burn out on some level.<br />
Add to that that some high raid guilds are run more like a busisness  and less like a game and you can see where people are just tired of the crap. Family raid guilds seem to retain members better, but those seem far between now, at least on Karana during &gt;my&lt; peak hours.<br />
<br />
Now LDON on the other hand, there is some fun. You ever try a Hard LDON with a ranger tank? Do a Hard with 2 wizards kiting as crowd control? Do a regular with you and 5 DPS? Do a pet LDON? Try an all shaman run? LDON is very forgiving once you reach a certain level of gear and you can basically screw around and pull trains and still do just fine if you have semi competant players, give yourself a group of competant players and you can really give the cleric a workout :D<br />
looking at 350 wins here, with 20ish losses...so you can say that I really like LDON :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The concept is wonderful. I would really like to see Lost Dungeons of Velious and Lost Dungeons of Kunark. :)</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more.  This is one thing I've missed a lot in newer EQ zones.  <br />

It would be cool if each dungeon was randomly drawn before you went in instead of the old maps over and over but I don't care I love Ldon.  I would also like to see Ldons in Kunark and Velious zones like that.  Tired of the old zones getting the most attention.  Its time to reward those that have bought expansions.</div></div><hr />

I would have to disagree. I am still seeing new parts of some of the dungeons now that I actually look around. I did them in packs of 30 and saw all the themes but now that I am repeating (capping stone) and am far more used to them I am seeing all the cool boss areas that I missed when I did collects and didnt focus on terrain. Now I always go where I havent been before to do the collect part (having the maps helps). Course it probably helps that I box them so I control where I go and what I see...<br />

Set in some sort of coding so that only 1 or 2 named pop (like normal LDON) and let me decide where I want to go instead of just down a long hallway (which is basically what LDONs are).<br />
<br />

Sebilis, ToFS, Crystal Caverns, LGuk, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

I personally think LDoN and instanced zones are one of the best major developments to ever hit eq........ as camping SUCKS. <br />
<br />
However, the repetition of doing the same 3 dungeons over and over is tedious.  I wish SOE would tweak risk/reward in Deepest Guk and Rujarkian to get more peeps to go.<br />
<br />
Of course, it would be great if SOE could roll out a few more brand new ones as well.<br />

You might do as I have done and create odd ball screwy groups and always be the puller. That will keep you on your toes.  If you get a strong group then go to Guk!!!! no reason not to and the group usually says yes when you make that case since few have it maxed.  Just remember that most peeps will immediately say no to Guk even with a strong group....but a bit of convincing usually does the trick and everyone is happy to get another one out of the way at the end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">LDoN is pretty much the only thing I do when I log in these days.  It's fast, easy for me to get a group, and I always loved a good dungeon crawl.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it represents what I feel this game has lost.  There is virtually no travelling, the named are hardly more difficult than the regular mobs, the loot generic, and instead of camping a particular mob for 8 hours you need to visit the dungeon 25 times to get the loot you really want.<br />
<br />
I actually miss the interaction of other people in the zone.  Whether it be shouts, trains, camp calls, joining up with another person/group to take down a tough mob, finding a rez for a fallen comrade, or just duoing with a friend while waiting for a couple friends to log in and join you.  Sure some of these things were annoying but overall the good times out weighed the bad. <br />
<br />
EQ used to be about the journey now it's all about the destination. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For me, Guk theme is the best theme for LDoN<br />
I really like it, because it has what we can call: challenge <br />
 :cool: ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, in this dungeon, root pull is your friend ;)<br />
<br />
Now about LDoN in general, besides the fact that zones look the same, I have to admit that I actually enjoyed playing my shaman again if I was the puller. I mean, if you pull, you are doing something non stop: Canni, slow, pull, canni etc etc etc.... often they were coming by 1 or 2, but the occasional 6 mobs inc were a blast to encounter.<br />
The non stop action is what I loved in my shaman pre PoP. It was to always do something, so I couldn't feel playing like wizards or clerics.<br />
Now, if I couldn't be puller in a LDoN, it is because we had a bard, so we always had single pulls and there was no challenge. LDoN were boring to me in those cases.</div></div><hr />
