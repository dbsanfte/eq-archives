<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I'm sure there have been multiple posts about Mistmoore in the past, but I just cant find em.  I have a friend taking his relatively low lvl guild 30-40, maybe 1 group 50s, to raid this zone and was wondering if that will be adequate to take the Butler, Maid and any other inner caste or whatever mobs.  Also I would greatly appreciate it if anyone posted any info or a link to any info that would help plan this event.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember doing raids here with my first guild and the xp wasnt too bad.  I think there is a xp modifier there now?  Only bad thing about the zone is the trains:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taelos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All of Mistmoore castle can be done by one solid group of mid / high 40's with a really good enchanter.  The raid you describe should be able to march back and forth across the castle without worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;mid / high 40's with a really good enchanter&quot;<br />
<br />
Mid to high 40s?  The zone greens out for the most part at 43.  A single group in the mid 30s can camp any place in the zone.  It was that way pre-kurnak and even more so true now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spent a lot of my early 20s and then again in my early 30s in Mistmoore...but I go there now and I don't see people...and I still haven't got those damned fangs....  Mistmoore is a really fun zone, though...but monster trains!  My god I remember some of those....  Hell, even now the entrance is littered with corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dumpling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if they ever do a &quot;New CT&quot; to Mistmoore I'd be back there in a heartbeat.  Shame no one hunts there anymore, its so fun.  Yeah your raid will be overkill.  I do seem to recall though that you can get a bit of XP in the castle at low 40's.  Mid 30's is when this zone really shines for xp though.   And oh the trains :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lycanthrope33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went through last week with a solid group of 40's and didn't even break a sweat.  Even multiples without a chanter weren't all that rough and came out with a fang for a ranger in the group...I'm still a bit lower than she was so I gave it up.  But was very easy to walk all over the castle and stomp em into the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TheOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mistmoore is one of the funnest zones in the game and I don't understand why it is usually barren on my server.  Or at least it was a year ago when i camped the maid/butler  (shudder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it won't be as fun...<br />
<br />
but you can just Camo up and run all the way up the buttler/maid rooms...<br />
<br />
<br />
i went there a few days ago solo to try to get my fangs... didn't drop but was a lot of fun...<br />
<br />
in the low 50's i went there with a warrior in my guild and we pretty much cleaned everything.... few med/bind wound breaks...<br />
<br />
its really not that but, just watch out for the casters... they hit for up to 350ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MM is pretty ezy after 40, i remember going there to get some granite for the Ivy Etched boots, and ater 40 i just wandered in with a group of mid 40's into the middle of th castle, plonk ourselves down and had no problems at all. Its one of the few really fun zones with great XP that has noone in it, i guess cause the zone can be hard to find, and peeps dont like running thru LFay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i remember helping a ranger friend to get his butter and fang with my troll like 1 years ago was  down there suddenly got agroed by all the zone and got smoked up  in 3 sec was level 50 with NO dog was thinking it was quiet strange :) will go there to get my spell soon but i am still werry afraid of this zone hehehe</div></div><hr />
