<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe i have the same sorta problem at the moment: do I keep on the Iksar Regen BP I have had for the last 20 levels, or do I wear the Barbed Ringmail that a friend gave me last night??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well the thing is, the guild Im in dont want the shamans to get a chance on Wolfcaller BP before everyone else that can use it have one. (Now the other main shamans in the guild all have Fungi so that might be the reason)<br />
<br />
One of the guild officers thought I should buy a Iskar BP instead, since I am a shaman and that regen is good for shamans.<br />
<br />
Im not sure I agree that 5hp/tick is better than alot of AC, WIS, resists, HP and Mana. Just checking what other shamans think about the BP:s. <br />
<br />
I might be wrong, but I belive that Wolfcaller BP would be better for me than Iskar BP at my lvl.<br />
<br />
/Armak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How long term is your guild planning? Wolfcallers is a nice BP but there are better that the guild may be able to get in the not too-distant future. Have another word with that officer and get a feel for the plans, for example if shamans are asked to pass on HoT BPs would they get priority on Vindi BPs in return?<br />
<br />
The BP is nice, the effect on it has been rendered pointless since group stamina was upped to the same return. I wore an Iksar BP until 57, I tried just swoping it in but I got bored of the constant equipping and left in on full time - the effect stacks with spell regen and is very useful pre-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tough one, you should definitely go for one or the other. I'd respect your guild's decision, but point out that you are missing out on a nice upgrade and hope to get a pay-off later down the line with a Vindi or something.<br />
<br />
I'd go for that iksar bp, they seem to hold value well (even increased a bit on AB I think) and are nice for an alt if you get an upgrade. Its a good upgrade to the froglok one, regen for shaman is very important.<br />
<br />
If you could get it then the wolf caller's is nice, but that regen on the iksar is very nice too. The main thing with the wolf caller's is that AC boost. Are you the main slower in the guild? If so then perhaps I'd press the case for the wolf callers but otherwise, for the good of the guild (and thus yourself, in time) the iksar is pretty damn fine too anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have both the regen and the froglok and after around 55 i didnt notice much of a differance w/ the regen of 5/tick much when i can self buff to over 2100 hp i'd prefur 5 ac and 5 wis till i can get a hot or tov bp so now a 49 guidly shaman is wearing the bp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">regen &gt; stats<br />
<br />
The actual benefit of the stats from the other two BP's is microscopic.  Wisdom is good, AC is good, saves are good, etc -- in any slot you cannot put a regen item in.  <br />
<br />
Your chest slot is too important to waste on stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are 58+, go for the SS bp or if you can get it, a Vindi. Otherwise, get the iksar regen bp. If you are 58+, KM can help you gain mana back very quickly (in my experience so far), so the regen from the ikky wouldn't be that big of a deal. I just got my SS bp and I love it. I also just got 58 and so far, canni4 + KM == mad mana regen. Not as good as canni4 + torpor naturally, but still pretty darn good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'm only 51 but i doubt i'll be giving up my ikky bp any time soon. i totally notice when i've loaned it out, so i bought another for my gf's twinks and my twinks to share. wolf callers has nice ac but the stats on it aren't anything to write home about really. do you really need 15 more wis and 90 more mana? i can canni myself up to fom pretty quickly and stay at a reasonable health with my ikky and regrowth up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a minor, but meaningful, correction to Seredith -<br />
the regen BP's are very useful pre-Torpor, rather than pre-60.<br />
<br />
Kragg's Mending at 58 is a big help, but it is not nearly the efficiency of Torpor, and I will not be putting my fungi away just because I hit 60.  <br />
<br />
Was talking to a friend last night who plays a 60 enchanter.  He pointed out that he had spent his life in EQ with a regen of 5 hp per tick.   <br />
<br />
with Canni 4 I eat away 148 hp on every wince.  the regen from the BP is a big part of keeping me going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HPs and Mana are greater than any regen you can have on an item.  AoB and regen are nice but when it comes down to it is it really going to help you getting 5hps a tick when a mob hits you for 200+ or for that matter rampages you for 4x800's ?<br />
<br />
I have had this debate alot with my fellow guildmates and the only time we use the regen BP is when we solo.  As a solo BP yes it would be good however as a raiding BP or regular group BP i would definately go with wolf callers.<br />
<br />
I currently sit at 2800+ unbuffed hps and i can let you know that the HPs &gt; AC and the regen is nice effect but it isnt worth sacrificing the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recently tried out a Barbed over my Ikky,  I'm currently trying to get together some money for a JBB from hill giant's so I get hit hard and frequently right now.  I found that even with the higher HP and AC of the Barbed I still had to heal during battle whereas with the Ikky I was able to canni up during battles and kill faster and longer.  With the Barbed I was medding after just one or two,  with the Ikky I can go four and sometimes five before I have to med.<br />
<br />
My opinion is regen&gt;16 AC and +50 HP<br />
<br />
That may change vs the Wolfcaller's AC but the Ikky would be a very nice upgrade over froglok.<br />
<br />
I did get lucky and resold the Barbed for 500 more than I paid for it too,  so the experiment didn't cost me anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hp regen = mana<br />
<br />
mana = more spell you are able to cast<br />
<br />
You should choose the Ikky BP at 51 until you can get your hands on a fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
If you solo via root/dot, use Ikky.<br />
<br />
If you solo using JBB, Wolf Collar<br />
<br />
If your grouped, Ikky. (With proper agro management you shouldn't be taking hits)<br />
<br />
If your in a raid, Ikky (regen = mana for buffs). If the mob your raiding has high damage, chances are if you agro your dead.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's the style you play that will determine what to use.<br />
Swapping out BPs is always an option just liek having resist gear. Some slotslike the BP slots, you don't expect to use ONE BP at all times.</div></div><hr />

What percentage of your gaming time do you spend getting quadded for 800?<br />
<br />
What percentage of your gaming time do you spend cannibalizing for mana?<br />
<br />
If a mob hits you for 200+ while slowing, once the melee take aggro and you can passively regen that damage instead of having to cast a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">personally id say the higher ac bp is better anyday.<br />
<br />
However i have always played the nore aggressive shmmay races ie ogre/troll  because i always fought mobs toe to toe.<br />
<br />
I NEVER Liked healing with my shamns and so if the grp ssssaw me in the melee all the time they never tried t make me into a second healer; ok some folk have shamns stereoytped as healers and think they know what YOU ought to be doing.<br />
<br />
if u dont melee mobs while soloing 40+ then maybe ikky is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would go for the wolfcaller, no contest, but i solo a lot and i go with slow, dogdog and tank, so AC and hp are crucial to my style.<br />
<br />
I regen about 26hp per tick as it is with buffs etc, and my style of soloing doesn't require a lot of spell casting. I figure that when things get messy, the AC is more likely to save your but than the extra regen.<br />
<br />
but like I said, different people play different styles, so go with what feels right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Uh...why wear the froggy at all? :p   Get iksar and wait til you get wolfcaller's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got an Ikky at 52 and LOVE it.  I have noticed a significant difference in my ability to regen mana with the BP plus regen spell on me.<br />
<br />
While I often get smacked by a MOB after I cast a slow, I do not go toe to toe woth MOBS much since I dinged lv. 50.  I tend to be the group slower/haster/healer and even when I solo I now tend to use doggie and root/rot.<br />
<br />
Soooo play style important.  Mine's changed over time and now that I do not go toe to toe with mobs, I think the Ikky better choice until I can get a significant upgrade.  The mana regen is NICE!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Barm, I am in the high end game on the bertox server and it totally depends whether or not my Dots + slow + malo + # of other shaman there.  VT as well as other high end zones can drop shaman fairly fast as i am sure PoP will do aswell.  I have been rampaged in NToV, AoW among various other mobs.  You right 9 tims outta 10 i dont take that kinda damage.  I have a fungal greatstaff which sits in my backpack so when i need to regen i can equip and click and i lose 0 stats by using a perma item.  <br />

overall with resists now maxxing out at 500 and your stats now maxxing out over about 300 or so the mana you can get from more wis hps and mana gear will now fanominally change the aspect of the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
It kind of does depend on your situation and whether you spend more time solo or grouped and where you spend time doing either.<br />
<br />
If you are going to fight mobs that cast mean stuff, you will prolly want resists in every slot you can cram them in to avoid getting raped by nukes/AE.  Most raid situations are going to have you wanting something closer to the Wolfcallers, but for sleepy solos like FG, Chardok ent, and other pop N' drop locations the Ikky BP will save you some work.  If you decide to haul off and go solo in Ssra or a similarly demanding location an Ikky BP ain't gonna help your cause much.  <br />
<br />
The Froglok is what I wanted to upgrade to from my BS tunic once RoK came out and today I would get a Firekeepers Tunic for 2K over it in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Podunk,<br />
<br />
You have a point for the added value of stats with the raised caps, but at his level he should be worrying more about mana regen than 210 vs. Disease.<br />
<br />
Even with torpor, I pull the fungi off my monk when I go on raids.  Personally, I think the fungi is pretty much the best shaman BP at any level.  It gives you health or mana, whichever you need.  That's better than an FT item.  <br />
<br />
The iksar is only 5HP/tick but has a tangible effect.  You can feel when you take it off.  Stats don't.  Ever find yourself still wearing an enduring breath item a day or so later by accident?  I have and I didn't notice the loss of those stats.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes i have been there for why the heck do i still have my rebreather on my head mid combat, however i do notice the difference not only because my helm has 34 more ac than my rebreather but the fact it also had 15 wis and 15 to all resists.  But you are right, sometimes you dont notice.  I have never have yet to own a regen BP because i never felt they were worth the stat loss.  I could solo the shrooms in FG pulling pairs will no problems for mana since i could canny5 and torpor mid battle without losing too many hps at all.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to your personal preference in the end.  I myself cast my regen buff, replenishment and just use that or any druid group regen but 9 times outta 10 i dont even use that.  I have FT 1 and canny 5 and i dont tend to have too many problems with mana or loss of hps in general unless like i found out last night buffing all tanks with focus 2 that well it SUCKS 25+ tanks at 12% mana a cast = mana goes fast even with KEI and canny 5.<br />
<br />
I agree the fungi tunic is a valuable asset no problems there, but i still believe that if i could have 50hp and 50 mana + wis and resists i would take it over regen simply for the fact if you have 10 wis on a BP or 14 i believe on wolfcallers thats 140 extra mana, and if you have a bigger mana pool you should have to canny less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">after a quick look at your magelo I'd have to say you can't afford to give up the stats, regen be damned. Go for the Wolfscaller all the way.  And you get can4 and kraggs in 2 levels, what makes regen a moot point anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am Armak's Guild leader and the one he spoke to, I think Armak is missing a little of the information so I will clarify here as it was missed in the tells during the HoT raid in question.<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that the guild in question is equipping the melees as first priority. Vindi is out of the guild range currently though we getting there fast. We feel that a melee will make far more use that a shaman especially when a lot of our melee have forgone Kael drops.<br />
<br />
Myself and the other main shaman are both level 60 and share slowing duties with Armak on Insidious and buffs so a SS bp for tanking isnt that relevant. The other main shaman wears a fungi whereas I wear an iksar BP.....<br />
<br />
I and the other main shaman have attended all the HoT raids near enough as both have been in the guild since nearly when the server started, I think Armak has been on two HoT raids with the guild.<br />
<br />
We have a loot policy that means we equip the melee then secondary classes. In fact on the last HoT raid tonight, I won the chain BP by pure default as no other chain melee class was there that didnt have it and I was the only shaman. Obviously we are getting to the stage when secondary classes are winning the decent drops, I have missed loots due to this but the guild as a whole is important.<br />
<br />
I dont generally talk abut internal guild policy on public boards but Armak wears our guild tag and enough people from our server would be aware of that so I thought i had better respond :)<br />
<br />
Oh and both main shaman have torpor so regen is less important to us.</div></div><hr />
