<br />
Is there anything out there that will let me right click Pillage Enchantment other then the Golem Metal Wand?  I would really like to be able to strip those silly buffs from those cocky Enchanters faster.<br />
<br />
I do get a kick out of watching them waste time trying to strip my buffs though, I dont buff against Enchanters.<br />
<br />
I checked Allakhazam's but there data base is messed up regarding this item.<br />
<br />
As for the Wand itself, it used to drop in the old CT so I am assuming it now drops in the Feerrott with all the other old CT loots.  Has anyone seen this drop since the CT revamp?</div></div><hr />

My Guild is Sol Ro enabled and I expect to see most of us in the Eplanes by the end of December, maybe before then. /shrug<br />

Those items are nice, but not what I am looking for.  Cast times on those make them useless against a clicky buff or two.  Was hoping for an item that has Pillage Enchantment at a minimum.<br />
<br />
I guess I could rotate AM and NM during a duel, but I think they are along the same spell line so I couldnt chain cast the two I dont think.<br />
<br />
If I could cast AM then cast NM before AM refreshes, that would be nice.</div></div><hr />

You can, I do it all the time.  Just because two spells are in the same spell line, doesn't mean they share the same refresh timer.  You can chain cast malo and malos with no delay.  Ditto for our slows, annuls, avatars, etc...  Only problem is that it takes up two spell slots, which is a lot in pvp.</div></div><hr />
