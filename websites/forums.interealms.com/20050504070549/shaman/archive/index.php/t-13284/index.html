<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jambolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild got on a discussion about hybrids and it came about that Shaman are hybrid of cleric/enchanter.<br />
<br />
Is this true? I had always considered shaman as a priest class, same with all wisdom casters CLR DRU SHM.<br />
<br />
Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans are not hybrids.<br />
<br />
One could also consider druids a hybrid of wizard and cleric (actually necro and cleric would be slightly more accurate). <br />
<br />
Yes shamans can slow and haste, and yes they can heal. but the similarities end there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman = Hybrid?<br />
Answer = No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you get spells at level 1?<br />
Do you get Specialization?<br />
Do you get Gate?<br />
<br />
Hybrids get none of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hybrid means the combination between a warrior and a caster class. And we are definitely not that, clerics can outmelee us.<br />
<br />
However we are &quot;generalists&quot;, like druids, with a huge selection of spell lines and a matching confusion as to what our specialty is. Except that everyone does know that slow is very powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snarky of Cazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hybrids are just a combination of two or more classes, warrior is not required. Beastlords, for example, are a combination of monk/shaman with a bit of mage thrown in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hybrids are just a combination of two or more classes<br />
<br />
VI actually used to have some actual classifications.  Their list of &quot;hybrids&quot; were SK, Paladin, Ranger, and Bard.  Only logical that Beastlords would fit there.<br />
<br />
Spells at 9, 15, 22, 30, 39, 49?  Hybrid = True</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">However we are &quot;generalists&quot;, like druids, with a huge selection of spell lines and a matching confusion as to what our specialty is.

<br />
<br />
What gets me is that The only thing we do better than everyone else is slow...which is only 5% better than Enchanter slow...<br />
<br />
Now Heal are done better by Druids and clerics by over 200% +<br />
<br />
<br />
We get snookered!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Now Heal are done better by Druids and clerics by over 200% +<br />
<br />
Not true at all.  Torpor\Q will outheal any druid or cleric in almost any exp situation with some AA.  Only thing it falls behind is CH by clerics on plate classes and then they need to be healing 4k or more per CH.  Torpor\Q also works well against AoE damage with quick buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First off, no we are not a hybrid class.  We do not share spells with a parent class (although we do share basic priest spells like heal and gate).  If you look at a ranger, sk, beastlord, or whatever, most of their 1-49 spells are the same spells their caster parent gets, except the hybrid gets it later.  They get some original stuff but most of it draws from the same idea or theme as their parent class (paladins get holy magic stuff like clerics, sk's get evil lifetappy stuff like necros, beastlords get spiritual stuff like shamans).<br />
<br />
Second of all, whoever said that the only thing we do better than anyone else is slow is very very wrong and should just delete their shaman now if you honestly believe that.<br />
<br />
I am a level 65 shaman with a more or less full spellbook (missing group shrink and group regen), and I have 93 AA.  My relevant grouping AA's are canni5, SCM3, QB2, and SCRM.  I'm pretty well off on gear/spells/aa, but I am far from being uber.  I am not a special case.  When it comes to grouping, I am a monster.  There is no other class that brings as much to a group as I do - there is no doubt in my mind.  Call me egotistical, but I think shaman is the best grouping class in the game.  Give me someone with taunt and 4 miscellaneous gimps and you have a functioning group that will never die.  I kept a group of 5 melees alive for 10 hours yesterday.  We had one person die to a train.  That was it.  Let me describe what I do in a group:<br />
<br />
I give everyone fo7 for the HP.<br />
I give everyone talisman of the boar for the HP.<br />
I give everyone talisman of alacrity for the increased damage.<br />
I give everyone ferine avatar for the increased damage.<br />
I give everyone regrowth of dah khura, and myself and the tank get replenishment.  This heals splash damage on the non-tanks (I don't have to directly heal them, they heal themselves by the time the next mob is there).<br />
<br />
Lets look at this section.  I have people: HP buffs, haste, atk buffs, and hp regen.  What other class gets all that?  Beastlords, but theirs are inferior to ours.  These buffs alone make a group much more powerful.  Lots of people on these boards like to be sarcastic about the effectiveness of our buffs, but they really should look a little closer and they might see how big a difference they really make.  Next section:<br />
<br />
Puller goes out and brings in a mob.<br />
As the mob is inc, I cast Q on the tank.  This only takes me 4.5 seconds (will be 3 seconds in a few days).  It takes very little mana because I have SCM3 and a decent mana pool.  It lasts damn near forever because I have SCRM.<br />
I malos the mob.<br />
I slow the mob.<br />
I apply Q to the puller if he got hit.<br />
If the tank is a knight, I apply blood of saryn.  If it is a warrior I skip this because I don't like tanking.<br />
Canni Canni Canni<br />
Reapply Q to tank.<br />
A decent plate tank will almost never need a heal besides Q.  If you use a decent ranger to tank he'll need about 1 kraggs per fight.<br />
<br />
If there are adds I root them before they get to the group.  If I am too slow on the root I just slow them and deal with it.  I might have to apply a tnarg's every now and then, but that is not a problem at all because I can get enough mana for 4 or 5 tnarg's with a single press of canni5.  I also keep a pet up that I mainly use as a sacrifice to buy me a few seconds when we get multiple adds.  He can tank 1 mob long enough for me to slow the rest.<br />
<br />
If I am using blood of saryn I will need to use canni5 every now and then.  If I am just casting my normal debuffs and Q, I don't need canni5.  My FT regens almost all the mana for me and a canni4 here or there tops me out.<br />
<br />
If you have a bard in the group, it becomes retardedly easy.  Their HP regen means that everyone except the tank gets completely healed of any splash damage before the fight is done, and their mana regen means you won't have to canni4 hardly ever, especially if you can bum a crack off someone (I never go off to exp without a fresh kei from nexus).<br />
<br />
A shaman might not be as powerful as a cleric and chanter COMBINED but we are very close.  A cleric and chanter is overkill for a normal exp group.  A cleric can't do it on their own, and neither can a chanter (unless you have multiple paladins w/ a bard).  A druid isn't even a consideration.<br />
<br />
You do not even need a full spellbook and AA to do this.  I went a LONG time without any 65 spells and barely and 63-64s.  SCM3 and SCRM are also recently acquired.  You do not need Q to be the main healer in a group.  You can do just fine with kragg's, you'll just have to work harder to keep your mana up.<br />
<br />
IN SUMMARY, if you think the shaman class is gimp, then it is you yourself that is gimp, not the class.  No offense.  We are a goddamn good class and it pisses me off when other shamans think differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What gets me is that The only thing we do better than everyone else is slow...which is only 5% better than Enchanter slow...<br />
<br />
Now Heal are done better by Druids and clerics by over 200% +<br />
<br />
<br />
We get snookered!<br />
<br />
If you look at our spell numbers, then yes, Chanters have a slow that's 5% less than our top magic slow.  However, they get NO AoE slow.  They get NO disease-based slow.  They get the two highest aggro lines of spells in the game, Charm and Mezz and the lowest HP's of any other class.  When a chanter mezzes a mob, the tank has to stand there, shouting insults at it for 10 secs before he hits attack.  Otherwise, '/ooc need a rezz for a dead chanter at orc 1.'  <br />
<br />
I'm a BEAR!  I laugh at slowed mobs!  I can tank them BETTER than the warrior can, because I spend the time healing myself and making more mana.  I can easily juggle two or three adds, keep them stacked and rooted, until the tank is ready to kill them.  If the tank gets too close to my rooted mob, I can move the mob away, so the cleric doesn't have to use his precious mana.  And while the tank is on the last mob, I'll be FM again, while the cleric is still looking for KEI.<br />
<br />
NOBODY snookers The Bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jambolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well the argument came about when a suggestion for a spell rotation was proposed for raid spectral/rune drops. I pointed out that hybrid classes would have an advantage over priest/caster classes since they get a significant less amount of spect/rune spells.<br />
<br />
Thats when it was pointed out to me that Shamans were a &quot;hybrid&quot;<br />
<br />
I resolved quickly by listing each class along with the # of 63 64 and 65 spect/rune spell drops. Shaman came out on top of EVERY other class at a total of 18 (next was 17, druid). quite a few over even other &quot;pure casters&quot; and way beyond the 6 needed by rangers.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how other guilds distribute spect/rune drops? (especially applies to guild just recently acquiring these, not the guilds that have more than enuff by now)<br />
<br />
Thanks, :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman != hybred<br />
<br />
Hybred classes are the ones where they take the good lower level spells from a class and give it to another class.<br />
<br />
No other class in the game has as many useless spells as Shammy's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, typically there are more clerics on a raid than any other caster class, so you wind up getting an assload of cleric spells if you do runes &quot;fairly&quot; with respect to rolling them to the percentage of each class attending the raid.  <br />
My guild did it this way for a long time but finally got fed up by the 14th &quot;The Silent Command&quot; or whatever the hell gay ass cleric spell turned up from a rune, and decided to do it differently.  <br />
Runes were turned in for each class in attempts to get the MGBable spells for those classes.  <br />
1)Focus of the 7th<br />
2)Protection of the 9<br />
3)Brells Stalwart Shielding<br />
4)Tunare whatever the hell ranger spell<br />
5)Voice of Quellious<br />
<br />
Those were the important ones to get a hold of for purposes of raiding.  We made a push for those and people were a lot more happy with the way runes were being doled out.  Once those were done, we went back to normal rune rolling. <br />
<br />
I now have three of my 65 spells and feel rather good about it.  Q, 7th, and FA.  Missing three spells from the PoP expansion.  The other one is Malosinia . . . can't seem to get the dam thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We keep a list of PoP spells needed for members.<br />
<br />
Guildleader (probably with input from officers) turns in runes (and specs back when everyone needed those, now we just let individuals loot those) to whichever spell vendor gives the spell most needed by the guild.  Of course, you don't always get those (most often group buffs were the most desired), so you gradually fill out entire spell lists.  That way, if you get something no one needs, spell can be sold for peridot/tradeskill fund.  I may be mistaken, but Henora (officer in my guild) can correct me if I am.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just to clarify my previous post. I am very well versed in the fact that over all Shaman are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Hence my 65 Shaman. I was merely pointing out that in almost every category we are out done.<br />
<br />
Heals:<br />
Torpor/Quiessence vs. Cleric Heal over time spels...we loose.<br />
<br />
Our 2000 point almost complete heal vs druids 5K and cleric 7.5K...we loose.<br />
<br />
Our quick heal is slower and cost more than druids and clerics.<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
<br />
Our HP buff is less than druids or clerics (yes I realize ours stacks with the others.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs - WE WIN!!!!!<br />
<br />
Debuffs:<br />
<br />
Tash vs malo - close call there but tash seems to be more funtional in most cases. <br />
<br />
Slows: we WIN!!! (but only by a margin). Yes, we have AE and Disease slow, which I have only found very limited use for either.<br />
<br />
Overall Shaman have the most versatility in the game, but I would still like to see Shaman shown a few improving factors that are useful. It seems to me that almost all the other classes have had major advance in the last few expansions while shaman are given not much of anything.<br />
<br />
Granted this is because Shaman are the most ballanced class in the game, but I WANT NEW TOYS TO PLAY WITH!!!! Everyone else is getting them, why not us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Been playing eq now for 6 months 6 days and only played a shaman since day 1.. (my de wizzy couldn't get out of the city so scrapped).. Only thing I've wanted to complain about so far are just spoilage... affliction efficiency nerf.. woopty do.. less mana for slows so now I can sit on my horse and send a nuke instead of a jbb.. affliction haste.. refresh is what would spoil me even more not the actual casting of it.. what else is there? str buffs in spell slots, yeah I want to get an uber spell every time I turn in a spectral.. wait a sec, if they did that all shaman spells would be 100pp in the bazaar I can now pass on on spectral drops instead of jump for joy.. How many etherial parchments are you guys considering to just destory or turn in and give to someone ANYONE to take it? I get tells &quot;Siludorf do you have fosouls?&quot; if I answer no I get like 3 fos 2 bore and some other crap the other guy didn't know what to do with. Consider level 61/62 bl spells to be VENDOR sold again.. why? All the shaman turn etherials into the bl guy to get infusio of spirits for their 49 shammy friends.. what else can we complain about? Alchemy = useless skill.. hmm.. I still am trying to get to 200, am I retarded? no it's just freaking fun and bragging rights.. I'm going to MAX alchemy aa, /tell uberShaman what's your alchemy at? =] <br />
<br />
What else? mitigated slow.. /tell Siludorf (from cleric) I'm full mana lets go to pos (from bot) so these things actually do damage.. WHAT? <br />
<br />
Now how many times have you been the only healer slower haster buffer cc in your group with 5 other damage dealers? Shaman need another nerf.. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blah blah blah is immune to slow&quot; *** do we need these messages for? After the 10th resist on a slowable the shaman should know to either try a different slow the next time or just stick with heals.. Shaman = spoiled.. &quot;I can tank, heal and crowd control&quot; no wonder your spell costs 250k what are you complaining about? You want to solo Rallos Zek? lmao off topic huh? sorry for the babble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The only reason someone could claim a Shaman a hybrid is because they can tank mobs.   A well geared, well AA'd Shaman can out tank some melee with less AA.<br />
<br />
(Yes Kiddies... Combat Agility 3 and Lightning Reflexes 5 are actually that good)<br />
<br />
<br />
Distributing 65 Spells smartly is how they should be done, which is not always what is &quot;Fair&quot;.<br />
<br />
65 Spells should be handed in for Cleric until there are enough Grp Virtue and Group KM's so the MGB Clerics can keep them AE'd for Raiding purposes (Say, 3-4)... then... Hand in Runes for either Druid or Shaman until you get a couple BoT9 and Foc7's for MGB's... Next...   Paladins for Brell's.   Then Beastlords.... then Rangers.     After all the Major MGB buff's are taken care of, you can worry about what's &quot;Fair&quot;<br />
<br />
Warg<br />
<br />
<br />
(Notice...  3 of the 6 classes what should be in line for 65 Spells are Hybrids.. the Hybrid Grp buffs have become very useful in large encounters dependent on what you want to add to the Raid.   Paladins are Raw +HP, Beastlords give HP +Mana+HP regen, and Rangers give the least HP, but Raw Attack power.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's cool for a quick listing, but to be accurate, Shamans get 16.<br />
5 runes<br />
11 spectrals<br />
13 ethereals including one from beastlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The only reason someone could claim a Shaman a hybrid is because they can tank mobs.   A well geared, well AA'd Shaman can out tank some melee with less AA.<br />

<br />
I thought no one would ever bring this up.<br />
<br />
with awesome HP regen<br />
with good amount of AC<br />
Combat Agility 3 and Lightning Reflexes<br />
Combat Stability 3 and Innate Defense<br />
<br />
We don't tank all that bad.  But careful with the statement that we can out tank some melee.  Some shaman without the gear and AA's have a hard time understanding this and still other shamans are so fearful of this possibly changing they squash it down when it comes up.  These same fearful shamans go to rediculous extremes creating project names like alpha pet *sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My guild turns in runes/specs gotten from raids in order of must useful for the raids. What does that entail? Well as already mentioned MGBed buffs are high up on the list. Group symbol for clerics, group focus for shaman, group 9 for druids, C5 for enchanters, group brells for pallys etc. I don't list group virtue for clerics since the only time we use it is when we have stacking issues with mob ae's. Otherwise we use mgb 9/symbol.<br />
<br />
Next up I'd put appropriate debuffs. Malos/malosinia, enchanter messes etc. Better debuffs you have the better it is for the raid. If your doing a raid where you have adds that need to be messed you sure as heck better make sure that your enchanter have the appropriate mes to do that.<br />
<br />
Next i'd put in appropriate nukes. Better nukes for wizzys/mages etc = more dps, more dmg and better results for the raids.<br />
<br />
Obviously you aren't gonna be able to pick the spell you want for the turn in so you'll end up filling out the other spells too for those classes while getting the key spells.<br />
<br />
What to pick first, well thats hard to say. If you want to be really organized about it you can make a list of all the raid needed spells and who needs them and turn in specs/runes to the most needy group at the time. That isn't always the best tho imo. For example some of the first runes my guild got went to shaman turn ins which netted use malos and focus of the 7th for our only MGB shaman at the time. With typical 2 shaman per raid and only 4 active shaman on the roster I'm sure clerics or other classes would have shown up as more needy but that Group focus sure made things alot nice for the raid and for the poor shaman.</div></div><hr />
