<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK with all the talk about people leaving. disgruntled people with GoD etc. everyone talking about cancelling, is there nobody around that is still having fun with EQ? I remember the first time i logged into everquest and i will never forget it, i was in awe and was hooked from the first 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
After 4 + years im still enjoying myself the only thing that diminishes my fun is all the bitching and complaining and the numbers slowly decreasing from this once packed game. I have played beta for all the new games that are suppose to be EQ killers.. only one i havent played is WoW and im sorry in my opinion they dont hold a candle to EQ. Ill probably try Eq2 to see if it gives me the same aweish feeling as EQ did or maybe WoW will when i finally get a chance to play it but bottom line is EQ is still a damn fun game to play.<br />
<br />
I think if people would relax and enjoy the game instead of trying to blast through all the content as soon as it comes out than bitch at sony cause they have nothing to do than when something is released early bug ridden to give those people something to do , than the bitching increases 2 fold, now in no way am i defending soe cause i think they are tards for most of the things they do as far as releasing expansions etc. But i think the community has a hand to play in it also and we cant pass the whole buck.<br />
<br />
Anyway im done just wanted to /salute the people in EQ who have come and gone and hope that alot of good people still stay around.<br />

<br />
I spend more Time soloing because it's just a fact that Shaman aren't all that hot in the higher tier GoD content.<br />
<br />
I like to think I am a skilled shaman but GoD makes me feel like a leper most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've only just hit 65, and I'm not encountering any of the problems that others are having, and I'm still having fun playing with friends in old world dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm still having fun. I'm happy i'm in a guild with mostly mature casual players, we dont rush things. We even broke into elementals a while ago. <br />

casual &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im reasonably casual based, my shaman is 65, but im preferring playing my wizard at the moment. May change, may not, im having fun either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll stay a little bit before wow is released, after that its doubtful, unless i start FF11 before that...<br />
<br />
I still havent had a chance for GoD content since my guild is working through PoP right now. The only thing im hoping to be in GoD right now is getting twinked by some quarmfarmer friends who let decent stuff rot on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Ill fool around in the planes and LDON a few times a week perhaps, but we're approaching the end soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After 4+ years and trying to level my 3rd character to 65th, I still enjoy playing EQ.  As long as friends I have made keep playing, I will keep on going also.  I must admit thought that I am really disappointed in GoD after how good of an expansion LDoN was, but even with that said, I will not plan on leaving yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bangor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I for one am giving them one more expansion if they make getting my spells anywhere as difficult as GoD spells then i'll call it quits. I'll be damned if i pay $24.99 so i have to pull teeth and pray i can get my spells, at least ldon and PoP had good ways that weren't to easy but not virtually impossible like GoD. I love the game but it seems they are trying to make the game extremely difficult for casual and hardcore players that aren't in timed guilds. 1 more expansion is it. WoW seems extremely tempting due to the lack of availability for the seasoned players to be able to acquire spells and gear. I hope soe comes to their senses and realize they are pushing us away instead of embracing us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Staying. Still enjoy it, haven't hit the wall yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Still here, though I am going through a break at the moment.  I have become more of a casual player over the years.  Still plan on playing for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still have fun playing, only just got 55 so still got some time before im 65, still have fun grouping with my friends ect. so im here ,unless alot of my friends  got to eq2 then i may go with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's all about your attitude IMHO. I've quit in frustration 2 or 3 times over one issue or another in the 5 years I've been playing this game. What keeps pulling me back is the interaction with people that love gaming as much as I do. I finally decided I was just going to enjoy the game no matter what is bugged, not working, or working as intended. I don't care if I get to Time or whatever GoD zone is the super zone or not. I finally completed my VT key after 2 years of working on it (and the rift was the second piece I got) though I still may not see Vex Thal for a while. The race is not important to me. The journey is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I still have a lot of fun with EQ, my RL friends play it, and I really like the people in my guild, so I'm staying for the foreseeable future.  Of course, my main is a warrior and I'm very happy with the recent melee changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still enjoy it, in a casual guild, we take what mobs we can when they are up, usually on designated raid nights (working on getting into Time now).  My shaman who was my main for years has been my bot for a year and a half now but still enjoy playing him, occasionally I still play him alone.  As long as I can continue to progress my characters and the guild and my friends are still there, I will remain, I already had a year long break and came back refreshed.<br />
<br />
GoD stuff has been a challenge and fun but Ive only personally done the first 4 trials with my rogue and most of the guild seems uninterested in it except occasional small raids on Ferubi.  Lots of guildies have retired recently which is a shame, right after we broke into the Elementals.  Most of them have moved over to try other games out and could have something to do with summer as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I may be more of a lurker, but I've been around since 99, I still enjoy this game. Recently went to plane of Sky and got keyed for all but the last island, was a real blast. Honestly, i'm not in the end game, but I don't quite care. My small guild is slowly working our way through PoP and we recently killed all of the tier 1 bosses which to me is a huge accomplishment.  I absolutely love this game for the people I've met. <br />
<br />
I won't be quitting anytime soon because I've put 5 years into making my characters. I have put 5 years into making friends and getting where I am now. I will continue chugging along slowly having a blast the whole time until all my friends quit on me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Freecare Spiritwise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I plan on staying. Still having a great time playing EQ. Currently 65 shm / bst / cler, and levelling my necro up like crazy.<br />
<br />
The game is what you make of it. I play in a smallish family oriented guild, which is just fine for me. Do I care if I never see the EP's or PoTime? Not a bit. The people who leave our small guild to be &quot;uber&quot; either come back after a month, or retire once they have all their flags and uber loot.<br />
<br />
Lately my shaman has been focused on soloing / 2 boxing dungeon crawls, and it's just been fun as hell. Deep in a dungeon, skill &gt; gear. Most of the old planes / dungeons have been revamped, have good exp / loot, and sit empty most of the time while everyone else grinds out 5 aa's a day in PoP and beats their head against the wall of GoD.<br />
<br />
Still having fun on my shaman 3 years later, although it took soloing to bring back my love of the class. Character progression to me is just continuing to have fun. It's all a matter of perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Im probably staying a little longer since the european WoW beta phase doesnt seem to have started yet :)<br />
<br />
I recently joined a new guild since almost everyone had left the old one to seek glory and lewts in far more uber guilds. This change has certainly been a positive one since I am now guilded with some my oldest friends in EQ again. Whether or not it will keep me playing for long is to be seen. I suspect that when WoW comes out I will try all I can to get my friends to leave EQ for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most definitely staying. My friends are all here on EQ, and aren't moving to any of the other new games coming out ... I see no reason to retire Tordail and move away from them. They're the whole reason I play and enjoy this game. Not to mention the fact that I have a great guild full of people that make my sides hurt from laughing so much every single night. I enjoy playing my shaman. Tordail has been 5 years in the making, and I'm proud of the work I've put into him and how far its taken me. He and I have a ways to go, yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Im staying, but not on Phattey.  He is all but retired now, and i will probably be lvling any number of my alts till another class catches hold with me.  The problem i have playing other classes is i think like a shaman.  I need mobs slowed/debuffed/dotted for me to function hehe.  I like my beastlord atm, but not sure if ill stay with him.  Probably going to lvl my SK and then start some 2 boxing stuff.  Wont plvl, i want him to be maxed in all areas of his skills, but once hes 60+ he will be a good duo partner for Phats and i can start farming for the rest of my chars.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am staying. A friend and I have been playing off and on since release. we have a few different duo's that we play. Currently our highest (and favorite) are his 62 Mage and my 61 Shaman. Although from reading the posts of end game Shaman I can understand their frustrations, I have not reached that level and frankly probably never will so the game remains a fun time for me. Except for the terribly annoying fact that key spells are sooooo expensive and or difficult to get for a unguilded Shaman. Still no Torpor for this lowly Shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm staying... for now.  3 months left to go on subscription.  I don't feel like logging in much though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">JFC, when someone with gear like Aruman feels like &quot;a leper&quot; in GoD, goddamit, **** is BROKE!  Checking out his magelo I see he has every concievable focus and kewl effect and almost 7k hps unbuffed.  Amazing.  <br />
And this man is worthless in the GoD expansion.  <br />
Hear that little shamans?  Someday, no matter how you try, you too will be utterly worthless!  <br />
<br />
What a great message for newbs, I swear.  <br />

Just more ravings from an increasingly bitter shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am staying.  My wife is staying.  Our friends are staying...  but my Shm has been shelved for a long time.<br />
I started a Bst and a Nec.  They are both in their 50s atm.  I have to admit that I love the Nec (more than I ever loved my Shm).  The Bst has pretty much lost its appeal to me.  <br />
My wife plays a mag and that is a great char.  I usually just duo my Nec and her Mag.  Our good friend is a cleric (I think it would be a boring class, but he likes it).<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people are staying.  My wife, our friend and I have been around since Beta and we still play several days a week.  I love the game.  We have tried every other game that came out and nothing compares.  <br />
I chose a nec because people on this board recommended shelving the shm for a while (until they are fixed) and creating another char like a nec...  Thank you to whoever said that....  I love my nec more than I loved my Shammy.<br />
Try another class for a while.  You are not stuck with a Shm.  There are lots of other classes to play and enjoy.  They must all be fun in their own way or nobody would play them.</div></div><hr />

Amen.  I can't even get excited anymore about raiding.   If my shammy gets all the phat Time lewts my guild is currently farming, she will still suck in GoD.  It boggles my mind that all the stuff I've been busting tail to get all this time doesn't really interest me now because it won't help my char enough.<br />
<br />
I have several alts between 32-53.  One of them will probably become my main soon.  I too will keep playing until Sony shuts the doors, though, got too many Rl friends who play.</div></div><hr />
