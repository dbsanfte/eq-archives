<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this has gotten to me badly, what do Vah shir have as god selection on sullon zek? i am guessing agnostic is neutral if they can use that... but nobody could be agnostic as i recall from my dark elf zek days.  And since i am on the vah shir subject, are vah shir KoS to ogre/troll/iksar cities since they are agnostic, sorta like thurgadin welcomes every1 since it is expansion?<br />
<br />
Dumb questions but they have really gotten under my skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They can only be on the good team on SZ...  I guess that would narrow down the gods somewhat.  Just go to make a character on SZ and see what the god is.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All Vah Shir on SZ can only worship Tunare, and hence have no other choice than to play with the good side.<br />
<br />
Agnostic is no option for anyone on SZ and they also modified some other races deities. I wanted to send you to CasterRealms site over the different team choices over on SZ but they unfortunately haven't updated for a long time now...<br />
<br />
...and yes. A Vah Shir on adventure into Grobb will of course be eaten in a sec... kitty meat *yummie*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems a little odd that on normal servers, vah shir have no choice but agnostic, thus making them neutral.  But on SZ, they are not even given the option of being neutral, and are forced to be good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They're forced to be good because the good team got the shaft at the beginning of the server.</div></div><hr />

An example of a hilarious kitty (bard). (http://www.notacult.com/fansythefamous.htm) <br />

Thought you might enjoy that.  Sorry it is only tangentially related. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
