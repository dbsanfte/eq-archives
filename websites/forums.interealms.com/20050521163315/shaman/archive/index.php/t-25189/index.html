<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Zlandicar, that nasty fokker in DN. I was feeling froggy after reading about an SK &amp; a Necro killing him.. why can't i?<br />
<br />
Bounced 4 Turgurs, 4 Malosinia's &amp; 2 Grummus's on him. All after malos/MD. So... when did he become so dang MR? I got him down to 78% before the &quot;big splat&quot;. Melee wasnt too bad, resisted everything, took probably 7 mins before i died.<br />
<br />
Input?<br />
<br />
I KNOW if i can't slow him I can't win.. period. I was belly-casting for sure.... anyone have any constriticism?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dactylus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try giveing  dogdog a tash stick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You prolly just got unlucky. I have landed turgurs on him a couple of times before<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't there an (old world) weapon that procs tashani....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nihil might work a little better for the initial slow (with the -40 resist modifier and all), the spell just rocks. Probably a pain to maintain due to the short duration, so replacing it with Turgur's will still be a priority, but should help getting things under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zland has always been a pita to land slow on but yeah, like people were saying, Journeyman's Walking Stick (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6618) will help a lot and try and use nihil if you have it for the initial slow.  As far as dotting him goes, I don't know that your gonna land anything on him, cold nukes are about all I would guess you'll get off.  As far as I remember he's extremely PR and DR besides the MR portion that you've commented on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">from what I am reading you are approaching the fight the wrong way..<br />
why would you ever try malosinia if malos wasn't in? the difference isn't that great, plus sinia would land easier once malos is in if you had the time to waste.. if you need to buy time, try sending in a dogdog + swarm pets in first.. if one of them enrages that will buy you most likely enough time to slow/malos and stick bane on him or something. Malos + Nihil dominates zlandi. then after that you can take your time to land slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You misread. Malos/MD was step1.<br />
<br />
I don't have Nihil, lost the roll on the on the only Yiktu rune I've ever seen drop.<br />
<br />
After my wipe, a few friends helped c/r &amp; kill Zlandicar. I could not get turgurs to land on that round either. 6 attempts.<br />
<br />
Once I'm 70 &amp; have Nihil, I'll give it another go &amp; post results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Open up with malos, then melee with tash stick and cast nihil as often as you can. Once nihil lands equip TA or mem turgur. Once turgur lands dispell until you dispell your own malos (you'll know you got all his buffs then). Un-suspend your pet after slow lands so he doesn't get plowed by rampage.<br />
<br />
Re-cast malos then get sinia on, and after that it's really easy, just nuke with velium strike and keep turgurs up. Bane works semi-decent and epic dot works really well. Don't bother with disease or poison based spells.<br />
<br />
I've killed Zlandi solo about 25-30 times and never died so it's a pretty good and safe pp source, although the CoM is rarer than you might think :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the insight Wulf. I neglected to post my Magelo, here it is : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418549<br />
<br />
I'm a sub-5k HP's shaman as you can see. It seems nihil is the key to this encounter. It's something I should get anyway, so back to the top of the list it goes.<br />
<br />
I was only after Zlandi for Frak's talisman actually, to finish up the Earring of Phara Dar quest. It does look like a good challenge/money source as you mention though. As soon as I get that elusive Yiktu, I'll be reporting the results. Thanks for what looks like an ironclad strat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">here is how i do him:<br />
mem dispell magic, malos, malosinia et turgur(i dont have nihil)<br />
get a tash stick and a cristal pumice(or the item dispeller from SSRA basement)<br />
<br />
i land a Q on pet and send him then i dispell him twice(it has a long refresh so use your clicky between the 2 dispell)<br />
because Zland is a necro and cast himself a +40RM buff if i remember well<br />
after that(30 sec after the initial doggy rush) throw a malos and Q yourself<br />
then start to hit him with the tash stick<br />
<br />
as soon as it proc(2 proc /min usualy) start to try slow<br />
<br />
<br />
as soon as slow land(sometimes i need more than 6 tries!) try malosinia then cripple<br />
<br />
the rest of the fight is easy as hell :)</div></div><hr />
