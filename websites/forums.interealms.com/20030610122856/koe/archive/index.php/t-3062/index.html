<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A pastor, who was previously a sailor, was very aware that ships are addressed as &quot;she&quot; and<br />
         &quot;her&quot;. He often wondered what gender computers should be addressed as. To answer that<br />
         question, he set up two groups of computer experts.<br />
<br />
         The first was composed of women, and the second of men. Each group was asked to<br />
         recommend whether computers should be referred to in the feminine gender, or the<br />
         masculine gender. They were asked to give 4 reasons for their recommendation.<br />
<br />
         The group of women reported that the computers should be referred to in the masculine<br />
         gender because:<br />
<br />
         1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br />
<br />
         2. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br />
<br />
         3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they are the problem.<br />
<br />
         4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer you could<br />
         have had a better model.<br />
<br />
         The men, on the other hand concluded that Computers should be referred to in the feminine<br />
         gender because:<br />
<br />
         1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br />
<br />
         2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible<br />
         to everyone else.<br />
<br />
         3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br />
<br />
         4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck<br />
         on accessories for it.</div></div><hr />
