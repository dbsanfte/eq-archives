This obviously isn't the same car I own but it is exactly what mine looks like: Badass ;)  The dealer made me an offer I COUDLN'T refuse so now I have a '96 Cobra Mustang as my very first car. :D :D <br />
<br />
I was so happy, I had to tell someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raell Kromwell</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope that offer you could not refuse included paying for your insurance.  OUCH.  <br />
<br />
It is a nice ride thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabres Ostrandir</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was well aware what I was getting into before purchasing the car.  I had already talked with my insurance company and gotten an estimate on what it would be.  It's alot.  I am not going to say how much but it's alot.  It was still decent enough that I bought the car though.<br />
<br />
Besides, who could turn down a car like that?  It's a chick magnet ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">decairn</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh my first car was a Lincoln Mark VII.  Same engine as a Mustang but about a tonne heavier ;x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.  Insurance for a 99 ranger in North County, San Diego: $525/6 months.<br />
<br />
Move to Southland, LA (watts area):  $1750/six.<br />
<br />
Let's hope yours is closer to the former, but with a car like that and a first time owner... owie =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabres Ostrandir</div><div class="date">04-21-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shh!  I'll tell you a little secret if you promise to keep quiet about it...<br />
<br />
It's insured under my parnets name. ;)<br />
<br />
And yeah you pretty much hit the nail on the head with insurance when you quoted it at about $525.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That car will kick some butt.  Now don't wrap it around a tree.<br />
<br />
I'm serious.  When I think of the car trouble I got into when I was your age it makes me shudder (15 years later)<br />
... and that was in a station wagon.<br />
<br />
Have fun, but be very careful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congrats, and be safe.  Im most impressed with what I have seen of the responsibility you are taking in this whole car buying process (what I have gathered from all of your post on it). <br />
