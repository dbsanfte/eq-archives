<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone explain how to do this?  I got a parsing program, but I can't figure out what file it's supposed to be looking for or what.  Do I need to set some feature in eq to save logs?<br />
<br />
I've been solo'ing mature wurms the last few days and I want to check on the effects of cripple and my new pony.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

You can turn on logging by typing: /log on from your main chat window each time you start the game, or you can edit a the everquest.ini file in your everquest directory and set logging to TRUE in that file which will, from that point on, make logging on until you type /log off. <br />
<br />
With logging on, all of your chat display area will also be written to a file called eqlog.txt file found in your Everquest directory (this may contain your CHARACTER name and server number in the file name as well). It does not get over written each time, so be sure to rename it between sessions, or it will just get bigger and bigger. <br />
<br />
Make sure filters are set accordingly.  For example, if you have Your Misses or Your Hits turned off, it is impossible to determine what your hit ratio is.</div></div><hr />
