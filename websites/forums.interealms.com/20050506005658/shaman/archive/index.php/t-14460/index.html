<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was bored so i figured I would try soloing a gaurdian wurm. I headed over to Skyfire to scout the zone to see if any where up. I found 2 up which amazed me as i never see them. These 2 where wanderers and not at the VBP zone.<br />
<br />
I ran to the dragon statue and setup camp. Summoned doggy and buffed him up and handed him 2 gnoll hide lariats. I headed back to the spot where i saw them near the Overthere zone in. There was a group there and i noticed a druid pulling in one of the GW's. I knew i had to find the other quickly before the druids group could grab it. I found it quickly and pulled it.<br />
<br />
Landing slow on the pull i knew i had time to land my other debuffs which i followed up with malos and malicious decay. It was a tough pull weaving through mobs to finally reach my camp. I started with a Breath of Ultor and followed that with a epic dot. I kept myself torpored and canni 4 to maintain mana. I was self buffed only and running 1200ac and 3k hp and i was worried about using mass canni so i just stuck to canni 4.<br />
<br />
I was slowly loosing mana but i figured i had plenty to kill him off. around 50% i noticed a fast flurry of hits.. crap, i forgot to reslow him... channeling a slow, torpor and tnargs. i was backup on life and it was slowed. I was now at 20% mana. Bad News. I torpored/canni 4 just to maintain life and mana and just used epic dot and doggy for damage.<br />
<br />
Slowly its life droped 15% to 10% to 5%. I forgot to back off the dog and he dies to enrage. I finally get it to 3% which it starts to run. I am less than 5% mana and 25% life. I recast epic and start chain casting JBB. I cant kill it fast enough as it starts wandering into the center of the zone toward a Chomadrac. I panic and root it. I totally forgot they summon and it kills me. arrrgh..<br />
<br />
The druids group finished it off and rezzed me. They said it dropped mala and ask if i wanted it. I declined and gated out. Anouther day ill have revenge hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hahaha.  Sounds like a fun fight though, I've never had a chance to try one out solo, but have duo'd them plenty.  Will get one someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds like a great battle, even though in the end you lost, it sounds like to me you won, cause you got to experience just a fun battle.<br />
<br />
You willl win next time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will get it next time, after ya get one that low one time its easy.  Got my first one to 18%, then next try killed it and posted the log on the boards here and started an uproar!  Haha, GL on your next one, and hope ya get a good pp spell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">should have had your pet attack from the back, it wouldn't have died then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice attempt and nice story :)<br />
<br />
Remembering to reslow these is essential when you're in a low damage output group (or solo!) - to my shame I have killed two tanks this way :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh another thought - probably belongs in another thread though. You're level 65 which means you have the true spirit pet - can these use the mage summoned proccing weapons? If so I reckon dog would do more damage with those than with GHLs. If you're fighting something that's too high to be stunned by a GHL (as I think GWs are) then they're only good for agro really, and I doubt even the 61 pet can last long against a GW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Holy crap! You killed a guardian wurm and it dropped a spell?!  Last 3 I've done have dropped 8pp and wurm meat, what am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
@#$!! gwurms. Congrats on your attempt anyways.  I get a rush fighting them myself as my gear is pretty much bazaar junk and a missed cheal on the sk = insta-wipe.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />
