<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure you all have mains you focus on but how many do you play counting all your characters you care about?<br />
<br />
I have 2 (mage and druid) over 20 but am likely going to spread my wings wider and make some more, I find basically all the classes interesting.<br />
<br />
I'm not counting the assorted 1-5 types I'm sure we all have. I mean ones we play and care about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you're talking just about WoW, one.  Just the Shaman, and I haven't been playing that much lately, either.  <br />
<br />
To many games, not enough time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive my 60 pal and a rogue i'm playing now. Some of my friends are finally able to play non dialup and they zoomed past my rogue so been playing her now to catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two regularly: 60 Paladin and 48 Hunter. When Silverhand goes down (Which is often), I have a 20 Mage on another server.  Also have an 18 Shaman, 18 Priest (Dwarf) who get rested lubbin from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two, my shaman and my flavor of the month twink, the shadow priest! Last month's flavor was the hunter but he sucked so bad at low levels that I really wasn't having too much fun with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And yes I'm referring to WoW. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">28 Shaman on a pvp server gets a weekly workout.  On a pve server I play a 41 druid and a 28 warlock regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One for now but i plan on making an alliance twink when American servers open up for us Euro trash.</div></div><hr />

50 mage<br />
20 priest<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 regularly, no real main.  I play what I feel like playing at the time.  35 Mage and 38 Hunter.  I have a 23 Warrior, but he's boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">60 rogue<br />
41 shaman<br />

<br />
Just not enough time to play them all :)<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've only got the one main really, 53 Warrior.  I've dabbled with a Tauren Hunter, and he's kind of fun, but he's still only 23, and there are weeks where I'll do nothing but help out guildmates level their alts rather than play something other than the warrior.<br />
<br />
I find I tend to stick to one character and only dabble in alts until it's like a switch flicks and I'm all, &quot;Well, I've had enough of this, time to focus elsewhere.&quot; at which point I'll start playing another character full-time. For example, my EQ shaman was almost 3 years of non-deviation, and then one day I switched to my bard and didn't look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Feather Level 58.8 Human  Thief <br />
<br />
Srathor Level 40 Night elf druid<br />
<br />
Gadgyt Level 28.9 Gnomish destroyer of Squirrels (Warrior)<br />
<br />
All on Earthen Ring. One of the Roleplay servers. <br />
<br />
By far the funnest charecter is the gnome. Every damn time I play her, for 5 minutes or 5 hours I am constantly grinning and laughing. Explosive sheep, a bloodthirsty attitude, and a deep rooted belief that the squirrels are OUT to get HER!<br />
<br />
Sure Warriors need more rage and have problems and blah blah blah. It is just fun. Every aspect of it. To me at least. <br />
<br />
The thief is a stupidly powerful class, I could easily have been 60 if I just spent a couple more days, but why rush, it will be there when I get there. <br />
<br />
And the druid is a swiss army knife of fun. Lots of options at any given time, plus I can play healer Thief or Warrior. Maybe not quite as good as the main class. But speaking from experiance of playing the classes in question, the druid isnt all that far off.  Definitly a thinking man's charecter, with a layered aspect to combat much like the shaman of old EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I will be logging on the thief tonight for a run at Blackrock depths with my normal crew. But the gnome is waiting for her chance at more squirrels!<br />
<br />
Hell I don't know who to sign off as today. The gnome is that much fun.<br />
<br />
Snoww/Feather/Gadgyt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol thats good stuff on the gnome snoww. <br />
<br />
My rogue just hit 37 today. But since I had a headstart on wow on my wife ...well to keep maritial bliss I'll keep my alt rogue same lvl as my wifes main. About to decide on who to play next. <br />
<br />
Have to decide what project to tackle next. 22 shaman or start a druid or priest to solo/mini group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2, Tauren shaman on a PvP server, Gnome mage on a PvE server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just don't know how you folks have multiple characters in the 40+ range. It's all I can do to keep a single character leveling at an acceptable pace. I've been playing since day 1 and I'm only 51 on my Hunter. I've toyed around with a Rogue (lvl 6) and a Druid (lvl 13), but that's my only foray into other classes.<br />
<br />
I suppose always helping the wife &quot;catch up&quot; could be one reason. Perhaps if I had been focusing on leveling my character and my character only I could be higher? Maybe the time I spent getting professions to the levels they are held me back? Maybe I watch too much TV? :)<br />
<br />
/em is jealous of some of his peers and the success they've had leveling. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">lol val. My wife took alot of time trying out all the classes and races to pick what she wanted to play. By the time she did i was closing in on 60. If it had been earlier Id spent more time playing with her t' taken alot longer to get to 60. She is at 37. I had to grind for a change to catch my rogue up to her the 2nd time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually I'm surprised people are as focused on one main character as most seem to be, given that most of the classes in this game are fun to play and not too hard to level. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses, keep em coming.<br />
<br />
As to me, I play a gnome mage, but was looking for ideas for an alt, seeing what else you guys play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">40 Troll hunter<br />
32 Orc Shaman (shelved for now)<br />
30 UD priest<br />
25 Orc Rogue<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">43 hunter (was my main)<br />
30 warlock (the new main)<br />
9 mage<br />
7 rogue<br />
<br />
After I get the warlock to 60 I'll play the mage and rogue some...and probably make a warrior.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>agomir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">60 Druid (Main)<br />
30 Paladin<br />
20 Rogue<br />
<br />
With a total days played for all of them at ~ 24 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm one of those who doesn't dislike any of the classes.  <br />
<br />
44 shaman - has a regular group of 3 to play with<br />
32 mage - finally has a group of 4 to play with, since a couple friend of ours dropped eq2 (at last!) to come join us.<br />
23 druid - one of my solo bored-at-work characters<br />
22 warrior - another soloer, fun - but SOL when she gets adds, can't do much toward escaping, like the druid.<br />
21 hunter - used to partner with my man's hunter, but I seriously think he got bored with how easy it was.<br />
15 warlock - got lost in the shuffle somewhere<br />
<br />
The rest are kinda teeny, but one of every class, basically.  I like always having *someone* with a ridiculous amount of rested exp lying around in case I want to kill an hour.  Not to mention lots of feeder-tradeskillers, who mine and skin and mail the goods to higher level characters to skill up on.  *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well to be honest leveling is pretty easy. We have a group on teamspeak, and we have done all the instances we can up to Black rock depths. Only getting together 1-2 times a week. So much of the time we are doing incidental quests, or playing alts with three of us that are on most nights. (Thats why Srathor is level 40.) <br />
<br />
Also we had on the 5 main guys each picking a tradeskill gather profession and shared components freely. I am 285ish skill leatherworker, Elemental with 300 in skinning with Feather. Srathor is a herbalist potion fella. And Gadgyt is the truly sick twink, with a 240 skill in Engeneering at level 28 (Gnomish 15 points bonus in that skill) <br />
<br />
The game is just fun. And we all tend to hop on and go do something rather than fart around looking for a group, If I am not with my roomate I am off beating up some collect quest. <br />
<br />
Leveling is not hard, it is even easier than EQ. <br />
<br />
Snoww/Feather/Gadgyt/Srathor + whoever else I want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">56 hunter (main)<br />
<br />
Then I play alts depending on their rest xp (no rest xp = no playtime):<br />
34 Priest<br />
15 Mage<br />
12 Rogue<br />
8 Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">60 rogue and 47 priest. Fun times. :P</div></div><hr />
