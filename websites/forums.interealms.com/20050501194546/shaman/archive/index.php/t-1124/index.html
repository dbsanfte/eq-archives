<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Great Saphophyte has killed me.  Twice now.  And one ignominous gate.  <br />
<br />
I did get it one time, and it wasn't too bad.  But I seem to have a hard time soloing this mob.  I've seen level 50 rangers just whack it down easily.  <br />
<br />
He casts too quickly, summoning and knocking me backward.  I was a shaman yo-yo.  Buffing my resists didn't seem to help, in that I never resisted anytime at all.  <br />
<br />
The key is to load up damage fast of course.  He has very few hp.  The doggie helps, but obviously didn't help enough.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have trouble with this?  Criminy, Yeldema seemed easier.  <br />
<br />
Oh the shame!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are your resists? I really think it's the resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a thread along these lines on the pre-wipe boards...but no, you're not alone.  He's killed me once, turned me into a big white heap of polar bear mush.  That was at 55.  A friend knows both a 60 bard and 59 shadowknight who have suffered similar fates.The key is to load up damage fast of course. He has very few hp. The doggie helps, but obviously didn't help enough.<br />
Actually no, the key is not to draw agro.  I went along with the do-as-much-damage-as-fast-as-possible method and led with Ice Strike.  The Big Sap was half dead from the start, but I didn't get another spell off the entire time, except for one Gate which, naturally, collapsed.  The shamans who've I'd heard discussing their successes said that they went with something along these lines:  send puppy in taunting, dispell shroom to kill the damage shield, epic dot, maybe slow if puppy is getting beat up, then any damage you think you can do without getting killed to speed things up until the epic dot mops up.<br />
<br />
Or, bring someone else with a 600+ DD and drop it in 5 seconds flat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually got to kill this guy for the first time 2 or 3 days ago.  Only got the earring :( <br />
<br />
In fact, it was only the second time I've seen him up.  First time I was on the way to a raid.<br />
<br />
I did have a 55 druid helping me though.  But, the pet did 100% of the damage.  The only thing the 2 of us did was heal the pet.  I MIGHT could have solo'd him.  Not sure about  that.<br />
<br />
Actually, come to think of it, I probably would have failed the first time.  But I think I can solo it after the experience of the first one.<br />
<br />
The problem is trying to stay in range (and sight) of healing the pet, while staying out of the aoe.  We both sat in the tunnel between the rooms.  At first I couldnt &quot;see&quot; the pet well enough to heal him, then when I moved closer, kept getting knocked back.  Eventually I found a spot out of ae range, where I could still reach the pet for heals.  It got pretty easy after that.  I was pretty low iin mana from the heals, but I had to heal myself a good bit from the ae's.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say letting your pet do the tanking while you heal him is the way to go.  Make sure he is buffed as well as you can manage.  Then send him in.  That way he stays at the top of the aggro list, and you dont get summoned.  If you can stay out of the ae, and still heal the pet, shouldnt be to much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This killed me once at L58 because I had never seen a green mob summon and proc a nasty AE.  I had no pet and had not cleared the room before attacking.  I got a spear DoT off, but was interrupted too much to cast effectively and bit it.<br />
<br />
The real key is to clear the room of all the cultists first, speed yourself and pet, and then hit the big shroom with spear DoT or Ice Strike right off.  Your pet will have all the taunt if you hit it with spear and you can just sit back and heal the little guy while he works.  Throw in a DD or 2 more and this undercon is toast.  <br />
<br />
PR seems to help a bit as well, although I got similar resists with a PR of ~260 and a PR of ~140.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't buff any resist over 255. Supposedly rollover resists are a thing of the past, but bards facing AE dragons had a thread about this recently and there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that this bug is NOT fixed. (Here's the thread: http://pub118.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=3951.topic )<br />
<br />
At any rate, here's another bug for ya to help out with this feller.<br />

I've never seen him up, so I have no experiences myself...just a bit surprised at all the difficulty people are having.</div></div><hr />

Fought him 3 times now I think. 1st time I had to run (didn't know he summoned) and promptly got me killed.<br />
The other times I killed him. What I did was start with Bane of Nife as it does the most damage (don't have Pox), then puppy attacks and I threw Ice Strikes at the fungi. Occasionally had to heal my dog but it worked well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, according to a poster at Allakhazams, &quot;This is completely false!

According to another poster, however, his knockback can at least be partially resisted, so I'd buff MR too, assuming it's magic-based.<br />

The reason you've been failing is cause your tactics are gimp.  Don't keep trying the same old **** in hope you will luck out and actually win.  Learn from yer mistakes and do it the right way.  <br />
<br />
What is embarassing even more is that my necro friend first soloed him when he was lvl 45.  And he had no prior knowledge of this mob, so he did it wrong first time.  Ah well, FD is kinda cheesy.  Wish I could FD when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I soloed him around 18 times in my low 50's looking for that spell.  I never seemed to resist the poison spell, but buffing magic, fire, and cold were useful against his other wizardly spells.  I'd clear all guys around him, have pet and myself buffed with max hp and haste...  Pet attack, cancel magic, let pet chew for a few seconds to build up aggro, then let loose with blizzard blast.  I'd usually get summoned on the 2nd blast, but by that time he was a goner anyway.  If you do get summoned, don't panic...  If you time it right, you can usually get spells off just fine between the summons and the knockbacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason you've been failing is cause your tactics are gimp.&quot; Heh, for some reason that line amuses me to no end. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I solo'd him np but it may have been simply because of where I was standing.  I hit him with slow immediately, sent my pet in and then moved inside to the right.  I stayed against the wall so his knockback was having little effect on me.  I suspect that if I had not been against the wall it might have been a different story because that is quite a knockback he casts.  I let my pet do most of the work and just kept him epic dotted.  Didnt use jbb till he was around 50 %.  Just kept the pet healed and it was np.  Got the eye and didnt stick around for a 2nd try because it took almost 3 hrs to get him to pop the first time and I didnt feel like spending another 3 hrs at a mind numbingly boring camp for a lvl 39 spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just bring my SK pet along :)<br />
<br />
We clear to him, sick both of our pets on it then he tanks and I slow it. Then I usually just sit there for about 20 seconds and its dead. I don't think the SK loses more then a bub of health. And the knockback isn't an issue, he goes floaty and stands behind the shroom (between it and the wall) and its pie. <br />
<br />
Frankly, he doesn't even need me there but I have a feeling I might need him. I have no epic *grins* so the only damage I'm going to be doing is through high agro spells and fido ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is a few spot around the cave where the knockback will 'lift' you without actually moving you much, giving you a better chance of channeling through.<br />
<br />
But yes. open with Ice Strike, let the pet get some aggro and finish with another Ice Strike or two. It doesn't have that much HP. And it doesn't seem to resist Ebolt nearly as much as Bane, by the way. One Ice Strike + One Ebolt + pet pretty much mean dead fungus.<br />
<br />
And, of course, you can also interrupt it with slam fairly easily.</div></div><hr />

Of course he didn't have the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">He is The Great Saphrophryte (sp?).  35ish level Mushroom in Echo Caverns.  Off on a side cavern just before the Fungus Grove Zoneline.  I believe he is perma rooted.  He never moved from his spot when I was fighting him.  He also didnt aggro me or the pet while I killed his bodyguards.<br />
<br />
The reason all the shaman are camping him - He drops the 39th lvl spell remove curse (I suppose if you have remove greater curse, wont need that spell)<br />
<br />
Not sure what else he drops.  He dropped on my one kill - A Sapphrophyte Eye - Ear Slot, 2ac, +5 charisma +15 hp's and +15 mana (from memory)<br />
<br />
He is somewhere around 35 in level I think.  But, he summons, procs a nasty knockback spell.  I took alot of ae damage, whether from the proc, or him casting spells, i dunno.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've killed this guy 3-4 times now, he never gets me lower than 4 bubbles of health. The knockback/summon is annoying, but he has very little HPs. The strategy is to occupy him while epic dot and pet kill it. <br />
<br />
I remember the first time I tried to solo it, what a nasty surprise that was. I didn't bother with the guards, lead with Pox, resisted. Then casted epic, then ice strike. He started the knockback/summon cycle with all of his pets beating on me. Being the smart ogre I am, I started gate the moment he summoned me, then just waited for another summon. It came, I finished gate.<br />
<br />
By the time I walked back, he had alread died to my epic DoT, but only dropped one of those gloves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This guy is easy if you do the right thing. I dont even clear his guards. I buff up in the tunnel (regen, resists, hp, sta) toss on my fungi, mem ice strike, and then I invis. The guards dont see invis, I dont remember if he does or not. Anyhow, if you go around BEHIND him, between him and the closest wall, you should be within his melee range and he doesn't seem to summon me fro there since he can still hit me. I just nuke him down with icestrike after I slow him. Worked for me every time. I think again though, that being behind him in the back of the cave (directly across from the short tunnel leading into his room) between him and the wall is the best place to fight him from. Anyhow, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've killed him a several times solo now, certainly an interesting fight with the summoning and knockbacks.<br />
<br />
I kill his guards, then I slow and epic dot.   Then I icestrike.<br />
<br />
One icestrike and he will start summoning.<br />
<br />
Then I use his summoning and my long cast time spells to my advantage.  So run far enough away to get summoned, start casting icestrike, then run away some more.  He will summon you back and you will finish casting the spell in exactly the same place as you started.<br />
<br />
This never fails to crack me up.  :)<br />
<br />
He resists bane, pox all the times I have fought him.<br />
<br />
He drops the spell remove curse, that earring and some gloves.<br />
The earring is pretty decent for caster twinks, I even considered wearing it over my barbarian cultural earring...but I decided to get the other chardok earring instead.  The remove curse spell scroll is lore, so no farming.   <br />

FYI, for rangers he is mildly annoying and nearly got me down at level 55.  I meleed him to 50% but I needed time to heal myself so I backed off and found out he summoned.  Gah, I am expecting to die now, so having only Call of Flame memmed as only DD spell :( I had to hope that he won't kill me before I nuked the rest of his life away.  He is certainly not trivial since his nasty ability to yoyo his top target is disorienting.</div></div><hr />

Gee thanks, and I didn't even describe what my tactics were.  Phbbt on that crappy, snide response.  <br />
<br />
Guards were cleared - except one tucked around the corner in his aggro range.  Led off with malo the first time, slowed him and he still resisted bane. Died to the unexpected summoning/ae.  Gate wasn't loaded.  I often don't actually.<br />
<br />
Second time I dropped him without a pet at all.  I thought, that wasn't so bad.  I was fully buffed with resists and PR/DR/MR gear and still nothing, not even partially.  Yes, full set of BD.  <br />
<br />
Third time, cleared the guards again.  I lead off with Ice Strike and tried healing the pet.  He started summoning me right off the bat.  I was able to channel a couple of spells, but had to gate.  Came back and he was dead and gone.  Either I killed him and someone else looted, or someone else finished him off and looted.  <br />
<br />
Fourth time, cleared guards.  Buffed pet.  Sent pet in first, dropped ice strike and he immediately began summoning again.  I did try to wedge myself in the corner to limit the effect of the knockback, but still was not able to channel enough.  I chose not to gate at all because it pissed me off.  :)  <br />
<br />
I think it boils down to a lucky channeling myself.  <br />
<br />
Obviously I should and can kill the guy.  That's the shame of it, the point of the thread.  Thanks Land.</div></div><hr />

A full set of BD doesn't cut it if the rest of your armor has no resists. &quot;FULL BD&quot; isn't super-duper. I'm talking stone of morid, butcher gloves -- those are the extra resists ya need to put on for a guy like this.<br />
<br />
Ah, whatevers. Give us some numbers so that we will at least have something a little harder to go on: <br />

Do you read?  People have given simple easy ways of killing him . . without resorting to luck or channeling.  Your tactics are described by yourself were/are gimp.  #1 try you immediately got aggro and were helpless the rest of the fight.  #2 try I think you just lucked out.  #3 try you tried the same tactics as in #1 and had to gate because it didn't work . . again . . surprise.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">PR/DR don't seem to matter, and I don't think MR does either.  I can get all of them pretty high, and still get zapped the same.<br />
<br />
I have probably killed this guy well over 30 times by now(and I mean WELL over), getting his spell for my shaman, my druid, and some of my guildies.  Of the first six successful kills, he didn't drop the spell once.  This is the only mob in the game that drops &quot;remove curse.&quot;  (Don't confuse this spell with &quot;remove greater curse.&quot;)  He's killed me twice, when I was first starting out, because of the interrupts, and because if he summons you and starts interrupting you with both spells AND melee, shamans cast much too slowly to ever get off a spell unless they're very lucky.  Even if he doesn't summon you, his AOE's will interrupt you a lot.  Of course, if you've left boglings up to help interrupt you and/or kill too, you're really in trouble.  I never did, but don't.<br />
<br />
So eventually here's what I've started doing, with minor variations.  I'm level 60 with full ToV dragon quest armor, torpor and all important spells, but my hitpoints aren't too high -- I can't canni 5 without killing myself unless I have buffs on.<br />
<br />
Summon pet and uber buff it, including focus, our AC buff, regrowth, pet haste.   Buff myself fully, with regrowth too, but forget the haste.  Summon and park pet in the room before the shroom room.  Kill all boglings there.   Single pull boglings in the shroom room with JBB blasts and run them outside to pet; JBB and pet them down, use epic if you like.  <br />
<br />
Don't take a long time dotting them, because this mob gets KS'd all the time and is on a precise timer that many people pay attention to.  If he's up, you need to kill him quick before someone comes.  And ANYONE can kill this thing faster than a shaman, so no fooling around.  If possible, leave the boglings at the exit to the shroom area standing so people won't run by, see the boglings missing, and wonder if they have a good KS opportunity.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, by the time you've gotten all your mana back from buffing yourself and the dog and killing all the boglings, it will be time to reapply regrowth on yourself and dog, and pet haste on dog, just to be safe.<br />
<br />
Important:  do not fight in the shroom room or even spend much time close to it until you are ready for saprophyte killing.  The shroom occasionally tosses out his AOE spells just for fun.  If one hits you or the dog, the battle begins -- maybe with all the boglings still chipping in, maybe with you low mana or you or the dog low health, or both.<br />
<br />
Anyway, once outer and inner boglings are dead and buffs/health are full, have pet follow you into shroom room, before boglings start repopping.  Have him guard there.  <br />
<br />
Slowing alone has gotten me summoned.  Once summoned, don't rely on gating to work.  I died twice that way, too many interrupts.  If you are going to try a slow, malo first.  I have had the shroom resist multiple slow attempts without malo, even though he's a greenie, just like he summons even though he's a greenie to my 60.  Malo will not get you summoned, but of course will start the shroom AOE'ing you and the dog, which will start killing both of you quickly.  Slowing is not the most important thing and not always the most practical.<br />
<br />
Killing shroom, the basic thing is to let pet do most of the work.  The pet must not die.  You either, of course.<br />

Interrupts foil most attempts to heal either you or the dog.  Luckily, even torpored, the dog can do decent damage.  So sometimes I torpor him even before the fight begins, and torpor myself, too, before the fight begins.  It is very easy to not have a chance to torpor yourself in the fight, so I will usually &quot;front-load&quot; the battle with a torpor on either myself or the dog or both.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after that, I order the pet to attack and hit the shroom with malo.  You need that to land your spells reliably; take no chances.  At that point, the dog starts dying very quickly, even buffed with regrowth, so if I haven't started him off with torpor before the fight even began, I torpor him immediately.  He can kill the shroom all by himself given enough time, so landing a damage spell immediately is not important.<br />
<br />
As to spell damage, I have tried bane of nife several times, but it takes too long to work.  You want this guy dead FAST.  It is also very high aggro, and has at least some chance of getting you summoned.  Forget poxx, and envenomed bolt is too weak.  A 600 point DD, like some people here recommend, is also not very good.  They take a while to cast but do little damage.  Epic takes MUCH too long to cast to rely upon it, and MUCH much too long to work.  I find I only have time for maybe two to four spells in the battle, though I will be interrupted many times before they land -- a damage spell or possibly two if I'm lucky, and a torpor spell or possibly two if I'm lucky.  If I get three spells off, I count myself very lucky.<br />
<br />
What I use is torrent of poison:  three times up to 540 per hit if it lands.  Usually I get at least 1k of damage off the spell.  Meanwhile, doggy is doing a lot of the work.<br />
<br />
That's usually all I need to do as far as offense goes, and it never gets me summoned.  Which is important, since I'm using a poison rain that would hit me, too, if I did get summoned.<br />
<br />
After a torrent of poison, if I don't have it on me, I cast torpor on myself whether I need it or not.  You don't want to have to hope you don't get interrupts when you NEED it; cast it before you need it if it isn't already on you, and if you get interrupted, just keep it up.  Check pet for his health constantly; if he dies, you will very likely lose and/or die yourself.  If there's not enough shroom health left to bother with another torrent of poison, see if you're lucky enough to get off a JBB round.<br />
<br />
Gloves(plus 5 magic/fire/cold I think, nice resist gloves for druids and maybe monks and BL) and earring are dirt common, spell can not drop for MANY shrooms in a row.  Don't ask for any help with the shroom from strangers, or you might just get KS'd.  Melees can kill this thing fast, as can casters, especially if there's more than one of them, and they can often do it whether the boglings are dead or not.  We kill him slow, and boglings provide too many interrupts and will kill your pet, who is always on the brink of death against this mob anyway -- as are you, sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this works for me every time, never gets me summoned, and never even gets my pet killed.</div></div><hr />
