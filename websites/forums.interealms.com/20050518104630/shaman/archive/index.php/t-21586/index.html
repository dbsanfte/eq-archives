<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has SOE done anything bout the Ireblind Imp in Fear so the zone is accessable again?  <br />
<br />
Yes I have read the Guide from Feburary on it, but all I have heard about is very  long CRs inclulding some very well geared guilds after trying to get epic pieces in Fear.  Seems the Ire's AoE Mez extends about 500' making it extremely hard to avoid.  I heard some rumours that SOE had dialed back the Ire somewhat.  The zonein is so dangerous, its hard to avoid the Ire.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any recent first hand experience (like the last month or so) or reliable information on getting their Tear in Fear?  <br />
<br />
Until SOE opens Fear up, seems like its difficult to the point of being impossible to get a Tear to complete our Epic.</div></div><hr />

Ugh... imp is not fun. He does have a short agro radius, but short of clearing somewhere besides the usual spot... you're tough on luck.<br />
<br />
Recently my guild did clear fear, and we aren't an uber guild, but we had about 7 groups. However.. a necro had already broken it soloing mobs somehow, from another guild so we didn't experience the full break in spawn. We simply rushed the ireblind imp and managed to kill him with a good number of adds and casualties.. lol.  if you can stay away from him it is possible.. but taking him with adds i wouldn't even try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea i got together 3 grps to make a run at it b4 i knew about the Imp there and was a long drug out wipe...took 4 days to get everyones corpse...i did hear of a 65 bard soloing the Imp, although it was said it took him 1 1/2 hr to do =-0...it is a pain to try to get peeps to go there to begin with but made it twice as bad since the addition of the Imp =-( maybe 1 day ill get that tear..If any guilds on the Luclin server make a fear run and dont need the chance of the tear id gladly give my services and forgo any loot right for a chance at the tear if the golem is dropped and the dood spawns pst to Joga would VERY much appricate it</div></div><hr />

Yes, they have fixed it, but you need everyone to know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
What happens now is that and Enraged Imp non-agro spawns randomly when you kill a scareling, and killing this will spawn the Ireblind Imp.<br />
<br />
You just need to not attack the Enraged Imp, it is non-roaming, and non-agro, but will assist any scarelings you attack close to it.  <br />
<br />
The only difficult bit, is making sure everyone knows not to attack the Enraged imp, and to move your break-in point if you spawn it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only other difficuly is, if the Ireblind Imp is already spawned when you zone-in, but then you just need to make sure you don't agro him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Ireblind imp is not that bad unless someone has trained him and his friends to the zone in.  We had three groups take him down and then someone pullen another imp and spawned a new Ireland imp on us 10 mins after the first.  We did wipe to this one but that is because people were not prepared for a second so soon after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we killed him.. he was spawned there and no matter how many attempts we made at training him away he always pathed back there. And sadly yeah someone decided to spawn him there :P He was up a good 2 days w/o despawning too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have everyone buy 2 crimson potions before going to fear. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Flabbo.... is your &quot;2 crimson potions.... problem solved&quot; comment first hand experience or conjecture?  <br />
<br />
If its YOUR actual experience, congrats on a clever tactic which, BTW, was also discussed in the Feburary guide to Ireblind Imp.  You might include some more details like how many were in your raid, how you pulled the Ire, where you fought him, things like that which would help others utilize your winning tactic.<br />
<br />
If you are offering conjecture, thats ok, but given so many posts about how difficult the Ire is, you might want to not be so cavalier about it... &quot;problem solved&quot;.... LOL  Its more like &quot;maybe this might work&quot; kinda thing.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping you have the first hand knowledge and will further explain how you did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ireblind imp is really not a problem to avoid, even if he is at the zone in.<br />
<br />
He will aggro on you but if you don't fight him he eventually loses interest and wanders back to his spawn point.<br />
<br />
So all you have to do is set up camp from some distance away from where you see him and leave him alone. If he adds just fight the other mobs and within about 30 secs he is gone. His behaviour is unlike any other mob I have seen (who will fight on once aggroed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's interesting if true....but who wants to take the chance of allowing him to wipe your party with the hope that he &quot;loses interest&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Still, I'd like to know if anyone else has tried this with success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The crimson potions are a must for classes without a self dot.  With a dot on stun is very brief lasting 6 seconds at most sometimes alot less.  I found I had to reapply my disease dots a couple times each fight.  We only had 3 OK groups with a couple good tanks though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bandicoot's observation that Ire will lose interest after 30 sec or so if not engaged sounds promising.  As for self DOTing, that can work; however, unless you NEED to kill the Ire ( I believe that he drops a Zerker epic item), why take the chance if you don't have to?<br />
<br />
Anyone who has been on a recent FEAR raid (like within the last month or so) that was a success, please post exactly how you avoided the IRE.  <br />
<br />
Did you just not engage him (as suggested by Bandicoot)?  How did you AVOID the IRE?<br />
<br />
Is the preferred break in camp now South rather than the traditional WEST?  Or some other break in tactic?<br />
<br />
If you did end up fighting IRE and won, was it just a simple matter of self DOTs and pots?<br />
<br />
LOL... I need my TEAR, and the IRE is in the way!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We beat him with 6 people, though really only 4 participated in the battle. Me, monk, ranger and cleric, all 65 (mainly in vt/ some elemental gear). There was a 65 warrior and a 56 sk with us (rl friend of the cleric). Warrior and sk were mostly mezzed thouugh heh... no potions and the sk couldnt land a dot on the warrior when they dueled. I aggro kited the imp, he didnt hit too hard. The cleric kept me alive, the ranger pulled off his spawns and took care of them, while the monk dps'd him down. It took a long while, but was fun. He may have been toned up some since we fought him (probably in early march?), but he wasnt hard if you have a team thats used to working together. Its a cool encounter, I wish eq had more of em.</div></div><hr />
