<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've decided I'm going to try WoW and my wife has also expressed an interest.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm looking for a good duo pair that start together in same zone - also a good soloer (or very desired group class) because I play a lot more than her.<br />
<br />
Leaning towards a healer/fighter pair because after playing loads of MMO's if you have those 2 classes you can xp immediately - and add other people if you feel like it, or want to.<br />
<br />
My initial thoughts are <br />
(dwarf or human) warrior/priest, <br />
(dwarf or human) paladin/priest<br />
(nightelf) priest/warrior <br />
(nightelf) druid/warrior - sort of favourite at the moment<br />
<br />
I doubt I could get my wife to play a horde character so shaman/fighter combo is out :( - women have to look good you know :)<br />
<br />
Can shaman solo OK in oW? If so I'm thinking of Tauren shaman for my own character when not paired up? Another option is a good soloer (or very desired group class) on the Alliance side as he will probably end up higher level than the pair and be able to help out :)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any recommendations on the above choices and for my solo character - and why please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is probably my bias showing, but I would recommend Horde characters, only because I find the Horde zones and story line to be more interesting than the Alliance ones.  One exception, the night elf newbie zones have an interesting and unique storylione, but that gets pretty well merged with the rest of the Alliance by level 10 or so.<br />
<br />
That said, I would recommend (in order of personal preference):<br />
<br />
- Tauren, bull/cow, warrior/shaman, Tradecraft: Armor/alchemy<br />
  -- Big, beefy, no expense for mount at level 40 (free plainsrunning skill), I like their racial story line<br />
- Orc, warrior/shaman, tradecraft: armor/alchemy<br />
  -- Because orcs make such a great couple, and look great in this game!  Otherwise no real change ('cept they gotta buy 100 gold mounts!)<br />
- Undead, warrior/priest, tradecraft: armor/alchemy<br />
  -- Undead very cool looking, free underwater breathing, no shamans, gotta buy that mount<br />
<br />
Both characters learn cooking (free skill)<br />
Both learn healing (bandaging and such) - free skill<br />
Armorer learn mining<br />
Alchemist learn herbalism<br />
<br />
Other notes:<br />
- Warriors in high demand at high level<br />
- Shamans in high demand at high level<br />
- Priests in demand at high level<br />
- Other classes are situation specific whether or not demand for them is high<br />
- Tradeskills matter and will save you money and/or add to your capability<br />
- All classes have the ability to adapt (moreso than EQ).  <br />
  -- Between bandaging, potions, and eating, healing can be shared bay all somewhat.<br />
  -- All classes have some sort of contributing buff for their group whether as a cast spell, a fighter's shout, a shaman totem, or hunter's aiming cue.<br />
  -- Everyone has the ability to cause significant damage except in specific scenarios (i.e. a high resist mob type).  Hunters are current exception, but that will likely be addressed.  <br />
  -- In other words, everyone contributes to the primary mission (damage dealing!) and can contribute to the secondary mission (healig and buffs)<br />
- Expect to have a lot of fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Krup for decent post - now how am I going to tell my wife she's gonna play a Tauren cow :) :) :)<br />
<br />
Anyone got input from Alliance side please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In case you don't get any better input...  <br />
<br />
Look into a druid.  If you're going to be stuck with Alliance, I can't imagine your wife not going for a night elf.  Druid's shapechanging ability ought to be perfect for switching between grouping and soloing - as well as adapting to different groups.  Unfortunately, I don't have a thing to offer regarding the higher level game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I played a dwarf hunter up to 41 so far and thats a very viable soloing character. And I can only imagine that it gets even better or more interesting when they put in talents for hunters so that you can specialize in various things.<br />
<br />
For a duo what about a couple of gnomes? They look fantastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leaning towards a healer/fighter pair because after playing loads of MMO's if you have those 2 classes you can xp immediately - and add other people if you feel like it, or want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
WoW is not quite like other MMO's. I think you could easily get away with being able to exp immediatly with a warrior/rogue or a warrior/warlock duo even though none of those classes can be considered &quot;healers&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am not sure but I think I read somewhere that you cannot make a horde character and an alliance character on the same server (in retail that is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not sure but I think I read somewhere that you cannot make a horde character and an alliance character on the same server (in retail that is)<br />
<br />
you can't do that on the beta pvp servers. i tried to make an alliance toon the other day and was unable to since i am currently Horde. i haven't tried to make an alliance on a regular beta server yet. i would like to assume that this rule would only apply on pvp servers to prevent spys gathering info from the enemy side. not that people won't do it with two accounts, it just makes it much more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup, only applicable to PvP servers (you have to select sides, on a &quot;per server / per account&quot; basis). PVE servers you can create both Horde &amp; Alliance characters on the same server &amp; same account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All classes are totally viable for solo.  Put nearly *any* two classes together for duo and it works well, sure a healer is nice, but any two can work.  Warriors are in fact quite strong, imo for PVE Warrior has been substantially and very noticably more powerful.  Warriors are also currently probably the #1 most played class among the beta servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had a really , really long post typed out, but I decided to get right down to it.  <br />
<br />
Basically...<br />
<br />
Any two classes duo great together.  The only time when you *might* have to get into specific class selection is in raid situations (which while I dont have any experience with, i've heard many stories about people doing supposably impossible things with an impossible group.  It's all about perception)<br />
<br />
I would honestly, strongly, BRUTALLY suggest and encourage the Horde.  Uncle Thrall wants YOU to join the Horde.  One reason:  Shaman.  Shamans kick some MAJOR elf/gnome/dwarf/human buttocks.  Add in, for emphasis, about a thousand exclamation marks. :)<br />
<br />
While a tank/healer combo does kick butt, and would be very effective, i'd go with this:<br />
<br />
If you're horde, *I* personally would suggest Shaman/Warlock.   Curse of Weakness + Stoneskin totem  = VERY little damage coming your way.  Add your healing stream totem and basically you're taking no damage except from HARD elites that are close to your level.  <br />
<br />
Pros:  You got a solid tank (with all the damage mitigation, even better when shaman gets mail).  Spec enhancement to aid this if you want.  You also got a warlock pet, for a variety of situations.  Crowd control (Succubus, fear, banish, and whatever snares account for in your book).  You got plenty of healing, thanks to all the damage mitigation.  Even better if you spec restoration.  Damage wont be a problem:  Shaman melee DPS, specced properly, it's GREAT.  Warlocks have BRUTAL dots, and shaman shocks, while mana-inefficient, are a great supplement to melee DPS.   <br />
<br />
Cons:  Er... I can't think of one.  You got tanking down, you got healing down, you got damage down, you have crowd control down.  You have TWO kinds of resses (shaman res and soulstone), other summoned utility from the warlock.  Both classes are VERY powerful soloers, VERY powerful in PVP, and VERY valuable in groups.  <br />
<br />
In situations where you're not likely to get adds, pop out a different pet.  Voidwalker can tank probably a little better then the shaman (has an actual taunt),  Imp can nuke, and you will have access to the Felhound and Infernal which weren't in-game during closed beta.  That's a great reason to be a warlock :)  <br />
<br />
Actually, the only one con is that shaman get Ghost Wolf at level 20 which will make whoever plays that character MUCH faster for a long time.  Warlocks do get a summoned felsteed spell though at 40 to make up for it :D  Biig negative there.. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
For alliance:<br />
<br />
This one is harder, since i'm NOT alliance, and there is NO equilivant to the Shaman.  I dont doubt that the paladin will be great with talants and the changes they are going to add, but it's safe to say it wont be a mirror image.<br />
<br />
But, with the paladin getting agro control methods, and supposably more and slightly better attacks to make them interesting,  combined with plate armor and heals (also supposably getting re-worked) it might be valuable to combine a paladin with a druid.<br />
<br />
Pros:  With agro management coming in, and higher damage (wish the boards weren't down), plus the druid either nuking or in cat form, you'll have some very solid damage coming down the pipe.  Paladins will be able to hold agro, and even if the druid DOES get agro, you can shift into bear form to take it.  Tankage?  No problem.  Healing?  WOW no problem.  Two healing classes.  You got MORE then enough.  You even have resses thanks to the paladin, probably at least passable heals, and AMAZING heals as a druid (The druids only real disability with healing was the lack of a res).   Druids can CC against beasts (Hibernate, a beast-only sleep spell).  Both can solo well (paladins are, before the changes, pretty slow at it though.  Druids are great and easy).  Both PVP great (Paladins are nigh impossible to kill, druid roots are the bane of EVERYone nearly),  and once pallys can control agro, they will be AMAZING for grouping.  Druid heals are also in high demand, especially if you come to a group as a pair, you got resses covered - like i said, the only healing druids' weakness.<br />
<br />
Cons:  There is one decent con to this duo, and one possible con.  First off, the tangible one.  You dont CC very well in this duo except against beasts.  Granted, beasts make up a VERY large percentage of all the monsters you're likely to fight for a very long time, but it's still limited.  Both of you, however, CAN tank passably.<br />
<br />
The POSSIBLE con is that the changes to the paladin aren't as impressive as everyone is hoping.  If the talants and fixes DONT work, then chances are, the druid is going to be ending up tanking with the paladin being a low-damage heal bot. :(  Have some faith though! That's why you ARE a paladin, right?<br />
<br />
Dont take either of those duos as gospel though, like i said, any two can duo well.  Heck, two hunters (either side) would be AMAZING.  Two cool looking pets, double the gun/bow goodness.  You'd share a lot of drops (might be hard for that reason) but hunters are incredible soloers.  Crowd control is a problem, but i've taken on 3 equal level mobs at once before.  Was nearly dead, but i did it. :)  and i've taken 2 at once, then a third late add without ANY trouble.  <br />
<br />
That was a little more long-winded then I had estimated, but I hope it helps, for whatever side you choose to be on (Go horde).  It is, after all, your choice (Go horde) and we certainly wont try to talk you into it if your wife is really that against being a Horde character (Are you Horde yet?!)  <br />
