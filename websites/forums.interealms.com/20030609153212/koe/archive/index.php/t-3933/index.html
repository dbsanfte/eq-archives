<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something I came up with ... i've suffered writer's and composition block for the last year or so, finally was able to spill something out...  <br />
<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The quarrel began like any other,<br />
Although now I cannot fathom what it was about.<br />
It turned into a reluctant challenge, in which I became the horrid victor.<br />
<br />
I stood and watched the lifeless spirit fall to the ground,<br />
and as I saw the light vanish from his eyes<br />
I realized what I had done.<br />
<br />
The heavens now cry for me and for what I had done...<br />
which now purges this blood from my tattered rags<br />
into the vast gutters below.<br />
<br />
And although I stand erect,<br />
and visibily unmarked...<br />
i doubt the darkness of my scarred soul will ever be absolved.<br />
_________________________________________________<br />
<br />
So it ends...<br />
and every detail hauntingly remains...<br />
the sounds echo through my mind.<br />
souls burning... passions seething... voices rising...<br />
<br />
We drift on,<br />
the sweet musky flavor of this ancient city<br />
saturates my skin.<br />
<br />
I gaze ahead blindly, lost in my thoughts.<br />
The silver moonlight dances and flashes across the canal.<br />
<br />
I lift the hazy veil from my face, raising my eyes to the purple dawn.  <br />
the stars wink at me and we share our secrets...<br />
<br />
and as the memories slowly fade....<br />
hot tears tingle my flesh<br />
and a new day begins.<br />
