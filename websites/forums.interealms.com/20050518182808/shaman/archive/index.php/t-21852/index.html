<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I understand from all the summaries of the Summit that Smedley acknowledged GoD was broken and mistuned.  That's quite a thing to say several months after folks have shelled out $30 for each account.  <br />
<br />
And I know that GoD has been retuned once.  But I saw in Summit summaries that developers were noting Vexd/Tipt took a lot longer to complete than intended.  And the hybrid issues persist (as well as shaman issues).  <br />
<br />
So, GoD is still a design jumble?  Has GoD been so dramatically retuned that it is no longer designed for level 70 toons?  Are they done?  What's going on exactly?  If it's not done, is there a plan?  If there is a plan, what is the plan?  If there is not a plan, why the heck isn't there a plan?  <br />
<br />
Anyone know?  <br />
<br />
I really think some clarity about their plans for GoD is appropriate under the circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is always going to be some changes here and there to events/mobs/zones.  I read somewhere they want to do something about the bic piece from the primals in yxtta.  Overall.. who knows.  Uqua was changed to be beatable.  Ikk 4 was fixed to be passable.  Ikk 3 was changed to give an easier hint about what is expected of you.  Little things like this are changing.  I'm expecting there to be several fixes inc soon in Tacvi and Txevu, mostly because not much is known still about these two zones and there are so many scripts and events taking place that you must pass to get places.</div></div><hr />

Vxed has been changed to require the deaths of 50 mobs and this will go live soon.<br />
<br />
The roadblock that Yxtta presents to someone working on the BiC quest will also be resolved soon.<br />

Yes, the expansion has been retuned so that it is no longer too hard for level 65s.  The zones that were most affected by this were Txevu, Inktuta, and Tacvi, and they were fixed up long before anyone stepped foot in them.<br />
<br />
Are they done?  What's going on exactly?<br />
Rashere and I are keeping a very close eye on players progressing through the end game content.  We get excellent feedback from watching the events and talking to the players and make changes as necessary.  Mostly these are small tweaks.  I'm very satisified with the quality of events that players are currently tackling in Qvic, Inktu`ta, and Txevu.<br />

<br />
That's outrageous, I expected a response in less than 20 minutes.  How do I cancel again??<br />
<br />
Seriously, thanks for the response Prathun.  I think the Vxed change should go live using a different definition of &quot;soon&quot; than Brenlo used when indicating that the AA reimbursements would be made &quot;soon&quot;.  :)</div></div><hr />

4 posts in 2 days from this Dev.<br />
Have we found a dev whos sympathetic to shaman and reads our boards at last ?.<br />
Lots of other issues need fixing with Shaman but unlike the last communication from SoE on here hope this one carries on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a question....<br />
<br />
Doing Ikki 1-3 and requiring a tank with at least 10k hps and time gear to do the named, is that retuning? <br />
<br />
An EP geared guild can do these trials, just finding the players that can do this is a bottle neck in itself.  Its hard to walk into the trials and pass them without being time geared or better.  <br />
<br />
So are they staying this way?  Some what I disagree with is the fact that its so easy to wipe in these trials givin circumstances.   It literally takes a good chunk of time to even find people willing to do them.  There really isn't much incentive for doing the trials.  <br />
<br />
I like the challenge, but as far as being player friendly you won't get far into this expansion without a high end guild.  You have to have a good tank.  Clerics and druids with an amazing mana pool.  I haven't seen any other expansion that is so far off the scale than this where you have to have things in order to progress. <br />
<br />
It really only further locks out people out and with regards to shaman hurts our need to be there.  I don't really have a problem with doing the trials its just being so highly dependant on a certain group make up is a curse in itself.  <br />
<br />
Making things so reliant on one group content to progress is crazy cause there are so many variables to consider.  I don't want to have to rely on the sun and moon aligning in order to get past content.  It is kind of annoying in the midst of everything else such as raiding to have to try and find a group within in a guild to do these trials.  It really turns people's lives into misery picking certain people over others. <br />
<br />
Not a real big morale booster if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

This is on the top of the list of things to look at.  In fact, Rashere has spent the last few days tweaking the six person Ikkinz trials to allow for more flexibility in the group makeup.  <br />
<br />
Post-tuning, it should still be challenging and require a well-geared group, (Kodtaz and Ikkinz are aimed at Time level players), but it will not be so difficult as to require a warrior being healed by multiple clerics.<br />
<br />
-Prathun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing you might consider was the way that significantly upping the levels of the creatures in Kodtaz was a nerf to the lulling classes.  Lull does not work on Yellow and Red con mobs.  <br />
<br />
In the past my groups were able to explore and xp and hunt nameds with a ranger/bard/druid/enchanter or even cleric for pulling.  Now, if you want to move into any of the temples in Kodtaz to fight, you better have a monk to FD split for you.  It's really made those zones unappealing to XP in, even with the increased amount of xp you can earn there.  It was one of the final straws for me, really.  Was nice to have a challenging zone to xp in, then the mobs were tuned down and made hard to pull.  Just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - we were in Kodtaz in the 2nd or maybe 3rd week of GoD, non-elemental players, so I had a significant amt of time to see it pre-change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No nothing have changed ,if you don't have a cleric in your group ,don't even think to go to GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes Madalton. Stay away. We wouldnt want Kodtaz to get crowded now. Its only the best exp in the game nowdays. And if you tell too many people that, it will become crowded. Which would hurt my exp gains.<br />
<br />
Is it tough? Of course its tough. Hell, the dev just posted that its intended for Plate of Time geared players. If you have not been farming PoTime for a few months, you are probably going to wipe numerous times as a single group in Kodtaz. Its tough even for PoTime geared people. 6 months from now, when the people pushing ahead through GoD get geared up with GoD gear, they will come back and laugh at the wimpy mobs in Kodtaz. Much like elementally+ geared players laugh at the PoValor mobs now.<br />
<br />
I can say that from firsthand experience, mobs in Kodtaz hit for less than they were a month ago. Ikkinz  trials have not changed that I have seen, but apparently are being retuned to allow for a single cleric to handle the healing. Ikkinz raid mobs hit for LOTS more than they did a few months ago when they were *cough* &quot;slightly&quot; *cough* tuned up. Those &quot;slightly&quot; tuned up mobs suddenly started hitting like freight trains on steroids. Hopefully, from what I am reading, these mobs are in the process of being retuned again, so the encounters are more managable.<br />
<br />
GoD was released untuned, with tons of broken things, untested scripts, and generally the most incomplete expansion EQ has ever seen. We've all seen the reactions from the players due to the problems. Now we are standing back waiting to see flesh put onto the bones the devs have promised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok Bigmeeno ,i assume you don't have a cleric in your group ,you are the main healer of your group......and about lacking the best exp of eq.....I DON'T WORRY if you want to know ,i don't play to exp. So don't worry i'll not crowd your favorite zone  :) <br />
<br />
      But back to subject. Yesterday ,no raid so we have try to make a single group for god. To bad ,no cleric available (or druid) ,and i couldn't stand as only healer. Getting to Kodtaz is not really hard but it's damn long , 3h+ trial are unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heres a lil info i can give from the sewers...the mobs will miss alot...if they hit for around 900 they will usually only hit once....if they double hit it will only be 300-600 per hit and one of those hits usuallly misses.....these 2 things have made it alot easier IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for the response.  People here are a lot happier just to get a response, even if it isnt exactly what we want to hear.</div></div><hr />

I guess the change to Vxed hasn't been implemented yet either.  That would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The change to the number of mobs needed in Vxed HAS gone live, it just wasn't mentioned.  I've spawned the flag mob 2x so far from this personally.<br />
<br />
Similarly Spirit of Cheetah has been found to really help flagging in here.  After spawning the hail mob, my group wiped, however i was able to carefully (or crazily you decide) use FoE and SoC when i got closer make a suicide run from the ent to the flag mob w/o getting hit.  It was fun =)</div></div><hr />

I think shaman have gotten to used to main healing. We got some stuff in PoP that was aimed at Time players or close to time and they went back to BoT and said, hey look i can main heal in BoT and Elemental. I think we get caught up in that thinking. We are versitile so when we make use of our tools we can do a lot, but the main vision was not to let us main heal in appropriate content.<br />
<br />
I dont know if this is a intential progress path for us or if its just a side effect, but it seems to me that for the appropriate level of zone for the spells we use and the level we are, we arent designed to main heal anymore. We are designed to back up heal. im fine with that, as long as we can pick up the slack in other areas.<br />
<br />
Persoanly i always felt that content should be dealt with as such.<br />
<br />
Cleric is the best pure healing class. Its their job and let them have it.<br />
<br />
If you cant fine a cleric then you can find a shaman AND a druid and together they can work as a team and fill the gap that the cleric is leaving. The shaman should be giving a adjustment to his DPS to compentsate for having to have 2 healing classes and effectivly losing 1 slot of pure DPS as well should the druid be able to contribute a moderate amount of DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basicly what you end up with is 2 classes being able to work as a team to fill in the same HPS and DPS that gorup with 1 cleric for the healer would have.  Tweak out the DoTs and keep the nukes solid on the druids and together we can do well.<br />
<br />
Pitcure it.<br />
<br />
<br />
On pull we lay on a HoT and when that wears down the druid CHeals, at which point we HoT and after the mob wears that down, the druid CHeals. In between HoT's we are DoTing and maybe Nuking with rains or fast casting nukes ( this 7 second crap is old. Just shorten VS to 5 sec or 4.5.) and in between CHeals the druid is laying a few nukes down. Add in a paragon AA with more healing per tick but the same mana with a shorter recast time and BAM, you have yourself a sweet group setup thats not so over powered its prefered over another. Its just a good way to setup a group when a cleric is missing.  Oh and also i think we should get the level 15 BST proc. Sorry BST's but you stole enough from us, you can stand to lose that to us so we can add some DPS to the group that doesnt cost mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there ya go. Everyone is happy and whoever isnt can **** :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wribit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I do Gates of Discord quite frequently because of the signifigant challenge and rewards to reap rather than xping in boring old SRT or Elementals.  I am NOT Time geared, nor Time flagged/keyed.  I solo in Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, Tipt, and Vxed.  I have tested soloing in the sewers, but all the guys i tried were immune to root or summoned.  Tipt and Vxed I only killed guys that didnt summon.  The xp is phenomonal, however it does get rather boring.  The trials in the Sewers are a pain in the ass.  The trials altogether are a pain in the ass, but it requires a very well skilled player, as well as a very skilled group to pull it off with success, even more so to pull it off flawlessly with 0 deaths.  I have a bunch of friends whom I farm Gates zones with for gear.  My monk friend who is a wonderful puller, has the leather tunic from Vxed and his Tipt bracer.  I have my Tipt bracer, so I can crit with my epic, and my Nihil spell.  My other friends have some nice gear too, and so on, and so forth.  My main point here is, yes I wish the mobs were less powerful, yes I wish the trials weren't such a pain in the ass, yes I wish BDIC pieces were easier to get and not such a pain-stakingly long quest, but you know what, I like GoD as it is atm.  I am not Kod`Taz flagged yet, I need Sewer 2 and 4 done.  Maybe I will become bitter when I get into that zone, but for now, I am content with how Gates is atm.  That is just my 2 cents on the subject.  I think its a great expansion; maybe the mobs could be tuned down just slightly so they don't hit like a Tier 1/2 PoP God.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact right after the summit they were awash with posting.s now it is almost back to the crickets again. <br />
<br />
Chirp... Chirp...<br />
<br />
I mean look at the dev tracker on the EQ site itself. Postings primarily last week the 18th I belive. Lets just make sure they don;t backslide into only posting when it is conveienant to do so to quell riots and such.<br />
<br />
I mean a friend that only calls when he wants something, is no friend at all. <br />
<br />
And yeah this is negitive. But come on here. Has SoE turned over a new leaf? Or is it the same old leaf with some gilding. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Honestly though Snow, I probably spend about 2 hours a day reading message boards, and I only go to 3, and I skip TONS of posts. I would rather like to think they have gathered enough data to attempt to make some viable solutions, and are now making them. After all, how many times do they have to read &quot;Shaman healing sucks. Shaman dps sucks&quot;. 90% of the info on these threads, and others like them, is redundant. And, in the unlikely event that something new does pop up, it will also be just as likely to be lost in a sea of sensless blabbering. <br />
<br />
This isnt the only site they need to watch. There are ALL the other class sites, and the EQ boards themselves. I dont even BOTHER to read those, due to the sheer volume of posts. Lets cut em some slack, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What else is there for Prathun to say?  I think he was pretty straightforward here.  <br />
<br />
I've had a good time in GoD recently.  They really frigged it up, but folks forget that Velious was a bit of a mess when it first came out too.  There was a lot of tuning for Velious.  Probably why it was a low seller for them, word did get out quickly.  Now folks regard Velious as some &quot;golden era&quot;.  <br />
<br />
GoD can be very good for folks who might think otherwise traditionally.  <br />
<br />
Plus I just got Balance of Nihil, so I'm happy about that.</div></div><hr />
