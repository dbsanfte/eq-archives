<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikkyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK.. Im not lvl 60 yet.. so I have only just begun to read about the Weaponshield /disc... <br />
<br />
So, you mean to tell me that... Weaponshield AND Trueshot are on the same timer??  /boggle<br />
<br />
*gets ready to cry*<br />
<br />
Your kidding, right?  I mean, if it's true.. that BITES pretty damn hard, unless other classes have the same setback... do they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All melee /disc options are on the same timer as far as I know. Pure melee classes (Warrior, Rogue and Monk) have shorter timers so you will tend to see them use there discs more often. Since we have spells our timers are much longer, which is the result of our hybrid nature.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
