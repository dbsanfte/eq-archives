<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neither and I have been playing since release.<br />
<br />
I would say that it is Different</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I think it has gotten better. It's gone through a lot of growing pains, sure, but the content, stability, features, and functionality are much more advanced than when the game was released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">went from a fantasy online RPG for fantasy-geeks to a mass consommation Arcade game ala Counter Strike.<br />
<br />
All in all, the game went worse with the years. But we're still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there have been some tremendous improvements to the game though.  undeniably so, imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as a general game definately gotten better.<br />
<br />
some aspects have gotten worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Worse. It was best during the Velious era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The game is easier now.<br />
<br />
Some of it is good, some of it is bad.<br />
<br />
While we have some content left it is not the same game.<br />
<br />
All in all I would say it has become worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Worse - I'm a non-guilded player and our status has gone from being 2nd rate citizens to untermensch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been playing for nearly 3 years, and I'm a casual gamer who belongs to a small guild, and I've made it to 61. (And slowly rising)<br />
<br />
Some aspects of the game are much better the books in pok to transport people around, the bazaar for buying and selling goods. For new players it's much easier for them to get into, no real deaths until level 10, help files in the UI explaining how stuff works.<br />
<br />
Other aspects of the game are worse, poor spell upgrades for shaman, in the expansions since kunark/velious. Raising the level cap to 65 and making good old world content trivial, but balancing that with new content that is insanely difficult for the reward.<br />
<br />
Overall I think it's better but I probably only bother playing because there's nothing better to play at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Worse.  Totally agree Vellious was the best time.<br />
<br />
Raids have gone from 1 hour events to day-long marathons. <br />
<br />
Timesinks, keys, flags, all of it is bull**** added to cater to a select few that have the time to pursue the course to its fullest.  Casual gamers have no chance to see the game in its entirety.<br />
<br />
The addition of AA abilities and new gear ideas are nice, but they don't cure what I personally see as root problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would say the game has gotten worse.  Class lines are blurred almost beyond recognition, and will get worse still, once the &quot;opening&quot; system goes live and SoE's Brave New &quot;You're-All-Hybrids&quot; World is realized.  They have managed to make the world &quot;smaller&quot; while adding zones (thanks to PoK, boats being replaced with TLers, etc), to the point that the element of &quot;travel&quot; has essentially been removed from the game.  Gameplay has been dumbed down, and mudflation is reaching a point where it's hard to see where they're going to continue to go with the game (really, what's the next carrot, gear with 300hp per slot?).  It's impossible to see the game content you paid for without a small army (see PooP, being unguilded makes PoP progression esentially impossible, at least on my server with its rotation system, backflagging agreements, etc.).  Gameplay itself is boring, uninspiring, and repetitive.  And I will quote Kylt, because I have no better words:<br />
<br />

&quot;So Harwel,&quot; you ask, &quot;With a list of complaints like that, why don't you just cancel?&quot;  Answer: I did. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The game has gotten much better in the three years since I started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Both.  Some things have changed for the better, but the overall feel of the game has lost some of its soul, IMO.  That probably doesn't mean anything to those who never played MMOGs before EQ, but for some of the old-timers, a lot of the immersiveness has been lost.  For instance (and this is only a single example), transportation has gotten so much easier.  On one end of the spectrum, there are those of us that remember how going from Freeport to Qeynos was an adventure.  As you leveled up, it became a chore, but you could find a port if you applied yourself.  At the other extreme, you have people now that don't even know WK exists (not kidding here, we have a few in my guild).  I am not advocating either, just contrasting.  I do think both extremes are a bit too much.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all in all, it is what it is, and there's no sense comparing.  I find it unfortunate that people now don't know their way around, complain about things that have been improved from the way it was, and have no clue about any game playstyle other than sitting in PoP and grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, and the opinion that the game was best during Velious can be argued as being a class-dependent opinion.  As an enchanter, I hated Velious with a passion.  Leveled a wizard to 60 (subsequently 65) while my chanter was still 57, and as a wizard, I can say with certainty many will claim Luclin was a wizard's dream era.  Personally, I enjoyed pre-Kunark lol ... I know, I am weird  =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I drew a graph, I would say the game got progressively better from release to Velious, which was a definite peak.  Luclin was a very disappointing expansion (big drop), but Planes of Power, even with all its easy xp and flags and other faults, added a lot of fun content.  It made EQ a totally different game, but it was still fun.  The last two expansions, however, have seen EQ steadily decline.  EQ needs another big expansion... hopefully GoD will fit the bill.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There is certainly much more content than ever before.<br />
<br />
And there are defiantly many little details that are complete that were not in the game when it first came out.<br />
<br />
The game is certainly much easier than before as well.  Leveling is insanely quick compared to when the game first released.  The bazaar has made it a piece of cake to get hordes of real nice items for very little coin.<br />
<br />
Better or worse depends on whether you like a challenging game where everything is difficult, or an easy game where it requires little skill and effort to hit lvl 65. <br />
<br />
I do think that the game has lost some of its appeal to me as it stoops to the lowest common denominator.  IMHO it is slowly taking on the feel of Dungeon Siege, (a game where one human could easily control a party of six characters, while eating a sandwich, and whipping up on beautiful, but unchallenging mobs), but I bet SOE is making more money than they ever did before.  Many things that were broken when the game first released are still broken.<br />
<br />
Over all the basics mechanics of the game have not changed one bit from the first release, Ldon is the closest thing to any thing innovative.</div></div><hr />

I admit that the POK books have dumbed down travel considerably, but I ADORE the Translocators.  Maybe you enjoy getting crushed to death in Erud's Crossing when the boat goes through the island, but I'd rather have reliable travel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i have to agree with the comment about small guilds and individual players will never see much of the end game content.  sony has definately been catering to a small number of high level players who have time to game constantly.  we all pay the same amount per month,. but the game content keeps getting made for a select few to uber out there characters and flood the market with both money and weopons that most of us will never be able to possess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">on a differnt note: the mechanics of the game have gotten better.  not near as many link dead and bad zoning issues. better graphics.  the pok has definately made life easier to go see more whith the time we have</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough, but as I see it, they should have fixed the problems with the boats instead of copping out with the TLers. ;)  Yet the TLers are on the docks, standing there in mute testimony to the general lack of competence on the SOE dev team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Personally, I think it has gotten better.

<br />
I'd agree.  I played EQ when it first came out through just before Kunark and now I'm back in a 2nd EQ run and I find the game to be much more enjoyable now.<br />
<br />
Worse - I'm a non-guilded player and our status has gone from being 2nd rate citizens to untermensch.<br />
<br />
(I'm unguilded too at level 65 by choice, since I've always been in and/or lead guilds for the last few years in various MMORPGs, and I'm enjoying not being in any serious organizations for now)<br />
<br />
I would actually disagree with this.  In the old days of EQ your options were a lot more limited if you didn't belong to a guild when you were capped at 50 because there was a lot less to do.  Heck, in my 1st EQ run I was in arguably the strongest guild on my server and there were still many times when I couldn't find anything to do (which is one reason I left EQ in the first place).<br />
<br />
In the EQ of today there are so many more options for all players that I think you can easily get by unguiled and only really miss out on bigtime raiding.  Anybody can crank out and accumulate AAs and there is some decent gear available to nonraiders.  Raiding takes a lot of time and patience, so those that do it deserve the extra rewards, IMO.<br />
<br />
I can usually log on and get involved with something I want to do pretty quickly, which for me corresponds to having fun.  In ancient EQ I could easily be running around for several hours frustrated while looking for something to do - which is not fun.<br />
<br />
I also like to think that being good at your class counts for something.  I may encounter and/or group with people with far superior gear and 100's more AA than me, but I still perform well and contribute in the situations I'm involved in.  Within the limits of my adventuring potential I think I do just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's really hard to judge because, honestly, what I was looking for in a game in 2000 is not the same thing I look for in a game in 2004. The technology has changed, the industry has grown and I have gotten older. <br />
<br />
Trying to look at EQ today through the eyes I had when I first started I would probably say better (just the /consent feature makes it 1000 times better).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think the gameplay has gotten better. I've been playing this character for almost two years now. It took me one year to hit 55, I think, playing two to six times per week, two to six hour sessions.<br />
<br />
I've gotten my alt SK to 29 in about 20 hours of play. No craziness with mapping keys to train sense heading (surprised we didn't have to train breath/eat/drink back in the day). No -insert misty memories of pre-luclin travel- anymore. No leaving the newbie loot that won't stack because you only have 8 slots, and two have food and water, and the vendor is waaaaaaaay back there. And MAPS! And BANKSPACE! And CUSTOM UIs!<br />
<br />
Basically, a quicker run to the post-40, post-50, and post-60 games, where every class can fill a niche. No more 6 level 20-somethings of ANY class combo grouping - now we need a healer, a crowd control and/or puller, a slower, a tank, and some dpsers. A faster run to the more FUN levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liken it to taking Warhammer Rolelaying and making it into warhammer Fantasy battles. The game has much of the same elements. And the same names and all. But the spirit is different. <br />
<br />
When I started. I was wandering around permafrost at level 1. With a stick in hand. Nekkid. And everyone else was there with me. talking hollering and staying close to the campfires at night because it was DARK. And the beasties out there would kill you as soon as look at you. By the time I made level 5. Halas was claimed by a brave Gnome warrior in the name of king Ak'anon.  How he got there I will never know. But it was so darn cool to see the little guy. And he had a set of big brass ones to make that Journy. <br />
<br />
By level 14 (Many months later. I went on a Journy to see the fabled Ak'anon. It took many long weeks of travel. I stopped off on the way. and Became one with the wall. And Fought the Gnolls of Splitpaw. Dealt with the Evil Eye Minions of King Xorbb. Stood face to face with the dread Abasador Dvinn. And killed him. (Much to the cheers of many elves and dwarves.  And when I finally reached my journys end. I stood in front of the King of Akanon. And informed him that the folks of Halas rejected his claim and if he wanted to deal with me he would be free to accept my challange. (He sat there. Cowering in fear. not saying a word.)<br />
<br />
The game now adays lack these stories. Instead they are filled with I got powerleveld in PC and this twink came along and stole all my kills damn Uberguilders. Or gripping tales of DPS and balance, and push and numbers. <br />
<br />
While exploring some of the new expansions I would awnser camp checks with names. And my Guildmates would ask me how I knew the camp name. I would reply I didnt. but since noone had been here before it would damn well be called what I wished it to be. <br />
<br />
That is lost on this day and age. And sadly I miss it. The game is fun in it's own right still. But it lacks the fire that it once had. Like another poster has put it. It certainly seems as if the soul is gone.  <br />

This is one of the reasons I quit FF after a month too. I don't consider spending 20-30 minutes getting to a leveling spot fun and then doing it all over again when you die.<br />
<br />
Travel in a game is not interesting its tedious. I was around when all EQ had was boats and I think we're 1000x better off now. Sitting on my ass for 20 minutes waiting for a boat was just a waste of my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luclin wasn't the greatest overall, but the advent of VT and seeing guilds race for gear that was just incredible compared to everything else was pretty cool.  AA's were definitely a nice touch to the game :D<br />
<br />
PoP was awesome for everybody.  New challenges for the VT guilds, and easy transportation for everyone makes this my 2nd favorite expansion.  The toughness of the mobs sucks sometimes, but it's better than falling asleep while you get a blue bub of XP every hour in Velks :D<br />
<br />
LoY was probably the worst expansion IMO.  Getting there seems like a pain since the release of PoP portals.  But they do have some decent gear here and there and the XP is still much better than old world XP.<br />
<br />
LDoN is the reason I am playing EQ again.  Alot of possibilities for every level player, and even &quot;casual&quot; gamers can get a piece of the pie with this expansion.  It also helps relieve some of the mayhem in the non-flagged PoP zones.  I used to love BoT, but I obviously won't be going there anytime soon again :(<br />

<br />
I am a Time enabled Shaman that has been playing since June 99.<br />
<br />
<br />
You sure can tell that SoE are the people who brought you the Playstation, EQ is becoming more and more about &quot;instant gratification&quot; ala the Arcade Game as time goes by.<br />
<br />
Amazing how people have differing perspectives though. A lot of the stuff that people list as being better is some of the stuff I dislike the most.<br />
<br />
One of the things I most object to is just how easy it is to level up these days, leveling should take time and intelligent effort in my opinion. It used to be that EQ was an imersive experience, these days its just a group of related arcade games that you access from PoK or PoT.<br />
<br />
Achieving Level 50 used to be an achievment, traveling succesfully from one side of the EQ world to the other was an achievment, knowing how to cross a single zone - in some cases - used to be an achievment, retrieving a corpse, knowing where to bind, killing specific mobs used to be an achievment.<br />
<br />
For example, it used to make me smile that Druids / Wizards did not know how to run from place to place, they didnt know where the zone lines where, they didnt know which mobs to avoid, which to ignore and which to kill, they missed at lot of content. These days it makes me sad that a large percentage of players have never even heard of the zones themselves much less know how to find them or cross them.<br />
<br />
Most of these achievments are now meaningless, they are so very easy that they mean nothing and in most cases are not even required to be undertaken. Now I accept that some people would not label some of these things as achievments but the fact is that this is what the game was about back then, its what the game was about when the people who have made it such a great success signed up, started playing and kept playing.<br />
<br />
For sure some of the game mechanics have been improved, massively improved, but in making these improvements a very great deal has been lost. Are these improvements in game mechanics worth the Arcade Style dumming down that has consistently been taking place since Velious, in my opinion NO they are not.<br />
<br />
If there was a game on the market that captured the original intent / imersiveness / effort of EQ then I would be gone in a hearbeat. As it is my play time is massively reduced by my greatly reduced enjoyment of the game.<br />

in many respects it messed the game up. solo wise...ok maybe for monks more than shamans.<br />
<br />
its a toss up. worse in most balance issues. better in pvp...which is a REALLY stupid thing to gauge balence by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Better in some regards (far more item variety  that are more beneficial to the classes (serpentine bracers anyone?) that are easy to get, less anal exp rate) and worse in others (A seemingly ridiculous progression course that will take you a good portion of your life to get through unless you just do what this game seems to want you to so and leave your friends for the next big guild). <br />
<br />
The main thing I miss about old EQ is that the destination is far more important and pushed than the journey itself these days. It seems you are useless if you are not level 65. Where as I did not mind adventuring for hours in old EQ just walking around and talking to npcs, its almost a sense of a rush for 65 above all else now. Then time to start farming those 500 aa. Whether thats the players or the developers fault though, is up for debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">PoP was awesome for everybody.<br />
<br />
For me, PoP was the worst expansion ever.<br />
<br />
Levelling to 65 meant that a huge number of zones in Kunark, Velious and Luclin became gimped out and uninteresting.  So the expansion that raised max level needed to provide the maximum possible number of replacement zones.  Yet the Devteam chose a design for PoP that excluded casual players from a significant proportion of the new zones.<br />
<br />
On top of that PoTime gear went into the realms of what - as an old time D&amp;Der - I can only describe as Monty Haul.  PoTime equippped players are now so powerful compared with casual players that EQ is effectively split into two games.  In D&amp;D Monty Haul was associated with inexperienced teenage DMs.  Its mind-boggling to see it coming from 'professional' developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Kunark and Velious were great and had lot of interesting things. After that it got worse. Luclin was a deperessing (bugs, timesinks, idiotic new models), LoY lacked in every thinkable department, PoP targetted at only a small population, Ldon missed the chance to provide raids for non-elemental guilds.<br />
GoD looks uninteresting so far...</div></div><hr />

That right there is the problem too. Instant gradification. No more fighitng forever making friends as you level. Now you level to 65 in a few weeks, but only if you dont talkto no one or get power leveld, then you get in a guild for better loot so youc an raid bigger mobs for more loot, so you can raid bigger mobs for more loot, so you can raid bigger mobs for more loot...<br />

<br />
I really miss the days when running from Qeynos to Freeport required a guide or alot of awareness. Where my home in halas was a far far away land that was so far i never got to go there and when i did it bright a real sense of coming home. Gave the old pixel town a real emotion connection to myself. <br />
<br />
I miss level ing places like blackborrow, where you only carefuly moved ot the second level and only if you brought atleast a friend or 2 and where yes, trians did happen to zone, but there was usualy people there to help derail it.<br />
<br />
Guess im just a old crotchety fart now, but thats the EQ ill always remember. Hopefuly they bring it back in EQ2 and i might play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Much worse since PoP. This expansion brought us extra levels that made pretty much every real dungeon in the game unattractive for a group. At the same time old style dungeon have been pretty much been dead since Kunark, and I don't see any hints of dungeon being revived, nor do I see that the current EQ team has the talent to make a Guk or Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Along with PoP came time loot. Loot that is apparently so amazing they have to start tuning total aspects of the game for time enable and those who aren't. All the while, those in Time are whining they have no challenge, loot sucks in LDoN, and they need even more! Its going to get so out of hand, we'll be purchasing different expansions before long. One cd for the top 3 guilds per server and one for everyone else.<br />
<br />
Lets move into the expansion of LDoN. Finally we thought, dungeons! Not only dungeons but a dungeon just for me, my wife and our close friends. Oops wait, they aren't dungeons they are boring arse generic tunnels with randomly placed generic mobs. Hell even the named seem generic.<br />
<br />
Oh well, all is not lost......... raids! Our small guild only can only field 35 people on scheduled event like late friday or on saturdays. Levels mostly being 65, but several 58-64s also. Problem is the times most average working, family people can get on is prime time, when EVERYONE is on. Rarely is anything up, most worth fighting have been killed by 2pm by guilds of college kids or people with no jobs or different time zones. LDoN raids will be perfect, once a week we can all schedule to show up for a raid. We won't have to worry about frustration of assembling and finding nothing up.....<br />
<br />
Well, wrong again! The raids are tailored to the style and power of guilds who can race to mobs, who are able to be on at 10am if that when an important zone is popped for them. WTH, whats the point of LDoN raid being tailored for basically the guilds who don't even appreciate the loot from them? For those who'm its not even an accomplishment, just a boring task, for those who don't even need or appreciate the options to spawn a raid on demand. Why the hell would a guild in TIME need a spawn on demand raid? They proved 2 years ago they could race to any content they wished to take, stupid design decision, reward those who don't even care or want the frigging reward.<br />
<br />
Please don't tell me racing guilds is part of the game. I don't play this game for head to head combat, if I wanted me vs them, I'd be on a zek server or playing a shooter. Anyways, I'm not asking for every boss mob in the game to be instanced. I'm simply asking that the expansion that brough us instancing, at least use that technology to put in one damn encounter for us casual folks who'd like one night a week to work toward a common goal. Not go weeks till we get lucky and catch a mob up.<br />
<br />
In all the game has been going downhill slowly since Velious. PoP was sort of like the appearance of a blackhole. The descent is accelerating with each passing second, and there is no escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I'd say it has gotten better, only because of the people i've met in the game though :)<br />

/agree<br />
<br />
I think perhaps the problem is that EQ has now been redesigned to pander to the 'vision' of people like Furor and Thott.  Its a soul-less thing where any sense of wonder, any idea of immersion in an RPG world, is lost.  I doubt if roleplaying (or anything requiring imagination) has any value to them whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I think by and large it has gotten better.  Over first 3 years I left EQ for months at a time.  <br />
<br />
Bad Old Days:<br />
At first the problem was finding solo spots or groups.  Remember that in the beginning there was not LFG tool and having to listen to the crap on the shout and OOC channels was anoying.<br />
<br />
Before Kunark, Norrath was impossibly crowded; seemed like there was one mob for every 10 players.  Trade skills were broken.  Alchemy was an insult to the Shaman community so there weren't a lot of alternative things to do.  Exploring was still an option.  For a long time in the game a mistake in tradeskilling ATE all your materials and you could not buy in bulk or select one at a time without typing in the number or moving the slider in the dialog box.  Again if you could not find a group or a solo spot, trades were too painful an alternative.  And it was not just a matter of SoE dumbing down the game; the interface and mechanics in certain activities were user unfreakingfriendly.<br />
<br />
I think many folks have mentioned that AA have done a great job of extending the fun and therefore the life of the game and I totally agree.  <br />
<br />
Just think getting 50-60 level Shaman spells was and to some degree still is too hard, and SoE never dumbed down that aspect.  Research helped, but it was still hard.  I never got torpor, had malo made and sold it to help pay for Malos.  Some parts of EQ have been harsh and continue to be harsh.<br />
<br />
New Items that Hurt the Game:<br />
Ease of travel sucks!  I know that I kind of enjoy being able to rush around Norrath at light speed but it really does take some danger out of the game when you can easily get back to your group from your bind spot.  I can remember when a death would have you running/ waiting for a transport for an hour before you were back to your group.  This added an extra penalty to dying and it made the game more exciting.  It also sucks that that those of us who can cast SoW or travel spells aren't all that now with the Books of Laziness.<br />
<br />
Maps should have been tied to a cartography skill.  If your skill is not high enough, your map interface does NOT come up.  That way it would not matter if you D/L complete maps of a zone.  If you have a 20 Cartography skill you are going to be pounding your Map hotkey for 10mins to get the map to come up.<br />
<br />
I hate the Luclin models (I hate most everything about Luclin actually).  Oh yeah they look more detailed and higher poly, but it is a case of more is less.  They said the new models would allow for 3D armor. &quot;Well, Where is it?&quot;  With the old models and Velious we had 6 different graphics 2 for each of the armor types and the Velious armor was pretty.  Now we are back to 3 armor graphics and we sit like dorks.<br />
<br />
I do like the Bazaar but it is kind of goofy.  I would have put a few Bazaars scattered around Norrth in Faction Areas.  You want to see what the Dark Folks have for sell in the Freerot Bazaar, you better have an illusion potion of Chanter buddy.<br />
<br />
PoP was okay for adding content but the experience was way out of whack and ruined the rest of EQ.  The flagging system was also goofy.  I can see needed a group to get an epic but needing a group to gain access to a whole portion of EQ is a bit much.  Their answer also killed the Charm slot for anything but the PoP Charm.  Short sighted I think.<br />
<br />
It is hard to evaluate the dumbing down of the 1-10 character levels since I already know all the ins and outs of the game but new players can't have the thrill (or sheer terror) that I had as a new player back when finding a corpse in EF was a feat and a death ate a good portion of your exp bar.<br />
<br />
Even with at I think that the only two real damaging events for EQ have been the Travel Books and the over the top experience in PoP.  If those two things were eleminated EQ would be a more challenging game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'd say it's gotten much worse.  Travelling is much easier now, though in a way it's good when you really need to get somewhere.  But, I remember the first time I ever left Kunark and what a rush that was with being KoS! It wasn't 'til level 28 when I finally saw the fabled EC tunnel which, until then, I had only heard about from other people.  I also remember when I had to have a guide to get back home and he left me for dead in DL which I was stuck in for 3 hours 'cause I didn't know how to get out.  Fun stuff like that is what I miss.  Now it's nothing but the grind, which I suck at.  People get from 1-65 in a few weeks while I'm still 57 after 3 years of playing.  Where's da justice?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Gameplay has gotten easier.<br />
<br />
The Game has gotten worse.  Its become so unbelievably one sided and easy.  No real danger anymore with click rez and graveyards.<br />
<br />
Not just that, it used to be a challenge to gain levels.  The reduced the xp loss from dying at least twice, characters under level 10 lose almost nothing.  No more hell levels.  The addition of help tips.  The game is so easy now it almost plays itself.<br />
<br />
Its gotten too &quot;monty haul&quot;, too easy to get levels, not challenging like it used to be.  Part of the reason is because of all the gear floating around making easy twinks.  But even on a clean server, its way too easy to level up compared to when the game first came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">XP loss? What's that? The 1% in 65 that I lose over the course of 8 deaths?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Worse - I'm a non-guilded player and our status has gone from being 2nd rate citizens to untermensch.<br />
<br />
I think it has gotten SO MUCH better.  I've been playing since 2000 and at one time when I got a character up to max level there was nothing else for me to do as I don't raid.  Now there is LDON, there are AAs, there are all kinds of things to do - I'm busy every night and I love it.  <br />
<br />
I'm guilded, but in the sense you speak I might as well be unguilded as my guild is a tiny family guild and I rarely even see another person from my guild logged on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Serrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Not in Beta but bought and joined into EQ the very week it entered stores. (Originally on the Brell Server)<br />
<br />
I think that the following have become better:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Interface - HUGELY better<br />
 Game play<br />
 Quests<br />
 Graphics and models, including player models<br />
<br />
<br />
Worse<br />
<br />
<br />
 Customer service - I swear half the guides don't even know the policies and they are certainly not implemented consistently<br />
 Sense of comunity and teamwork in the player base - I used to trust people til they proved otherwise, now I distrust til they prove trustworthy<br />
 Manners in general of the player base - Seriously, the behavoir in shout and ooc makes us all sound like a bunch of little brat, I am not against some cursing but come on, its gotten pathetic<br />
 Naming policy - Naming policy no longer represents that fantasy feel EQ once had<br />
 Sony RP - The only time Sony even seems to care about RP is when they have an expansion to sell.  Everquest has become a great video game but nobody seems to care at all about roleplay any longer<br />
 The requirement of uber guilds - People have zero loyalty to their guilds any more.  People change guilds as often as they ding.  People used to join a guild and commit to building it.  Now they finish with a HOT guild and move to a Elemental guild, instead of building their current guild to Elemental.  Its a cycle that perpetuates itself and if you want to see all the great content, you pretty much have to ditch your friends along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that Sony promotes the bad attitudes in the player base by developing content, and rule sets, that essentially reward those who would step on other people to get where they want to be.  As well as their nearly complete unwillingness to ban disruptive players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Having played off and on from beta III to now, I have seen the game improve in so many ways.<br />
<br />
-Travel before was a nightmare.<br />
-Over crowding of zones was terrible. 160+ people in Lower Guk? Where did we put them all? Nothing I hate more than fighting people for spawns or loot. To me it is childish and beneath us all.<br />
-Everyone looked the same at a certain level; you had a small selection of items. EVERY shaman had lavender bracers (rmb), Green helm (Totemic), Gold boots (GEB's) etc.<br />
-The first set of player graphics were terrible by today's standards. The new ones while not up to par with other games (read SWG) they are better than the ones on launch.<br />
-Set career path. Before there was no difference in people for the most part. No AA's. You were what you were.<br />
-There were no Augmentations, so all items were the same.<br />
Linear progression. You went from newbie grounds, to Black Burrough, to Lake Rathe for Aviaks, to South Karana, etc and so did every other guy you knew.<br />
-Finding a group was more difficult than it is now. We have a tool to help facilitate this, and both the Planes and LDoN sort of demand grouping.<br />
-Epic Weapons give you a long-term goal, and it introduced a lot of story and lore to the world of Norrath.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on, but really there is no need. The game in my mind has done nothing but become more player friendly over the years while retaining challenge Some classes may still be unbalanced, but they do try to fix things. Just remember it is easy to get down on EQ, it is a game that is not perfect. But it is a good game, and it has improved. People need to jump OFF the negativity bandwagon once in a while. I left EQ three times. I keep turning back to it though, so that says something to me.<br />
<br />
Has soem of the &quot;flavor&quot; been lost? Sure. Hell levels werea right of passage, corpse runs were a  thing of dread, loss of a corpse was a nightmare that would lead to endless &quot;has anyone seen my corpse&quot;. rampent shouts for groups or sales and the ensuing complaints and bickering, the remoteness of certain towns or zones. There is comfort in all these thigns, and I remenber a lot of them with &quot;fondness&quot;, however all the changes were implemnted to make the game more player friendly. I remmber the past but I embrace EQ as it is now, it is a good game. But it is what you make of it.</div></div><hr />

Horizons failed to it recently, being some kind of &quot;sim-crafters&quot; type game with dwaguns. THe vastness of the content is not to be discussed in EQ, the choices made  by developpers with vulak, ST, luclin and PoP however is highly debatable. Those zones were the definitions of totally uncontrolled items mudflations. Vulak was probably the most important mistake of Velious, with loot on par with Ssra.<br />

Well that's the problem, the game went from an immersive world (travel and die) to an arcade game (track and kill). I played EQ because it was a fantasy game in an immersive world, that i wanted to explore and discover; not to click books and raid daily. I play it because im waiting to see WoW and Dark n light, and probably because i can't just really quit, delete years of my life and move on. Call it addiction, it's probably it.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with the person who made the parallel with furor and the game as it is now: it totally reflect the mentality of someone who just want to &quot;kick ass hardcore&quot; and who choose the wrong game; counter strike would have been better for him, and eventually for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">EQ is definitely less immersive.  To some people, that is a good thing.  IMO, they chose the wrong game, but ever since Sony took over, they have catered to that playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better:<br />
<br />
- More places to hunt<br />
- Travel is quicker<br />
- Ability to diversify character (To an extent, play long enough and you will get ALL the AA's)<br />
- Tradeskills marketedly improved<br />
- Class penalties removed<br />
<br />
Worse:<br />
<br />
- There are leve 65 folks who have seen less than 10 zones. When you have to explain to somebody how to get to Sebilis for a Trak raid...hmmm.<br />
<br />
- Faction means nothing. <br />
<br />
- Travel is quicker. Boats? Screw that - we need to be there NOW.<br />
<br />
- The skill of the playerbase. Not that EQ is rocket science to begin with, but when people yell &quot; zone&quot; on a 4 pull with an Enchanter in group (LDON - normal) well there is a problem. (BTW I locked em down and killed em with my charmed pet)<br />
<br />
- Customer Service. Not only are guides and GM's skeptical to begin with - their knowledge of the game is SEVERELY lacking. I had to explain to one GM that Protector's of Zek were in Kael. Like dude - W.T.F. ELSE would they be? (This was Luclin days too)<br />
<br />
- Not to harp on one very specific aspect, but the nerfing of the Monk class 3 years into the game was a HUGE mistake. No way in Hades should a change of that magnitude have been made so late in the day. And I'm here to tell ya - &quot;Melee skills&quot; don't make up for that nerf.<br />
<br />
But Brad and the other guys did build a better mouse trap. No doubt. I tried Dark Age of No Content, I skipped Craftizons, but I will try WoW. And I have quit EQ a couple of times and keep coming back.<br />

Agree totally along with some other posts in this thread.  It also seems like every time I play EQ now I am trying to live those fantastic moments in the past, like venturing in blackborrow, crossing Qeynos to Freeport, dying at the bottom of befallen, starting a new char with absolutely no gear and cash and feeling the reward of everything I earnt.<br />

<br />
What I like about the new EQ is the UI and various little user conveniences like that.<br />
<br />
What I miss so much about the old EQ that I knew from 2000 to 2002, was the sense of a horizontal world of exploring and adventure.<br />
<br />
In some ways the game was too hard early on and too easy now.<br />
<br />
What Everquest is now is a vertical ladder of flags and keys and trials. It has completely shed the whole sense of travel and exploration being important. <br />
<br />
I feel that is one of the reasons people enjoy playing other mmorpgs now, when you are in a new landscape you can just explore and that is so much fun.<br />
<br />
When I hear of OoW coming out, it doesn't even cross my mind that it will be new fun zones with nooks and crannies and such. I just assume it will be a tiered set of encounters with flags, keys and blocked off content. Basically like a country club amateur tennis tournament, not a role playing game.<br />
<br />
I dearly miss the game simply being a wide open world in which the only thing keeping you from entering a zone is that it's simply too hard for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I have been playing from the start and  I think the game has become much better exept for that last crappy expansion. I do not miss boats, cr s that last 3 hours because you forgot you are still bound in Qeynos, spamming lfg for hours in oasis/loil/ot/karnors just to find a crappy group that disbands 30 mins after you joined, and much more and can live without.<br />
<br />
Worse. Totally agree Vellious was the best time.<br />
Raids have gone from 1 hour events to day-long marathons.  <br />
hmmpf, don t know what you did in Velious but I still remember that 12 hour raid in NToV, not counting the CR neccesary after the zone crashed at 6am. Most PoP targets can be dropped much faster today than Velious or Luclin targets in their time.<br />
<br />
The improvements overweight the drawbacks by far for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since then, the game has become deeper. It has been more easy to play, but i miss a great deal of excitement. Hard to say if its a better or worse game.<br />
<br />
But in some ways its a less exciting game now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">been playing since luclin.<br />
<br />
i'm still having a blast but as many have said it's a different kind of fun. the GoD expansion was refreshing for me. you could actually run into another zone. none of that click this, click that to zone into. sure, it's there (so far the only thing i have seen that you must click is the KT stone), but there's alot of zones that you can zone into just by running across the zone line. i missed that in PoP. you can explore again. it's not always safe but i don't think exploring was ever safe.<br />
<br />
the only thing i don't care much for is the importance of the rez in GoD. instanced zones made teh rez so important. too important imo. but it was improved slightly by being able to add and remove people from it.<br />
<br />
overall i don't think the game has gotten better or worse. it's just more user friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">. . . these days its just a group of related arcade games that you access from PoK or PoT.<br />
This says it all for me. The game is different. Better in some ways, worse in others. Overall, I would say &quot;much better&quot; but that is more based on the massive amount of content and improved interface than the game itself. <br />
<br />
I started the day it shipped. The night Bertoxx went live, my friends and I decided to re-start our characters on that server. I was the 12th player to log in (did a /w all the instant I hit the ground, and it said &quot;There are 12 players in Everquest&quot;. I enjoyed the game then, but it WAS pretty tedious and a lot of sutff was really borked. People forget the little things that sucked, like riding the boat, having a lag spike, and finding yourself drowned in the middle of OOT. Or running through EC, and having a Griffen wax you good, then &quot;camp&quot; your corpse. The game was smaller then though, and once we maxxed out, it sucked for a while. Camp checks in Lower Guk yeilded answers like &quot;The 4 frogs in the first hall from the Safe area toward the Frenzy room.&quot; Other stupid things were born in these times too, like &quot;Lists&quot;, and greed really reared its ugly head. <br />
<br />
Now, the world is so big that the insta-travel is a MUST. There is so much to do that quest spoilers are practically required. The level of gear is disgusting. They game changed from &quot;leveling&quot; to &quot;Get to 65 THEN start playing for real&quot;. <br />
<br />
Still, with all its faults, I love EQ. I think it has evolved well, as well as it could. 5 years is a sickening amount of time to play a game nearly full-time. Its amazing. Sure, some things bug me. The game is so dumbed down its lame sometimes. Old zones are so obsolete its not even funny. There seems to be a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; thing with the game now, when in the beginning, the game was VERY obviously targeted to people with dedication and patience and skill. <br />
<br />
Evolution is inevitable. My EQ characters are as much a part of my life as my dog and cat, really. OK, maybe not THAT much, but at least as much as my plants. That bettter? Overall, from then to now, I give the designers a solid &quot;B-&quot; for the way they have handled it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I started December of 99, I think EQ is better overall, I enjoyed it more once I came back after completely skipping Luclin.<br />
<br />
What is missing most to me is the penalty of death is nearly zero, no real loss besides a short corpse recovery and 96% rez.  EQ needs something to make the game exciting and make you CARE about dying.  Im not for hour long corpse recoveries or anything drastic like that, but there is absolutely zero risk right now, Im not afraid to die like I once was and that to me is unexciting for the most part.  On the other end, that can tend to make people sheepish and not want to explore, but there's got to be a happy medium in there somewhere.<br />
<br />
I still cant help thinking about what the game would be like now if the developers would have planned ahead for the game to last for years instead of a short time and if things were scaled differently to make room for the future, things like complete heals, 96% rezzes, 75% slows should be lower than what they are now but we should be eventually working toward those type numbers years down the road when we are all level 100 and the game is near its end, not maxed out in the first expansion.  I also dont think itemization was scaled from expansion to expansion as well as it should have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Mirribelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I started playing after EQ originally came out.  I remember hating having to stare at my spell book when medding.  <br />
<br />
I've always thought of EQ as getting to new places and seeing new things.  Which is why I both love and hate PoP.  I travel places quicker and explore more but I hate the flag requirements for the planes.  I was one of those silly people who bought GoD right away because I crave the new content.  All in all, I think EQ is much better for players like me but there are still many, many, many places for improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">A few things are way better for me: the character models, the UI, the bank, the spellbook, not having to sit on a boat...<br />
<br />
However, I remember the first time I soloed A Mountain Giant Patriarch in DL.  I was level 44.  I agro kited him.  My hand was actually shaking b/c I was nervous I would lose and really excited I was getting a shot at him.  I haven't had that feeling in 21 levels and countless hours of playtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I do miss the adventure of travel, the fear of death, and the uncertainty was the adventure.<br />
<br />
Then again, PoK books have made travel easier.  Can you imagine calling for a raid for The Hole, only to have 4 ppl show up 2 hours later, and the rest are still otw because they missed the boat, had the boat crash and kill them, etc?<br />
<br />
I guess the reason why so much &quot;adventure&quot; has been lost is simply because back in the day, we had no maps, and most of the time, you moved solo or if you are lucky enough, had a couple of friends to accompany you.  The fear of death was pretty much real.  There was no way I wanted to retrieve my corpse in South Karana, running all the way from Halas.  Even if you bound yourself at the zone entrance, you still had to look for your corpse, defenseless.  When you were level 30, killing level 34 mobs, it was exciting.  <br />
<br />
Fast forward to the present, the zones you now explore are now pretty much set.  There is no dungeon crawl.  You enter a PoP zone, invis, and make a beeline for a camp.  On raids, you just sit back and follow the pack.  If you die, you will get a clicky rez.  There is no more adventure now, just different methods to xp grind or get uber gear.<br />
<br />
For the most part, EQ has gotten better.  The graphics have gotten better, but I can't say the same about the animation.  Custom UIs are interesting to play with, and gameplay has really been dumbed down alot.  <br />
<br />
With regards to shamans,  EQ hasn't improved that much, and hasn't declined that much to me either.  The problems of shamans not stacking in raids, and not being to heal enough in GoD, and not doing enough DPS... well, C'est la vie!<br />

<br />
Plane of Knowledge and the PoP expansion is to blame for much of it.  <br />
<br />
It eliminated all travel aspects and the adventuring that came with it.  In the early days, as Vigdis mentioned, travelling to buy that special spell was an adventure in of itself.<br />
<br />
It removed faction as a factor in the game.  It reduced the cities to ghost towns.  It helped trivialize death, the only real form of risk in this game.<br />
<br />
While I'm not against a few keyed zones, flags for nearly 3/4ths of entire expansion is an incredibly bad idea;  An idea they repeated in GoD and probably will in OoW.  As a result, PoP also made the difference between the low-end and high-end player's gear incredibly vast.  Now it has forced further expansions to jack up the gear further. Hey look! This item has 400hps on it! And the next expansion it'll have 500hp.</div></div><hr />

While I somewhat agree with this statement, honestly, the EXTREME penalty of death in the old days was far too harsh. People did not want to take &quot;chances&quot; and risk losing that prescious XP they grinded hours for. Therefore, what you ended up with was a lot of folks waiting until they were overpowered for a specific area THEN moving in there, to lower the risk of dying. XPing wasnt simple in the pre-Kunark days. It was a crappy time consuming grind. <br />
<br />
Now, with the penalty for death being minimal, I am MUCH more inclined to try crazy, impoissible stuff, since I know I can make that XP back up in an hour. I dont mind dying 3, 4 or 10 times on a raid, because overall, I only lost a few blue. I have seen people lose entire LEVELS at Nagafen and Vox befoer Kunark, and not get them back with the rezzes. Thats brutal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I don't miss the death penalties.  They were crazy, and added no sense of thrill for me.  An unrezzed death at 59 back then was heartbreaking.  <br />
<br />
On the whole EQ is better I think.  They've made some structural design mistakes I think, chief of those being PoP progression.  It's going to come back and haunt them more and more, as there is a limit to which people can keep doing these encounters.  PoP+GoD has pushed folks over that limit, and that's a big reason why so many guilds have dissolved recently.  <br />
<br />
But day to day gameplay from a design prespective is a lot better.  And there's far more content and variety available now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I think the game is a ton better than it was, but with 5 years to fix it one would expect that.<br />
<br />
I would say first on the list of good things is the ease of travel.  It used to be such a pain..the new folks have no idea.  But on that subject I am frankly amazed that some people actually enjoyed having to spend 20 minutes running from Qeynos to Freeport including the death run in Kith Forest or waiting 30 minutes for the boat rides.  It just goes to show you that people are indeed different.<br />
<br />
Next, because of the light death penalty peeps are not as chicken as before.  That is an amazing thing and CERTAINLY the main reason I have not quit EQ.  True!  Because of the prohibitive death penalty and difficult travel peeps used to be so chicken I wanted to throw up.<br />
<br />
Then, I'd say the grouping bonus was a very strong idea.  That might even be ranked higher on my list, because nothing in EQ is worse than looking for a group and not getting one.  That is the ultimate bummer.<br />
<br />
Instanced zones like LDON were a terrific idea although I think that Sony could do better as I have mentioned in many posts.  Maybe the upcoming solo LDON's will be the Shaman savior (who knows).<br />
<br />
The LFG tool is amazing as is the bazaar and maps.  Again the newer players have no idea how nice these things are now.  I can't begin to count the time I used to spend in EC buying and selling junk and getting headaches trying to read the fast script.  And being able to log in and get tells from peeps wanting you in groups and the travel isn't prohibitive and you are set up in minutes! That was just unimaginable the first few years of this game.<br />
<br />
Thats enough for now.  Grats Sony/Verant on the above referenced items and the new interfaces/aa's/leader aa's etc.<br />
<br />
Now, if the developers were just faster to react to class balance due to content changes and better on PR they would have an even better game.  Oh and get rid of the racial penalities, cough cough.<br />

not much means anything anymore in the game.  it sucks when you spend 20 hours doing a quest for the best item for a slot on your char, then an expansion comes out with a common drop that is better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess they're doing that with epics now.  But it would have been nice if there were plenty of ways -- quests, augments, whatever -- to upgrade your old stuff all through the game.  I get kind of attached to my goodies naturally, and love collecting stuff.  It would be great to have a better and better collection as time went by instead of just having your goodies become sometimes worthless or almost completely worthless.<br />

Very true. This is one of the reasons I joined a &quot;non-hardcore, family style, raiding guild&quot;. It felt GREAT when we killed the Emp. It was AWESOME when we started VT.

I could go over which points got better, but everything that got &quot;Better&quot; generally meant making the game easier, which is good for veterans who are bored and want to start alts, but bad for the true newbie.<br />

My complaint is that any truly NEW players that EQ attracts nowadays are more likely to be the l33t d3wdZ and less likely to be the true fantasy lovers.  There are plenty of &quot;Cheat Codes&quot; in today's EQ, whether it's throwing a fungi tunic on your level 1 warrior alt or spending a single day in the crazy (and in my opinion, negative) ZEM of paludal.<br />

Great point. Not only that, its too focused aroung the bazaar mentality rather than the &quot;lets go camp a Widget of Uberness for This-or-That Friend&quot;.

I know, I have heard all about it. My entire guild is practically trying to cure my LD for me lol. They told me all about that technical stuff, and although all their solutions sound plausible, I have no idea to go abgout doing it. I think the real reason why I go link dead is because I use a router. THe knowledge base on the eq website even says that they do not use router/wireless technology and they dont even do a thing to help those who go LD with router technolgy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the game is more stable. Yes, there is a heap more content.<br />
<br />
But<br />
<br />
There is no longer any risk. The game used to scare me. A quest used to ba a Quest. you used to have to plan on how to get to someplace you had only a vague idea of where it was, and deal with stuff you had never seen before. I remember doing the Totemic Quests and having to find Dagnor's Cauldron, and that, in itself, was an achievement. The Dwarves and Elves that I met had mostly never even seen a Barbarian before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Haakim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Better in hundreds of ways. There have been so many small advances since the old days, too many to count really. Yes, eq is easier now...but it wasn't ever that hard. I never lost a corpse, not even close. I just wasted time on CR's. Hard = Timesink. Sorry, i can do without most of that crap. The holy grail of these games should be Fun = Timesink. The tedious bits should take little time, the fun parts more. EQ has moved towards this to some degree. Gates was a step backward, go figure. <br />
<br />
So, its better. That doesn't mean after 5 years I don't get bored of it all. Or that there aren't significant problems. I think a lot of the folks who say its worse are just tired of it, and why not after playing so long? That isn't a bad thing. The fact that so many have played this game so long is telling. If it hasn't gotten any better why would we be here? I mean, if nothing had changed, can you imagine how crowded lower guk would be right now?<br />
