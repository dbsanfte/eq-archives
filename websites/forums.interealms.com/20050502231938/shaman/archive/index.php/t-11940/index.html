<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friend of mine (lvl65 shaman) and I (lvl64 shaman) are a bit bored... more like burned of our class at the moment...<br />
<br />
We are thinking on making alts, something to duo with... need suggestions  :D <br />
<br />
currently thinking on necro/necro, necro/druid, necro/mage, mage/mage ... none of us are to keen on pure fighters (war/monk/rog) ... no spells just, well... boring  :o <br />
<br />
 :p Thanks!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I can say is that you should have one Mage somewhere in that duo. Their Pets can tank well, and pet + their nukes = some really mean DPS. I made a mage alt and have had a blast with her so far, and her pets cant even dual wield yet.<br />
<br />
From there, 2 mages would be great, but you also might want a druid to heal the pet and snare, etc., and a necro could also snare and add dps. So its really up to preference after Mage.<br />
<br />
But thats just my suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've tried pure casters, and other than a shaman, I just can't dig 'em.  Maybe the druid burned me out, but something did.  I love hybrids, though, so that's what my recommendation would be.  Bst/Bard, Bst/Pal, Bst/Pal, Sk/Bard, Bard/Ranger.<br />
<br />
I would go atleast one plate class (Pal, SK, Bard) to &quot;tank&quot;, and the other (Bard/Bst/Ranger) for damage output and small heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On a side note, a pally/ench combo is far more capable than many people realise, especially later on once Pally heals get up to par.  One of our pallys 2 boxes an ench and he can quite happily take out PoV stuff himself for good xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say druid/mage would  be a very good combination.  You would gain root, snare, harmony, travel, evac, and reasonably strong buffs, dire charm, charm, AND good dots/nukes from the druid in addition to the sheer power of the mage (pet, nukes, summoned focus items, and more).  <br />
<br />
There isn't really a downside to that combination except the lack of a rez when it all goes bad.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say druids look kind of neat these days with animal charm and all.  A friend of mine plays a druid alt once in a while and has a blast with charm.  I tried a mage out, they are fun but I didn't like not being able to take very many hits and being so reliant on mana, I can't take medding after playing a shaman so long.   I eventually rolled up a beastlord as my alt because I had a lot of monk gear left over from various monk alts I had when I was trying stuff out.  I am having fun with it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After 70 levels of cannibalize, I don't really have the patience to play a caster. The only one I could probably deal with would be necro...maybe.<br />
I also have the problem of trying to canni when I play alts...I tend to leave that hotbotton empty so I don't do something that might be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
(62 shaman and 2 level 40 shaman = 70 levels of canni).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd recommend a necro if you're bored with your Shaman.  I've been enjoying mine.  They get some of the coolest spells there are.  If not a necro, try a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necro/Mage would be a good combo. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go Necro/mage all the way!<br />
<br />
Ever seen feared necro and mage kiting? Its a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Technically speaking especially if your thinking about the future.<br />
<br />
Go with necro/necro.  The two necros combined pets damage is not too far off from a mages pet.  Plus Necro pets proc don't ever get resist.  You both have easily 5 dot that will stack on each other that don't brake root this is extremely nice.<br />
<br />
You don't fully loose the ability to slow between the both of you.  If you miss it.<br />
<br />
You both will have Insane amounts of utility and escape abilities.<br />
<br />
You both as necros will have amazing mana effeicent types of heals for your pets.<br />
<br />
DS from a mage means nothing if you two are fear kiting.<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration start VERY VERY early for necros where the begining mage will have to play catch up until the end.<br />
<br />
Lastly, and this is the BIG ONE.  Think what the duo team of necros can do in a plane like CoD.  <br />
<br />
Hell, even PoN complements necros with a dire charmable banshees.  Basically, lots of places to charm.<br />
<br />
I say go with the necro/necro team it is by far the most fun and safest plus you both get to experience first hand HOW they rival us when it comes to soloing and power.<br />
<br />
I am not saying mages are not good but they are a bit when it comes 'extreme' limitations in utility and escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We went with Necro/Necro combo :D<br />
<br />
So far we're kicking ass. Thanks for the imput all :D</div></div><hr />
