Good luck with your quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No clue where it spawns.  Three golems:  Fright, Dread, and Terror.  When you kill them (not easy fights), the Iksar Broodling can spawn.  He is the guy you need.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 Iksar Broodling/Child per Golem - he spawns after the death of two of the Golems - Fright and Terror - but the child will spawn after each of those two is slain....I BELIEVE 100% of the time - at least - I've never seen one NOT spawn when those two golems are dropped. <br />
<br />
FRIGHT'S TEMPLE: approx +250, -400<br />
<br />
TERROR'S TEMPLE: approx -600, -1300<br />
<br />
I am not POSITIVE on the locations - pulled them from a map of Fear - so don't be surprised if they're off a bit - I make no guarantee's of it's accuracy since I did not make the map.<br />
<br />
Oh -a nd I BELIEVE the golems are on a 3 day spawn cycle<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, catching the golems up (and if possible CT not up to reduce chain aggro) is the big trick. My suggestion - keep checking who's in fear (/ all cleric 60 65 works well), then ask them if they killed the golems.  Three days later the golems will be back up, and you can lead your friends there.<br />
Fright does not have an AoE, but does have a DT on a 45 sec reclyle.  This, and his screwy pathing, makes him tough to pull.  We usually send in a sacrifice (the shaman that wants the tear) and then pull him to a group along the south wall.  Just have at least 3 MT to take him down, they will most likely die due to the deathtouch (so I usually get the 3rd for slowing him).<br />
Terror can be treated like a dragon with an AoE, its cold based and I haven't resisted it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But gnomes make such a better sacrafice then a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As someone has already said, they are called Fright Dread and Terror. My own tear was spawned off of Fright.<br />
<br />
Another good thing to do is listen for guilds who are trying to kill CT, as they need to completely clear fear to do so. I heard one very high level guild was doing so, and they let me tag along for the tear. <br />
<br />
When our enchanter needed the Wraith of the Shisskar, a rare spawn in Fear, he parked a ranger friend up there for a few days. The ranger did bite the dust, but was able to run in, check things, run out a few times. Which helped in getting everyone there and ready when the Wraith was up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fear and Terror both sound quite nasty - is one noticeably easier than the other?<br />
<br />
My guild consists of about 3 or 4 groups lvl 50-60 including 3 clerics, 2 enchanters, 60 monk, 60 War, 57 Pally, a host of lower 50s tanks and a range of others (lots of bst for dmg output but not much in the way of wizards or rogues). Resists are therefore not all that good coz we're not talking many 60+ chars here, so my initial thoughts are that Fear with his DT maybe better as we have a fair number of tanks. I could probably get a 60SK to come along too.<br />
<br />
Which would you suggest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your main problem is you have a chance, say 60% of getting the child to spawn.<br />
<br />
So if you kill Fright, you are not guaranteed on an iskar child. So you may need to kill both Fright and Terror to get it... I heard rumors that Dread doesn't spawn the child, but that may just be rumors. <br />
<br />
I personally wasn't even in the raid force that took out fright and dread, so I can't give you any strategy advice.</div></div><hr />
