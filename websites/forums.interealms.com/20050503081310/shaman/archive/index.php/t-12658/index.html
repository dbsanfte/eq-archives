<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JadedGamer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to help a friend that just recently came back to EQ get up to speed with the rest of us. (We are all currently 65)<br />
<br />
In your opinion please list what three classes you feel a 65 shaman could plevel to 60 the fastest. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any melee or hybrid, in the order of how much dps they put out. <br />

I would list that, but I don't feel like every jack and jill know-it-all turing this thread into yet another *(this class does more dps, I parced it* cluster***. <br />

Lol thanks, thats pretty much what I was figuring. I'm not interested in DPS. Just interested in what class I can get there in the least amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Monk, rogue, ranger.  Probably the fastest 3, in no particular order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monk, rogue, ranger.  Probably the fastest 3, in no particular order.<br />
<br />
You have them in order of best melee damage face to face whether you ment it or not ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warrior is a good choice also. Just buff them and let 'em beat on stuff. I really didnt even have to slow mobs much until around the 40's when I was leveling my warrior. With regrowth and slow, didnt have to heal very much either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pre Charm nerf enchanters leveled pretty quick to but I'm not sure how it would go now. however I know I took a ench 1-25 my first day in about 5 hours and then 25-40 in the next 3 days of maybe 30 hours or so. <br />
<br />
Charmet pet (malosi line makes it so easy to charm a red pet at low levels) with focus, replenishment, and haste will flat out rip through any mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For pure speed, Halfling Rogue would be fastest.  Then Halfling Warrior, then Human Monk.  Hybrids are a bit slower due to exp penalty if you're going to keep them solo and the fact that they have to med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've also thought leveling a mage or necro wouldnt be a lot harder than a pure tank, because you could just buff their pet like it was a tank and they slaughter stuff with pet. Pets/npcs arent restricted by the level requirement for spells, so you could put your highest level buffs on a low level mage/necro pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i would say monk warrior ranger, in that order , then SK pally , then rogue.<br />
<br />
Basicly the best power leveler in the game is the druid. She can heal and buff and Damage shield. Now you can heal and buff well but there is not DS  handing out free damage regarless of what the person is putting out. Nukes get interupted very easy for the first 30 levels or so, so what you need is high DPS based off melee skills.  Probly the most fun of the top dps melee classes is the ranger and the monk if you ask me. And the good thing is that bolth are not 100 % crippled by being alone. Warrior need a partner for most of his life or he is on the side line. Pally and SK can solo much much better too and have spells to boost up the DSP their melee is lacking and in some cases add utility ( stuns and snares). <br />
 <br />
Anyway , hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i got a gnome paladin to 51 in three days using only my 65 shaman. rl days, not /played. im sure any of the damage dealing melee would be faster though. get a jeldorin, and a nice two hander for 50+ and run the paladin. pl 1-9 in FoB, 10-20 in paludal, the right to hhk till 55 or so. guards till 35-36 then start on the noble camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A level 65 shaman can level a mage faster than any melee to 60, unless you severely twink the melee, but that would require alot of planning.<br />
<br />
Unslowed mobs on a buffed/hasted/FA mage fire pet works wonders into the low 50's. The reasons why are...Pets don't follow PC level buff rules, so Focus, FA, 60% haste, Q, etc. all land on a level 4 mage pet. Fire pets DS = level of pet + 1. Bingo...big damage.<br />
<br />
Mage pulls with Burst of Flame for full XP, and works on casting skills while pet and DS kill the mob, rinse and repeat. Nuke at will. Move on. This scenario is also equipment independent. KEI optional too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People keep forgetting beastlords.  At high levels, they do damage between monk and rogue, and can solo their whole lives (pre 60 easily, post 60 is a little harder).  Like monk, ranger, warrior, paladin, you'll be PLing them in exactly the same manner that they solo, standing toe to toe, so no efficiency lost there.<br />
<br />
Of course, beastlord abilities have slightly more overlap with shaman than most other melee, but they still have utility (2 off-tanks in one person, mana/hp regen buff, atk/hp buff), not to mention the kickass damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just a F.Y.I, there are no class penalties anymore. I loved it when they did away with the class exp. hit......I got to 60 during the days of class penalties.....the slowest being Troll/Iksar SKs...right behind that was Troll/Iksar shaman bleh haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would say halfling rogue simply becuas melee=faster leveling than casters w/o pet and halflings have 5% exp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would say it would be rather difficult for us to PL a rogue... well not difficult but more time consuming than the other melees simply trying to keep that Backstab up.</div></div><hr />

Have the shaman do the tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you mean race or just class penalties i have never heard they changed it ??? at all either way what source did yu here it from and were ?? please  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">a lvl 65 warrior can PL a rogue pretty well :)<br />
<br />
Shaman do quite well on any mellee and pet class; wizards, druids, and clerics are a pita for a shaman to PL.  So I say forget all else and let the friend pick between the mellee classes and the pet classes, all fairly equal depending on technique.</div></div><hr />

Gee, good thing hybrids haven't had an experience penalty for over 2 years now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It was announced awhile back via patch message. Race is the only factor in how much of an exp. penalty you'll encounter :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">oh yes ok doh i remeber now it was the hybrid classes that were effected the most by this,  thanks evel for the memory jog :)</div></div><hr />
