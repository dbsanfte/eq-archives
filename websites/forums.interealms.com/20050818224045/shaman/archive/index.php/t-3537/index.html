<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thank you all for making this latest fundraiser a wonderful success!<br />
<br />
I just cleared 1950 in Paypal donations and the checks that came in added up to a little over 350 dollars, so with a few last minute donations, I should be able to buy the ColdFusion MX server that I need!<br />
<br />
We reached this total in just under three weeks, making this one of the best fundraising drives yet. I can't thank you all enough for contributing and helping this place remain free and uncluttered from advertising.<br />
<br />
To those of you who donated, as soon as I upgrade to the newest version of vBulletin, I'll be sure to add everyone as a contributor who donated so you can be recognized for keeping us going. There will be a few other perks for donors as well that I'll be phasing in. Anything I can do to show my appreciation, I'll try. Soon, I'll also tally up how many donors we had and in the spirit of competition break it down into Shammies and Rangers to see who did what :)<br />
<br />
Again, thank you all for making it easy to keep this place going. It's indeed an honor and a pleasure to have these two sites and I hope you all will continue to keep making this place as great as it is!<br />
<br />
In gratitude,<br />
