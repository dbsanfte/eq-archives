<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coheed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and my monk friend both dinged 52 last night and we have been trying to think up a good strategy for  duoing nag... i know it has been done before by a monk shaman combo.. but all we can think up as far as fighting is getting buffed in Pok with virtue, fo7,KEI, haste, resists.. ect.<br />
<br />
our plan is basically to have monk start fighting, i maloise and slow and then heal.. anyone know if nag is slowable and how his resists are? <br />
<br />
any info would be great. thanks = )<br />

<br />
1) Nagafen isn't slowable regarding the spells available under 52<br />
<br />
2) Expect to be completletely debuffed within a minute<br />
<br />
3) you need heavy twink gear to be able to tank and do meaningful damage to naggy<br />
<br />
4) you cannot duo him without being able to deal with points 1) 2) and 3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A monk on my server used to (or maybe still does /shrug) solo naggy and vox.  Thread is here: http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm24.showMessage?topicID=26.topic<br />
<br />
As I recall, somewhere way in there he discusses tactics.  I believe he used bladestoppers, stinging wort potions, and something else which I can't remember atm.  Obviously get full raid buffs as you mentioned, too.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that Naggy is flagged as unslowable, but I don't think I've ever heard of anyone actually slowing him, either.  So basically, I'd say assume you'll be fighting him unslowed.<br />
<br />
Would definitely be a huge challenge for a couple of 52's that weren't twinked out the wazoo.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've slowed vox before, but failed on naggy.  I ended up slowing him around 60% into the fight, when he was standing over top of me.  Was pretty awesome, but it was before the time that i knew how to keep a log of it, or how to turn off melee messages, so I lost it in the spam a few secs after it happened.<br />
<br />
It's possible to duo, however you would have to be pretty twinked up, and as such, us some form of outside help for the most part.  A monk twink in my guild used to do it using a chanter/cleric bot.. not sure if he just FD'd or what to lose agro on him while he runed and healed himself back up though.</div></div><hr />

it's exactly what they do. Even doable with only a shaman healing. Hits, FD, heal, rinse, repeat. Total sploits, dont get caught doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A monk in my guild used to solo Naggy to farm gear. Had a lot of AAs, though, and potions and what not. Google for 'monk solo naggy', there's a video clip out there of another monk doing it, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, VERY twinked monks with a few AA's use to solo naggy before the monk nerf.  I can't imagine any monk being able to do it anymore.  With a well played shaman though, I'm sure naggy can be duoed.  You do have to have some pretty twinked gear though.  Don't expect to be able to get by without 200k+ at least in bazaar tyep gear.  Probably quite a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Theoreticlly a melee'ing wizard could kill either of them, Just use DS's all the HP buffage you can stand and eight backpacks full of stinging wort potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wanedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The monk that soloed nag/vox used stinging wart potions b4 they nerfed unlimited potion drinking, now if you quaf somthing like 4-6 drinks it wont let you untill a cool down period is over. the monk was a twink of a former guildmate of mine on the vazzalle server tecknoe destrukto (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13186) his main char is quarken a high end warrior on the server, our guild has since broken up and everyone went thier seperate ways however the statment that it was before the monk nerf is completely false it happened right after promethian order killed solusk ro for the first time. we even put his exploits up on our frontpage which is still maintained even thought the guild is defunct (http://www.promethianorder.org/ topic: Lights! Camera! Dragon!) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We had a monk on our server who was soloing Vox and Naggy with regularity.  Prayers of life and Stinging Wart Potions are what let you heal up enough.  There's various right clickies you can get, including the epic, that will soak the dispells from the AEs.  This was WELL AFTER the monk nerf.  You need top end twink gear like AoW legs, White Dragon helm, Epic, Fungal Tunic, 36% haste item, Strength of the Elements, 9th/10th coldain ring, etc etc.<br />
