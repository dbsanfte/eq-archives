<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been working on a druid with 2nd box.  We have been working SF zone in OT - worked real nice but everything is getting blue.  Was thinking about trying FM zone in DL using same technique (beat em up and zone).<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions about this?  Other places possibly?<br />
Techniques??<br />
<br />
Any advice appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm doing this right now.  Mine is almost 39.  I am 52.  Here is what I do:<br />
<br />
Gorlas and the higher Gorlas (can't rememebr the name) in TD until 35  then she was high enough to group with me.  This is a good out of the way place with uncontested spawns.  We are bound on top of the firepot spires, so easy access too.<br />
<br />
Grouped with me in OOT on Seafuries.<br />
I go out and pull with Tugur's.  Hasted puppy attacks, I drop an E-Bolt and she DOTs.  She DS's me as I get aggro after the E-Bolt.  I simply tank, canni and JBB it to death.  She snares it when low and throws me a heal every now and then to keep from needing any downtime.  With this strategy, I have zero downtime, even when I have to stop and rebuff myself, I go out and pull as soon as I am buffed.<br />
<br />
I turned my exp to all AAXP so that she could catch up to me.  I've gotten almost 2 points so far.<br />
She gets 1% exp per kill, so 100 kills per level.  It takes about 1 hour to get 20%, so 1 hour per yellow bubble of exp, 5 hours per level.<br />
With gem drops and plat, I get 1.5-2k per level on her.  Plus the Sea Foam sells for 20pp per in the Bazaar and I get about 40 per level.<br />
<br />
All of this is with JBB and horse, no epic or fungi.  I am thinking of getting an Iksar chestplate with all of the plat that I am getting.  I have already used some of it to outfit her pretty well.<br />
<br />
This may not be the best or most efficient plan, but it is working for me.  She gets exp and I get plat.</div></div><hr />
