<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, things got off to a staggard start last night as at 7 CST at the LS ring, it was Calon, Griss, and Ciryon. (Lassha was not feeling well, so Bear's son, Ciryon got to join us). Got Overflow in from a quick trip and also Morgrym and Drognar and also Draganite and we continued to pick up regulars, including Bomar, Terackia and Nogglebok and it was a rough start as we were not very organized and the groups were changing around. <br />
<br />
By 8 CST we had gotten things settled down and proceded to have a wild time for 2 hours with Calon and Terackia making level. (Calon has 2 levels for clarity and Terackia 1 for sow). The Kobold was forced to part with a pair of boots and while we had one death, I think a good time was had overall and I continue to learn much about running a chanter in some wild situations. We are getting close to going to go see the king before as we were pulling from the entry ways.. Couple more weeks of Sol A and it will be time to move on. <br />
<br />
Sol A has been an interesting place for us, but it has been hard to get the groups in real close proximity to each other because the dungeon is pretty tight. We have been mixing and matching groups up to get the right mix in each group and things have been going pretty well.. This is an excellent opportunity for guild members to meet not only other members they may not normally see, but also petitioners interested in joining our guild. <br />
<br />
If you are interested in joining us, this goes pretty much every Wed night and the meeting place (for now) is the LS druid ring at 7 CST.. (Ss.. you need to work on Weezee's work schedule, we would enjoy her company.. :) )</div></div><hr />
