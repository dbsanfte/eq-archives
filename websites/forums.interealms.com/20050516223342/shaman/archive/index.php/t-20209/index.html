<br />
What is the crit rate for lvl 1, 2 and 3?  Any feedback is welcome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its ok, I always seem to crit my disease dots.  Or maybe i just notice those more.   Really doesnt feel like it was worth 30aa.  Then again compaired to the rest of our god AA, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I got your attention.<br />
<br />
Would you recommend Fury of Magic Mastery or Critical Affliction?<br />
<br />
Already got spell casting subtlety 3 and these god damned GoD AA skills are costing so many AAs that I need to so a bit of research...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just spent the AA's and got level 1 last nite.  So far I'm loving it.  Plan on going all the way.  I have a BA aug and so far top crit has been 982 for Bane, I'll break 1K yet!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't get a crit message for everyone to see either, you just sort of notice that your private DoT message # doubles.  The good news is I just saved a bunch on my car in--- err I meant the good news is that it counts Foci into the equation unlike crit nukes.  So if your focused Bane would hit for 525, itll double that to 1050.<br />
<br />
  Worth 30 AA's? Not really to me, but too late now QQ.  ALL GoD AA's are overpriced IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crit rate is about 3% per level. It's a so so skill. Not great, but not trash either. If you solo alot you might get alot more out of it, but Crit DD's are definately worth more IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">funny you say that Ceno, I seem to get most of my crits on my Bane/Blood hits.  I'm sitting at 30% to FoMM2 right now, and two nights ago I had a tremedous luck in a 6 sec period.  Had bane on the mob and cast our best rain.  Ended up critting all three rains for full hits (3900) total and had a crit bane for 1092 in the middle of that.  Of course, this is the first time that I've ever done that (have managed to crit all three rains once before though).  Anyways, is it worth it, yeah, it's a lot of AAs, but it's a pretty substantial overall dps upgrade.  But, I would only get it if you tend to use alot of dots.  By this, I mean if you plan on casting at least bane on almost every battle.  Otherwise, ifyou just cast VS or whatever, then go with the crit nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about, say, 9%?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">can somebody please explain to me the rational for why our dot crit aa isn't on the same scale as fury of magic in terms of cost and damage output?</div></div><hr />

Depends how ya like to play the game man.  In groups I always chain nuke so FoMM is very handy.  Yet lately I have spent full days &quot;/lfg on&quot; so I've just been soloing and crit dots helps a little with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How does crit affiliction effect Dot agro? Do we generate more agro from our dots when crit affilction kicks in or not? Since SCS doesn't seem to work with dots I am a bit nervous investing in crit affilction if its going to cause even more agro on my dots when it crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had 30aa banked for GoD.<br />
<br />
Bought crit affliction1, killed a few mobs at table, thought to myself 'what a waste of 5aa' then bought level3 to see if its any better. <br />
<br />
CritAff3 is pretty nifty, probably not worth 30aa unless your thinking about which resist to train next.<br />
<br />
Adds ~1-2 mobs to a cycle soloing in fire, goes off a fair bit when just using bane in groups etc. I never parse this stuff, just enjoy seeing the odd crit here and there.<br />
<br />
I'll probably do FOMM next after I finish subtlety3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wisey, i would say go for crit dot, even if it is expensive. <br />
<br />
1- DoT is versatile, you can use it for solo and groups / raids. Yes in GoD mobs drop fast usually, but if you can get a focused bane, you can nearly always get 3+ticks damage, that like 1,5k 2+k dmg around, wich is not bad. Even more when your dps have to afk, or are slacking you can see it easely ;) And look, it is more mana / dps efficient than 2 spear of torment 1,3k dmg without focus for 550 mana in 10sec around(anyway anger/fury of solusek is hard to find or ****ty slots for shamans). It is also better than that crappy Velium Strike wich need 10hours to cast, even with haste focus.<br />
<br />
2- DoT is high aggro, but if you get a good tank, you most of the time are right behind the MT aggro, in case he drop, better you than the cleric or the evacer. In any case, you should have SCS 3. And no, with SCS 3, you can still hold aggro whenever you want to (if you like beeing the rabbit in C2...)<br />
<br />
3- DoTing allow you to dmg the mob AND do something else like spoting the tank / cleric, looking / debuffing adds, scratching your head, etc...  :rolleyes: In GoD, mobs need to be burned out quickly because of the super high dps they have, most of the time you have to chain spot someone. This way, you can bring both dps and healing power at the same time, wich isnt crap to my eyes.<br />
<br />
Now like Ceno said, it is up to you, everyone has his own style of play, i just showed you how DoTs can be efficient for me. Remember as well, crit DoT maxed is 9%, Crit nuke maxed is 16% (7% spellcasting fury, 4,5 fury of magic, 4,5% fury of magic mastery), and allow you to land critical blast if you melee, but require you to chain cast / melee, focusing your attention to only 1 spot, that might be deadly if you see an add too late because of that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like Critical Affliction 3.  Just a day before GoD went live, I also got the BA 4 aug.  CA 3 is about 9%, BA4 averages to 10%.  Together, I am getting over 20% more bang out of dots on the down time solos.  Bane on the unslowable mobs in GoD are nice before I start chain patch healing.  SCS and Run 5 are the only other ones in GoD I would even consider until they fix the broken ones.<br />

Hi hun, crit dots are pretty nice, get a good BA4 item then you can do over 1K with bane pretty cool.<br />
hope all is well on Rodcet :-)</div></div><hr />
