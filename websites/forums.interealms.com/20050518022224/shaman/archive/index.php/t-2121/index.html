<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so i got a few new ring yesterday.  and i cant decide which of the two are best to where.  I have a regal band of the Bathezid (2nd chardok ring), shadel bandit ring and 9th coldain ring.  I am thinking that the chardok ring and 9th ring is probably the best combo.  Just curious what you guys all thing?<br />

<br />
<br />
Doesnt stack with regen? Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone have a loc on the camp in TT? I was looking for it the other day and couldn't find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't have the loc handy, but if you run straight out from where you zone in to TT from EJ, you will run in to the lake. When you hit the lake shore, turn right, and follow the shore. When you reach the right side of the lake, down the hill to your right are a set of ruins with anywhere from 8-10 mobs inside and around the edges, all either ghostly looking or skeletal. That's the spot. <br />
<br />
There are at least 3 named that appear in there, as well as a host of others. Any of them can drop the ring--it is not restricted to just the named. <br />
<br />
Important notes: though these guys appear to be undead, they are NOT--cleric and paladin vs undead spells and abilities do NOT work on them. And they attempt to flee when they get low in HP, which undead ordinarily don't do. They aggro from a long range, and you will often get multiples, but once the camp is broken, it is easy to manage it with a good group.<br />
<br />
A couple of other nice items drop, btw, at least nice for twinks, though not for shaman. Shield of the Risen Cultist, some sort of Sword of the Risen Cultist, Staff of the Risen Cultist (you get the idea).<br />
<br />
Hope that all helps.<br />

<br />
Are the cultist rings Lore?  I have heard they are NOT.<br />
<br />
PS - the cultists give negative VS faction hit so you can tank your OT faction here.  Just something to be aware of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Asta, Sorry it was a bit vague. Effect on 10th ring includes a regen and as it is triggered rather than worn the entire 10th ring effect is overwritten by spell regen - makes that group regen spell not such a good idea when you start having 10th ring wearers in your group.<br />
<br />
Im sure theres plently of shaman who don't use regens at 60 but still, it would be somewhat annoying to have your effect overwritten by other regen casters especially if you;re using the effect to preserve buffs. I dont intend to go past 9, theres friends who benefit more from the 10th effect than I would (if I can ever be bothered to get that far on the quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cultist rings are not lore and the camp is p900, p2500 on the west side of the lake the river from the Swamp runs into. Basically a little southwest of the chicken hut.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ring of the Shissar :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am wearing 2 cultist rings.  My ranger is wearing 2...my druid will be wearing 2 as soon as possible<br />
They are great...get as many as you canwhile you can.<br />
They were removed from the camp for a month or so and another patch is comming soon.  VI may take them out again.<br />
<br />
<br />
The drop can be 1 per hour or 1 every 5 hours...I have gone 12 hours with no drop, and I have seen 2 drop an hour...it varies.<br />
<br />
Last weekend, I spent 48 hours there and got 4 rings, plus one for everyone in the groups.<br />
<br />
Warning: I am a troll and I bank in the Overthere...this will screw faction...so if you have an alt or something...have them camp the place and camp out the shaman, then loot with the shaman if a ring drops.  That's how I did mine.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
These are the best rings for the effort and cost...gettem.</div></div><hr />
