<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to do the turn in to the Spirit in Emerald Jungle and then try to kill the Black Dire Wolf in Castle Mistmoore.  My questions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1)  Can I turn in the gem one day then go kill the Black Dire Wolf at a later date?  Or does the Black Dire Wolf spawn ONLY when you turn in the gem in EJ?<br />
2)  How big of a group and what levels are needed to kill the Black Dire Wolf?<br />
3)  If I try to kill the Black Dire Wolf and fail, do I have to start the entire epic quest over again?  Or can I just attempt to kill the BDW again at a later date without doing the gem turn in?<br />
<br />
Any hints on how to complete this part of the quest would be greatly appreciated as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The BD wolf spawn is not based on your gem turnin to the spirit.  The two are completely independent.  Go turn in the gem, kill the wolf whenever you can, then come back and give the BD pelt to the spirit.<br />
<br />
If the wolf is not up when you get to Mistmoore, go kill the Advisor.  This will cause him (and his buddies) to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) No. The gem does not spawn the wolf, the wolf is spawned via killing the Advisor inside the castle Mistmoore, or otherwise on a timed spawn.<br />
<br />
2) Group of 50's basically. Level 60 wizzy and cleric just nuked him to death for me :)<br />
<br />
3) No. If you fail, you just try him again, and again and again if need be until you kill him. You then hand in his fur for the boots</div></div><hr />
