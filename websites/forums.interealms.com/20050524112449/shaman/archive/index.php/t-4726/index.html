<br />
I'm usually up to par on who has what for an ability and how it works..but while in ST a couple of weeks back some wizard in the guild asked me if we had this. He didn't even have to tell me the function of the ability of course, and I was already wondering why we don't have it.<br />
<br />
For a set of classes that cast some very high-agro spells (cheals for clerics, slows for shamans, dysjunction for druids..for example), this should be something we should be able to work toward.<br />
<br />
What to you think?<br />

Not everyone will want this skill, some use aggro for ghetto CC. <br />
But then again, it's just one more skill to keep us exping . .<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I've got 49 AA's and still have so many skills I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pretty sure the skill is broken anyways.  wizard friend of mine said he did not train it cause it works the opposite of intended.  do not know if this is true, just what i have heard</div></div><hr />
