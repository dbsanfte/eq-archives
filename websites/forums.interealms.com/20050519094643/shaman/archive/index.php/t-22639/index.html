<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Posted this on the Priest's Covenant over on the Druid's Grove as well, in case anyone wonders about mention of other classes in here :)<br />
<br />
slows<br />
 - Refigure the Disease line to scale up to 60% at level 70, since that seems to be the workable minimum. Make it so that Disease slows are unmitigable, but leave the current resist checks.<br />
 - Adjust the resist rate on Tigir's Insects and make it a PBAoE rather than a targeted AoE. Unlimited targets might be a bit &quot;out there&quot;, but this is a REALLY unique spell, it needs to be usable.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
 - Adjust the Cripple line to, well, cripple mobs. Sucking away 85 points from a stat might make a gnoll pup pathetic, but it's not going to help against a Noc, Kyv, or even a Timeless Golem, fer crying out loud. Big debuff to AC (or perhaps make it an inverted damage sheild so that each melee hit does +10 damage or something. it adds up), and a noticable debuff to damage from the mob (Lower max damage by a %, thus while not slowing the mob, it does make &quot;spiking&quot; less common)<br />
 - Roll the Disease line into the Malo line.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control<br />
 - Some sort of Shaman stun. This could even be as simple as giving us Bash, or improving our pets' chance to stun on a bash / kick<br />
 - Perhaps some method of doing damage without breaking Mez? Fanciful, but what hte hell<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
 - For the low-level Shaman, just do away with Inner Fire and it's type 1 HP. Make it a straight 20 HP at level 1, up to 30 HP at level 10.<br />
 - Also for the low-level Shaman, a 50 Hitpoint Talisman buff at level 14. There is a LONG gap between Inner Fire and Tnarg<br />
 - Add + Attack to Strength, + Mitigation to Stamina, + Avoidance to Agility, + Accuracy to Dexterity, and maybe turn Charisma into a faction mod of some sort.<br />
 - Either get rid of our AC buffs or put them in with the Talisman buffs on a slot that would stack with cleric / Paladin AC buffs.<br />
 - Make Acumen do something. See Invisible + Ultravision is NOT a level 56 spell. give it Enduring Breath like the LoY enchanter spell, Leviathon Eyes.<br />
 - Perhaps add something to the Frenzy line. HP regen, mana regen, an Attack bonus, overhaste, I don't really care WHAT is added, but as nice as it is to max my str., it's not nice enough that I want to cast Voice of the Berserker (level 59, doesn't stack with focus line) even when all I had was Harnessing of Spirit (Level 49)<br />
 - Mingle the stat buffs. Single-casts SUCK, and everyone knows it. Make multi-stat group spells, as well<br />
 - Up the number given by ALL resist spells (that is, the Abjuration ones that follow the &quot;resist&quot; lines, not the Shielding or DMF lines) for all classes. Either that or add a third tier that adds +70 to a resist. So we would have, Endure Magic, Resist Magic, and Repell Magic<br />
 - Up the HP given by focus a bit, and add the + Attack / Accuracy bonuses for Strength and Dexterity<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
 - With pets zoning now, Innate SoW isn't too critical. However I do think that Spirit of the Howler, True Spirit, and the level 66 Snarling Spirit should have a movement increase attatched to them. Say Runspeed 3<br />
 - Innate Dual Wield for the level 49 - 66 pets<br />
 - A line of pet buffs starting at 34. Haste, Attack, AC, and HP. Give them actual durations.<br />
 - Pure aesthetics, but how about a variance of models? Say the level 34 and 39 spirits are willowisps (weakest), 44, 49, and 55 are &quot;ghost wolf&quot; (pretty good), while 61 and 66 have some other graphic. Perhaps spirit bears? Mages get four models + monster summoning, Necros get two models (used to get three), Beastlords get five, and Enchanters at least get variable weapons on their animations. All the Shaman races are pretty ugly, why not give us a little color / flavor?<br />
<br />
Nukes<br />
 - Make rain spells single-target, or make all three waves land on up to three targets. None of this &quot;splitting it&quot; BS. Fix the resist rates, they've been broken forever. Possibly add a Cold line like the Druid' Pogonip series<br />
 - Reduce the casting time on our cold and poison nukes. I don't need better efficiency, but I want to see my swirly blue sparkles and snowflakes (or dancing cobras) land while the mob is still standing, not after it's dead and looted.<br />
<br />
Dots<br />
 - Reconfigure all DoTs to the 30-second Bane timer. You can even keep the recast high (24 seconds). I'm not a fan of the &quot;reverse splurt&quot; idea, that would be some crazy aggro.<br />
 - Speaking of which, reduce the aggro given by poison counters. If you don't do it for Shaman, then please, do it for the Enchanters.<br />
 - Perhaps add a small snare component to disease DoTs. Not enough to really slow them down, but perhaps enough to keep them from running away. Another fanciful one.<br />
<br />
Melee<br />
 - All priests need melee upgrades. Give +25 Druis and Shaman Offense and weapon skills and +50 to Clerics' (leveling all three at 225 across the board), with an extra +25 for slashing for druids, +25 for shaman piercing, and +25 for both Cleric bash and 1hb. Allow all three classes to take advantage of main-hand damage bonus<br />
 - Allow Shaman to raise Bash to 100.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
In addition to what's already been argued...<br />
 - A level 24 HoT, call it something Shamany. 120 mana for four waves of 105 healing, same ratio as Stoicism, but make it decrease attack speed by 50% and root. And yes, make it a quest, perhaps a race-specific quest from your guild trainer once you're of high enough level.<br />
 - Drop Superior Healing down to 39 for Druids and Shaman, and 49 for Paladins. Lower Kragg's Mending by a few levels, perhaps to 54 or 55. it really DOES suck really bad.<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
 - Convert Canni 3, 4, ACP, Pained Memory, and Ancient Ancestral Calling to be passive abilities. The two ancients would have no illusion, while the normal spells would have bear form or ghost wolf, thus blocking horses. None would stack with the Clarity line, though they would mix with Pot9 and SD, like normal lich spells.<br />
<br />
Just plain stuff (Wishful thinking and misc.)<br />
 - Allow us to mass-summon food and water.<br />
 - Deity spells. One for each Shaman diety including Agnostic, they get it at level 50 via a quest, like prekunark hybrids. It can even be as difficult. It's actually not a bad idea for all priests.<br />
 - More plate graphic armor!<br />
 - Most classes have a spell that either sheds or adds aggro (DA, jolt, concussion, the visage line, etc). Shaman get a lot of aggro. Some AA that we can pop off to drop down a few notches would be really nice.<br />
 - An AA that extends the duration of our detrimental spells (Slow, root, cripple)<br />
 - Free Grobb!<br />
 - Make Bear Form a little more interesting. +5 Wis and +1 regen, followed by +10 wis and +2 regen is kinda crappy. Perhaps give it meaty resist bonuses to everything but Magic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One thing with buffs, in a sense both the player receiving and casting are penalized if the receiver already has maxxed STR, STA, et al.<br />
<br />
Well why not code it so that even if you have a 305 STA and somebody cast Boar on you - you get the HP's anyway?  Still have Boar take up a buff slot, but sheesh, don't penalize a player who worked to attain nice gear and don't penalize the Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some interesting ideas.  Some old ideas.  Some bad ideas.<br />
<br />
Beastlords get 1 model for pets, depending on race.  It's not like they can pick like a Mage or Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the scaling disease slows.  As for no mitigation... forget it.  Ain't gonna happen.  Would prefer Tigir's to be a true AoE instead of more like a rain spell with the 4 mob limit.<br />
<br />
Combining the Decay Line with Malo line... It's a hassle, but I don't see it happening.  I'm actually surprised the Malo spells reduce as many different resists as it does.<br />
<br />
Cripple really needs to debuff based on a percentage, scaling with level.<br />
<br />
Stun... doubtful we'll get it, and some shaman races do get slam/bash.  Sure, it sucks.  But they have it.<br />
<br />
Buffs... I agree with adding +strikethrough or other direct combat enhancements to our buffs.  The rest I could care less about.<br />
<br />
Maybe more later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What?!?!? I don't want a ****ty lich spell, I am not a necro. The one thing I DO like about canni is that there is no stacking problems. With can5 every time it pops it factors to like 35 mana or something, and I like lump sums instead.<br />
<br />
We are fine with canni5 and a can spell. It would be REALLY cool however, if they made a can aa that was 500hp 250 mana with a 20 second recast or something, and quick cast,a nice mini can, so we don't need to waste spell slots on canni, and we have a faster can aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
slows<br />
- Refigure the Disease line to scale up to 60% at level 70, since that seems to be the workable minimum. Make it so that Disease slows are unmitigable, but leave the current resist checks.A 60% disease slow would be nice, but it can't by pass mitigation<br />
- Adjust the resist rate on Tigir's Insects and make it a PBAoE rather than a targeted AoE. Unlimited targets might be a bit &quot;out there&quot;, but this is a REALLY unique spell, it needs to be usable.woot  :) <br />
<br />

But i do like the inverted damage shield idea<br />
- Roll the Disease line into the Malo line.Malos does enough already, and i like my quick cast dis debuff for when i really need VP to land.. <br />
<br />
Crowd Control<br />
- Some sort of Shaman stun. This could even be as simple as giving us Bash, or improving our pets' chance to stun on a bash / kicksounds good<br />
- Perhaps some method of doing damage without breaking Mez? Fanciful, but what hte hellum.... so a raid is now 2 chantters+umpteen million (52) shaman, so we mez/antimez nuke everything?  I can't see this happening, too easy to abuse<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
- For the low-level Shaman, just do away with Inner Fire and it's type 1 HP. Make it a straight 20 HP at level 1, up to 30 HP at level 10.<br />

all good idea<br />

- Innate Dual Wield for the level 49 - 66 petswtb!<br />
- A line of pet buffs starting at 34. Haste, Attack, AC, and HP. Give them actual durations.woot, less buffing for alpha<br />
- Pure aesthetics, but how about a variance of models? Say the level 34 and 39 spirits are willowisps (weakest), 44, 49, and 55 are &quot;ghost wolf&quot; (pretty good), while 61 and 66 have some other graphic. Perhaps spirit bears?

<br />
Dots<br />
- Reconfigure all DoTs to the 30-second Bane timer. You can even keep the recast high (24 seconds). I'm not a fan of the &quot;reverse splurt&quot; idea, that would be some crazy aggro.i don't think dots will be our damage for the future, at least not with what i've seen from gates, and this would either hurt the soloing sham, or make them too powerful (not that i'd mind the latter)<br />
- Speaking of which, reduce the aggro given by poison counters. If you don't do it for Shaman, then please, do it for the Enchanters.<br />
- Perhaps add a small snare component to disease DoTs. Not enough to really slow them down, but perhaps enough to keep them from running away. Another fanciful one.interesting idea<br />
<br />

Allow all three classes to take advantage of main-hand damage bonus<br />
- Allow Shaman to raise Bash to 100.<br />
sure, i'd like to be able to beat stuff w my stick better, it's always fun<br />
Healing<br />
In addition to what's already been argued...<br />
- A level 24 HoT, call it something Shamany. 120 mana for four waves of 105 healing, same ratio as Stoicism, but make it decrease attack speed by 50% and root. And yes, make it a quest, perhaps a race-specific quest from your guild trainer once you're of high enough level.good idea<br />
- Drop Superior Healing down to 39 for Druids and Shaman, and 49 for Paladins. Lower Kragg's Mending by a few levels, perhaps to 54 or 55. it really DOES suck really bad.i don't think that we need to really change the spell levels, it isn't that hard to level anymore, really<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
- Convert Canni 3, 4, ACP, Pained Memory, and Ancient Ancestral Calling to be passive abilities. The two ancients would have no illusion, while the normal spells would have bear form or ghost wolf, thus blocking horses. None would stack with the Clarity line, though they would mix with Pot9 and SD, like normal lich spells.i like the flavor that we have w canni (my arm tastes yummy!), and i'd rather not have it take up a buff slot, because you know it would get compaired to lich, and because necro's had them first would be less mana regen that that, so no canni nerf!  But i would like to see them all changed to be in line w the newer ones, so that it's a larger chunk w an 18 sec or so recase.<br />
<br />
Just plain stuff (Wishful thinking and misc.)<br />
- Allow us to mass-summon food and water.WTB<br />
- Deity spells. One for each Shaman diety including Agnostic, they get it at level 50 via a quest, like prekunark hybrids. It can even be as difficult. It's actually not a bad idea for all priests.<br />
- More plate graphic armor!why, we are a chain class?!?<br />
- Most classes have a spell that either sheds or adds aggro (DA, jolt, concussion, the visage line, etc). Shaman get a lot of aggro. Some AA that we can pop off to drop down a few notches would be really nice.wtb less agro!<br />
- An AA that extends the duration of our detrimental spells (Slow, root, cripple)nice<br />
- Free Grobb!ehh those trolls deserved to be kicked out<br />
- Make Bear Form a little more interesting. +5 Wis and +1 regen, followed by +10 wis and +2 regen is kinda crappy. Perhaps give it meaty resist bonuses to everything but Magicremove rabid bear, and refund the AA's for it.  Then make a level 59 spell called rabbid bear.  THEN make a new AA to what rabbid bear *should* have been.  That would be nice imho.<br />
<br />
A note about slow mitigation.  The developers design the mobs to do a specific DPS post slow.  They then use this to calculate what the pre slow dps should be.  If mitigation does not exist, the mobs pre slowed would just be insaine.  Take for example a mob that does 400 dps post mostly successful tugurs (it's slowed 56%) pre slow it does 914 dps, w/o mitigation it would have to do 1600 dps.  <br />
<br />
Most of the things on here are very nice though!</div></div><hr />
