<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 42 Vah Shir Shaman. Doing some fighting in TM caves at the moment, and wanted to know if there were better strategies for taking down Geomancers (and casters in general) for a Shaman. Currently, I sic pet and alternate cold and poison nukes until dead. They just don't seem worth tanking due to the damage I end up taking from nukes. <br />
<br />
I have unbuffed MR at 35, FR at 28 I think. I do use MR and FR buffs, which helps alot, especially with the &quot;thunder&quot; knockback spell. I kill them okay, just wondering if there is a strategy I am missing here that would make this and other casters easier to take. If it matters, buffed AC is around 850, HP around 1100.<br />

<br />
For casters in general - send in your pet first, let him get it's attn.  After a bit of aggro has built up, land a DOT or a slow (usually a DOT is better).  When pet is down to less than 50% health, I will<br />
wade into melee - find a FAST weapon, something other than a 2hb and try to interrupt as many spells as possible...with dogdog on the back of the mob and you in the front you should be ok. <br />
<br />
Another bit - mobs can't cast while running, so have pet engage at a distance, then DoT, nuke, sit until the mob is mad enough to come running to you...if you have room to 'kite' a bit you can keep them from casting much.<br />
<br />
Specific info on the Geomancers - they are just a pain in the butt.  Crappy loot, more trouble than they are worth.  I would tag one with a DOT  and run back to my camp spot, he would usually cast once on me and then come running.  park dogdog far enough behind you so that he doesn't engage mob before he gets close to camp (to prevent adds).  Then wade into melee and try to do as much damage as possible as quickly as possible.  I would still use a Poison DOT over the nukes, the efficiency is much higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Casters I kill like I'm a druid. Root the mob, Dot it up, and go sit around a corner. they have low HP and die quick. works like a charm in seb :) at 50% health charge in and nuke it, break the root and it should be fleeing.</div></div><hr />

Why sit around the corner? I thought that most casters could see and cast right through walls? Some trick to this, or will any corner do?<br />
