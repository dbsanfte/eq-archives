<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to remove an augmentation from an item?<br />
How?<br />
I don't like the idea of making all my gear ND....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are help files in game to tell you how to do this.<br />
<br />
Take item, and NPC purchased solvent, put the two inside the same container you use to put the augment in in the first place, hit combines. Augment removed, augment destroyed.<br />
<br />
At present, you can only remove Type 1/2/3 augments. Types 4-8 are PERMENANT, unless the devs add in solvents to remove them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Augment is destroyed? That bites!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Price you pay.  The good news is that augments are pretty common.  Most Ive seen in one run through a dungeon was 5, all pretty good upgrades.  I was drooling over a +6 any slot aug that I wanted for my wizard alt, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Are you sure about this, I read &quot;slots&quot; to refer to the up to 3 augmentation slots.<br />
<br />
Thus you use a slot 1 solvent to remove whichever augmentation is slot 1 which could be of any type 1-8.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Went and dug up the helpfile, and it seems I did read it wrong, and solvents do remove augments by slot, not type.<br />
<br />
A relief, I guess :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Geez you guys confused me there for a while...<br />
<br />
OK the way I see it is that slots 1-3 have solvents available and can have their augments removed (but you dissolve the augment and lose it).  But at least the ND item becomes droppable again (if it was droppable in the first place).<br />
<br />
Any other slot (in particular slot 4 that many weapons seem to have) makes the item permanently ND once it is filled with an augment.<br />
<br />
I think this is a clever method SOE have developed to curb mudflation. Weapons will not be as readily available at the bazaar in the future (since they become ND when slot 4 is filled). So weapon prices will go up... (well most of them). I took the chance to go buy my 39 SK twink some uber droppable weapons (even though he cant use them yet). Of course I could be wrong (and will be if there are loads of decent weapons drops in LDoN).</div></div><hr />
