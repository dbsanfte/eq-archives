<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a tech support forum, but after going there and seeing that many people do not read it, I thought this would be the best place to get an answer.  I also used a descriptive subject so that those who would like to avoid it, can.<br />
<br />
My brother's computer hasn't worked will since installing Luclin.  He has a P3 800, 256RAM, and a newly installed 64 MB GeForce4.<br />
<br />
The problem is that in many zones, all of Luclin in particular, he can only see maybe 15 feet around him, and the rest gets &quot;fogged&quot; out.  He also gets a lot of graphics that pop-up on him suddenly.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have tried:<br />
Went to options in EQ and turned every memory intensive option off.  Installed new drivers for the graphics card.  Unistalled EQ and reinstalled EQ.<br />
<br />
All of these options either didn't work or only slightly improved his graphics.<br />
<br />
So any suggestions on what to do from here?  Maybe something in the .ini file needs to be changed?  Couldn't find much help in a google search.  Figured this would be the next place to post since there are some people much more tech savvy than me here.  Thanks for any help in advance, and once again, sorry for posting in the wrong forum.<br />

<br />
I'm sort of guessing it was always at the minimum when it didnt work, now it works and no one has changed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bingo!  That was it Baldaorm.  Thanks a lot for the help.<br />
