<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if anyone Has duoed the named Kobold right inside Sol C.  I have a Sk friend who would like the 2hs and I would like to grab the ring.<br />
<br />
Wondering since we can always try to get more people but then we would have to wait for a specific time to try him.  Otherwise the duo of us two could go at anytime. <br />
<br />
Named Mob:  Spiritmaster Heili (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12716)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have trioed him with 65/shm/rng/dru easily.  I could probably duo it, but I like having the druid to port out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have seen him duoed easily with 65bard ~100 AA and 60shaman.  The bard was well equipped, I think, but not elemental equipped.<br />
<br />
This was before lull nerf and bard pulled him to solb zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gave it a shot last night we where doing ok getting single or double mob pulls til the SK has a mob run back a bit and cause a chain pulling about 10 to us(wee corpse run).  We are going to try it again but going to bring in a cleric and beastlord with us this time for more healing/dps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link Jaidin I hadn't though to search for the ring name I had tried for Sol but it didn't return anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've gotten fairly deep into SolC with a ranger friend and his 60th cleric on the second box.<br />
It takes some smart pulling and quick work but you can get pretty deep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just did this again last night with a ranger. We walked in, did Heili and then killed Tybolg since he was in the neighborhood. I got a lot of resists on slow, but even then these guys don't hit all that hard anyway, there was never any danger.<br />
You do get two adds with Heili, so maybe root Heili and take down one of the adds first before he breaks, there's room in there to split them anyhow.<br />
G'luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have killed this guy 6 times this past weekend and he has dropped the 2handed sword everytime.  Are you guys sure he still drops the EE4 ring?<br />
<br />
Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ring is rare.. really rare.<br />
Took many visists to get mine. Luckily many people in my guild wanted the sword.</div></div><hr />
