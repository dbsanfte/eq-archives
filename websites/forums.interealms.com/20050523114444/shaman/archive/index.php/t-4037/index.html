<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ludane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what is should get next. my wis is only 135 ( 140 in bearform )<br />
<br />
 Keep in mind that i only have about 500pp. and only earn about 100pp per day camping cynthia in RM.<br />
 I would like armor that have a good graphic that goes well with my JB helm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not bad stuff, you've got a nice balance between ac/wis/hp going on there, wish I'd been that mindful at that level.<br />
<br />
Do you have Luclin? The Bazaar is a great place to pick up mid level items. If not you'll have to try and buy the traditional way.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for any Imbued Northman or Arctic Wyvern stuff especially if you can use the bazaar, you may find people selling off items they've made while raising their skill when they used to just sell it to vendors. Arctic Wyvern mask is a nice piece, the Imbued Northman earrings are nice, lots of other pieces, bracers, belts etc.<br />
<br />
For neck look for an Ivory Imbued Collar (not to be confused with the Imbued Northman pieces which are player made), semi rare drop in Chardok and a lovely neck item that wont need to be upgraded for ages. Not sure about your server but they're very cheap on mine. Shaman only item, don't pay more than a few hundred pp for one.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO you have pretty balanced gear.  I wouldn't stress over the WIS level.  You can take an upgrade in many slots, so just keep your eyes open and take what comes along.  Some stuff to watch for:<br />
<br />
JB boots and gloves are obvious choices and the click-buffs will help the mana situation a lot at lvl 45.    Should be buyable for around 350 in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings would be nice for a barb - AC3 WIS4, so you'd lose 15HP and gain 4WIS.  I bought one for 50p in the bazaar, but that was a steal.<br />
<br />
The polished bone bracer is probably due for an upgrade - maybe a Ry'gorr chain bracer for the AC.  <br />
<br />
Straw Spun Belt gains you 4 AC at the cost of a few HP; Flayed Turmoilskin Belt would be an awesome upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Howling Harpoon is a nice weapon upgrade with +WIS.<br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask would be super for the face and is not that expensive any more.  <br />
<br />
Black Alloy Medallion for the neck - better AC and good WIS as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lol, Seredith, you posted while I was composing mine, nice to see we reached the same conclusion about the balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at your level you can also finish epic up to the boots.  This will give you sow boots and the shield and sow give nice wis and some nice ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh Weissblau, great minds eh!<br />
<br />
At that level I was wearing banded legs and a Bloodstained Tunic. Of course that was before Velious and Iksar quest armour so I tell myself it wasnt my fault. (I was in a full set of plat wis jewelry tho /cringe)<br />
<br />
Oh and Ludane note the names of the earrings in Weiss' post, I got them wrong - softkin stuff /nod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was wearing banded legs until I got my totemic legs, which was just about at that level.  I just got rid of the totemic in favor of Jarsath Leggings the other night, woot!<br />
<br />
I think I was wearing Totemic BP at 35 or so... pretty sure, anyway.  I got a lot of mileage out of the totemic armor, I quested a full set except the legs that an higher-level shaman friend of mine gifted me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent 2 days in Dawnshroud hunting tribal's for acrylia, and the money I made allowed me to upgrade a ton of my equipment.  My suggestion is search using the new UI for equipment that you can use.  Then compare the prices between all the traders.<br />
<br />
I was able to pick up a Flayed Turmoilskin belt for 700pp.  Crystal Chitin Gauntlets for 1k, Imbued Ivory earrings for 100pp. <br />
<br />
But the others had the exact same ideas I did...the Northman imbued stuff is pretty nice stuff, and very affordable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow..my grammar is slipping something fierce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If its wis your after get some Chipped Bone Bracelets off Owwomp +5 wis each (with ac) and affliction efficiency 2 (less mana used on DoTs) really nice at your level</div></div><hr />
