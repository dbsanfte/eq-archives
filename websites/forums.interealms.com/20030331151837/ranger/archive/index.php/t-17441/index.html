<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SolidHead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They SUCK, even worse then what we had to go through in Halls of Testing. Out of 36 elemental molds that my guild got, 2 were chain. Yep, that's 5% drop rate for chain armor in the elements. Anyone else experiencing the same problems or maybe I'm just having bad luck. I can't belive that VI in right mind would ever set drop rate to 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop worrying about armor drops and farm some bow items so, we all can get em :0<br />
<br />
Aye does sound like verant is screwing chain class, saw post on foh boards expressing the same thing. Not like chain class's had a huge ammount of choice since HoT.<br />
Make vindi bp chain usable and ill be happy, god knows they gave a crap bp on statue should have had chain version on vindi imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it's no where near as low as 5% for us. Probably around 15. Though, it depends a lot on what mobs you farm too. Certain mobs seem to only drop certain items.<br />
<br />
Hydrotha in Water can drop Chain sleeves (he can drop all sleeves, actually).<br />
<br />
Avart of Dust in Air - Chain helm. Avatar of Wind (think it's wind) - Chain Bracer.<br />
<br />
In Earth - Boss of the Vine people event (tainted rock beasts) drops chain boots.<br />
<br />
In fire - Quavonis Firetail can drop chain arms. Arch Mage Yozzani can drop bracer. General Reparm can drop gloves.<br />
<br />
I have, a Bracer, Helm, Gloves, and Arms now myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are those elemental amor things hard to make (skill wise)? Do you need any trade skills to make em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought Elemental armor didn't need any skills...I hope not. -.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its crap in my opinion, we have seen so much plate and silk drop it isn't even funny.  <br />
<br />
Its just getting old to slain 10 mobs and see 1 chain drop, if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How the rune drops guys, you know you wanna help a fellow ranger out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rune drops?  <br />
<br />
Have yer guild run the Fennin Ro event.  You'll get yer fair share.  <br />
<br />
On top of that, most &quot;mini&quot; bosses and up drop at least one rune per kill in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Fandros</div></div><hr />

It will be a long time before I see an elemental mold but from reading message boards I have learned a little about them. The new armor molds from PoP do require tradeskilled pieces but they can be purchased from GM smiths and tailors. The forge for the final combine is purchased from the quest NPC in PoT after you get the right flags (for 500pp I think) and the final combine is no fail.<br />
<br />
Not one hundred percent positive this is correct but I think that is the general gist of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kruull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think we are at 1 chain (arms) 22 plate and 18 silk so far. <br />
<br />
We also get a ton of those pal/sk weapons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, if I ever get the molds then I can easily find a tradeskiller. Glad that the final combine is no fail. :)<br />
<br />
-edit- fixed a typo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Riudi Oaknoggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I got my ornate chain (Planestriders Tunic) I purchased the etheral chain rings from a vendor in the Bazaar, bought a Tannan Smithing hammer in PoK, and paid Bok Wharhammer in PoT 500 pp for the forge and with the forge I got the emblem that goes in it.  The forge he gives you is an actual forge, very small, very cool.  Put the emblem, chain rings and hammer in the forge and got my tunic and the hammer back.  :D  The final combine is indeed no fail.<br />
<br />
The ethearl rings cost me about 450 each (I did see them as low as 300 before I bought mine). <br />
<br />
One more thing - You must be flagged for a Tier 3 plane before Bok Wharhammer will give you the quest for planar armor.  You can get the ornate molds before you are flagged but until you are flagged there is no doing the quest.  When I was merited the ornate mold I still needed a tier 3 flag.  Carried that mold around for two weeks before I FINALLY got it done. :D  Elemental armor follows the same quest using the same npc and materials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">all i know is.. our monks are making out like bandits in leather..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bobpork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We're exactly the same, 5 active monks...all have at least 3 pieces each, some up to 6. Our 4 active druids are exactly the same, and our solitary beastlord is going crazy trying to decide wether she should take the elemental or stick with her other leather only armor (seaweed legs and exquisite cap etc). Our silk are doing rather well also, I think plate are slowly catching up as we had a good run this last 2 spawns, but how many chain? 3 total. 1 gloves, 1 bracer and 1 arms. This is from clearing every single named mob in fire about 6 times, every named mob in water 4 or so times, killing every named in air (excluding the avatars) 2 times or so + 1 of the avatars and a full sweep of plane of earth (obviously not including the gods there yet). 3 drops from about 75 or so total armor drops, not exactly stella drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SolidHead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, funny in a way how we get also gloves, armguards and bracer out of around 40 armor pieces. This is horribly unbalanced :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razumihin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">f leather</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">we just got chain boots off magmaton in fire so he can drop chain too for those keeping track of chain droppers :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: blazzax dropped a bracer too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arkanjil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Got me Bracer, boots, gloves in a period of 5 days. Chain drops were definately upped after last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Elodoron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not on Solusek Ro...cleared PoW and PoF except for the gods, parts of PoA and we got....0. Out of our 20 or so pieces we got 2 chain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SolidHead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They definately upped the drop rate a bit, we got legs of Fennin last night! Also a pair of boots of megatron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Definately coming a long way!  I was able to score those leggings, now i think most of our ranger/rogues have at least 1 piece.  Just hoping this trend continues.  So we can all get outfitted much like monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think it goes in cycles.<br />
<br />
For a while it was raining leather, then it was a fair amount of silk, then back to leather, then we had some plate, then more leather.<br />
<br />
Today, chain was the new leather... I expect that after a nice run of chain, it will go back to leather again and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fleire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The drops are pretty random it seems. However, mobs like Quavonis and Hydrotha can only seem to drop Sleeves while other elemental dropping mobs can drop nearly any type and any &quot;other&quot; (None BP/Leg/Sleeve and maybe Helm) slots, which in turn means bracers, gloves, boots.</div></div><hr />
