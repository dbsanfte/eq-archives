<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm really surprised I haven't seen any posts on this yet.  From what I've experienced, the group window does not update the other members hit points correctly.  It seems to be kinda random, but much more noticeable for about 5 min after you zone.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, what I'm experiencing is the group window does not update automatically for some players until you actually target them.  I, my second computer, and my friend have witnessed this, as well as hearing many people complain in the guild about not getting healed.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ya, hopefully fixed in tonights patch<br />
<br />
assuming there is a patch tonight, just a wild guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a patch tonight and I hope like hell that is fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's weird. I played for a couple hours right after the servers came up (late) the first time. Didn't notice anything of the sort. Is everybody getting this (aka am I blind) or could it be a custom UI thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed the same problem last night and I don't use a custom UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did see any probs with hp bars but the pathing in BoT sucked big time...mobs looked like they teleported into camp from miles away. Youve gotts lurrrve patch day :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah i noticed this and oh look another  big patch, hehe. I bet they make the ST, VT and VP keyes no drop again too (they where droppable on FV last night)<br />
<br />
Oh DING 100 Posts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahhhh apparently it was updates for the last person joining the group. Wouldn't have noticed that as it was the snare-bot.<br />
<br />
Wonder if anyone stuck a key on their baz mule last night with the plan of back-flagging it today :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seems like the casino has been taken away for the time being ... caused a LOT of systemwide zone crashes due to the number of people using it, according to the patch message I got today at around 11 a.m. EST. I got a raid of &quot;level 50 people&quot; stuck in Old Sebilis last night (nope, no &quot;Velious crap&quot;, just Kunark crap) when the zone crashed. I tried to log back, and it wouldn't let me even access the world server. No 1017 message or anything, and apparently a lot of people in my guild had the same problem. Tells were lagged terribly on Karana all night long, and the group window was doing some funky things with people's HP ... for example, I scared the hell out of my cleric ... hit Canni 5 and sucked my HP down to around 48% ... but on her window, it sucked me down to 2%. She freaked, poor thing, healed me, and *smacked me (ow) right there in 4R. (LMAO I'm known as &quot;the guy who canni's unconscious&quot;). Lots of people complaining about not being healed, etc. last night. Didn't have a chance to play, so I dunno if the problems are fixed, but I was able to log to the bazaar this morning post-patch with no troubles.</div></div><hr />
