<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mathilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I need ot ask a favor, I went LD last night during Fear CR, my DSL decided not to work for the rest of the night (well for an hr and a half @least until I got POed and crashed myself), therefore leaving my poor battered and bloody corpse at the feet of the mighty Cazic Thule without hope of seeing life during the CR. Soooo, I would like to know if anyone would be able to help me tomorrow do a CR, this will probably sux0r BIG time, and all I have to offer in return is my undying loyalty, (which you all have already, so its not much to offer :/) and buffs for life. I get off around 5pmish PST, so if any could assist me, Ill be on around 6:00pm PST. Cya tomorrow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mathilde, I feel your pain :(  One time I went LD 3 times during a CR in Hate, luckily I got back in time for the actualy recovery (meaning the recovery took a LONG time).  In fact, we started hate at 11, wiped at around 12, and I didn't get to my corpse until 4 AM.  This was a school night too &gt;_&lt; but I can stand sleeping with my corpse in such a place.  I'm very sorry this happened to you, and if you get a recovery team going, I think I will be free basically most of tomorrow so give me a tell for a little extra help.  I'm more than willing to offer my highest help.  Although I wouldn't be necessary :p  This is my suggestion:<br />
I think it would be best to spend the money on a coffin, because in times like this its basically what they are made for (expensive so people can't just go around and always summon their corpse with a necro) but this is dire.  Get a good necro, monk, (can necros invis?)inviser, and porter.  Have the monk clear the way to the zone wall, run you and necro there, summon corpse, loot (past rez time I'm assuming) and evac/port out.  You might want a cleric just in case anything goes bad, but have the monk fend off any mob that's walking towards you or something with FD.<br />
Or, we all could just raid Fear tomorrow.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yad, unfortunately with the nature of Fear (seems like an easy zone to raid, dont it) thats not how you can possibly do a CR... <br />
<br />
You need 2-4 well balanced groups to go in and &quot;Break&quot; fear, there are roughly 12-14 roamers that can agro HUGE amounts of monsters... <br />
<br />
Back in the sub 50 days.. a break gone bad was a horrible thing.. I mean really bad (people decayed over it)... <br />
<br />
Math, if Im online, and we have the forces to do it.. Id be happy to pull/lead a break... worst case we can take two groups and AE break it... :) thats always fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hasheyla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ouchie that really sucks Mathilde :( We cant have you running around all nekkid :( I should be able to be online around that time so just shoot me a tell and I'll be more than happy to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I&quot;m not for certain I'll be online around this time, but if I am I'll be happy to help...getting stuck in Fear isn't fun :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know, only been there once, after the monk cleared zone-in, only saw 1 or 2 mobs wandering around us, maybe we got lucky. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Math,<br />
<br />
I will look for you when I get on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fear on a full pop means fighting 4-6 mobs on west wall if things go well, 10-20 if not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I should be on around this time, and would be happy to help with a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I should be on around that time also so please let me know and I will be more than happy to go and help you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mathilde, did you ever get your body out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spoke briefly with Mathi last night on her alt, and at that point no, she hadn't gotten her body out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mathilde and everyone else;<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's make sure we get that corpse outta there tonight.  KoE isn't known for leaving anyone behind.<br />
<br />
I should be on around 8 CST.  A couple words in GU and I can be there quick.</div></div><hr />
