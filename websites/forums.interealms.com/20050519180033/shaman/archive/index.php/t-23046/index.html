I even went ot allas to check on this mob, Trooper Drix..and he isnt even listed, what kind of F-up nonsense is this..I have every spell you can have up to 62, the only thing I didnt have was HoV for me or dog dog..This mob, killed the fully buffed pet, a lvl 58 pet according to the crap that is spewed out by sony and then turned on me..He resisted everything with the exception of malo..How is that freaking possible in a greenie zone????  From a mob that isnt even listed..  Sony can kiss my white ASS!!!  IM sure tommorrow I will have calmed down, but for now, ...............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your not supposed to kill guards in newbie zones :O. so most of those NPC's are basicaly imune to players.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Iksar Newbie guards have always been the toughest guards since Kunark was released.  I can remember killing guards from most other home cities fairly easily on my warrior (lvl 60) not so long before Velious came out, but the Cabilis guards pasted me onto the ground in next to no time. If they've beefed up allthe guards since then, I shudder to think what sort of mincemeat the cabilis guards would make of a 62 shaman  :D</div></div><hr />

She's not really in much immediate danger from the mobs, she just can't kill them fast enough and ends up taking a LOT of damage.</div></div><hr />

She cant solo those Guards at the Tables in Fire? The red con ones that give 14% a pop? <br />
<br />
Heh, sometimes, we are a bit spoiled on that kind of stuff. I will admit its NICE to have that &quot;option&quot; to just go solo for 4-8% a mob somewhere. Not every class has that luxury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A new classic.  Not meaning to be deragatory, but how can you be level 62 and not know this?  I remember back in my early days of newbie hunting in Freeport and Misty Thicket, Bards and others (but I remember Bards doing it several times) would kill the guards and leave us newbies at the mercy of the mobs.  Having the guards as a security blanket for players learning their class is a good thing.  So I was glad to see them beefed up.<br />
<br />
It's just a death, get a rez and move along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This so reminds me of a couple of years back.<br />

So basically, you're qutting the game because you lost a pet?<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how many pets I've lost to just having a bard in the group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you found one mob that you couldnt solo;  Rest assured, there will be others.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and because you dont seem to know:<br />
<br />
Con is not a measure of relative difficulty of a mob, but ONLY a measure of experience recieved upon its death.  While blue con mobs are generally easier to kill than yellow cons, it does not ( and frequently IS not) have to be that way.  <br />
<br />
And if that doesnt help your pride, think about this.  In FoB, there are probably 200 mobs and NPC's wandering around.  Of that 200, there are probably 15 that you, at level 62, or even a level 65 could not kill.  So that leaves 185 mobs that you, at level 62, can kill  with absolutely zero difficulties.  So you can strut all you want, just watch out for those 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if you want to see some real fun, train the half-elf over by kaesora (yes, the green con) over to the cabilis guards.  <br />
<br />
last time i did that, the green con took down about 4 guards while being mobbed by about 8 total.  bring an invis pot if your kos, though, and zone in/zone out of cabilis just to clear aggro<br />
<br />
i also think the greenie is DC-able, and enchanters use him to solo the Tangarin for part of their epic.</div></div><hr />

Great post, btw.  <br />
<br />
You are to be commended for attempting a mob that you didn't know anything about...many people in EQ would just say &quot;nahh...I'm skeerd!&quot;  <br />
<br />
So you get an &quot;A&quot; for effort, but an &quot;F&quot; for judgment.  :)<br />

Dont you really really hate it when they do that.<br />
You see pet pop and you think *** then it suddenly hits you oh bard in group.<br />
It never seems to be just once they do,it they seem to have to do it 2 or 3 times.<br />

<br />
It took us almost 5 minutes.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This story reminds me of last night in the deep helpin a friend get his last inscribbable word from there.  I had this bright idea to just kill those elders otw to the imperceptible guy(shrink wand).  Should have seen the look on my face when I tried to pet pull and pet died in 2 rounds causing all of them to come anyways.  Then when I found out they weren't slowable.  Then when I found out they weren't rootable.  Then when I found out they hit 550.<br />
<br />
Well we did live (note I didn't say we won) and I just chalk it up to a learning experience.  Hey I wasn't concerned with slow and root status back in luclin when I played rogue!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Reminds me of the first time I was in Paineel (30ish), with a group of adventurous friend who decided to take the boat to Odus to go to Stonebrundt. (no books then, and we didn't want to bother the taxis) The Paladin saw all the undead in the newbie area and started going nuts.  Well when we couldn't take out one skeleton guard with a cleric, a warrior, a mage a shaman and a paladin (AND THE GUARD WAS GREEN!!!!)!, we went running to the zone like a bunch of rangers, and found Solace in the warrens, where we vindicated ourselves by taking out the mugglewump (for some mage fishing pole) and Krode (for my uber uber shawl).  Later we got mauled by pandas when we got to Stonebrundt and the CR was long, but I never forgot that stupid GREEN guard we couldn't kill.<br />
<br />
So you would think I would know better.<br />
<br />
Then...a couple weeks ago on my SK I decide I want to kill in Gutka.  I remember my Oggok bouncer killing days and assume I'll have no problems.  Not thinking I try a gaurd in the newbie grounds as a test (rather than zoning in)...Thankfully I had told the group to stay by book just in case.</div></div><hr />

Not only could I not land malos on the thing cause it ran so fast and kept interupting me. I couldnt land slow root or anything else. <br />

Also he seemed to have a 2 way or something cause the longer I dinked around with him the more dragoons kept adding on me =/</div></div><hr />

Humm ... Malos cant be resisted .. it should land on any mob ... even Goons in OT :)<br />
<br />
After I malos them I can land about 50% of the spells I cast on them .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">He's not a guard, he's a quest mob, which are notorious for being over-cons. The reason is probably to stop people killing them for xp.</div></div><hr />

Alright.. i'm better now.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the time a few months back when i was near the gnome city and decided to pull one of the guards.  Now.. not being one of the smartest people when it comes to being prepared, I grabbed a pet out and used malos to pull him.  Needless to say.. it was about 25 min later when my pet had finally chewed through the gnome did I finish.  by that time I had to refresh his haste like twice, and I was out like 200pp cause I begged a newbie to run to the store and buy me some rusty weapons to make the fight shorter.  Took me about 10 min to give the stupid pet the weapons (was before I had gotten the pet discs).</div></div><hr />

Malos is 'resistable' if you can't cast it.<br />
<br />
Great story, Rommel. Don't feel bad ... just a bit red in the face maybe for taking 62 levels to find this out.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, ok..Update, this is not conscidered a guard..He is a new mob placed there as part of some sort of epic quest event..He is listed under the GoD expansion mobs.  His name is Trooper Drix..Yes he runs as fast as sow speed.. He reminds me of Veltar....If you dont believe me, and didnt catch my sarcasim under the whole, Im sure I will calm down later, then here it is again...Im sure I will calm down later...Now being later, I have calmed down, and after researching the mob, I dont nearly feel as bad as I did last night.</div></div><hr />

lol..I whole heartedly agree..That zone has given me no amount of trouble..Last week I got a tell from a friend who said there was a giant gorilla in the zone on an island..I slipped over there to lend a hand and we buffed up, summoned pets..It was myself, and a 55 cleric and 58 BST..Just as I began to pull with a little malo, he happens to let it slip that its an epic mob...Doah!..well, it went badly, and Donkey Kong loves to summon...Lots..They brought in a chanter, who DC Pimble whats his name by Kasoras and used him to kill the bloody ape..<br />
     All in all last night was mostly a WTH time, exspecially when I went to allas and couldnt find the bugger listed there..Grrr...Anways, now that Ive calmed down, and realize how miffed I was last night, I am actually able to laugh.... He is a tough blighter..He hits hard, hits fast and must be Veltars cousin...Dont try to out run him with sow...He will only laugh as he kicks dirt in your face as you spend your last few moments curled up in the fetal position..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Speaking of Veltar, I downed him tonight after a brief PL'n session with a friends zerker.  He was pretty much cake at 65.  Only pain was the add's.  It's terribly hard to pull veltar anywhere out of the way, as he summons, constantly, and you just keep zipping back to him as you run.  In retrospect, I should have loaded a root spell for the add's.  If you have some ornate pants, you should be set.  VP also come's in very handy.  <br />
<br />
I have done that damn guard you speak of outside the Cabalis zone in as well.  I didn't solo him, but I was low 60's, and had a low 60's warrior with me.  I don't think I landed anything on him.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">One last time for those who for some simple reason havent grasped it....I know there are some killer mobs in FoB...Now, normally I dont mess with guards, maybe the Freeport corrupt ones, or HHK, but those are gravy...In FoB, Trooper Drix is a new toon...Not a static guard persay, he wanders about quite a bit, and is commonly found wandering near the tower.. He was introduced when GoD came out.. He cons blue, and yes, I know that con means nothing, infact Ive had brushes with several severly underconned mobs, including Lodie...and Eirod Haerod  in MM... I tried Drix, and got whooped, was peeved but now Im not.  Whatever your insinuating has no merit what so ever... I was merely suprised by the damge output of Drix, and the speed at which he runs..I havent been suprised like that since Veltar wandered into my group a long time ago in DL....</div></div><hr />
