Val, get a few levels and get to know some folks in the Syndicate.  Good people.  Play the game for the right reasons.  They are a very tight and well established guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Syndicate is more of a 60+ guild, they have very low standards in way of recruitment though, better off checking the tarew marr boards, and looking for guilds there.</div></div><hr />
