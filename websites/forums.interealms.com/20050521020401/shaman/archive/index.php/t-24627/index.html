Noone told me I couldnt disscuss the communication process so im assuming that I can do so . Its mainly a communication through a message board type thing on the EQLive boards . I feel like its a good system of communication . I generaly get a responce from Brenlo and friends rather quickly .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I still have the text.  See if you can get a confirm on this for me!  Old message pasted below.  As of now, it's been 5 weeks since I asked.  After 2 weeks, I got a response apologizing for the slow reponse, since many of the developers had been on vacation after release.  They're out of excuses now.<br />

&quot;Kytherea, sorry for the direct message. I had a question I haven't been able to find an answer for, and it's pretty much coding related.<br />
<br />
How exactly are the experience penalties applied? I know they don't apply to AA, but they do apply to regular exp. However, I don't know WHEN the penalties are applied. It's easy to understand if the player goes 100% regular exp or 100% AA, but it's when the exp is split I have a question. Let me use an example: a hypothetical troll bard.<br />
<br />
Assumptions: 20% penalty, 10,000 exp for a mob kill, 90% AA experience, 10% regular experience<br />
<br />
1) If penalty is applied first<br />
2000 penalty<br />
800 reg exp<br />
7200 AA exp<br />
<br />
2) if the penalty is applied last<br />
9000 reg exp<br />
200 penalty<br />
800 reg exp<br />
<br />
There is an potential experience 'bleed' of 18%. Similarly, how does it work with leadership exp on? Will a racial exp penalty ever hit the leadership experience pool?<br />
<br />
This has been bugging me for a while! Thanks very much if you can help!<br />

From lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=5935&amp;source=Test):<br />
Changed Slot 8 from &quot;Increase STR by 30&quot; to &quot;Increase STR by 90&quot;<br />

<br />
Glad to see they took care of that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I originally posted this in another of your update threads and I'm afraid it might have gotten lost, so I am posting it again.  Hope that's ok.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I feel these changes are enough. Im just saying I feel its wrong to dismiss them completely. There have been changes in the last six months ...<br />
<br />
Grim I have a request to make.<br />
<br />
There are two points that I have never seen developers talk about in any meaningful way. If your conversation is going well with them, as it seems to be, it would be quite helpful for me, and I expect for others, if you could get us some feedback on this.<br />
<br />
1. Maintaining shaman healing ability as a constant percentage of cleric healing ability, because of the shaman's ability to slow. Shaman can heal for about half the total amount of hp healed as a cleric, in most situations (various math demonstrations put it at 47%). If game developers have written any posts defending this proportion, I have never seen it; but there is a fair amount of data out there that suggests this was fairly workable, in the kunark and velious eras, on fully-slowable mobs. In Planes then in Gates and now especially in Omens, more and more mobs mitigate slow. So slow is no longer as much of a factor as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Question 1: In the developers' minds, what is the reason for continuing to use this ratio based on unmitigated slows, as the game adds in more and more mitigation?<br />
<br />
2. Maintaining shaman healing ability as a constant percentage of cleric healing ability, instead of as a constant difference from cleric healing ability. When raw numbers increase, maintaining a constant percentage does not maintain the status quo: it means that the difference between the two gets larger and larger.<br />
<br />
[a] Suppose a cleric can heal for 2000 and a shaman can heal for 1000. Because mobs hit you for actual hp rather than for percentages, the important point is not that the shaman can heal for half as much as the cleric; instead, it is that the shaman heals for 1000 less than the cleric.<br />
<br />
[b] If a cleric can heal for 4000 and a shaman can heal for 2000, the ratio may be the same, but the difference in healing is now 2000 hp. There are many more situations where the damage caused by the mob will fall into that 2000 hp gap, and the tank will die.<br />
<br />
[c] If a cleric can heal for 6000 and a shaman can heal for 3000, the difference in healing has become huge: 3000 hp. There are vastly more situations where that 3000 hp gap will mean a dead tank.<br />
<br />
A 1000 hp disparity in healing power is a real disparity: it means that in a given situation it won't be as easy for shamans to heal -- but they will usually still be able to get the job done. In contrast, a 3000 hp disparity is immense: there will be lots of healing situations where they won't be able to get the job done, the tank will die and the group will be wiped.<br />
<br />
Question 2: In the developers' minds, what is the reason for maintaining a constant percentage instead of a constant difference between shaman healing and cleric healing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your hard work, Grim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What spirit of might/sense stacking issues you refering to?  Do you mean the ones where you lose the buff once certain classes disc (like warr fortitude which removes sense, or rogues duelist which removes might?).<br />
<br />
I guess asking them for clarity on if the 4th mob in the shaman 2.0 epic part is working or if it's not in the game yet would be nice to know.  Aruman and I currently think that all epic 2.0s are not in the game yet, so therefore there is a missing part for all of them so that they cannot be finished at this time.</div></div><hr />

Rytan said that he would change our pets to innately dual wield. Also, the pet should have around 4200 hitpoints. He is also looking into stacking issues with spirit of might and champion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Understandable, but completely hypothetical and not as it is in game.<br />
<br />
There is a disparity in healing, but OoW has quite a few 'fixes' for the Shaman class. Yes, it bites that it took an expansion to resolve some issues, but TBH, I think the Shaman received quite a few nice updates to abilities and healing through AA and spells in this expansion.<br />
<br />
1. Yoppa's mending could use a little upgrade in healing amount, but not much<br />
2. Ice Age and Yoppa's Spear of Venom could use a tiny tweak<br />
3. The list from Fanfaire by Gloriana would take care of the rest of our issues. If what is in that list actually occurs, I think the Shaman would be pretty much fine as a class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
definitely don't have 4200 hps unbuffed right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Grimbear and/or Gloriana, please make sure Rytan looks into the issues with Vindictive Spirit. <br />
Currently, you can't have a PC targeted when casting this spell(not even yourself) or the spell won't cast. <br />
Unless your target is blank or you have an NPC targeted, the spell doesn't work. It's annoying as hell and not how PBAE spells are supposed to work.<br />
The same issue, I believe, leads to this spell not working in PvP. I have duelled a few people and every time I'd cast it, it would have NO effect. Neither do you get the recourse, nor is the other player slowed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone of you two found out about what the deal with the Tacvi weapon is btw? Will it be changed or will it stay the same? Especially in comparison with the effect on the Aged Hammer of Dragonborn this should be adressed, thanks.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Can anyone confirm with Rytan if Spirit Quickening stacks with other haste spells or Muzzle of Mardu? I am pretty sure it stacks with the first and not the latter(never been upgraded, only 20% haste, short duration are all good indications), but if it doesn't, why did we never receive an upgrade to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would just like to say that Grimbear and Gloriana are, in my opinion, doing a fantastic job. Thank you for your efforts. Keep up the splendid work.<br />
