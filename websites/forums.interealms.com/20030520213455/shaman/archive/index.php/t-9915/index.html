<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 48. Once I hit level 49, I want to prepare myself with equipment for Nagafen and Vox. I have been on one Nagafen raid which was a wipeout. With about 90 FR buffed, I took full 500 damage each tick. I was level 46. I also tried to slow Nagafen 3x before I died. A waste of time and mana, I later learned, because he is immune.<br />
<br />
What equipment do you recommend at level 49 which can be obtained by a single level 49 group, quested, or bought for under 1k to use for Nagafen?<br />
<br />
What resist number is required for Nagafen and for Vox to avoid Magic Attacks (You lose control of yourself) and AOE Fire/Cold (500 per tick)?<br />
<br />
What buffs and potions is it reasonable to cast or provide in pre-fight buffing room?<br />
<br />
What debuffs, dots, and techniques should I use when called in to fight?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For your resists, get 2 Velium BD Bracers 500 each around? if u manage to get more money, velium diamond rings are nice too, can probably check out kunzar cloak, think ivory imbued collar runs cheap and has resists?<br />
<br />
As for your first try getting wiped out, you were probably too low level, and im guessing that you guys didnt have enough clerics or had bad coordination, remember the higher level everyone is the better chance you have to succeed (resist more)<br />
<br />
Its always nice if you can get a couple lvl 60+ buffers, to make things easier....<br />
<br />
At level 49, just try and get main tanks with HoS/resists, make sure everyone is crap buffed (he dispels first 4 i think), then put on resists/stat buffs whatever, HoS is really all u need and resists, maybe stamina, but everything is rather trivial... make sure sow is off, have everyone be walking... so u dont get too far if u get feared<br />
<br />
dont worry about debuffs/dots, most stuff wont land anyways, and on most naggy raids there is a lack of clerics, meaning you'll probably have to gimp heal to help out a bit<br />
<br />
if you can make the +fire resist potions then go ahead and bring those to distribute around, could get costly if you have a lot of people tho...<br />
<br />
main problems with naggy/vox raids are that no guild really raids them anymore so your down to pickup raids, which really blow in my opinion...<br />
<br />
most of the time youll just be healing though, not really anything else you can do after buffing.... IMO anyways... dont forget to go level though, you shouldnt be engaging naggy in most circumstances so more lvls = better buffs (52+), and you can just go for buffing/healing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would have over 100MR / 100 FR / 100 CR  when fighting either of those dragons at the very least.  This is before you put on any buffs. <br />
<br />
Typical resist gear is as follows:<br />
Golden Diamond Mask (optional)<br />
Velium Blue Diamond Bracer x2<br />
Velium Diamond Ring x2<br />
Electrum BD earring x2<br />
Froggy Crown (optional)<br />
<br />
Basically, when setting up you need to buff at least 4 crap buffs before you buff anything else.  And I do mean anything else.  If you have KEI click it off (hurts I know but you will lose it anyway).<br />
<br />
Once the craps are out of the way buff the main tank with your best buffs (Stamina, HoS). Let the druids cast Circle spells for more resists.  Buff everyone else with HoS EXCEPT casters, but you probably already knew that =p<br />
<br />
Potions ... not really necessary unless you want to make a DS potion for the main tank.<br />
<br />
Ok buffing is out of the way, now concentrate on your main task which will probably be patch healer.  Run in after the charge is called and start spamming heals on the MT.<br />
<br />
Move around the back of the dragon to avoid most of the AE - this works nicely with Vox not sure about Naggy but most likely will work with him also.  Keep spamming heals, don't worry about debuffing the mob.<br />
<br />
On a side note, for Vox it is almost necessary to have a few enchanters to mana drain her so she doesn't CH.  If you are in this group ignore the MT, heal the chanters.  Make sure they are also behind the dragon.<br />
<br />
Oh, one last thing, expect no loot!  Roll if asked but generally don't even worry about it, just have fun!  Take lots of screenshots when the dragon is dead =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great Info. So are these dragons melee only? No point in Malosi and Incapacitate? Thought latter might help melee damage land better.<br />
<br />
Base resists of 100 should be doable with the items you mentioned.<br />
<br />
I can certainly heal MT or chanters. <br />
<br />
With KEI and level 60 resist buffs, if I have 4 uneeded buffs on before I go in, no reason to click it off is there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shhh - don't say I told you this - It's all about the healing.   Lol.    Well plus a couple extra things.   On Vox ... Sieve the crap out of her with a Enc to drain her mana.    Both of these dragons melee is cone shaped ... so if you are to the side or behind her you don<br />
't get as much damage.    <br />
<br />
Resists ... try to get so higher level folks along to buff up your group ... even bring along some friendly lvl 60 plus folks.   Get some PoP buffs and it really helps on extra HP and regen.   Be sure to load up on Crap buffs first - at least 2 or 3 grp type buffs work like Grp Cha, Poison, Disease.    <br />
<br />
As for resist gear - SBS is a nice shield for you on both resists and normal usage.   Then get a stone of Morid for your range.   Blacken Alloy Coif for your helm.   Froggy Crown also is nice but may be more plat than you want to spend ... but the resists are so much better.   Gold Diamond mask, blue diamond rings, blue diamond earrings and white diamond necklace for resist gear.   <br />
<br />
Plus ... don't forget about the Ice Giant toes on way to Lady Vox.   On way to Lord Naggy ... look for the polished Mithril mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks. <br />
<br />
There actually seems to be nothing else out there on the Shaman role with Nagafen and Vox, and little on the best resist gear. <br />
<br />
My guild has many over 52, so old world dragons are not very doable as a guild, since we dont have 36 characters at 49-52. Still, there are a couple of good dragon raid leaders who are active on Drinal, the most notorious being Znort, who has an excellent reputation.<br />
<br />
Since you wrote this I have picked up some nice resist gear which is getting me towards 100 unbuffed. <br />
<br />
I have obtained the Blackened Alloy Coif and it is quite nice for the price. <br />
<br />
Also Saprophyte Spore Gloves were very cheap, and nice resists on hands. <br />
<br />
The Cone shaped damage output is interesting too. In reality, only main tank should be in that cone, and maybe a couple others if main tank gets hosed, right?<br />
<br />
I have read that clerics should not use Complete Heal in these encounters, as they will get aggro.<br />
<br />
The other interesting idea I have wondered is whether a bunch of Stinging Wort potions would allow a smaller set of adventurers to prevail in this encounter. Although it would be expensive, the value of certain drops would be able to make up for it I would imagine. A ten-shot costs about 400 to make, and heals 3000. <br />
<br />
I would be very interested in other threads where people shared their experience with the shaman's role on certain mobs or encounters when it differs from the usual buff/slow/poison/backup heal we are so familiar with.<br />
