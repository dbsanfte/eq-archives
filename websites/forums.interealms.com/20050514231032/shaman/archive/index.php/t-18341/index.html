<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stepping</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what the hardest thing anyone here has 2 boxed and what combo did ya use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gaukr Sandstorm in BoT for me, 2 boxing Einnod + a 65 chanter. He killed my charmed pet at 25% and Einnod died while I recharmed another pet on the chanter. Gaukr was able to kill the 2nd charmed pet with 0% life left and a lucky nuke channel killed him from the ench.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was bored a few days ago so revisited crypt of naddox and saw Blue con Naddox Spiritseeker on track. Around 9-10 mobs spawn around him. Was down to last mob before him when I agro'd him early on accident, wiped. Shm only had 25% mana when he was agro'd, will have to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does solo count? Cause I DID solo Askr the Lost in BoT..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol einnod,glad to see i'm not the only one, on one agnarr raid we killed him before his last spawn, and i f8ed to get it on target, and not looking i just nukes, happened to be Askr, i ended up slowing and tanking him bc i had asked for loot, ended up getting my tear and tanking himf or like 5 min</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have duoed the Kromzek Captain in WW a few times with my SK, not really uber or anything but it's the only thing that comes to mind.  Maybe when he's 65 with some AA it'll be a different story :)  Solo accomplishments include Ayillish (WW canyon dragon), Drusella (pre-revamp, 6 times), Taskmaster Abyott in GD, Lodizal, Luminii Crawler in PoV (unrootable, hits 544).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My tandem is pretty gimp still, we've taken down named in droga, golems in poi factory so far and thats it really. Once i get some aa's and get to 65 with a full spellbook i plan on tearing through ww on a dragon killing spree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have killed Gorenaire, Talendor, Severillious, Ragefire, rhag , dozekar,  all BOT wing bosses, BOT tower mobs, POE 966 hitters, pofire first castle mobs, Sleep Walker (pov) and some other stuff I might forget, all with a warrior 2boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">taskmasters in basement of ssra for my bag was about 9 months ago but great fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's probably not all that impressive by today's standards, but I'm not all that adventurous and decidedly not uber...  On my way to ToV, I spotted Kelorek'dar and decided to give it a go.  When my warrior was down to 55% before even being able to pull her (she does this 1000hp+stun ae, as I found out), I was pretty worried.  Well, 30 minutes later she was dead, and I learned a valuable lesson...  When the mob gets low and starts to flee, don't forget to pay attention to your other box, lest he drown. :(  Way to put a bad ending on a nice kill. ;)  I was especially happy that I did it with only shammy buffs - just made me prouder for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />
