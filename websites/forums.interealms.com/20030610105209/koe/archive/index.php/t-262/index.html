<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok folks Hate is on for tonight at 7pm EST meeting at the SRO wizzie spires.<br />
<br />
Canoe is leading the expedition.<br />
So far we are still in need of a Rogue, Monk and Wizzie. I think? Canoe and I will be organizing groups at 7pm so please be prompt. To those who cannot get there until a little later we will make every attempt to have you ported up Please organize a convenient time to meet at the spires so to limit the amount of times that ports are required.<br />
<br />
Psyloche your input would be appreciated or Chmee or anyone who has been up to hate since the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks tons Guys lets ROCK HATE<br />
<br />
BTW please sign up under previous post this is FYI only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I camped out in S Ro near the wizzy spires.  Any chance of me getting either a late port, or getting logged in for a port up so that I can join when I get home at 6PM PST/9PM EST?<br />
<br />
If someone I trust will log me in, I will e-mail info.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe if we are lucky we can time it so that those folks logging on around 9est can all group and port up together. The added firepower would be great if we are planning on taking on some of the second floor. Cubugh said he has a wizzy that he can log on around 9... if you guys have some stones you can port up without too much trouble at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry - I've been planning to go, but haven't posted yet - i'll drop my name on the other thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As of now it's a go, with the server crash......we might have a chance at a god here folks if someone doesn't beat us to it =)<br />
<br />
<br />
I bought 10 stones today, so we're set for that.<br />
I would however like to be able to get a couple groups up there as soon as possible if it's not taken, even if just to get a foothold, so be ready as early as you can.<br />
<br />
As Atokal said, attendence and/or advice from peeps who have been up there since the change (larain, cshae, psyl, burien, sinf etc etc - ones i know who have) would be very beneficial.<br />
<br />
All depends on when the server comes back up and how quickly we can get people movin on up.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarconus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wish i could make it but i close today and tommorow so wont be home until around 2 am cst. im off saturday so i hope we can get something together then<br />
