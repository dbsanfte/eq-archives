<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is a pretty dumb question, and yes I have looked it up on search, but I need help... What is the most efficient way to solo? I'm 52 currently soloing Stormwave in Dulak because that's where everone told me to go... But, for some reason, the mobs are taking way too long to kill here i.e. 3-4 minutes a pop then add another minute or two to that to get mana back... My curre3t strategy is to summon pet, buff self, buff pet a litte, pull mob with turgur's then melee.  Where am I going wrong with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dot while you melee and make sure you have given the pet 2 weapons so he will dual weild. also the haste muzzles mages can summon help quite a bit.<br />
  another tactic is to root the mob and dot him then when the dot wears off reapply and begin melee at that time. this way you are recovering mana from the initial dot while its working. <br />
  a couple different tactics/tips there for you. your milage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go to bazaar but your pet 2 fists of ixiblat, a 500 hp girdle and a haste mask<br />
<br />
buy a jaundiced bone bracer while your at it<br />
<br />
tip for kei and pot9<br />
<br />
<br />
Sick pet on mob<br />
slow mob<br />
chain jbb<br />
<br />
you can dot, but usually dot will steal agro from your pet and then you will have the mob in your face interrupting your casts, unless you were smart and made an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Problem: I'm Iksar and can't use JBB...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You might try adding in a DoT or two, the ones we get at 49 are both worth using while soloing. You probably aren't doing anything wrong, you just need to get more efficient at killing. Dual wielding pet, epic, JBB, horse (if you have a JBB), some affliction focus items, a mana preservation item, KEI ....<br />
<br />
Lots of things out there to help you kill faster, without a couple of 'em, 4 or 5 minutes a mob sounds about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Problem: I'm Iksar and can't use JBB...<br />
<br />
You should quit now and reroll your character before it is too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL, Jinheim.<br />
<br />
DoTs will help you out a lot if you're not presently using them.<br />
<br />
Also there are a lot of things that can be done to use what we have available to maximum efficiency.  For one, use your pet's hp and his insane regen (post fight) to your advantage.  For example, buff up pet including with regen, pull with turgur's, if you have epic, root it, back up and epic (I *hate* how easily this is interrupted), Ebolt and reroot.  Now back off and canni-dance that used mana back again while your pet takes the hits.  Throw another Ebolt in again when first expires and get in there and tank now, Cannibalizing and Stoic and Ebolting as needed (not sure how many hp these mobs you're fighting have).  I had JBB in the mix too, but that won't help you to consider.<br />
<br />
Once you're done, you get back your used mana for half a minute and pet regens back to full health and you're ready to go again.<br />
<br />
Of course, the timing might be different for where you are fighting, but this is basically what I did to help maximize everything we have available.  Experiment a bit and you'll get the timing down to optimize each encounter.<br />
<br />
There are a myriad of other different tactics you could use also, from letting pet tank fully while you sit on the horse Cann'ing, healing pet, DoTing, to plain ol' Root rotting.  You'll get better and faster, just don't be afraid to mix things up a bit and try out something wacky now and again.  (I used to use JBB and Flash of Light as a type of Fear, and it was timed beautifully so that I could blind the mob, JBB it once before out of range and have another JBB start casting and hit the mob on it's return after FoL wore off, and then blind it again to send it off again...all the while with our pet eating it up)<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well... I dont think you're doing anything really wrong, but i would suggest if you want to continue meleeing..get a soulstripper its about the best weapon you can use at your level.  I think that alone will tremendously help your situation.<br />
<br />
I found the boats to be harder than they should be..and would suggest you hunt around the buildings on land.  Run around invisible and see what is DB to you and go from there.  You can get about level 56 on land so IMO its the better route.<br />
<br />
Dont fret about not being able to use a JBB; they lead to impotence anyhow~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, What I believe you're doing wrong is meleeing at all.  At your level, you probably don't have a huge mana pool or much FT, so if you're worried about your mana regen for quicker kills, let your (useles) pet tank and Canni, or, as I did, skip the pet and root dot.  Plenty of free time to Canni for dots.  Also, I'd get your best Curse line dot from LDoN, would hasten your kills quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No-one's mentioned Stoicism yet - if you don't have it yet, get it.  Keep stoicism up while tanking the mob for your pet, Keep EBolt up on the mob, and alternate between Cannibalising and nuking, while keeping Stoi up.  Should finish most fights pretty close to FH and FM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nothing really wrong with meleeing between casting, unless you have a mount.<br />
<br />
I would recommend saving up for a mount though, it will help your mana regen considerably, including during fights. You can be tanking (as long as you're not attacking) and still have meditating mana regen rate.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the suggestions above are good. Bear in mind Envenomed Bolt is a great dot. :)</div></div><hr />

/nod. The best thing you can do to help efficiency is to get yourself the cheapest Drogmar/Horse and turn off autoattack, in outdoor zones.  Then you can tank for your pet,  heal yourself efficiently with stoicism,  cannibalise and cast DOTs....  all while meditating at 17 mana a tick or whatever it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A mount will help tremendously, as will stoicism.  I am currently 48 and while I mainly group, I like my share of soloing as well.  The previous replies were right, get some mage summoned pet toys and equip the pet.  Another thing I like to do for weapons (stole a bunch my necro) is get gnoll hide lariats.  They proc stun, which helps a lot for both keeping aggro on the pet and limiting the need for heals.  I'll usually pull with slow, send pet and apply dots.  Then canni in between heals while medding on my horse.  If I find that I'm not using much mana, I'll get out there and melee a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Koushirou,<br />
Gotta Dot Bud.  Throw 1 DoT in the mix, and the mobs go down MUCH faster.  You will still take a min or 2 for each mob, and after 3,you'll prolly have to canni up, but thats no biggie.  I found that it was best to grap a Pally or SK, and duo the boat (at 51-52). I couldn't clear the boat on my own, but with a knight partner, we could clear the boat just in time for the first mob to re-pop, also I could keep manna up better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FYI, the mage summoned weapons won't proc until you have your 61 pet so don't bother with those.  Do give it two shivs and you'll be fine, though.  Or, look around in the bazaar for some cheap procing weapons like gnoll hide lariats, etc.  I still melee at 61 occassionally just for fun, so it's definately viable at 52, but you do need stoicism regardless of whether you melee or not.  Drop the disease dot at the beginning of the fight or a poison one about halfway through and you'll be fine.  I'd also recommend getting off of stormwave and move to the Oceancrasher dock area, or, the elementals in nadox.  The furious blackhands in nadox are doable, too, but a little more effort.  But then again, you may start collecting your Blood of Nadox components via /shout /ooc if you are in nadox when they drop and no one needs them.  Oh yeah, get a soulstripper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Meleeing for fun is just that - for fun.  It's not gonna lead to efficient or effective killing.  Melee by all means if that's what floats your boat, but know that since shamans do not get double attack, dual wield, atk value over 200, or a damage bonus, we hit like ninnies.  And we always will.  No matter what weapon -- compared to our spells.<br />
<br />
Your effectiveness soloing outdoors will skyrocket with a horse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never had a problem with the fists of ixiblat proc'ing on the 55th pet.  Not sure about the 49th pet though.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the mobs in LDoN tend to have better xp (and loot!) per kill, but they make up for it in hps, resists, and damage output.  Old world and Kunark mobs will have fewer hps, hit like sissies, and don't have the insane MR that LDoN mobs have.  Try the Chardok ZI/ZO for an example.  You trade slightly less xp per kill for a higher kill rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really sure unless you need better gear...and make sure you feed your pet.<br />
Also, as was already mentioned, get Stoicism.<br />
<br />
As comparison, I was keeping Stormwave cleared and no downtime worth mentioning while soloing at 49. No JBB until much later.<br />
What I did have was a drogmor and KEI. I'd grab a 3-4 hour KEI before heading down, and by the time it wore off, I really needed to sell anyway...so sell, reKEI, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
I would load up all my buffs (if you can get IoS, do so...the buff run you can do with IoS and all your stat buffs puts HoS to shame), call up Old Yeller, haste us both (regen for me), then pull with slow.<br />
<br />
I'd sometimes toss a disempower, sometimes toss a EBolt. I'd melee through part or all of it, then canni and stoic after each one so I was 'full' again (or close enough to it that I knew I could easily handle the next). I'd often pull the next while Stoic was still going, because it would wear off by the time I needed to engage in melee. And yeah, melee was extremely effective for me here. The crew members went down quick between me and Old Yeller. The DoT was just to make it that much quicker. My weapon was (and sometimes still is when I aint using the SoulStripper) a RIF. Nice proc on it. Nicer proc on SoulStripper.<br />
<br />
All that being said....dude, XP has to suck on Stormwave! Try the Armory (you will get two at times if you don't have someone to single pull) or grab a tank, any tank, and go camp the Enraged (which lets you get that wonderfull SoulStripper as an added bonus). No plat drops in the caves, btw...but I get more Blue Diamonds there than I seem to outside.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be on Lanys, look me up...me and the DE Cleric can help ya camp the Enraged sometime. Would be cake with two shaman and the cleric, even if we don't have a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You mean to tell me that when you bought your character, the seller didn't include a guide to solo'ing?  LOL.   <br />
<br />
Just kidding, but, at 52 soloing should be easier than ever.  You have 2 dots that kick ass, use them.   Cast e-bolt and plague, then slow and root.  Thats a total of 870 mana, between a horse, c3, and cann, you should be nearly full mana by the time the dots wear off.  Maybe you need a different spot.  <br />
<br />
Your iksar, run, don't walk to high hold keep, you will get exp and plat beyond your wildest dreams.  You'll be 56 in a week, then you can get into IC in PoV, LOL.<br />
<br />
Have fun,</div></div><hr />

Yes the fists will proc on the lower level pets I dont remember on the 49 pet tho. but i bet they will . If i remember right the 49 pet is like lvl39 and the previous pet is lvl36.</div></div><hr />

Get a horse or Lizard.  Then dot instead of melee.  Other option is go to HHK and solo there as the mobs are even easier and the XP is better :P<br />

<br />
the hands of ixi-splat work on the 49 dog. cant wait to hit up the kedge and walnan blades though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do not have JBB nor my EPIC (just lazy on EPIC... I've been &quot;almost done&quot; for over a year now...)   But I didn't have any problems solo in Dulaks.<br />
<br />
Here is my take... see what everybody thinks.<br />
<br />
My advice... let dogdog be the main tank.  You want dogdog to take a beating since (a) you can't use his HP for mana (b) he heals much much faster than you between fights... especially if you make him sit.  Most people think of dogdog as a DOT, but he is also a meat shield... make sure you maximize both functions.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt; Buffs&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
You don't need all the best buffs... you mainly need HP for canni... so STA and Tuna are good investments.  If you find yourself taking a beating, then bring up AC and then maybe the AGI buffs.  Horse really helps you with mana and to not pull sit-aggro... otherwise you should be in bear form.  Oh, and I usually had C3.  By the time C3 wore off I was usually ready to gate out and sell anyway.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I give the pet all the best melee buffs and best haste.  As mentioned, dogdog must have 2 shivs or proc'ing weapons.<br />
<br />
Regen is a must on both of you.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt; Tactics &lt;/b&gt; <br />
<br />
I would lead with Slow, then engage dogdog... let him get aggro, back up.  Mob should turn on dogdog.  Wait for dogdog to get a good amount of taunt going while I canni back the slow mana.  Then I layer in the first dot.  You shouldn't pull aggro, but if you do, just wait a sec for dogdog to build up taunt and back up.  Then layer in the next dot.  Canni up.  Repeat dots as necessary.<br />
<br />
I usually leaded with Plague since it lasts the longest... then followed up with ebolt.<br />
<br />
By 55 in Dulaks, with the new pet, I was able to finish most battles ready to jump into the next.  With regen up, dogdog was usually ok too, but worse case: slap a stoicism on dogdog, tell him to sit, and go pull the next mob... he will be good to go by the time your back.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt; Other minor points:&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
I always have root up just in case dogdog has trouble taunting the mob off me.  I root and then back up.<br />
<br />
Let dogdog take a beating... but never let dogdog die, you have too much mana invested in him.  If he gets below 50%, lay a Stoicism on him... he will loose some haste, but your dots are going to kill the mob.  Also, if dogdog is near death you can always lay a stoicism on yourself and step in and to take some hits.  Stepping in myself is usually my second choice because then I am not canni dancing.<br />
<br />
Lastly, my horse was the best investment I ever made.  It was recommended to me over JBB... but I couldn't afford JBB anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Not really sure unless you need better gear...and make sure you feed your pet.<br />
 &lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
huh? Never heard of anyone giving food to the dog- did I perhaps misread that or do you really give your dog food/drink?</div></div><hr />

<br />
horse will help, but is not necessary for zero downtime. I could clear stormwave at 52. Pulled with malosi, and rooted them before they got to me, canni a few times, slow and incapcit/cripple and send in dog. then stick 1 ebolt on them at 60-80% of their life and canni it back as fast as possible. If I get back to FM before he dies then join the fight. every 2nd or 3rd mob stoicism to get health back up. rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />
