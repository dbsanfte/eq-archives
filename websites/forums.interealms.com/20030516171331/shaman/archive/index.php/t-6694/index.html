<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frogert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i posted this under the wrong forum :rolleyes:  but here it goes  in the correct forum<br />
<br />
1. What is the lowest lvl the shaman epic can be finished, with a MQ of the tear <br />
<br />
2. i have an epic walkthough and it is all text, is there a better one with mayeb pictures and locs or some spice to it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) I believe you need to be level 51 to complete the epic. <br />
<br />
2) I used the guide from http://www.eqshaman.com and I had no screw-ups at all following it. If you MQ the tear you need to max True-Spirit faction before final hand-in.<br />
<br />
3) Yes , there is a 3 .....   Rak is a little tougher against fire pets since the resist changes. Best bet is to toss some tanks into the fight to beat him to a pulp. He is a wizard with lowish HP. So a fast kill means few AE's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frogert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why did verant never keep the epic quests  similr to lvl :(<br />
<br />
<br />
i did my rangers at 47 and my monk at 50 and i was going to get the shamans done at like 48 or so.  <br />
<br />
guess i will have to wait til 51, and i got a shaman with max truespirit faction to MQ the tear with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The reason the various epic quests are disimilar in regards to level requirements, difficulty, etc. is that different developers created the various epic quests (and evidently they didn't compare notes too much.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've heard rumors you can get your epic earlier. I have never seen it done. I'm not even sure there is a level requirement on the scale turn in. Has anyone ever had this happen to them? I've heard rumors of level 30's walking around with their epic, it just won't click for you till 51.<br />
<br />
Rumors, though, I've never seen one.<br />
<br />
If you MQ your tear, make absolutely sure you have MAX MAX MAX ally. As in, your faction with truespirit cannot get any better. If you don't see that, don't turn in the scale. <br />
<br />
I also used the guide from eqshaman. There aren't any pictures, but pictures aren't needed. &quot;Spice&quot;, well, it's a walkthrough. Not a magazine. Locs are given for those mobs who aren't obvious - such as the wandering spirit in EK (who is on a set path), Ooga in Erud's Crossing, and the guys who give Woe &amp; Envy &amp; Marr's Promise. Rak and Neh are pretty much known spawns, as are Ghiosk and Kirn. If you and your guild don't know where they are, you shouldn't be heading down to them :)<br />
<br />
You can skip the Hole &amp; Neh, but it means more faction work. Just a heads up. Rak will still have to be done, which means you will do Ghiosk anyway, as he's the first reaver pop.<br />
<br />
I'd personally wait a few levels and do the whole quest as it is intended, as if you loose anything, a GM will not be sympathetic to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zubr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok here is hard core facts. I did every single thing myself and did not hear it from room mate uncle.  Started epic at 43 did every single step myself only once and follow instructions exactly.  Hole and CoM mobs were done at 49. At 49 tear was MQ by friend 60 shammy who did it many times and max ally. While walking to last reaver I got 3 books again and put it in bag. After killing  both mobs in CoM went to spirit in EJ turn diary, which took me to ally faction. After diary did 3 books turn in again  and scale. Bam spear in inventory and 7 blue exp which took me to 50.   Hope this will clear this up. Was done myself on Oct 18 on 7th hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont care if its called cheat or whatever, dont wanna spend all my time doing a booring quest, but I like the reward.<br />
<br />
I did the black fur boots solo and then turned in envy/woe part untill I got the mess&quot;faction couldent get better&quot;<br />
<br />
spawned Lord Rak with MQ and got my epic.<br />
<br />
Just be sure u get the &quot;couldent get any better&quot; mess from the wandering spirit and it couldent go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IF its not a shaman MQing your tear, then it wont work. Only a shaman can MQ the tear, even if the other classes faction is max ally. So if you are gonna skip parts, get yourself or another shaman a tear. The person with the tear then maxes their faction, then do the tear hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure of some of the facts above, but I got my epic at 48.  I did all the steps in proper order (I just maxed out my faction to be sure it works).<br />
<br />
The Spear will not right clicky until you are level *50*.  I dinged 50, and had to try the epic once.  Right clickied just fine, but I had a poor target choice (Hello level 49).  I charmed a guild cleric to come out and get me close again (Thanks Tomal), and 2 kills later was 50 again.</div></div><hr />
