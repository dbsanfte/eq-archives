<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just been talking with a friend that quit eq over a year and a half ago and he was asking me how my shammy was doing.. told him and he said I must eat PoD's (priest of discord) for breakfast now.. made me start thinking.. anyone know much about them? were they beefed up like the guards were? What do they cast, any faction hits etc.?<br />
<br />
<br />
I might go try one when I have a spare moment.. in the old days the PoD was a real challenge, just wondered how they fared now.</div></div><hr />
