<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was really excited about making 46 and being able to go to the Planes.  Spent a short time in PoJ with a 50ish group, mobs seemed rather tough...is it possible to solo anywhere in PoP? and if so where? is the loot worth the trouble? seem to hear a lot of shouts for rezz's from high-40's to low 50's who got owned in some plane or another... anyone with experience in the planes please advise...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 46 as a shaman, you're going to have to be extremely patient and careful to solo anything in PoP.  It's not, as a rule, very worth it until you're in your high 50s at least.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to solo out a bunch of levels quickly, Lower Guk is recommended, and High Keep Nobles&amp;Bards.  Either option can take you to 55ish in a week or so of dedicated exp'ing.  Be aware that killing in HHK carries a faction consequence, if you care about stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks Brohg...does it matter at all about my gear? IMHO i would say that i am geared for appx lvl 55ish... not trying to brag just curious as to how much that factors into things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless your gear at level 46 somehow includes Spear of Fate, Turgur's Insects, Envenomed Bolt and Bane of Nife...</div></div><hr />
