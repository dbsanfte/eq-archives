<br />
but, if you want something broken down a bit more i would suggest start with themes of discusion.  we talk about what we have comparied to other classes, what this theme brings to a group, what it does for us solo, what it does for us in a raid, and where we need improvment.<br />

<br />
I tried to classify Chutoi's points as follows:<br />
<br />
1.  Healing power - main point is that shaman healing is way behind other priests even when slow is factored in<br />
<br />
    a.  Amount healed compared to other priests<br />
    b.  Importance of slows in facilitating healing<br />
    c.  Healing relative to hybrid classes (specifically paladins)<br />
<br />
2.  Damage output - far behind other classes<br />
<br />
    a.  Pet damage - far inferior to other pet classes<br />
    b.  DoT damage - far too slow when mobs die so fast in groups and raids<br />
    c.  DoT aggro limits getting DPS in this manner<br />
    d.  DD spells extremely inefficient and slow<br />
    e.  Shaman melee extremely poor, worse than clerics<br />
<br />
3.  Slows - supposedly the reason that healing and dps are so poor<br />
<br />
    a.  Bst and enc slows nearly as good<br />
    b.  Slow mitigation severely reduces the advantage<br />
<br />
4.  Buffing<br />
<br />
    a.  Shaman buffs marginally better than other classes, e.g., beastlord<br />
    b.  Many high level players at or near stat caps without buffs<br />
<br />
5.  Mana regeneration<br />
<br />
    a.  Other classes get mana regenration methods that are nearly equivalent to shamans<br />
    b.  FT and other enhancements increase mana regen rate across all mana using classes<br />
    c.  Mana regeneration spells are widely available to other classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its a good one...no question, but he missed a few things, that are also overlooked and result in an effective loss of power.<br />
<br />
1) Resist Adjustments on our DoT spells...none of ours have any...necros do...druids do...where are ours...right we dont need them we got Malos and Malicious Decay...so we have the mana cost of malos/malicious and the mana cost of the DoT to work off...oh and the loss of time of having to malos first...and then in PoP if its poison or disease, probably still get resisted...<br />
<br />
2) Buff Duration.  Ours sucks..not one of our top level buffs last as long as our counterparts....<br />
<br />
3) Haste...all our other group buffs are the same as the single buff with maybe a slight drop in duration...what exactly is the purpose of a group haste buff that we get...it has a slower haste percentage.  Frankly, I would rather it hasted same and either had the same or shorter duration.<br />
On the haste side...why is it that chanters haste buffs also add attack and yet ours dont?  We are supposed to be the melee stat buffers arent we?  Why is our ability to haste not within 5 percent of chanters...?  they can slow with 5 percent of us...<br />
<br />
4) If we are supposed to have group versions of our stat buff spells, where the heck is Group Ferine Avatar?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think we can send Chutoi's post as-is, it's great, but too long.<br />
<br />
We need concise bullet points - Problem/Suggested Fix.<br />
<br />
Anyone volunteer to break it down into bite-sized chunks that the developers can easily digest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not signing off on anything from &quot;all&quot; shaman.  My name is not all.<br />
<br />
Now, it's from all shamans, then you have a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't done much for the community, so here's my stab at it. Lots of replies since I started this; feel free to take any of it or none of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. As a Priest Class, we should be more sought after for heals than  Hybrids like Paladins. Any true improvement which considers the DPS of PoP+ mobs is welcome. Suggestions:<br />
<br />
Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
Some sort of faster and more efficient quick single-target heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. As a Slowing Class, our slows take longer to cast, take more mana to cast, are resisted more, and generate more agro than those of Enchanters or Beastlords; and with Mitigation, the narrow lead we have (on paper) is even more narrow. Any true improvement which considers Agro, Mana and encounter durations in PoP and LDoN is welcome. Suggestions:<br />
<br />
Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in it's current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. As far as Mana Regeneration (once our forte) goes, our current abilities are completely marginalized by the plethora of targetable and wearable mana regen enhancements in the game. The ability to convert HP to Mana and thereby regen mana quickly, once the balancing factor offsetting our largely inefficent mana costs for similar results (heals, buffs, debufs, damage), is rendered nearly moot by the likes of VoQ, Po9, SD, Mounts, and FT AAs, Augments, and dropped/crafted/quested items. Any adjustment which considers these other sources of mana regen is welcome. Suggestions:<br />
<br />
An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana.<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that's not too bad; perhaps someone will tackle the other issues.</div></div><hr />

Gloriana what about you make a top post that is sticky. The first post is the broken out bullet points of Gardeltron and any amendments we make over time you edit this top post.<br />
<br />
The second post in the thread is a copy of Chutoi's post word for word as a reference.<br />
<br />
If we all start trying to summarize his post we are going to have 100 different lists. Gloriana we need you to make an &quot;official&quot; start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Glor, I considered length when I wrote the original post in response to the clueless on that thread.  The problem with condensing further is that you leave stuff out.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, shaman have a lot of problems--addressing a few would be balance.  Addressing all of them would be overkill--ie, fix DoTs (properly)and nukes aren't as important.  Fix slows and heals aren't quite as unbalanced.  Fix heals and slows aren't quite as unbalanced.  Etc.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that when we mention a problem, we have to document it with anecdotal evidence of some kind.  We're working against a pretty skeptic crowd.  <br />
<br />
As to the solutions, that has it's own problems.  Finding a middle ground where we can all agree on a suggested fix is gonna be hard.  You'll note I shied away from making suggestions.  Even if we do suggest fixes for all of the above, it runs into my earlier point--fixing all of them would be unbalancing, and making that many suggestions for improvements would make us look greedy.<br />
<br />
In the end, I figured a description of the problems was sufficient for that forum.  I haven't checked back in the last few hours, but last I did, I didn't see many people trying to offer counterarguments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Taking Chutoi's main points listed in my post above, here is a suggested list of problems and fixes:<br />
<br />
1.  Healing power <br />
<br />
Problem: Weak healing with respect to priests, and also to paladins with their new GoD spells<br />
<br />
Fixes: Increase effectiveness of ICH; Group Quiescence; new mana efficient fast heal<br />
<br />
2.  Damage output <br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman DPS is far behind other classes, designed for old world encounters<br />
<br />
Fixes: New higher level pet + better pet dps buffs; new mana efficent DD, high damage or fast acting DoT with low recast time (or fix Bane); changing rain spells to be true AoE spells with reduced resist rates; improved melee abilities; fix Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
3.  Slows<br />
<br />
Problem: Very llittle advantage to current slow line compared with other classes<br />
<br />
Fixes: A faster, lure-type slow that slows nearly as good as current level 51 spell<br />
<br />
4.  Buffing<br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman buffs marginally effective given current stat caps<br />
<br />
Fixes: Increase stat caps (yea right), not sure what else can be done<br />
<br />
5.  Mana regeneration<br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman mana regeneration is no longer much of an advantage given changes to the game and other classes<br />
<br />
Fixes: Reduce shaman spell costs; introduce a true upgrade to current line of cannibalization spells</div></div><hr />

We might have to prioritize it. It looks like a lot of people can agree that another 2 minute disease dot is lame. It doesn't look like an overwhelming majority favor a new fast heal.<br />
<br />
We could put the items which have the most backing at the top of our list and the items which it's hard to find any consensus toward the bottom.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I too sincerely appreciate Chutoi's post and agree with much of it.  However, if people are truly interested in creating a statement from &quot;all shaman&quot; and speaking with one voice, then it and many other suggestions on this board contain a fundamental flaw.  It is one of myopically arrogant focus on the end game you play.  That's fine for you, largely irrelevant to me.  At least in Chutoi's case, he was clear about how his suggestions applied:<br />
<br />
[/quote]<br />
I am going to be talking about end game shaman (level 65). If haven?t played a level 65 shaman, and aren?t correcting something I say about a class other than a shaman, you don?t have any business replying. My response to you is, ?talk to me when you?ve experienced it.? <br />
[/endquote]<br />
<br />
Other than its tone, which is counter-productively condescending, I largely agree with the content.  I have little or nothing to suggest about aspects of being a Shaman beyond the level that I've experienced.  I also have no desire to influence how your end game develops.  However, there are plenty of improvements to our class which need to be made that likewise have little to do with your end game play.<br />
<br />
If anyone honestly wishes to speak for &quot;all&quot; Shaman, then I suggest they lose the attitude that we're not Shaman and have nothing to contribute until we've been 65 and/or raiding for a long time.  All you contribute with that attitude is a division among players and shame and pity for the unintentional loss of respect you have incurred upon yourselves.  Many long-time and high level Shaman remember well how many other folks play this game and contribute valiantly toward increasing the enjoyment of players not in their present situation.  Many others do not remember, never really knew (i.e. got to 65 in a month), choose not to care, are too full of being uber, or for any number of other reasons, simply dishonor themselves and their great class.  They most certainly do not speak for me.<br />
<br />
Without repeating my post in http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18930&amp;pagenumber=3<br />
there are many reasons for playing and many ways to enjoy Norrath.  Respect and un-common courtesy have as valid a place in our virtual world and they do anywhere.<br />

Try to think &quot;big picture&quot; and get the BEST FIXES for our class, not necessarily every fix you think we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The interest in improving high end shamans concerns all levels of shamans. Most if not all players expect someday to reach the top level. How would you like to play a moderately powerful and respected class for 4 years and then just as you expect to reach the pinnacle of your powers find that you have been demoted to buff bot status.<br />
<br />
That is what is happening. Below a certain exp level you may not understand our concerns. Believe me unless something is done to change the proposed &quot;improvements&quot; to our class in GoD you will have very little power to look forward to in your high level days.</div></div><hr />

Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes. <br />
<br />
Good points, all of them, but I think something must also be mentioned about the disadvantages of passive VS. active mana regeneration.  The problem is not only with the ever narrowing gap between our &quot;superior&quot; mana regeneration, but also with the time/spell gem needed in order for our regeneration to work.<br />
<br />
Our spells are less effective, less mana effecient, and often have a slower cast time, all to make up for our &quot;superior mana regeneration&quot;, but even with an advantage in mana regeneration (which is very slight nowadays) we can't match the casting increases needed to make up for the spell handicaps do to all the time that must be spent to get said &quot;superior mana regeneration&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Before we can really come up with a unified proposal we need to decide which areas we'd most like to see upgraded.<br />
<br />
As Chu pointed out, asking to upgrade everything is too much.  If we ask for a significant upgrade in healing and nuke power, then asking for upgrades in our DoTs and Slowing is a bit over the top.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps a simple poll asking which area we need to be upgraded the most in.  i.e.<br />
1. Direct Healing<br />
2. Direct Damage<br />
3. Heal over Time<br />
4. Slowing<br />
5. Damage over Time<br />
6. Pet<br />
<br />
It'd be damned nice if we had an option when doing a poll to ask people to score/rank the items listed. i.e. Rank the following areas from 1-6, 1 being top priority and 6 being lowest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Mana regen in groups can't be emphasized enough.  We are at a serious disadvantage when compared to classes with mana regen buffs.<br />
<br />
As a baseline shaman can get approximatly 50 mana per tick while cannibilize 4 constantly including the mana for cast quiesence or torpor.  In addition they get the boost of around 40 mana per tick when using Cannibilize.  But that is with 100% activity just making mana, ask most 65 shaman and I'd wager that you are maybe casting Can 4 once or twice a minute at best while attending to your other duties, that total mana regen number is loking more like 50 per tick not the 90 per tick that is the max.<br />
<br />
Look at Voice of Quellious which is 18 mana / tick.  This isn't just 18 its 18 times the number of mana users in the group.  At a minimum its going to be two in a full group, healer and enchanter.  More likely its going to be 3-4 mana users in a group, that is 54-72 mana per tick.  Way more than we get for ourselves through Cannibilize.  Not even taking into account that passive regen is superior to active mana regen.<br />
<br />
Similarly for Beastlords, their 9 mana per tick spell Spiritual Dominion gives them 27-36 mana per tick for the whole group.  In addition they get paragon of spirit every 15 minutes which gives them 480 mana per character, which averages out to another 3 mana/tick.  Total a BST brings to a group in mana regen is 36-48 mana per tick.  Almost the same as what we bring!  <br />
<br />
Druids get 24-32 mana per tick for the whole group with Protection of the Nine.  Plus they get a self regen buff with 4 mana per tick. Total to group 28-36!<br />
<br />
To go on with this point of aggregate mana regeneration is the fact that mana regeneration split up between multiple characters is inherently superior to that of a similar aggregate amount on one character because those multiple characters can cast multiple spells simultaneously while the shaman can only cast one spell.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm <br />
Of course none of this matters since we're supposed to be so gosh darn good at soloing. <br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
nb: I haven't solo'd since LDoN came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Please start that poll for me, Sciek, I'm kinda pressed for time today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Scieck raises a good point, but after watching the same type of post on the SK boards (pre-PoP), I'd suggest the following - based on what SKs asked for and what they got.<br />
<br />
A list of what role you want a shaman to play and how spells can be changed to support that role.<br />
<br />
For example, for me a shaman is primarily a slower (though at my level of the game people still love focus and avatar).  Given the 3 primary choices for slower (enc, shm, bst) what do the other classes bring to the table besides slow.  Enchanter brings CC and KEI/VoQ, BST brings DPS.<br />
<br />
Assuming shaman are primarily slowers, what next? What should we be doing when not slowing? Healing, DPS and CC are three possibilities.  Should we do all 3 badly (like now)? If not, which do we prefer? <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd love to be a better healer, like to the point I could let someone else pick up slows and swing as a main healer.  Maybe on a par with a druid, certainly not as good as a cleric, and CERTAINLY better than a paladin. Our CH sucks, and Kragg's is a joke.  Fix those and look at the corresponding lower level heals and when we get them and scale those.  This would leave certain CC and DPS abilities, but they would still suck. This would give valid secondary considerations when choosing a slower - a BST would be a good slower when DPS was needed, ENC would still have the best CC and SHM would be a stronger secondary healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here's my take:<br />
<br />
Debuffs: The Cripple-line has recieved no upgrades since Kunark, rendering it outdated, when comparing the heavy progression of stats that both players and NPC's, have acheived over the expansions since.  Because our buffs are physical oriented, there's no reason to have strong atk/ac/stat debuffs that no other class can compare to.<br />
<br />
Heals: If we are to be a priest class, then we should be competitive in this area, at least with druids.  As always, clerics should have an extreme upper-hand with healing.  But currently, our heals barely move on warriors, paladins,  or shadowknights.  Critical Healing AA's do help, but praying for it to kick in to keep someone alive, isn't good.<br />
<br />
Group HoT's would greatly help against NPC's who AE, and in situations where multiple people in the group momentarily gain agro, and a HoT spell is good enough.  It saves time than having to go down the list healing each person, and gives more time in situations where curing is greatly needed on someone or needing to slow, root, etc. an NPC. <br />
<br />
An efficient quick, single-target heal upgrade, would help against the standard hard-hitting NPCs in any high-level zone.<br />
<br />
Nukes: This may not be our area, but a nuke over 1k that doesn't cost an arm and a leg in mana or casting time, would at least give us a little dignity with ALL the other int/wis casters (excluding hybrids) that do have nukes over 1k.<br />
<br />
DoTs: This is an area we should shine in, where wizards, mages, and druids shine with nukes.  But currently, the poison-line which comprises of our most used dots, can resist heavily (even after Malos) and gain frustrating agro usually resulting in the death of the shaman.  DoTs during its course on an NPC, really only do a small fraction of damage compared to classes that can nuke for great damage and the weaponry of melee classes.  So why should a shaman pay hideously for applying a single DoT?<br />
<br />
If we are to pay hideously for applying a single DoT, then make it worthwhile.  It isn't overpowering for a single DoT to do 500-1000 damage per tick, depending on the length of its infliction.  The classes that can nuke well, can still outdamage those DoTs with chain-nuking.  Where it might not be mana-efficient for them, and DoTs being mana-efficient for us, in that scenario, I see it as balanced.<br />
<br />
I know we have the capability to stack our DoTs, but between the ancient limit of 8 spells memorized, and high rate of agro with just one DoT, there is alot of room for improvment.<br />
<br />
DoTs that include debuffs, could bring a creative alternative, if high damage isn't the answer.<br />
<br />
Pets: I can deal with an inferior pet, but since we have had them since the original release of Everquest, some better attention can be given to them.  If not in melee power, why not something similar to what familiars give to wizards?  Or, our pets can have alternatve abilities such as proc'ing small heals or mana gain to its master or group.  Give us reasons to spend points on pet-related AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Here's an attempt at a basic outline of our current problems.  No new ideas, just outlining what Chutoi's already said here (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056591-9.html) with a bit of commentary inspired from other posts scattered around on the forum.<br />
<br />
Melee<br />
<br />
<br />
 I personally have little to no desire to melee, but lots of us do.  To that extent, we should at the least be able to keep pace with a cleric's melee abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nukes<br />
<br />
<br />
 As it stand right now, shamans are the only casting class lacking a 1000+ dmg nuke.  When you take the long casting time built into our highest nuke, we're out performed by even a hybrid (rangers).  <br />
<br />
 The resist rate on rains is completely out of line, to the point where they are unreliable at best as a source of damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals<br />
<br />
<br />
 We lack true battle heals.  While our heals can help during downtime, they're no where near strong enough to help when facing mobs that can easily do 2,000 points of damage in a single round.  This goes for all three of our top heals (Tnarg, Kragg, and Quies)<br />
<br />
 We lack a group heal.   Every class with heals gets some form of group heal, with the exception of rangers and shamans.  We are the only priest with no group heal of any kind.<br />
<br />
 We're out performed by a hybrid class yet again when comparing overall healing abilities.  A paladin gets burst heals, group heals that heal almost as much as our single target, and a duration heal that's only 50hp less per tick than our best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
<br />
<br />
 Every pet but ours can dual wield without having to be armed first.<br />
<br />
 Our pet does roughly 12 dps base.  With full buffs and weapons, we can squeeze that up to about 38.  For reference, that's about as much as our level 56 poison dot.  Hardly enough to bother with.<br />
<br />
<br />
DoTs<br />
<br />
<br />
 On paper, we can do massive damage with our DoTs.  In game, that would get us summoned and killed (either by the mob of the tank out of frustration) in about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
 There's an inordinate amount of agro generated by poison DoTs<br />
<br />
 Mobs generally don't live long enough for our DoTs (even Bane) to take full effect.  Disease DoTs are useless for anything but soloing since raid targets (the only thing that lives that long) have a limited number of debuff slots.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
<br />
<br />
 Mitigation reduced the gap between enchanter, beastlord, and shaman slows to a point where any difference is negligable at best.<br />
<br />
 Our slowing process takes forever  Mobs almost half dead before we are able to get them slowed since a slow casting debuff is required to land Turgur's reliably.  Other classes get resist mods (bards), fast casting slows (beastlords), or fast casting debuffs (enchanters) to compensate for this.<br />
<br />
 Mitigation reduced the effectiveness of our slows to the point where extra healing is required.  Our heals weren't increased in proportion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
<br />
 Current gear makes it easy to reach stat caps, rendering our massive selection of stat buffs obsolete.<br />
<br />
 We are towards the bottom end of buffing hit points, out performed by druids, clerics, even paladins and beastlords.<br />
<br />
 Our premier melee buffs (the Avatar line) is less desirable than the equivalent spell given to a shaman hybrid class (beastlord) due to the stamina, resists, and higher atk rating.  It doesn't have the stacking problems that we encounter with Avatar either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
<br />
<br />
 Our comparative mana regen has been steadily decreased over the past several expansions.<br />
<br />
 Enchanters and Clerics (proposed for GoD) get a free bar of mana every now and then.  The strength and variety of mana regen buffs, combined with the availability of flowing thought and mounts has steadily increased over the past several expansions.  All of this reduces the gaps to the point where, although good, our regen isn't nearly as spectacular as it was.<br />
<br />
 Our cannibalize spell line takes precious time to work.  Other classes get passive methods of mana regen.  <br />
<br />
 Cannibilization alone doesn't create enough mana when only available every three minutes.<br />
<br />
 Between signifigantly higher spell costs and high resist rates, any advantage we have with mana regen is used up.<br />
<br />
<br />
GoD Spells/AA<br />
<br />
<br />
 No one wants a new disease DoT for any purpose other than soloing, which has been discouraged more and more by current game design.<br />
<br />
 The new Cannibalize spell is LESS efficient than the one we currently have and amounts to roughly 1 mana more per tic.<br />
<br />
 No one will use the proposed slow in its current form.  Recast is too long, duration is too short, resist mod isn't enough, or the slow percentage is too low.  The only good part about it is the fast casting time.<br />
<br />
 20 AA points for something that should be patched in as a bug fix for free (pet buffing) is absurd.<br />
<br />
 DoT crits cost more than the equivalent AA for nukes, while delivering the same performance.<br />
<br />
 The pet AA's just suck in general.  We're not a pet class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Our role is supposed to be battle priest. That implies DPS and healing. Personally I'd be happy to resume that role again. Fix rabid bear so that it actually does something besides waste aa's and give us druid level heals. I guarantee groups will want us for our slows if we can also bring some other decent qualities with us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wyldin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One common misconception about shaman balance is definetely mana regen. While we do have the ability regain mana rather quick it does allow us to regain sustained dps for longer periods of time. Unfortunately in the high end game there is very few situations where you would be required to have said sustained dps or mana consistancy for heals. I don't know how it will be in GoD but in Time phase4 and up are just short duration fights, and shamans lack of burst dps makes them semi worthless in these situations. Shaman's heals however do have some MINOR benefits BUT even with top end gear you will run your mana pool dry in a hot minute because of how incredibly crappy their fast heal is (i'm not going to mention the crappycheal because you are a motard if you use it.) While you are burning your mana trying to heal 1 person you will barely even dent their hp (even a top end wizard :( ) This has left me to either a) do crap dps with dds (dotting will just cause you to overagro and cause unnecessary problems) or do spot heals on MT as necessary (wow this is suck.) Currently shamans have no real stackability in a guild making multiple shamans quite useless in a high end raid guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">My input. Better heals is a given, due to the rampant state of slow mitigation. Better dps, dots that give us a reason to cast them over nukes etc. All this has been said.<br />
<br />
What hasnt really been said is buffs. Stat buffs are nearly useless. BUt OTHER buffs might not be. Stuff that exists in terms of % mods on items could be put as a buff. Rather than +Agi, we should have % dodge mods, or avoidance mods. Stun resist mods. Strikethrough etc. A reason to buff at high end would be good. Hell, how about a spell called &quot;Warpaint of Zek&quot; that adds to the chance that Flurry/PB/Double Ripopste   etc gop off, and increases hate. Stat buffs were useless a year ago.<br />
<br />
And for the love of Zek, give us FA as an AA to free a slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I like splitzer's list.  Even though I would prefer to keep Chutoi's post, so that Sony realizes people are bitter about some things, the list is good too.  I would just work on the wording a bit more to be absolutely clear and concise on what we want.  Seems that the people at Sony need to be spoonfed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Stackability ... heals and dps.  All else is peripheral, the only shaman in a group or raid is quite useful (although in many cases not prefered over  enc or bst).<br />
<br />
Poison dot agro is due to ... poison counters.<br />
<br />
The easiest fix would be to switch the poison and disease counter dots (nobody uses the disease except when soloing for the most part, so the agro wouldn't hurt there).<br />
<br />
That, or a straight up -hate mod to the poison dots to make the agro commensurate with the damage.<br />
<br />
All shaman dots (including bane) should get a -30 resist mod (because dots can't land for partial damage).  Druids get -30/-100, necros -50/-200 ... having to malos first ensures that the dot won't be running to full duration, and malos benefits everyone, not just the shaman.<br />
<br />
Just like having a slowed mob benefits all the healers, not just shamans.</div></div><hr />
