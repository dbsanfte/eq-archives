<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">PSA: Yes, I used search, and no the particular information was not found, but yes there is some overlap.  If you cannot handle that, please exit the thread immediately.  Or just flame away.<br />

OK. An old EQ friend recently retired (at least for a while, once an Evercrack junkie always an Evercrack junkie) and left me his account.  Him: 65 Shadowknight, mostly elemental geared, stone etched war sword, all pre-GoD spells,  ~200 AA.  Me: 65 Shaman, about 50/50 elemental/pre-elemental gear, all pre-GoD spells,  ~150 AA.  I can post magelos if it matters.<br />
<br />
I have never seriously 2-boxed before (had some low level alts that I would PL from time to time on my second machine but that’s it).  So the first thing I am asking for are any tips and tricks of the multibox trade beyond the obvious hotkeys like  target/assist, target/heal, assist/debuff, multi canni, etc.  				<br />
<br />
Second, I am looking for any ideas about fun or profitable (to support my massive gambling addiction) places to 2-box this combo.  I have been thinking about the Kunark dragons &amp; Zland, top to bottom of Sebilis (fun mostly, not much profit there since the fungi drop rate nerf, no?), maybe some of the lower Velks stuff (fun again mostly), CT, Veksar.  Best cash spot I can think of is probably Sol Ro Tower though.  Sucks that they nerfed the GoD nameds, as I still want that spell haste augment and lack GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Trying to think of some other worthwhile places.  Hate, the new Hole, Ykesha zones?  Non-profitable is fine, so long as it is fun.  I am sure I am overlooking something interesting, maybe in some unused Luclin zone?  Anything worth doing in Chardok (or B) maybe?  Any big mobs that can be taken down just to say I did (could do Zelni-wheteverhisnameis I suppose, anything else like that out there?)<br />
 <br />
and for xp: Earth junk mobs, usual spots in Fire (maybe field 1or even c1 minis, by may be too hard?).  Maybe water (no experience xp’ing here but have read some glowing reviews).  Any other xp spots worth checking out?		<br />
<br />
Anyway, just looking for some tips of the trade and location suggestions.  And before you ask, yes exploration and trying things out is fun (especially with summon corpse) and I will do a lot of that, and yes it will be a long time before I am even half-assed as a Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Meant to post this in Hunting Grounds.  Feel free to move if appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Loot -- first, try to scoop up stuff that rots in GoD trials, like the 110 hp pants, the mask, etc., for your SK, if he doesn't have better.  <br />
<br />
Or, try Riwwi.  Look up the loot on the nameds there, and watch out for see invis mobs.  Some good stuff drops there, but the experience is terrible so it can seem very dull.  Some of the mobs there can be a little dangerous, too.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you put in some intensive time reading the SK boards and learning a few tricks of the SK trade, like FD pulling, and snare pulling, and combining snare and FD to pull.  Think about that last one -- work it out yourself mentally.  Now think about SK pet pulling, very nice especially if you get pet hold for your SK.  FD yourself, send pet in on mob, back him off.  You'll often get single pulls.  Try snare mobs and running them around your shaman while you malos and slow mobs, getting the feel for the range and lead time you need when running around.  Play around with all this stuff, in lower level zones if you like, so you become proficient and confident and know your alternatives.  You have a very flexible combo, but some people are not flexible, so they waste their opportunities.<br />
<br />
Additionally, for loot you can go camp spiders in POF and get obsidianwood saps, which mostly are bought by people doing the Aid Grimel tradeskill earring quest.  They go for 50k each on my server, and sometimes you can get a couple in a few hours.<br />
<br />
For experience, go to POF tables and pull with your SK's snare, and either group together or just keep the experience with your shaman.  The snare makes things far safer and easier.  Your SK could use some more AA's, so sooner or later you want to think about that.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you don't have a circlet of shadow(the pre-nerf hat, not the &quot;circlet of shadows&quot; with the long cast time), get it as soon as possible for your SK.  It is an insta-click invis that you can click on right in front of a mob if invis is dropping without aggroing it.  Get a shaidin revenant bauble, I think it is, too.  These are very handy indeed; you can float with the earring, invis with the crown, and explore easily all over the place with a very small chance of dying compared to looking around with your shaman.  You can even invis PAST mobs for pulls with that crown, and still get a pull in some situations.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you hadn't realized it, if you FD too long, your pet poofs.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun!  I have a 65 SK myself, and we have a ball together.  Nothing like having a handy corpse summoner around for all my whacky adventures, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My SK/Sham combo isn't quite as well equipt as yours, but I'm looking for similar ideas.  Something to do when I can't find a 'real' group etc. <br />
<br />
I have had some fun in Veksar, but it's kinda out of the way.  Water zin I found out I can fairly easily do when I was finishing up my binden concertina.  Haven't been brave enough to try any other elemental spots yet though.  I personally love SolC.<br />
<br />
Haven't been to brave to try alot of places yet, but I guess I can get over that.  After all, one convienience of boxing an SK = easy CR  :D  Just pay out the 150pp for 2 coffins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, and if you hadn't realized it, if you FD too long, your pet poofs. Magic number here is ~2 mins.  <br />
<br />
It's also about the same length of time before you get my favorite message.  &quot;Your enemies have forgotten you!&quot;  May not seem that great, but there's an issue with wanderers.  Most mobs, once they return to thier static spawn spots will forget an FDer.  Wanderers do not have a static spot they stay in, will continue to remember you long after you FD.  This was most noticable in places like PoD, PoS, Fire, etc, where 90% of mobs wander.  Nothing like having stayed FD for 20 mins, then have auto-pull for the next 40 from association aggro.  This message is a recent addition, about the same time as GoD release.  Now once you remain FD consecutively for those 2 mins, you'll get your aggro wipe.</div></div><hr />
