<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I like to solo big mobs in my spare time, and I was trying to figure out what to go after next.  Just looking for mobs i'd be able to handle solo.<br />
<br />
So far i've done:<br />
<br />
Trakanon<br />
Vex Thal entrance mobs<br />
Protectors of Ro<br />
Krigers in Bastion of Thunder<br />
Cliff Golems<br />
Lodizal<br />
<br />
<br />
Those we all a lot of fun, especially Trakanon :)  That one took some &quot;doing.&quot;  Anyways, anything else I should try out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then after you haul your corpse to a cleric and get rezzed, you could see how far you can get working your way through ToV, maybe try the PoI dragon (it's been forever since I did him so I don't really remember how hard he was, maybe too hard for soloing).  Also you could help all the people who are running around trying to finish off their 1.0 epic by offering to solo the various raid mobs.  Just a few ideas off the top of my head; I'm sure others can think of better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we can do sythrax and BoT named, not wing bosses though.<br />
we can also do the worm on the way to Itraer victus.<br />
and i heard rumble crush is Duo'able with a decent shaman and a good pally or Sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I may try some BoT named, and look up the worm.<br />
<br />
I may try that ToV idea too.  I LOVE ToV, and always look for excuses to go back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zelnithak is a fun solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, I forgot about him.  I thought about it, and never remembered it.<br />
<br />
How long does it take?  I'm guessing like 2 hours or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Foramorm, <br />
I have a hard time believing you solo'd trak.  Self buffed and no additional help?  If  you Magelo is current and I would say it was pretty current with your lvl 67 and all.  It just doesn't look like you could do it.  If you would PM me with your strats I would like to see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not trying to be cocky, or anything.  Because my gear is far from stellar.  I just want to know if there are any other fun mobs that I can solo :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for the negative rep bump :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rhag 1, Rhag 2, Rumblecrush, Xerkish the Creator, Va Dyn, Spiritseeker Nadox(good luck finding him up!), Ancient Megalodon, CS Sharks(epic part), SRT wing nameds and himself.<br />
<br />
These are just a few mobs that are soloable or will be soloable in a month or two depending on your gear(didn't look at your magelo).<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I should try Nadox, I did him with a druid and ranger for my epic, would be fun to try and solo him.<br />
<br />
Rhags could be soloable, I haven't done them in a long time, maybe i'll check it out later this weekend ;)<br />
<br />
Va Dyn is pretty easy, that's probabbly a possibility as well.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you updated on how I do with these.  Some of them I can't do with my current gear, but should be up to snuff in a week or two.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... how the hell are  you going to do wing nameds solo? jiva even the easiest one xuzl is waaay beyond the reach of shaman. The regular nameds like fierce mephits (sp) are doable easily but I bet you can't get past 1 real named. Forget the named now but shaman cannot pull jack **** solo so you're going to be fighting too many at once and it'll take too long and respawn will get you if you even pass that part.<br />
<br />
Not sure what will happen in a month or two.. but lets say you zone into chamber,.. 2 1k hitters no way you can take them out.. then you have to split the other 4 1k hitters from sol ro, then kill sol ro (ha) before the respawn...</div></div><hr />

W-T-F, you make it sound like it would be hard  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hopping Mad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hi,try killing Taskmaster Abyott in the Great Divide...doesn't hit to hard but prolly in the 80 - 100k hp mark and summons<br />
<br />
great fun to solo<br />
<br />
Hopp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can we solo Nadox?  I don't remember what he hit for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">nadox is a *****...can prolly solo it if you brought some DS potions and some heal potions just in case.  his DPS isn't to high, but he does have a bit of hp though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can we solo Nadox? <br />
<br />
I solo'd him for the epic thing. Not to hard.<br />
<br />
I also like to solo The Va'Dyn when I find him up. My bard twink craves a Toetwister.<br />
<br />
Another fun spot to solo is the Warlord frog in PoE. He is a trap frog. You can get yourself an Earth Elemental illusion clicky if your lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you were going to solo Va Dyn, how do you get him single? Seem to remember there's at least two adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually clear the first hall area. Then invis to him and pull him. Train him and 15 adds to zone. Zone back and go grab him while he is walking back to his spawn. Root a few adds and zone again. After a couple times you get him with 4 or 5 adds which is no problem since the adds die fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Helspont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mobs that I have solo'd. <br />
<br />
Zelnithak: kinda a boring fight, weak AE and not much mob DPS. Pre-Nerf panther on the pet made short work of him.<br />
<br />
Severilous: interesting fight. Caught me off guard when I found him, has very high resists. He has a stun AE. <br />
<br />
Lodi: /snore<br />
<br />
East/South BoT wing mini's. Oreen and Gaukr: Oreen is easy seeing as he basically chain casts, Gaukr is another beast, random 1.5K chain procs can make short work of you.<br />
<br />
I am close to triggering the Glyphed cycle solo in SSra.<br />
<br />
My watch list<br />
<br />
Goreinaire<br />
Wuoshi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Um, one of the Glyphed cycle Deathtouches...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wuoshi definetly doable, tanked him when we found him up on our way to Kael and once slowed, barely touched me. <br />
Rhag 1 I still havent managed to do. Pet panther draws aggro and gets killed, and mobs repop before bane and anathema do the required damage :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Second mob on Cursed cycle DT's every 3 minutes, best of luck :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zilaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm... I have heard of a shaman soloing grieg....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Helspont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Added the fish in CS Kelorex' Dar, this mob is a joke, and has free loots.<br />
<br />
Duo'd Venril Sathir: Insanely high resists, pet panther for the win<br />
<br />
Solo'd Zelnithak again post-panther nerf. Tripled my kill time, still easy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Greig was a fun fight! I downed him. Greig himself is a total wuss, it's killing his guards that's a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">just heard an SK soloed vindi.  has a shaman done that yet lol?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xoralundra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My watch list<br />
<br />
Goreinaire<br />
Wuoshi<br />
<br />
Gore and Wuoshi are not all that difficult to solo because they spend too much time casting and not enough time meleeing. The biggest problem I had was when Gore walked up a hill after I got him to 15%. Had to camp out to lose aggro and try again. Anyway, they're good fun if you find them up. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fr0z3n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">no way he could do it lol vindi dps output is just too insane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">no way he could do it lol vindi dps output is just too insane<br />
<br />
Yea, a SK solo'd Vindi.  But this was a SK w/ close to 16k HP and 3k+ AC (and a fair amount of sheilding).  Fully raid buffed, the SK was doing 400+ DPS while Vindi only did 250~ DPS.  SK life taps have become that effective...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess he'd do around 450 DPS to a similarly equipped Shaman. Doubt a Shaman could solo him, just because we'd have a hard time doing damage, but that's all theory. <br />
If I remember correctly Vindi was rampaging, which means that you can't do passive DPS via your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yes he ramps.  Pretty sure a shaman could tank, but as you said, dealing meaningful damage is the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">named in wos are  cool to solo .<br />
i only did all the one from NC zone to velitorkin (didn t try him  :p  ).<br />
<br />
named chimera (can be red for a lv 70) was the toughest for me because he melee up to 900 or so,and got the annoying dot proc?.<br />
<br />
my hp was at 8000 hp with conc and ac at 1640 or so.<br />
