<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hungry earth, <br />
Swallows my pride. <br />
Empty mirth <br />
follows, I lied. <br />
Spoken in vain, <br />
My words of love cried. <br />
Broken in pain, <br />
Silence replied. <br />
Shackles of hate, <br />
Locked to the stone. <br />
Tortured by fate, <br />
I can not atone. <br />
Darkness ensues, <br />
Clouding my heart. <br />
What did I lose? <br />
How do I restart? <br />
When does it end? <br />
How to Begin? <br />
My heart I defend, <br />
But it knows my sin. <br />
&quot;You used me to gain&quot;, <br />
It scowls with rage. <br />
&quot;Now I bear this stain, <br />
And sit in this cage.&quot; <br />
Why is it me, <br />
That owns you this blame? <br />
I question of she, <br />
This self-wounding claim. <br />
Have ye not thought, <br />
Of the lies toldeth me? <br />
&quot;Those lies that you bought, <br />
were easy to see.&quot; <br />
Blinded by you! <br />
I point and acuse. <br />
&quot;That may be true, <br />
but you, not I, lose.&quot; <br />
With that you are wrong, <br />
My lost empty soul. <br />
By my side all along, <br />
You've been in this hole. <br />
So you see not I, <br />
But you own this life. <br />
As hard as I try, <br />
I can't end your strife. <br />
Be known it was true, <br />
What you spoke every day. <br />
And lies told to you, <br />
That drove us this way.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Fallen<br />
<br />
Fallen from grace, <br />
Fallen to waste, <br />
Washed up, used up, <br />
Dead to the world. <br />
<br />
Blazing with passion it burned, <br />
Ingniting everything around it, <br />
None questioned its strength. <br />
<br />
Raging with love it yearned, <br />
Illuminating the darkest reaches of self, <br />
None doubted its commitment. <br />
<br />
Aching with loss it turned, <br />
Folding upon itself, <br />
None considered the depths of its truth. <br />
<br />
Fallen from grace, <br />
Fallen to waste, <br />
Fate's strings sear my soul, <br />
Her shears rend my heart. <br />
<br />
Cleaved in twain, <br />
Trust stains the ground, <br />
Bleach white in purity. <br />
<br />
Wracked with pain, <br />
Fear entombs my thoughts, <br />
Endless hallways of nightmare. <br />
<br />
Drained of sane, <br />
&quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Promise&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;, <br />
Meaningless words of deception. <br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Untapped love burns my veins, <br />
Ravaged heart darkens soul. <br />
Unknown fate holds the reigns, <br />
Driving onward frightened foal. <br />
<br />
Charging forward with reckless speed, <br />
Wind whipped sand takes my sight. <br />
Rock torn hooves shake and bleed, <br />
Sapped by pain, the will to fight. <br />
<br />
Masters crop cracks my skin, <br />
Forcing on with no concern. <br />
Failing muscles just give in, <br />
Wasted lungs heave and burn. <br />
<br />
Pain subsides one moment brief, <br />
Then is gone to my relief. <br />
Broken beast a lifeless heap, <br />
Tortured heart can finally sleep.<br />
