<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I want the disease dot. Sorry, but I do use them alot versus boss mobs who resist all my nukes and poison spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I want something no other classe have, that wont be given to any other class, and which make me very useful in groups and needed in raids.<br />
<br />
Skills buffs.<br />
group heal - since druid eventually got one, why not us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went for pet. Yes, our pet is fine against greens, and has been a boon in farming Chardok faction, but when he goes up against anything level-appropriate from the last 3 expansions, he gets chewed up and spat out...<br />
<br />
I have a chihuahua.<br />
<br />
I want a Doberman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just give me ANYTHING but another disease dot that I will never use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seriously I'd prefer if they gave us nothing instead of this spell. I'll never buy it, mem it or cast it. It is utter garbage. I'm sickened by the proposed &quot;improvements&quot; to our class in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dirt.  Yes dirt.  That would be better than this stupid dot.<br />
<br />
Truely though, I really would like an upgrade to canni (something that reduces the time spent clicking), a new slow (situational slow would be great, if they made it work in several situations.  I wouldn't mind their current incarnation of a new slow if they uped the resist check to -50 and reduced the recast timer to 6, and then a group HOT, preferably just a group Q.<br />
<br />
I would love those three in that order...  But over the disease dot, I would happily settle for a bag of dirt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What do you want instead of a new Disease DoT?<br />
<br />
Anything...unless you solo a lot disease DoTs are useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol.<br />
<br />
I would like to see:<br />
<br />
1) AoE Malo<br />
2) Group Heal OR upgrade to Tnarg's Mending<br />
3) Group Ferine Avatar<br />
4) Upgraded pet (that at least dual wields so we don't have to have dozens of daggers taking up our inventory... he's a level 58 warrior he should dual wield dammit)<br />
5) Upgraded Nuke (decreased casting time, better damage/mana ratio)<br />
6) Quiescence heals more per tick.<br />
<br />
These are all viable shaman upgrades imo.</div></div><hr />

you can choose multiple things and your answer isnt tied to the replacement of the disease dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Put me down for one 'all of the above' too... we should have been getting a couple of items off that list in every expansion since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

I want just a fix to our curse dot lines. They should have a -100 resist mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It looks like all classes is getting a focus that reduces the mana cost by 25% on their new nuke or their major new spell. Guess what spell they gave us focus for?<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4922&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
25% mana reduction on a SLOW worthless dot is NOT the same thing as getting a 25% mana redcution on a fast nuke which you will be chain casting etc.<br />
<br />
This worthless **** is just an insult, I'd feel better if they just removed plague of daluda.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn, what was I thinking. Trying to go and make dots a balanced form of damage compared to nukes again? <br />
<br />
That's crazy talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would take almost anything over a new disease dot!<br />

I'd prefer a better canni, but a better heal or a better dd would be nice too.</div></div><hr />
