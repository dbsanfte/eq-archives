<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm working on getting my self buffed AC to 1000, I'm still about 50 points short.  Two clear weak spots are one ear (hollowed pixy rib, PotC in other) and belt (girdle of the holy wanderer). I have about 200 wis,so I'm looking for high AC suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ugh, nearing 1k?  Just shroud of spirits &amp; battle gear I break 900 but with resist gear I fall short :(   Nearly all my play time has been spent raiding and our guild is putting an emphasis on getting epics for people so I haven't been getting new gear or loot to sell lately.  My only equipment upgrades has been getting resist gear to swap out while on ToV raids (but I do have a piece of tarnished chain arms in bank waiting to get the gems) :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">20hp on an earring, not too shabby, you've got pure ac in some slots courtesy of some JB, personally I'd leave the HP items alone unless the upgrade had more HP (chardok earrings, black sapphire electrum 2ac/35hp and varying mana on those).<br />
<br />
I'd drop the Diamond Wedding Band for another 6/65 and/or RMB for something with more AC.<br />
<br />
You've noticed the belt could use more ac, I'd say cloak, range or face could all be candidates for higher ac items, somethings gonna give if you do this pre-epic and it's gonna be wis.<br />
<br />
Get over to ME and camp the chief for a Divine Inspiration (best of both worlds in terms of wis and ac and not too hard to get just time spent and luck whilst getting exp) for range slot and see how things look after that. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to agree with Seredith on the ring - although I would probably go for a shadel bandit ring if you can get one, you lose 10hp for 55mana and some saves.<br />
<br />
If you dont mind losing some wisdom you can get a Spider Fur Belt for your waist slot for a few hundred pp.  Divine Inspiration would be very upgrade for you range item. If you have some money left over after that you could always go for a Death Mask of the Elysians for your face slot - 12ac instead of 6, or Crystal Spider Eyes as a cheaper option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advise. I have a second 6/65 ring, to be swapped in and out by situation, same as tribal war boots. RMB gets swapped with jarcrap a lot.  Face is getting a mask of war soon, and back item was the first studded acrylia piece I ever made :), so I like it for sentimental reasons.  I will look into the divine inspiration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're *only*  worried about AC, there's a 30ac ALL/ALL earring in Umbral that's not too hard to get. My group, 60 epic Monk, 60 Enchanter, 58 Cleric, 56 Epic Druid, 60 Epic Ranger with Endless Quiver and Archery Mastery3 and myself, 57 Post-Epic Paladin took him down with minimal problems. The MoBs name is Festersore, level 55 Necromancer in the second junction room of the Netherbian Caves (left wall facing out from zin). Be sure to manasieve him though, he managed to get a gate off (/rude!) and summoned our GAR to his spawn point. The GAR pretty much ended up tearing him to shreds though. Festersore's PH is unknown to me, but he *does* have one.<br />
<br />
On a side note, these caves are fun and can be challenging with one group, up to and including Tawro Icequake and his Spirit. One of my favoite spots in EQ. I recommend exploring them all with a single 55+ group you trust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There aren't too many very high ac earrings. If you have descent smithing or are willing to work it up the sanctum guardians earring from the spirit of garzicor quest is a really nice earring. Only 5ac so not a major upgrade for ya but very nice stats.<br />
<br />
For the belt you might be able to find the artificers ringmail belt, 15ac 5 wis 40hps mana. Very nice belt as far as tradable stuff goes. <br />
<br />
The bracer definitely has to go. Artificer ringmail bracer is another nice peice, 12ac 5 wis 30hps/mana and 5 sv all. Or a wis or sta bracer from Umbral, one of the dragon bracers or the new rubi bracer from CT.<br />
<br />
The divine inspiration is a good range slot item for ac and wis.<br />
<br />
The death mask or crystal eye's are both nice masks with good ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could go with jarcrap bracer instead or RMB. It gives 9ac with wis and you can get it free in karnors because no one wants it. Also you could add a couple more points with flayed turmoilskin belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dump the low ac RMB and get a real bracer.  The planar bracer has 9ac.  You can also get a sentry bracer.  Another better choice would be a supple scale armband from KC for the extended range 3.<br />
<br />
The cloak can be upgraded to a Lodi shield or Heiro cloak.<br />
<br />
For the belt, get one of those chitinous belts from FG.  Ask people who are camping the shik'nar for shards for the VT key quest to see if you can get one for cheap.  One belt seems to drop about once every 1/2 hour.  The other option is girdle of reflection from the kael quest.<br />
<br />
Oh.  And get your epic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunately I went 0/4 on the artificer's bracers (which would otherwise been known as Shamus bracer) before I run out of BDs and GMed pottery instead.  And to my knowledge there is no active barbarian smith on my server that can make the stuff with any better chance then I do.  <br />
Epic will come as soon as I manage to pick the right Fear raid for the tear.:)<br />
That chitinous belt looks like a decent alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even totemic bracers have 9ac :) Or for a bit of stamina, bracer of scavenging. Totally low end, but shouldn't be more than 200pp each :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another belt option is:<br />
<br />
Chitinous Belt<br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: WAIST<br />
AC: 13   WT: 1.0<br />
STR+5  STA+5  WIS+5  SV DISEASE+10  <br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD DRU BRD ROG MNK SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL <br />
<br />
They ae not too expnsive or you can talk to your local uber guild farming lucid shards for vex thall, these belts are quite common and often rot.  Drops in FG of the high level bug things.</div></div><hr />
