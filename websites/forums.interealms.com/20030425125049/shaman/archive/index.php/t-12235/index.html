<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, got the new shammy going (lvl 15, but fairly twinked so he'll go up quickly) and I've got my 1hb maxed, so now I'm planning to work on my piercing skill.  What weapon do you recommend?  I'd like to keep it to under 3k.  I can go a bit higher if it will make a huge difference, but I'd prefer to hold onto the plat for other upgrades.<br />
<br />
Also, should I switch weapons around 34 when I get dogdog?  If so, what do you recommend?  (so I can start shopping around in the bazaar now)<br />
<br />
One more thing...how about a 2hb wpn?  Or, should I just ignore this skill?<br />
<br />
I plan to solo for the most part until my mid 30's, by then I should catch up with a SK friend of mine.  (who's also twinked...he's almost got a full FH armor set at lvl 34)  So, once I hit 34 I'll be grouped with him at least half the time.  Once I hit 50+ I've got a good group of 6 to join up with...all 55+ by then.  Bottom line is, I expect to do very little soloing after the mid 30's.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Umm…  Actually its not.  What in the world is a REIF?  I finally have a few plats saved in the bank and I’d love to get a weapon upgrade, but it’s hard to search weapons by their abbreviation.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Runed Etched Ivy Fang I believe. Drops in kael, the manor if I remember correctly. The lowest (on Trib), I've seen it was 3.5k and it was gone before I could get to the bank and back to the seller in the bazaar. Average price seems to be 7k+ with a few people asking 10+ (saw one at 20k, no clue if it sold at that price)...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">saw one last night on Errolsi Marr for 10k...think I'll see if I can get it myself with a mid 50's group and an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rune-Etched Icewurm Fang<br />
12 damage<br />
19 delay<br />
+5 wisdom<br />
+ 30 mana (I think it's 30)<br />
Procs Spirit Strike around level 37 (81 damage cold-based - same as our level 19 spell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice.  That would be a very effective weapon to use if, like me, you need to work on your piercing skill.  Anything with a delay below twenty and decent damage is something to drool over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorgeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">REIF starts proc'ing at 35<br />
as for 2hb, if you're a barb, and can afford it, the barbarian spritist's hammer is a nice, nice thing to have,<br />
22/43 weapon that procs Winter's Roar at 30, and +13 WIS +13 INT too, they sell for around 2-5k on E Marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First,  I would and did work on all of our weapon skils at each level untill you get them close to 200.  <br />
<br />
That said, I would not spend much at all on a piercer,  I would spend the cash on a nice 2hb with a good ratio and a hast item.  At level 20 your damage caps will go up quite a bit and the 2hb will make a nice diferance in your damage output.<br />
<br />
When I was a little Ogre shaman I would solo after each ding untill each weapons skill was maxed.  At first you level so fast that skills will get left behind and I did not get them all level caped untill about level 27 or so.  I would start each level with pierce, then 1hb and then finaly I would just equip the big 2hb hammer for the rest of the level anytime I was solo.  My kill rate with the big hammer was significantly faster so I would just save it for last.<br />
<br />
I got all my weapons skills into the 170 - 180 range so that If I got somthing very nice as a drop I would be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Now at 61 I have 200 in 2hb 200 in 1hb and about 180 in pierce but I only swing the hammer while indoors between casting CanV, CanIV and torpor.<br />
<br />
level 1 to 51 almost all my damage came from 2hb.<br />
level 51 to 59 almost all my damage came from JBB.<br />
now my damage comes from spells and I spend 90% of my time generating more mana.<br />
<br />
The above does not include pet damage.<br />
<br />
For solo grinding 2hb &gt; pierce.<br />
In group selected a shield weapon combo to up your ac and mana / hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCHW, Alacrity and REIF simply and utterly destroys everything in your path. Drop an EB and have alpha dogdog chewing it's hindside and it's dead in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Once you get above 20, go with a Goranga Spear(sp?).  This is 2hp so you can't use a shield, but it has one of the best piercing ratios that you can hope to get.  It is fairly cheap too.<br />
I would have agreed with everyone that 2hb is the way to go, but there is some realy nice 1hb weapons out there now.  I was using a witchdoctor's cudjel(18/22) for a while until I got stocism and a leezard and realized that I am more efficient just tossing out a nuke or 2 will more than make up for my melee damage.<br />
But, after I get canni 4 I think I may go back to melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Howee_C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been looking for a REIF on The Rathe and haven't seen one in months. :(<br />
<br />
Picked up a Granite Face Grinder a few months back (29/36 10str/wis/int, 2hb) and almost have the skill maxed. An ogre just looks RIGHT with a big-ass hammer in hand. :) Plus it's nice to see those hits for 90+...<br />
<br />
Talisman of Altuna, Guardian, Stamina, Chloro, Alacrity myself, alacrity on dogdog, get in mobs face, smash it with hammer, repeat.<br />
<br />
Still plan on keeping an eye out for a REIF, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye on Terris thule you will see a reif about once a week for sale or sometimes once a month i picked mine up for 6kpp,<br />
and like it alot but i have 2hb and 1hb weopons also to skill up with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">just picked up an REIF for 300 plat in the bazaar!   :D   Can't wait for this weekend when I can try it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can also look for the Tribunal Loyalist's Spear, 11/19 10AC 35Mana 35HP 5sta 5wis 5svf, procs light healing... should be priced close to a REIF...<br />
<br />
For a nice but cheap 2HB, I recommend the Tarnished Drive Shaft - ( 23 DMG 30 DLY 7.5 WT, 8 AC, +65 MANA, +65 HP, +10 INT, +7 STA, +10 WIS, +15 SV POISON) These are going for about 1.1 - 1.5k on vazaelle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tribunal Loyalist Spear has a recommended level of 51, so I don't recommend it for a young shaman.<br />
<br />
I do recommend that you work on 2hblunt, because you never know what sweet weapon is going to fall into your lap.  For 2hblunt go get a fast one, like either the Abandoned orc shovel (free .. pick it up in Lake Rathe in an orc tent) or the Tae Ew Hammer of Aggression (low delay on this).  Both are excellent if all you're after is skill.<br />
<br />
As for 1hblunt, there is a sweet 8/18 blunt that drops off the gorangas in dawnshroud peak right next to the zone in to ME.  It's no drop, and extremely fast so its also great for getting your skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I do recommend that you work on 2hblunt <br />
<br />
Best 2HB I've seen for pre 50's for skillup is Poison Wind Censer:<br />
Dmg 20, Dly 28. +5 Str -30 vsPos +5.00 Wt  It procs at lvl 50, so when you reach 50 change to tarnished driveshaft, otherwise the AOE poison proc combined with the -30 poison resist could be messy =) N.B. mobs that poison would best be avoided too..... Mine cost 100pp from memory. Nice graphic.<br />
