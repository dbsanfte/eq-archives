<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When PoP came out we had a thread comparing turn-in results for spells, and it looked like a pretty even distribution.  Nevertheless I'm unalbe to find the new heals, Khura's mending, Blessing of Reverence and Quintessence for sale on Xev.  I run a 24/7 bazaar mule, so I usually am pretty up to date on the offerings.  Every spell is available, usually in multiples, but those 3. Are they rarer as turn-in results or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Khura's mending never went live.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Reverence is a CLR spell haste buff. :p<br />
Blessing of Replenishment on the other hand is shared by druids and shaman and still seems to fetch a fairly high price due to the larger demand, so it's quite possible that it's just bought up anytime it's for sale at a reasonable price on your server.<br />
<br />
Quiessence is a lvl 65 spell and runes aren't common anywhere pre-Elemental Planes, so I wouldn't expect to see a lot of level 65 spells of any sort for sale often or cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone will put it out there....but the previous poster is correct.  There have been 3 copies of Quiessence  in the bazaar on Rodcet Nife in teh last month...highest price was 150K, lowest was 100K.  <br />
<br />
Probably less work to get to 65 and then farm runes than collect 100K...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for the corrections, especially that I can give up on Khura's (someone tell the peeps on eqcasters about that).  <br />
In regards to farming runes, I can farm 100 k on good weekend, winning the rolls on the few runes I might see in a month is less likely. <br />
Since we're dicussing prices, currently on Xev, FA is 30 k, Fo7 and BoS 60 k and  malos 75 k.  Doesn't seem to be too unobtainable, and prices are dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm curious as to what you are farming to make 100k in a weekend, i could use some pp to buy spells myself  :confused:</div></div><hr />
