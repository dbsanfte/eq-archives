<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On Brell this guy is so easily farmed these days that finding him up is less likely than winning the lottery.<br />
<br />
He is the last flag I need and proving to be impossible to get, any other servers having the same problem?<br />
<br />
Barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup.  On Quellious, VZ and TZ are both farmed heavily.   Difficult to find either up for more then a few hours.<br />
<br />
Same is with behemoth.  They really really need to make behemoth a 24hour reset on failure rather then three flipping days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same on Tunare.  I know a whole lot of people that are stuck on VZ from our raid group as the last to get EP.<br />
<br />
Along the same lines... just logged off 2 hours ago from our very first RZ kill!   Was a blast and was good to get him out of the way.  Haven't even zoned into any EP yet.    We got him on our 4th try and had 44 folks.<br />
<br />
First try: Popped him and got him to 40% (not bad for a first try)<br />
Second try: Popped him and he despawned since we had too many deaths :/<br />
Third try: Popped him and got him to 5% :/<br />
Fourth try: 4 Folks left and we were down to 44.  But we smoked him.  Not trying to compair penis size, but we did get quite a few compliments for our first kill and only our 4th try having that few people.  What's the least other folks have gotten RZ with?  I'm expecting Time folks to say they one group him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think VZ is easy to backflag on emarr.  Extremely fast and easy target when isnt too heavily farmed here.  You keep an eye on him and hell pop during raid times before long.  Also a fun fight to AE lol.  8 VZs in camp at a time with wizards tanking is some fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So many people know how to one group him that it's impossible to get him on Tunare.  It really surprises me Korask that you can easily find him up on any server...  folks in PoT for xp see he's up and go smoke him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">TZ and VZ are both very hard to find up on Xegony, there are a couple people that 3 or 4 box him and sell the loot and flags whenever they are up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im not sure as I hope I never ever ever have to see his ugly butt again.  He was the LAST guy I needed for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, a lil off topic.  Something we do on our server (not sure if you do it on yours, but a suggestion anyway)  is Flag Sharing.  Most of the PoP raiding guilds allow a few other guilds' members in on flagging raids, and vice versa.  It helps a lot on flagging mobs that are heavily farmed.  Just a suggestion that maybe you could propose to your officers (if you guys dont already have something like this).  1 guild can start it and end up with many participating as it benefits almost everyone.  I hope this helps some.  GL getting that ugly mo-fo, and when you do kick him once for me :D</div></div><hr />
