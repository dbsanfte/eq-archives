<br />
Once again, things are getting much easier for newbies.  <br />
<br />
Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay. <br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean that all characters that do NOT have a skill of 200 in sense heading (All my characters 45 and over do, but not those under) will recieve the 'update' and be put at 200?  Or is it just for those starting out?<br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier.<br />
<br />
Uhh, why?  Usually the flashing name above the mobs head is enough for me, except when you have multiple mobs that don't have names.  /shrug  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And with the update after that they're going to insert the ability /wipe. THis makes it so that a SOE representative comes over to your house and wipes your ass for you. With this patch comes /pissbucket, /Papajohns, /Chinese, /hookersandbooze, and /labatomy.<br />
<br />
Thank you SOE! Now I just need someone to breathe for me and I'm set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think its bad to have sense heading starting out at 200, I mean getting it to 200 was tedious anyway.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature<br />
<br />
Ewww! they have this sort of thing on Horizons beta and i really dislike it, cant think of any reason why you would want this....A tell window is just as good.</div></div><hr />

I've have a lot of accomplishment I'm proud of in the context of a computer game, but mindlessly pushing buttons or hitting 200 in sense heading isn't one of the big ones accomplishment on my EQ memories mantle. I guess I don't mind if SOE trivializes that achievment. I'm an odd one, when they removed the spell book I was cheering for all the lowbies, even tho I had suffered 3 toons with that pointless &quot;feature&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lots of things have dumbed down Everquest but the changes to make it easier on true newbs have nothing to do with it. I'll tell ya what ruined EQ, PoP and graveyards. No more thrill of being deep in a dungeon hoping you can hold your own with 10 mana left. *shrug* who care, we die we pop back, no nasty cr, get a quick click rez.......coffins, what are coffins, cr.....why? <br />
<br />
Sorry I won't go on, its a pet peeve when I see the &quot;I walked uphill to school in the snow&quot; routine over simple changes. Over on the bard board they are indignant and acting as if they gave every newb NToV loot and bard speed, lol.</div></div><hr />

The sense heading isn't that big of a deal.  If you hunt in outdoor zones just look at the sky.<br />

usualy i dont care much about aggro playing fico as i can backup heal and tank but lately have been playing my alts and it is just dangerous to group with a warrior in group. i guess warriors still going to be /ignore when i am making my groups.<br />

(sorry for irrelevant blah blah but i am just frustrated having warriors in my group... they totaly ruin my grouping experience)<br />

I am firmly of the opinion that if you have over 50 days played on one character, you should be able to testbuff a character up to the level of your character or level 30 whichever is lower. This would allow me to continue to have fun playing the game. Sorry, pre-30 is boring as hell after the 100th time of doing it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you there. I've played a lot of different characters and the lower levels are a pain in the butt after you've done them so many times. That's the reason people twink their alts, to go through as fast as they can. It'd be kind of nice if they added something like this.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, there would probably be many more underused zones than there are now, and true newbies would never find a group pre-30 - which would kind of hurt warriors and other non-soloers more than the rest. Another reason is people who do play for 50+ days and switch classes may not know how to play that class. If you thought shamans who don't know how to cannibalize were bad, this would make it worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">thats a load of crap, if you dont want to deal with the lower levels, buy a character from ebay.  Just because someone has played one character for 50+ days doesnt mean anything except that you spent 50 days on that character.  <br />
<br />
If newb lvls are a pain in the butt then either bite your lip or dont make an alt.  The idea that someone is entitled to anything because they have an older character or because low levels are beneith them and they shouldnt not be bothered by the tedium is ludacrious and stupid.<br />
<br />
the way lvls work is you go 1-65 people, not 20-65 or 30-65 i dont care how many days youve played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the way lvls work is you go 1-65 people, not 20-65 or 30-65 i dont care how many days youve played.<br />
<br />
Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">3 reasons<br />
<br />
1. Think about it, would your character be the same if he/she skipped lvls 1-30? I know i wouldnt, i learned ALOT about the class in places like LoIO (i learned not to be a druman at the windmill)<br />
<br />
2. I dont mind things like twinking, PLing, etc. because i feel (and this may be your point) that higher lvls have the right to use what theyved earned.  But i think twinking and PLing go far enough and being able to skip those lvls alltogether would be just unfair.<br />
<br />
3. I think its easy enough to xp from naked lvl 1 as it is, and it annoys me to think that others think the xp in places like paladuls is slow and boring, (i made 8 lvls in 1 day soloing in PC on a ranger with maybe 5k in gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Back in the day.... perhaps this was true... but not anymore, not of any skilled player.<br />
<br />
I did my shaman to 65 in about a month and a half... thats not bragging... others do it faster I'm sure... the point is... I blazed through 1-30 in a couple of days... they were an annoyance.    <br />
<br />
I didn't know EVERY detail about being a good shaman (hell, I probably don't know, can always learn something)... but I knew a lot... I knew how to use dots... kite... root...  heal... slow.... etc...  why?   Because I played a cleric and enchanter.    The shaman doesn't really offer anything new over those.... if I had a level 65 cleric on an account.... why not let me /testbuff a higher level character.<br />
<br />
If you have one high level character... unless you simply don't pay attention... or soloed yourself off bodyguards in EW all your life... you know about other classes.   <br />
<br />
It is different to play that class and learn it's exact strengths and weaknesses... but it's not like your an idiot.<br />
<br />
I know what a wizard does... I would make a fine wizard... I'd have to learn just how far I can nuke... but I have an idea.<br />
<br />
Some classes are harder... cold playing an enchanter in high stress groups... that could be rough... but if your other character worked with enchanters (or bards) in the past... you know what the deal is... starting at level 30 won't have any affect on that... hell pre-50 find any groups willing to need res... they just want a clarity bitch :)<br />
<br />
So I would fully suppot /testbuff if you have an existing 65 character on your account.   Call it a reward for being 65 and breath new life into the game.     Allow you to testbuff to 50.... 50-65 is the time sink anyhow.<br />
<br />
Since getting to 65 is easy (even for casual, non-uber player ... just takes more time).... it's there for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dumb question INC: What's the /testbuff command do?<br />
<br />
And, EDIT: I must really suck 'cause I've played for almost three years now, and I'm only 54... &gt;.&lt; I don't think getting to 65 is easy at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">3 reasons<br />

<br />
Three responses. 1) Places like LoIO usually have 1-5 people at prime time. There are very few real newbies anymore. 2) If I can't play a level 30 of any class after leveling to post-60 or hell even post-55 I should be beaten. 3) Would my character be the same without 1-30? Sure. Would I as a player? No. But this only goes for the first couple times lol. After a couple it is pointless.<br />
<br />
2. I dont mind things like twinking, PLing, etc. because i feel (and this may be your point) that higher lvls have the right to use what theyved earned.  But i think twinking and PLing go far enough and being able to skip those lvls alltogether would be just unfair.<br />
<br />
I don't see any logical reasoning at all in this. Not trying to be mean but try as I might I really can't see it.<br />
<br />
3. I think its easy enough to xp from naked lvl 1 as it is, and it annoys me to think that others think the xp in places like paladuls is slow and boring, (i made 8 lvls in 1 day soloing in PC on a ranger with maybe 5k in gear)<br />
<br />
Slow? No. Boring? Hell yes. What will I learn about the game killing my 15000th bandit on my 8th twink? Nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sariss,<br />
I think you are missing one very important aspect of the game (when you talked about going from 1-65 in a month and a Half).  I am assuming that you have another toon/alt, and that you were used to the game mechanics of EQ, and you possibly had a little better starting equipment/cash to help your shaman on its way.  The brand new player doesn't have that, and the best way for them to learn, is to &quot;tough it out&quot;.  I know it did for me.  Going on 30 min corpse runs in EFP (by the river [near the icy orc temple]).  Now THAT is what taught me what to do, and not do!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Main reason nothing like testbuff should go to live servers for ANYONE is that it'd really hurt the true newbies.  There aren't that many true newbies coming into EQ like there were 2 years ago or so.  Low level areas that used to be packed and plagued by KSing and camp stealing now have 1-2 groups total in them.  Allowing people to skip those levels completely would just utterly gut those zones and make life for the true newbies a lot worse trying to find a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Soooo.... start the newbies at level 20 or 30 and convert all the lower zones into higher-level grind zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The targeting is a pathetic change if it goes live.  It's like the glowing hockey puck on some US televised hockey games.  If you haven't figured it out, you're likely not going to be watching anyway.  The game is getting dummied down badly enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Just last night I had a DB conn cleric ask me for Focus in PoK, when I mentioned that most clerics do not request this, she goes, &quot;I want the HP&quot;.  I don't have an issue making stuff easy for lowbies, but I have a problem that one day I may be grouped with these people and their ignorance might be the difference between success and failure.<br />
<br />
I am totally against testbuff, I am totally against the targeting changes, if they want to simplify targeting, go back to the &quot;an_orc_pawn_02&quot; labels in the targeting window.  Otherwise, don't add features that will malfuntion, slow down my EQ Client and otherwise put less informed and experienced players in my level range.  It's not like I want uberplayerXX in my group, I just want people to experience the game, including the pain of the lower levels so that when they get to the point where they can group with me, they actually know their class and they're not getting me killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd say the targetting thing wasn't needed, but I've had the situation too often with mobs of the same name with no VISIBLE name standing together that I can see the benefit of it.<br />
<br />
As for Sense Heading... I'm a bit disappointed.  Every single character I have has maxed SH for his level, it was just a bonus for me for being dilligent, but I agree it was kind of a pain.<br />
<br />
Now, for testbuff... I'd be ok with, if you have a character of ... 60?  65?  Being able to /testbuff your others (minus gear) to 20, mayyyybe 25.  Seriously, until then the classes are fairly generic and it's just a question of grinding the 30 hours plus.  It's not until the upper 20s to 30s that the classes really start to diversify and you learn to play YOUR CLASS, as opposed to your first toon, where getting to 20 was an exercize in just learning to play period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm trying real hard to see why 200 sense heading for all, and a backpacks for noob, would be considered dumbing the game down.<br />

If the targeting system is an option, I won't lose sleep over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Call me an idiot, but I used to get lost all the time in EFP.  It wasn't until I was lvl14, that I bought a compass (talk about a life saver!!), untill then, I had to gate alot!!  Getting sense heading to 200 is easy as heck, once you figure out the Macro's, but I think its something that all new players should experiance (for thier own good).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
...I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Newbies are a higher priority than the ****hole that is the 55+ game...<br />
I don't think so.  Whole expansions are geared to the higher end game alla PoP, Velious, Luclin, mostly LDoN.  The fact that they add a few features that are geared exclusivly to the lower end of the game just means they aren't concentrating exclusively on the higher end game.  I don't think this is a bad thing, I just think the changes they choose to make are questionable.<br />
<br />
An example of this is the sense heading.  I learned a lot about macros while maxxing my sense heading.  There seems little need now for newb's to learn about macros at lower levels for the most part.<br />
<br />
The targeting thing is pathetic.  Basically your target glows in the dark like it's been watching TV too closely for an extended period of time.  I got a really bad feeling about this one.  People need to learn what happens when you keep targeting the wrong mob.  I'd rather see the old tags go back up with the numbered label.  People might use the assist less often, that can be dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well good Lord.  Giving a poor newbie a backback and the ability to tell what direction they are facing in is HARDLY dumbing down the game.  <br />
<br />
I didn't know that the npc's name flashed when you targetted it.. Learn something new every day!  I am for the targetting change, though.  I suppose I'll have to turn on particles for it.<br />
<br />
Now, dumbing down the game would be creating a tracking &quot;path&quot; and a &quot;find&quot; feature, like in SWG.  Of course, I'd be for it, since I get lost horribly!  but since EQ has never had it, I think people would flip out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">As far as making the game easier for newbies I don't see a problem with that. First time I played this game on my own just after launch, the UI was so cumbersome it was a serious PITA to acomplish simple tasks. It wasn't until two years later when I started playing with some friends that had played a a while that I actually liked the game. What they've done for the low level game is very good to attract new people which from a business standpoint is something they are really going to need to do if a lot of the old time players are just hanging out until something better comes along. The possible new graphics engine will also be something aimed at gaining more new people imo. <br />
<br />
I personally would love the idea that anyone with a 50 or 60 character on an account could use /testbuff to make a new 25. Its not going to hurt any true newbies because those same people that would use this are most likely going to solo or PL their way up to 25 anyways. I don't think I've ever onced joined a non family group with one of my alts until he was 50+. <br />
<br />
People keep saying they're dumbing the game down. I just think that they are trying to make it easier to learn. Learning curve for a game is one of the things that retains new people past the first few weeks. EQ used to be really hard to get used too unless you had people you could ask for help. Where is a true newb going to turn for help now when their zones are deserted?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
However giving that same newbie ingame maps with a 200 skill sense heading that makes a &quot;you are here&quot; arrow appear on said map IS. Having an automatic 200 sense heading is nice, it's tedium removal, I agree with it. The in game maps really took a lot of the immersion out of the game for me though. I remember taking 3 days to figure out how to get from Akannon to Butcherblock waaay back, and it was fun. Used to be you had to be carefull going to a new zone. Even with an eqatlas map you could still get lost in unfamiliar territory. I kind of miss that aspect of the game even if I find the maps pretty practical.  Personally I think they should remove the &quot;you are here&quot; indicator and just make the maps something you consult the same way you'd consult a printed map to figure out where you are. Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

But hell I shouldn't have been able to max my char out in a months time not in an entirely new game.  Anyway thats a bitch for another place).<br />
<br />
If they could impliment waypoints (at least outdoor) I'd be lovin it.   Waypoints for those of you that didnt play SWG were beacons of light that you could create at points of interest (if you had something targetted it would make the beacon there).  You could send this waypoint to others via in game e-mail (wouldn't mind a feature like that within EQ - if even outside of the game at the login screen...just to e-mail guilds and what not to inform them on raids -- some people forget to go to the web site :P).<br />
<br />
No comment on the rest, but some food for thought.  DAoC has had the ability to create level 20 characters (max there is 50 still :) ) for quite some time...bout mmm.. 6 months if I remember right.  It hasn't ruined the game :).  Of course DAoC's world is like 1/5th the size to a n00b from EQ.  ANd people always use the LFG &amp; LFM tool as you have no ability to /shout /ooc in an entire 'zone' in it.  I'd love it if more people used LFG &amp; LFM in EQ (LDoN has upped the usage at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">All this over a bag and and no tedium raising sense heading? They both sound like fine changes to me. True newbies don't know to run to a quest giver to get a free bag. It's not going to hurt the game if they have a free bag to start with. And the hassle of raising sense heading added nothing to the game, except the occasional opportunity to snicker a high level character who'd never bothered. <br />
<br />
Now, /testbuff to something in the 20-30 range? That'd be fun. I'd have a blast experimenting with all the different character classes. No, wait, it wouldn't be right. The RIGHT way to have a L 24 alt is to buy him a bunch of gear in the bazaar and PL him to L 24 with my wife's L 65 cleric in a few hours. That really teaches me how to play him.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Newbies are a higher priority than the ****hole that is the 55+ game...<br />
<br />
<br />
...I guess.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. On one side everyone complains about the 55+ game. On the otherside, folks want to testbuff their way to 55+ to fill it up even more. Skip 80% of the content and then complain about the lack of 55+ content? Its beyond me. <br />
<br />
I think the game has changed enough since 1999 that a complete WIPE is in order. Start everyone over with their pre-equipped rusties, bag and 200 sense heading. Just kidding.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Sony wants online gaming to eventually compete for customers with TV, movies and other mass media entertainment. That means its going to get dumber and dumber and dumber and cater ever less to the &quot;uber&quot; crowd. Mass market economics will eventually force this. Conversely, this will make a nice niche market for games that cater to the so-called &quot;uber crowd&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Careful what you wish for... Patches have been known to do wierd things and I, for one, dont want to discover that fun bug...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok death was ok now for re....WAIT A SECOND!!! Why am i level 1 with a spear in my hand and 200 sense heading??!  Oh well, at least i have a nifty bag that matches my outfit so perfectly.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier.<br />
<br />
This isn't just for newbies.  This is *great* for rangers at near to max archery range on raids for example.  Mobs of similar name you can't really tell which is flashing at 200 range.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">try being an enchanter in a crowd of 5 critters all the same, targeting thing would be very, very nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Quote from Darkpaw:<br />
I personally would love the idea that anyone with a 50 or 60 character on an account could use /testbuff to make a new 25. Its not going to hurt any true newbies because those same people that would use this are most likely going to solo or PL their way up to 25 anyways. I don't think I've ever onced joined a non family group with one of my alts until he was 50+. <br />

===================================<br />
Humm, so if I'm a noob and I buy an ebay account, I can create and play seven level 30 Chars that I know nothing about.  No harm there, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">/testbuff to 30 would be nice.  Then I wouldn't have to level up port-bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">i would laugh my ass off if they did an unscheduled wipe the day eq2 comes out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">. . . but I suppose the next generation of EQ addicts will be spoiled. =p<br />
<br />
Um, you mean this generation (and the last 2 or 3, for that matter) ISN'T spoiled? LOL. Thats a good one. <br />
<br />
1K pp will buy a set of gear better than what I was wearing the first time I charged Nagafen in the Fall of 99. To get that 1K pp, a newbie need only kill spiders, and sell the silks for 3-5 pp EACH. Not per stack, but EACH. Or any other number of farmable low level items that are Bazaar consumables and sell well and consistantly. <br />
<br />
NOTE: This is not intended to be an &quot;Uphill, both ways, in the snow&quot; post. I wouldn't trade those early days of EQ for anything. Nothing in the game today can raise those prickly hairs on the back of my neck like that first time I pulled from the House in Unrest, or wandered down the zone wall of Lesser Fay at night and ran into the Brownies, or that feeling I got in the pit of my stomach the first time I charged Nagafen. I actually feel sorry for newbies today, they will never get to experience that, at least not to the degree I did.</div></div><hr />
