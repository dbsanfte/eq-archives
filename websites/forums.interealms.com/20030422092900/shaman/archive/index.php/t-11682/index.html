1.  where did the front page to the crucible go?  the one that had links to all the spells (not just 35+ spells)?  the one that had ALL the cool quests listed?  please tell me how to access that GOOD info.<br />
<br />
2.  the real topic, how do i gain faction with the dark elf cleric to get this quest going?  i researched alakazam and they said there was a DE in grobb that you could get a note from and turn it in to the quest giver.  is this how it is done?  isn't grobb under seige from the froggies?  i've never been there so i dont konw.  lol.  oh yeah, i'm an innoruuk worshipping troll shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started this quest in Neriak with a Troll Shaman twink I had a while back when i reconsidered starting over. To my knowledge I never had to go to Grobb during the course of this quest.<br />
<br />
To gain faction needed to do this quest is simple: Kill Halflings in Nektulos and do the head/necklace turn-in quests. (Look under Quests by Zone - Neriak for more information).</div></div><hr />

Well, yes, that was one way to gain the faction needed to start the Symbol quests. Obviously, it won't work any more since we were kicked out of Grobb 5 weeks ago :(<br />
<br />
However, there has always been another way of raising your faction with the DE Clerics. Go to the East Freeport underground tunnels and find the Necro guild. They should be indifferent to an Inny worshipping Troll. Go upstairs and through the breach in the wall. Go through the closed door in the room that emerge in. There you will find Opal Darkbriar (sp?) and yet another sister of the DE Cleric that you need to get on the good side of. Talk to her and she will give you a note for him. Deliver the note and you go from apprehensive to amiable in .3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, you need to do this FedEx quest twice to get to a higher shade of amiable before he gives you the first Symbol quest. I can't confirm it since even though I have done the FedEx quest twice, I haven't started the symbol quests yet.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you try to get to the Freeport Necro guild from the Freeport PoK book and walk on the pool ledge, you will probably fall off and get ambushed by 3 Drowned Citizens (level 11-13?) like I did. Wolf Form definitely helps there, but I suspect that levitation will also work.<br />
