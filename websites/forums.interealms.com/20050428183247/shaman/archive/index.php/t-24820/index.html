 New Raid Encounters<br />
  Rumors of Onyxia, an enormous black dragon, have been heard through<br />
  out Azeroth. Be sure to bring many brave warriors for she won’t<br />
  take kindly to intruders in her lair. Both factions will need to<br />
  complete unique, and challenging quests to gain access to the<br />
  Onyxia encounter.  **During the beta testing there will be a <br />
  temporary placeholder vendor who sells keys to Onyxia’s lair for <br />
  testing purposes. <br />
<br />
  Discovered in the heart of Blackrock Mountain beyond the Depths, <br />
  lies the Molten Core.  Within the Molten Core lives a multitude of <br />
  ancient and powerful evil.  Adventurers be ware, for the dangers found <br />
  within the Molten Core are many and takes many forms.<br />
<br />
  **Raid loot is being worked on and temporary loot has been placed in <br />
  raid encounters <br />
<br />
<br />
 New Kodo mounts!<br />
  There is but one creature in all of Kalimdor that possesses the <br />
  strength and stamina to bear a tauren rider into battle: the <br />
  majestic kodo beast. Swifter and slightly smaller than their <br />
  wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same <br />
  resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits <br />
  that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It <br />
  is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection <br />
  of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that <br />
  approach them with honor and respect in <br />
  their hearts.<br />
<br />
  Tauren players will no longer have the Plainsrunning ability, due <br />
  to the availability of Kodo mounts!  Tauren players can purchase the <br />
  Kodo mount at Bloodhoof village.<br />
<br />
  **Currently there is an active bug that prevents players from <br />
  purchasing mounts from different races regarding of reputation, this <br />
  bug will be addressed in the next patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
 General<br />
- Higher level dungeon monsters (level 30+) have had their experience <br />
  values increased.<br />

  (to compensate for the dungeon monster change).<br />
- On death, all eqipped items will lose 10% durability.<br />
- Durability loss through fighting has been decreased (mainly to <br />
  accommodate the new penalty for dying)<br />
- The penalty for using a Spirit Healer has been changed - there is no <br />
  longer any experience loss, instead all items (equipped and <br />
  inventory) will take 100% durability loss and the character will gain <br />
  resurrection sickness for a duration that scale according to level.<br />

 Mac<br />
  Shader based options are still disabled on the Mac client and are <br />
  awaiting release of driver bug fixes from Apple and GPU vendors. We will <br />
  release a patch to re-enable shader based graphic effects in Mac WoW when <br />
  that becomes feasible<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
- Monsters with extra dodge chances have been corrected.<br />
- Abilities that activate off critical hits work off critical hits from <br />
  abilities as well (Blood Craze, Enrage).<br />
- Blessing of salvation correctly affects healing over time spells.<br />
- If you tame the leader of a herd of Kodo with the Kodo Kombobulator the <br />
  whole herd won't follow you.<br />
- If you close the disenchanting loot pane without looting the item, the <br />
  Dust or Essence or Shard is automatically looted for you.  (You no <br />
  longer destroy the enchanted item if you close the loot pane with the <br />
  results of the disenchantment)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Miscellaneous<br />
- Vocal emotes now display a normal emote to the chat window, instead of <br />
  the &quot;Player says...&quot; text.  Voice Emote Audio is unchanged.   <br />
- There is now a checkbox to turn off audio emotes.<br />
- Many boxes and crates ready to be looted have been added around the <br />
  world.<br />
- Many new rare vendors selling weapons/armor/potions have been added <br />
  around the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lots and lots and lots of negative response to this patch on the WoW forums.  Any input from your perspective?  I'm getting ready to ban myself from reading those boards for fear of starting off on a bad note with WoW.  <br />
<br />
Is there overreaction or is this patch not as bad as everyone says.  Seems almost universally bad though.<br />

/em very worried with only 2 weeks left :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear ya on the &quot;self imposed ban from the forums&quot;. Offical forums are usually nothing more than a bitchfest anyway.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried the new changes, but just from previous experience with some of the items<br />
<br />
- 10% durability penalty is fine<br />
- 100% durability penalty on resurrection is NOT<br />
- 30 minute resurrection sickness is NOT<br />
- reagents for many of the spells that now require them is just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Currently, those are my only issues with the patch. Again, I haven't experienced any of the changes first hand since we haven't played since the patch. I'm willing to give it a go, AND give Blizz the opportunity to tweak it back a bit.<br />
<br />
One thing I've seen repeatedly from them over the course of the beta...they tend to introduce new functionality &quot;in the extreme&quot; at first, then gently dial it back until the hysteria dies down to a low grumble at most. :)<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The WoW boards, in my experience, are about 90% whine-fest vs fanbois and 10% useful and interesting information.  If you read them thinking very little is worthwhile (or honest, or truthful, or intellectual), you will occasionally be pleasantly surprised.  :) <br />
<br />
- 100% durability penalty on resurrection is NOT<br />
- 30 minute resurrection sickness is NOT<br />
To be specific, these two penalties are only for those cases in which you resurrect using a graveyard spirit.  Fellow player resurrection costs you the 10% durability penalty of any death and a 5 minute rez sickness (based on my experience this morning).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where Blizzard is trying to go with this latest rez change.  Perhaps the &quot;we never ever want to lose experience for any reason&quot; faction won out in their thinking.  Perhaps they are turning the death penalty from a time penalty (lost experience) to a monetary penalty (pay to restore durability).  <br />
<br />
Folks are upset by the requirement for reagents in particular spells (underwater breathing, portal, etc) - I gues as an old EQ guy it doesn't much mater to me.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, there's a lot of nice improvements.  I like the new racial traits - can't wait to try out War Stomp with my Tauren!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My brother just told me that the servers are coming down in the next few minutes.<br />
<br />
Could it be so they can fine tune some of the extremes introduced in last nights patch?<br />
<br />
One can hope! :)<br />
<br />
On a related note, his level 7 NE Warrior died. Cost him 2s 46c to repair all of his gear after getting a rez at the spirit healer. He didn't see any rez sickness icon and I didn't know exactly what to tell him to look for.<br />
<br />
At level 7 (for an untwinked true newb), that's a substantial chunk-o-change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A quick note on the rez change:<br />
<br />
It is screwing up PvP alot. The rez sickness penalty renders you practically uses if you're a melee and the cost of fixing your gear over and over adds up. <br />
<br />
Me (18 Druid) and two lvl 20 rogues died from a server crash last night and ended up rezing at the Spirit Healer. We were then slaughtered mercilessly by a lvl 20 Mage who happened to be running by the Healer area while we were attempted to recuperate. Nothing we could do about it.<br />
<br />
At least from the PvP perspective, this change does nothing but penalize PvPers. I'd be 12 thumbs up if this were reverted  back to pre-patch, xp loss only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are already planning to take the durability penalty out for PvP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I've actually taken the in-town resurrection once... it just doesn't bother me to run back to my corpse, and I've never been unable to find a safe place to hit the resurrection button.  I'm fairly confident that - as has been said above - they'll tone the durability loss back over time.  It's almost as if they enjoy watching the screaming bitchfest on the boards.  I think I read somewhere that they posted something about not even bothering to read the replies until 3 days after a patch, anyway.<br />
<br />
As for PvP... well... I think trying to make one ruleset to fairly cover both PvP and PvE is insane, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I most definitely agree there will be changes made to it. I'm not upset over the changes, after all, beta == changes. I don't however think that the game needed a stiffer death penalty. I believe some people are saddely conditioned to believe that if they die they need to be penalized, as if time and morale loss wasn't enough. <br />
<br />
As for the rez thing, all 3 of us had to use the Spirit Healer, because when the server crashed, alot of people ended up falling through the world upon relogging. This was right after the patch, and we figured GM's would be swamped so why not just eat it and see how the new penalties affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
Overall though, the game keeps looking better and better, and I'm having the most fun I've had in along time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, hate the death/durability thing. Died 3x and after the fights, had to cough up 4sp. That happend 2x during the day. Love the NE stealth. If I sit in green grass, hit stealth, I am almost invisible due to wearing green robes. (Priest). Time is just flying when I play this game. Had 17 quests at one time and just not enough time to play. <br />
<br />
Why Oh Why can't I win the lottery!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So like what is the CHEAPEST class to play?<br />
<br />
meaning:<br />
<br />
What is that class that loses least durability? I am starting my first char in a game where i don't know what to farm to make cash and I won't have cash for anything so melee is out of question i would think (correct me if i am wrong here).<br />
So out of casters which is best? Do warlocks use regents or is it just mag and shm?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The new spell reagent requirements kinda balance out the cost of playing a caster with the cost of playing a melee (considering their durability hits).<br />
<br />
Start whichever race/class sounds most appealing to you. Don't let these changes influence that decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">@Soulstorm,<br />
<br />
     I agree with Valgoth, one thing I've noticed about this game is that there perspective on loot and mobs that drop it is completely different then what you're accustomed to in EQ. As far as I've seen, when you see a named mob, you have no incentive to kill it, because %99.9999 percent of the time, it's related to a quest. Unless someone shares the quest with you or you've taken it, it drops nothing if you kill it. Everyday mobs have a chance of dropping good, usable loot for the level of the mob. Camping drops doesn't really exist in this game. Also at the same time you'll be getting xp, coin and nice gear from doing quest. You want better gear? Go to an area with higher level mobs and start questing/killing. I am not high enough lvl to comment on what this situation is like at the end game content, but my impression is that this trend will continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you for the replies.<br />
<br />
But...do warlocks use these new regents?<br />
<br />
See i know they got their own version of the &quot;essence emeralds&quot; from eq1 but do they also have regents that cost cash to buy?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My Warlock is only 11, so hasn't encountered any reagent requirements beyond the Soul Shards for the Void Walker pet. Even so, we can create those ourselves by striking the killing blow with a spell called &quot;Drain Soul&quot;. <br />
<br />
There may be other reagents required in the higher level game, but I haven't gotten there yet. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From the patch notes it doesn't look like warlocks were given any spells that require purchased reagents.  Reagents were mostly added to spell types that warlocks don't really get like buffs (not self only.)  Though soul shards are quite a pain around level 20 when you have pets and healthstones that require 1 soul shard and soulstones that require two and generally very limited bag space at 20.  They don't stack so I devote a whole 8 slot bag to soul shards and seem to always be running low.  At least you don't have to pay anything for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Players will only receive a 25% durability loss instead of 100% when using a Spirit Healer to resurrect <br />
<br />
- Players will now only incur a maximum 10 minutes of resurrection sickness instead of 30 minutes when using a Spirit Healer to resurrect <br />
<br />
- Some key buff spells will have their reagent requirements removed<br />
Standard Blizzard act - they get after stuff pretty responsively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It only made sense they said the penalty was here to stay but how harsh a penalty was more flexible. I think it's decent.<br />
I notice that there is a n increase in costs to repair my stuff. It's still negligeable at my level (11) but i wiwll get to the later levels before i judge. So far i can tell one thing. Making stuff yourself through tradeskills IS WAY EASIER than buying stuff. Quested rewards own too. Buying stuff from merchants sucks tho.<br />
<br />
I have a skill of 48 in tailoring and i'm making bags and stuff with stats already :)<br />
<br />
It did cost a pretty penny to get to this skill cause of LINEN (grr you will all learn to hate linen :P)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The equipment penalty is garbage, IMO.<br />
<br />
The other night I was on my orc warrior and had to do a quest in BFE.  It took me about 10 minutes to run there from the nearest city, and I got ambushed by a horde of lions 3 levels above me (they were lying down, as if dead, so I ran through them).<br />
<br />
Now, as my warrior only had 185hp, and they were hitting me for about 15 damage each, I went down pretty fast.<br />
<br />
I died four times trying to get my body.. That's 40 minutes run time. <br />
<br />
At that point I said forget it and took the res penalty.. yay!<br />
<br />
Ok, so I go to repair my gear and am told it will cost me 6sp 40cp ....<br />
<br />
Now, I had 1sp 12cp...<br />
<br />
Wow, that's SOOO much better than losing a couple hundred xp.</div></div><hr />
