Wouldn't matter for mass group BUFF. It doesn't have an icon or a duration so it isn't a buff. Untill they change that you can't mass group BUFF it.</div></div><hr />

isnt it 3045 damage?  Think you were counting 6 ticks per minute instead of 10.  And its duration is 2.1 atm.  Thirteen ticks would be 1885, twentyone would be 3045.  Either way im not a fan of disease dots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Imo these spells still need some work..... I would like to see the new slow be a replacement to turgurs. It need to bee a 75% slow with a 6 sec recast time. But personally i would settle for a 70% with -75 rm... Eithier way the duration should be upped to at least 4-5 min. The new q should be a group version or a 500 a tik targetable version. The new dot is still useless cut the duration to 30 seconds up the damage to 500 a tick make it 510 mana.... basically make it a bigger better bane. Heres a hint sony we dont want your idea of a disease dot. They are useless they never run their full course through an encounter. Eithier give us a bigger faster working dot or a bigger faster casting nuke. Canni aa is a great idea. Still to low though up the hp to 400 and mana to 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sounds about right to me Krakle, either make the new quiescence 450+/tick or make it group.  Another very slow disease dot would be slightly useful for soloing, but I'd much rather have a bigger DD or a quick strong one that costs way more.<br />
<br />
I'm just going to ignore the new slow and stick to turgur though most likely, they aren't going to give us something more powerful than turgurs is</div></div><hr />

Still useless.  I might get it if it was storebought, but no way is this pos rune-worthy.  If I'm raiding and something really needs to be slowed RTFNow, I'm casting Malox and some other shaman is casting turgurs.  If I'm xping and resists are bad, I'm gonna want the additional -MR of Malox, both for slow, and whatever else I or others are casting.  This is a spell in search of a job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What makes you think that &quot;ancient&quot; means that is only going to be dropped off the very highest end encounters?  AFAIK we are the only class that is getting spells with the word &quot;ancient&quot; in the title for GoD.  Also, the luclin-era ancient spells look like this:<br />
<br />
Ancient:  Scourge of Nife<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaos Breath<br />
<br />
See the difference?  You sound like the wizards who were crying because strike of solusek was only going to drop off SolRo himself and thus non-raiding wizards would never get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">uhh... Jinheim?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If the slow remains short duration and lower % slow, it should be darn near unresistable.  There's places where that would be useful (similar to bst slow).<br />
Ancient chaos breath sounds like Q should have been, but needs more hp.  Something like 400-450 sounds closer.  Clerics are supposed to be the best healers, all around.  Druids are reasonably close to their match in direct heals.  Paladins are close to their match in emergency heals.  We should be close to their match in heals over time, in my opinion.  Thats our niche in the heal scheme, please let us have it.<br />
Plague of daluda. WHY, OH! WHY must they torture us.  Soe, you say its a group game, please stop giving us solo only spells.  pretty please, huh?  A nice upgraded nuke would slide in nicely here.<br />
<br />
And to the best of my knowledge, ancient spells are only spelled ancient: spell name in scroll form.  I'm pretty sure my feral avatar simply reads ancient feral avatar in my spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">all these spells are just slight upgrades and most of em seem to be quite limited in usefulness.  not one of these spells is a must have so unless they easy to get i dont see much point in bothering....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It looks like they removed all the new Beastlord slows, too. Now we have a fast cast, harder to resist slow that we can use for pre-slowing and pulling (Or using for a backup slow if Turgur's resists). With Grummus and Tirgir's, I'd say we're set pretty good for slows over Enchanters and Beastlords.<br />
<br />
The other 3 new spells are just small upgrades to our existing spells. If it didn't look like every other class was getting the same treatment, I'd be pretty pissed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It looks like they removed all the new Beastlord slows, too.

With Grummus and Tirgir's, I'd say we're set pretty good for slows over Enchanters and Beastlords.<br />
<br />
So, now, at a minimum, if this new slow is supposed to be for &quot;pre-slowing&quot;, our spell slots will look like this:<br />
<br />
Q<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Nihil<br />
Turgur's<br />
Canni<br />
Malx<br />
Root (at least I keep it up, anyway)<br />
&lt;random damage spell, or perhaps Grummus for EXTRA EXTRA preslowage&gt;<br />
<br />
Look, I understand your point Toktuk.  But I think we can all agree there's no reason to turn Shaman into a slowing station you drag mobs by anymore than we already are.<br />
<br />
Give us some damage options.  Hell that Mist of Nihil in another thread is a really good idea, as long as you get the negative resist modifier.  <br />
<br />
I don't want a wider variety of slow.  Just ONE slow for 95% of all encounters that has a negative resist mod that has a decent recast (i.e. not 12 seconds) and moderate mana usage.  <br />
<br />
The Ancient Chaos Breath is pretty good, me likey, shorter-term healage option.  But please, not more frickin' varieties of slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i see alot of you wanting a group Q, but think about your EIGHT spells slots.. if we get one id rather it be a AA spell.. atm im not too concerend about getting one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Look, I understand your point Toktuk.  But I think we can all agree there's no reason to turn Shaman into a slowing station you drag mobs by anymore than we already are.<br />
<br />
Don't know about you, but I don't stand around waiting for someone to drag a mob to me to slow. If I'm not pulling myself, I'm running around handling adds, or patch healing, or dropping nukes/rains/DoTs (whatever the situation calls for) as needed. Most Shaman here keep Turgur's and Torgor's up so that if Turgur's is resisted, they can immediately try to slow with Torgor's if the first is resisted. Nihil is simply a better spell for doing that (or for pre-slowing and pulling, as I already said).<br />
<br />
I know when I'm going to need to disease slow ahead of time because I check the Slowability Guide (http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/slowing.html). There's no point in keeping Disease slow up all the time, again, if you're having trouble with resists, you should try using Nihil to get a mob slow temporarily. Then drop Malos and Turgur's and you're good to go. My spells normally look like this:<br />
<br />
Malx<br />
Heal<br />
Damage (DoT/rain/nuke)<br />
Turgur's<br />
Backup Slow (swap for buffs temp. as needed)<br />
Cann<br />
HoT<br />
Root<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sweet what a cool upgrade to the the level 39 slow that will be - For those who forgot to buy Turgurs Insects for 3 years anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My point remains the same.  I don't want a wider variety of slows.  I want a better damage option.  Just one.  A SINGLE, GOOD, damage option.  Right now, there are none.<br />
<br />
Bane (LDON dot) is a really good start.  It's huge aggro, but it's a short duration dot, shorter than poison, and does solid damage for decent mana cost.  Give us a small neg resist adjust on Tears of Saryrn, and I'd be willing to call it even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd be willing to bet an 8-pack of Guinness that the Ancient spells listed for this expansion are not on par with the ancient spells of the past, rarity-wise.  I'm not saying it's not possible, but then again, I don't take my Guinness lightly. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm just basing that on the fact thet there's not one for every class like that...  Sony's not always totally fair between the classes (although I think they try), but I don't see them hosing us that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The more I think about the &quot;new&quot; slow..the more i feel like I'm being slapped in the face.  Think of how a beastlord at 65 has a SIXTY FIVE percent slow that casts in 1.8 seconds, what are we geting? a SIXTY percent slow with a MEASLY -30% resist check and a VERY long recast time (although i do like the faster cast time of this new slow).<br />
<br />
What should the spell be ?  AT THE VERY LEAST it needs to be 65%.  The recast time?  NEEDS TO GO!  It just needs to vanish and be able to be recast when the spell gems pop  (2.5 seconds?).  How about the resist adjustment?  If its going to be a lesser percent slowed than a beastlords' slow, it NEEDS to be unresistable.<br />
<br />
I don't usually care that much about what beastlords have compared to shaman, but this is completely and utterly ridiculous now.  Is it honestly too much to ask for a 75% slow with a -30% resist check and NO recast and the same 3 second cast time?  Hell, even a lower cast time would be nifty.  Also, if they are cutesy and decide to double the mana cost for my above suggestion, I cannot be held responsible for what i may do :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Terabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My 2 Cents, first of all the Slow needs to be upped to at least 65%, or screw it make it 70% dam WE ARE THE SLOWERS in this game, this is our main thing other then being the buffing whore, but that lasts for what maybe 5 minutes unless you have multiple shamans on then can be 2 minutes, the rest of the raid you are Slowing and helping with heals.... C'mon make us #1 slower again!!!<br />
<br />
Sure make the new upgrade to Q, groupable!! At least make it something we will want to get over Q!<br />
<br />
New Cani, alright!! Bout time.. <br />
<br />
Umm Disease dot? Stick it where the sun dont shine, why would i want another one of those disease dots i dont use?? Make this a new bad ass Nuke or a better agro gaining DoT like Bane!!! <br />
<br />
MGBable ToA??? Stick it SOE!! Why would we want this?? When will we EVER use it over a enchanter in a raid??? Make Tiny Terror MGBable, then we will ALL be happy!!<br />

I would give my left and right nut for MGBable Shrink! <br />
