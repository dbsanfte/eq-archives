<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lucent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current solo zones are OOT and BW. I can get 10-12% xp/hour. I was wondering is this low? are some of you guys in this level range getting 20%(one yellow) /hour? if so where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that is pretty damn good in my opinion.<br />
i am 52, and even in planes groups i cant get a yellow an hour..at least not in PoJ and PoD, which are the only planes ive been invited to so far. 10 to 12 percent an hour sounds about right for 51 to me<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 to 2 1/2 blue per hour?  Beats my pace at that level!<br />
<br />
If you get HHK to yourself at 53 or 54 you can do that fast, or a bit better.  At 51 I was happy with one blue per hour, in a spot with squat for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slapped down plat for a 4-hour KEI, and absolutely mauled the BW giant fort. Don't even know why I bothered with KEI, since the only spell I was casting was turgur's (And VoS on hte ancients). Same with 52. That spot is golden</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have a JBB, get KEI and head to CoM. XP there is awsome!!!! With enhanced KEI and JBB along with fido I can get close to 3 yellows per KEI session or about 60%. The good thing about CoM is that there is never any downtime, constant pulls one right after another. At 49 you can single pull the front, yard , and the 2 sides. EASY XP !!!!:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CoM might net that kind of exp at 49, but at 51+ it's not nearly as good.  The amount of exp needed to get from 51 to 52 is TWICE the amount needed to get from 50-51.  So at the same amount of exp per kill you would get only 30% per KEI, not 60%.  A three hour KEI would net 10% per hour which is about the same as the original poster is getting in OOT and BW.  Also, by 52 CoM starts to turn very green and light blue so the exp is even slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When mobs turn green in CoM you need to move further in. The XP in CoM from 52-53 was the fastest I ever saw, you just have to move to the arena and gazeebos. Even the temple at 52 is half dark blue and good xp. Move to the arena and pull the houses and then to the gazeebos. It only starts drying up at 54.</div></div><hr />
