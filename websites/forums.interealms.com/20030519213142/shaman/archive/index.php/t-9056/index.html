<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best and fastest way to raise Chardok faction for this quest and the subsequent ones?<br />
<br />
Is Droga the only option?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did the Faction in Droga! With 61 Alpha Pet the fastest way, Nurga could work too but mobs are spaced too far from each other to make it worthwhile!<br />
<br />
Raising the Faction really isnt the Problem, its the angry goblin :( A 3day spawn in Droga which is needed to get the 2nd Ring. i got him after a patch but someone tried to KS me...people do stupid things when they see phat lewt :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another option is killing gobs in Warslike woods for the green goblin skin (drops off gGob Soothsayers, or gob Agressors, best located at Gob Fort, but usualy camped due to Grach/shrunken goblin skull earring farmers). <br />
<br />
Unless VI nerf'd it, you can: <br />
(1)-kill in Droga for 1 faction increase per kill;<br />
(2)-turn in 1 green goblin skin (to the quest giver Hearld NPC in Chardok) for 3 faction increase;<br />
or (3)-turn in those salts 2 at a time for like 1-2 faction increase (not sure exact amout of faction given on salts).<br />
<br />
Hard part about the green goblin skill, is it isn't very common, so you can clear the gob fort many times without any, so it gets slow, unless you are camping Grachnist the Destroyer. So may be quicker to just kill in Droga as you'll have a steady flow of mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I finally hit warmly with chardok last night and got my signet of service.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the patch ended quicker than it was estimated, so someone else got the angry goblin on the repop.<br />
<br />
How do you guys get the goblin?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of parking a mule down there, a caster class which I can bind right outside of the temple in FM and load up with invis potions (if he is under level 10, he will keep his stuff when he dies), then start checking on Saturday night for the angry goblin.<br />
<br />
Of course, after reboots are good times as well, but I missed out on this one.... four hour patch indeed!<br />
<br />
(But at least I got the shady goblin).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm torn on this.  I *really* want to do the ring quests, but too many friends need bits from inside Chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got the angry gobby! Skargus was a wuss to solo.<br />
<br />
I made a level 1 wood elf ranger. They have racial hide, and track.<br />
<br />
Invised her, ran her down there, made sure her hide was working (conned until it stuck).<br />
<br />
Sat her there.<br />
<br />
six hours later, she was still sitting there happily looking at the spot where he would spawn... and... he spawned :)<br />
<br />
I gated my butt to fronteir mountains, ran down there, and soloed Skargus :) Whee!</div></div><hr />
