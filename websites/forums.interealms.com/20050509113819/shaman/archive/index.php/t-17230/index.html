the scary part is it works. the same people who ask my duel wielding barbarian rogue for shamy buffs wont ask my duel wielding shaman for shaman buffs.</div></div><hr />

There are loads of nice all/all equipment out there if you just look for them, that will alter the apperance and mask your class effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He joined an experience group in the Gorge of King Xxorb, and pretended to be a rogue.  Apparently he did that for about an hour or so chatting away until one of the group members nearly died and he popped a heal off.  They still didn't really get it until he started casting more.  <br />
<br />
It was a pretty funny post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Porunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remeber that post, I thought it was in KC though.  He started casting all sorts of things and told the group they were procs or clickys.  They didn't catch on till he pulled out his SoF.  He told them it was a new Luclin weapon that looked just like the epic, but they didn't go for that.</div></div><hr />

How much played time do you have on your shaman? When was your shaman created? How many times over the years of time playing have you been asked one too many times to take time out of your day and help another simply because they graced you with thier presence?<br />
<br />
i ask this in all hopes of not sounding like a uberer than you *******. But to possibly clue you in that there are a few people who have been hearing sowPLZ for not weeks or months. But years. All the while happily donating for clarity and or ports and all sorts of things. But hearing folks say to a shaman You don't use a reagent.. Or whatever. <br />
<br />
Guess what sparky, it is my mana, and my time that folks are asking a favor for. Doesnt matter if it is &quot;Excuse me Sir. Might I sleep with your wife?&quot;, or &quot;Pardon me, can I borrow the grey poupon?&quot;, Asking nicely will always get you a bit more consideration than &quot;Wife is Milf! I am gonna bang her, okay?&quot; Or &quot;Toss that grey **** here yo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Plus it is fun to play dress up now and again, i mourn the days when folks would actually attempt to be civil to one another. (Laughing now at myself cause I have just flamed... Sigh, noone is immune...)<br />
<br />
Have a good one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I often MBG focus of 7.  I usually do it every night before I camp.  No reasonable buff request is refused, if they ask nicely and politely, and I do not have other pressing comitments.  But at 65, with Elder title you can get flooded with requests.  At 55 you have no idea how bad it can get.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I won't buff, and I I usually load sow when I zone into a crowd zone.  But some folks get mad when you don't offer them the full boat, for them and a dozen of their friends....  When you are just medding up to camp, or having a heart to heart with someone, are on a CR, are running to a raid, are buffing your group so they can port to their next adventure, etc.<br />
<br />
Just because we can buff, does not make us a buff vending machine.  We have the right to not want to buff.<br />
<br />
Typicall I only haul out my sword to tease my friends.. &quot;you want Focus, um note the sword pal, do I look like a shaman to you? /tease&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have no problem saying no to buff requests, but some folks struggle.  giving them tips to make their life easier seems a good thing to me. :-)<br />
<br />
p.s. I've never taken any money for buffs, but thats my personal choice.  Its the casters mana, its always their choice if they want to charge for a buff.<br />
<br />
I donate for KEI, ports, Virtue etc.  But its of my own free will.   I can play without them, but I like them, and they are worth the pp for me.  My choice, I want them, I'm willing to pay for them, and the casters like the pp.<br />
<br />
I think we just have to accept each of us gets to pick and choose how we play the game, and accept the we can not dictate how folks will play.  They have free will, and it is a good thing. :-)</div></div><hr />

Well, last time I went an played in a pick-up group in PoV, I had a case of mistaken identity.  Turns out that with my AA and equip, I made a much more effective tank than the SK or the warrior in the group.  So . . . I was main tank, puller, healer and slower.  :p<br />
<br />
Approximately an hour an a half in, after I hasted the rogue (for the 3rd time), the rogue says, &quot;HOLY SH*T!  You're a shaman!  I thought you were a shadowknight!&quot;  :p<br />
<br />
How the heck do you mistake a shaman for a SK after they've been slowing, healing, hasting, tanking, and pulling for an hour and a half?!?<br />

&quot;sow plz, thnx&quot; &quot;pp for HOS&quot; i just cant keep up with everything, so juat what is MBG, or CC when ppl say they can CC, i think to my self i can do a camp check to....so what do these mean...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never charge for buffs, although I do donate for kei/virtue if I choose to get them. If I am in a rush I feel no obligation to stop and buff a person on the way, but if I am just hanging around waiting for something to happen, or in /tell with friends I see no harm in it.<br />
<br />
Also, it isn't always a bad thing to buff. Last night I checked for groups in BoT, nothing immediately open. I was about to zone and got asked if I would fo7 a group in DS for a donation. It took me 1 minute total to get there and I enjoyed cancelling the donation when it came up.<br />
<br />
My reasons? Hell, it might get me a group with those folks in the future for one, and secondly... I certainly haven't forgotten the feeling when I got a drive by buff as a noob. I always said I would give forward. It is a good feeling to just give for nothing.<br />
<br />
But, that is just me.<br />
<br />
My biggest peeve however is the new trend on chanters touting KEI on Rodcet. What is it with the &quot;Give donation in advance&quot; routine? I sometimes feel like giving 1cp just to see if they accept it and provide KEI. It ceases to be a donation if you have to provide one in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">MGB stands for Mass Group Buff. <br />
<br />
It is an AA ability that allows you to cast a group-targetable buff spell on everyone within a certain range of you. You can hit a great many people with the spell all at once this way. <br />
<br />
CC stands for Crowd Control, in the context you're referring to. It means the ability to prevent several monsters from beating the crap out of your group. Normally it refers to using Mesmerize spells, or sometimes charm. Shamans do a weaker, but still quite effective version of crowd control by using attack speed slow and root spells. In my mind, one of the things that distinguishes a good shaman from a bad one is the degree to which they can perform effective crowd control. <br />
<br />
My personal favorite is when the group enchanter is pulling in LDoN,  gets a critical lull resist, and 3-4 mobs come piling in and kill him almost instantly. Then I slow and root park everything and we happily kill them all and resurrect the enchanter, about the time he's asking if anyone lived.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm usually pretty kind when it comes to buff requests, and I generally MGB Fo7 before I log each night, but I do have one pet peeve...

<br />
MGB .. I did a typo. Mass Group Buff.... Its an Alternative Advancement skill.  I equip the sword for a larger radius effect, lol.  I typically cast it at pok at nexus stone or bank or at a LDoN camp.<br />
<br />
Its my way of givng back to the folks in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MGB= Mass Group Buff. Means the caster can hit everyone in their area with the spell, regardless of whether they are in the caster's group. AA ability<br />
<br />
HOS\IOS= Harness of Spirit\Infusion of Spirit. The top level buffs that a Shaman can cast on someone below 45. Do yourself a favor, buy HoS, but ALSO get IOS. Takes more buff slots and time, but IOS wil let you stack your STR, DEX, AGI, and STA buffs on top. HOS won't, and casters will hate you for casting it on them anyway, since it mucks with their personal line of shielding. Also, you can stack Altuna on top of IOS. Heh.<br />
<br />
CC= Crowd Control. 5 baddies coming in to camp? You need CC. The Enchanter and Bard are best for it...they can mez the adds. Other methods are the Necro's ability to ghetto mez, rooting the adds away from the group, fearing them (okay, that is usually a Very Bad Idea). Anything that keeps multiple mobs from becoming an issue is CC.</div></div><hr />

Most people just reach a point on day where there just tired of buffing.  Not just shams but all support classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I took a hint from a friend who plays a 65 chanter and I constantly keep AFK up when in PoK, and as much as I hate it, I always have roleplay on.<br />
<br />
Without roleplay I get hounded with tells from people ACROSS the zone wanting me to come buff them. I once got asked for a Focus and I told the guy to meet me behind the bank. Took him 10 mins to get there. Only reason why I stook around is because I was waiting to meet up with my brother.<br />
<br />
I'm actually seriously considering the dagger idea now, lol.<br />
<br />
You want buffs off me, be in front of me. Hail me, then ask or even send me a tell, but please please ask nicely. Sow plz or worse, can you buff me plz, will usually get ignored. I don't have HoS, I only have Focus, so if you're under 46 don't be surprised if I say &quot;Sorry, don't have that spell&quot;.<br />
<br />
I will take donations. Why not? I donate nicely for V and KEI. But I never ask or expect donations. But even the ones that donate can be annoying. I once had some girl once ask if I could buff her for donation. When ever anyone asks for Buffs I just tell them I can Focus them. I really don't want to pull out every buff in my book. She said fine to Focus, I casted, she donated 20pp or so. A minute later she asks, oh can you cast &quot;So and so buff on me too plz&quot; Then after that she asked for something else and something else....<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
To get a buff off me is not that hard. Just stand in front of me and ask nicely. If you want a focus just say &quot;May I get a Focus off you Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
I will never say no to that. :P</div></div><hr />

Again, I agree. I take donations if people offer them, generally. I will turn someone down more often than not if they've been very polite or made me laugh or brightened my day...it happens! ;) I have spell lists for easy memming of buffs for group and single buffs, specifically because I hate rooting around in my spellbook. I even have one for the &lt;45 crowd...as much as I don't like the l33t crowd I do like to help out my friends and those odd polite ones. :)</div></div><hr />

lol.  I don't mind being asked for buffs (and he asked nicely), but his 'threat' after I told him I was gating was laughable.  <br />
I guess I was supposed to say: &quot;Ohhh...didn't realize you were an alt of a powaful chanter KEI vendor...well lemme run back to PoK and buff/PL you.&quot;    Instead I said &quot;/shrug.  ok.&quot;<br />

Now grante it if some one does ask me for a buff like sow focus or what not I will be glad to give it to them if they ask politely now if they Sow PlZ i would like to tell them to shove off but i just tell them to ask more politly and they normaly do.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe is when i am doing something like buybg spell componets to get my friend to reserch them and I get a tell &quot; can you come buff me I will donate&quot; Now i normal dont except donations but I went and buffed this indivdual and no sooner than i buff they bolt. The princable is they will tell you any thin to get some buffs so i brusehed it off and continued shoping for componets not 5 min later the same person sends me a tell saying they need a new haste and healed they want me to run to PC from the bazaar to do this. I make know that they never even offered the dontation promised which was not a big deal but I told them I would not go totaly out of my way to hook them up with a new speed and a heal and that theyshould do an ooc to get healed<br />
<br />
Now i have played my shaman for going on 2.5 years and ever since i got 20 i get bugged for sow and what not. Like i said i do not mid doing it if you ask nicely but some days I do like the idea of not getting bugged<br />

However, just the other day I got a tell asking for buffs.  I was in Shadowhaven and I figured... not many people in this zone why not.  I said to meet me in the bank in a minute.  I got a confusing reply about which bank.  I did a /who newbiename and he was in PoK.  I told him to forget it that I wasn't waiting around for him to zone 2 zones... he seemed a little preturbed.<br />
<br />
While I can sort of understand sending a tell to a shaman in the same zone, I can't figure out what this guy was thinking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I usually keep a spell set with my lower level spells as well with stuff like Agility, Guardian, Chloro, etc.  /roleplay usually doesn't help too much if I wanted to avoid buff requests seeing as I have &quot;shaman&quot; written all over me.  Typical Iksar in chain wielding my shaman looking 2HB (Hammer of Spiritcalling) and my armor colored in light blues, greens, with a hint of purple :p  Just recently, I decided to turn off /roleplay 'cause I liked seeing myself as a Mystic with the /who commmand :).  Not a minute later, I was already getting tells asking for SoWs or buffs.  Surprizingly enough, every single one of them was polite in asking, were in the same zone, and were willing to go to me for what they wanted.  Never asked for a donation, but got 10P from one person.  Just the one thing that ticked me off was the 50K twinked level 1 Necro who asked for the works, then asked to buff her pet in Qeynos (Which I did anyway, 'cause I wasn't doing anything else), then asked if I could PL her and I didn't get a single copper from it. XD Other than that, she was pretty nice, actually exchanged tells with her for an hour and a half afterwards.  As far as whether or not I take donations, it usually depends on how nice the person is.  If someone just plain asks for a buff and offers me a donation afterwards, sure I'll probably take it, but if I can tell that someone is one of those really appreciative types or offers me too much, yeah, I'm gonna decline that.  I love helping people out and I found that it does pay off, 'cause you never know when that lowbie'll have a nice higher level char.  (Mmm, free ports for a while.)</div></div><hr />

Allways happy to buff people unless I'm in a hurry. It's the ones that abuse the /who shaman function and send tells begging for buffs from across the zone that I want to strangle. The culmination of this was being in pok and getting a tell asking if I could run over to frontier mountains and buff a complete stranger ...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Me too, however I never thought about doing that to avoid buffs.  I don't have a problem giving buffs but that does sound fun.  I even have a Guise of the Deceiver from the old days.  I'll have to try that trick of getting a group as an SK/Rogue/Cleric sometime in the future.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Regarding disguises.  When skilling up on Alchemy I put all that &quot;meat&quot; to work from Dulak's and made a suite of illusion potions.  Now, I can't say I do this to avoid buffs... at least not often (that would be expensive)... but I can say that the primary use I have for the potions is screwing with people so they can't figure out what class I am.<br />
<br />
I just loving running around with /roleplay on as a gnome... or a dark elf... or a erudite.<br />
<br />
I think this would be the icing on the cake if you had one of these weapon/item combos discussed above.<br />
