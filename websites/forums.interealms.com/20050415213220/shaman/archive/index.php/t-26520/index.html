<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ArminiusCheruskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Panter was changed today on lucy. No recast, group only. Leopard stays as it was on Test with 30 second recast. Not sure how I feel about it atm, I cant tell if its /tgb able or not. I think if its /tgb able but not MGB able I think that would be a good compromise.</div></div><hr />

Complete and utter BS.<br />

Date Change <br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Recast Time from 30.0 seconds to 52.0 seconds <br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Target Type from Single to Group v1 <br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Mana cost from 540 to 1875 <br />
<br />
Ugh, that's just killed using the spell to solo with. Come back 30 second single target version, all is forgiven!  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actuall leopard looks like its groupv1 also, but with 52sec recast according to lucy.<br />
<br />
I'm not happy with it being a group spell.  Seems inefficient unless you are in a pet-heavy or melee heavy group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">groupv1 is still single target I think, just group only</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">groupv1 is full group.<br />
<br />
&quot;PC, Group Only&quot; is single, but group only (look at the info for Shrink for an example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not a fan of a group target spell either - not good for soloing AT ALL. <br />
<br />
I don't want it changed at all, but this is not one of my favorite options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ArminiusCheruskii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ugg, didnt see any updates to Leopard, that does bite the big one, maybe they were in the process of updating as I was looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">my bad, so what's the difference between groupv1 and v2?  Both tiny terror (just own group) and talisman of ...(any group) are listed as v2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CRAP! Thanks for the bend over on this. Can I petition for a reach around every time I cast it?<br />
<br />
Or at least get back the 120 crystals I spent buying this thing?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congratulations, this is what happens when you stop wanting what's best and start bandying around ideas on how to continue nerfing it, instead of banding together to keep it as-is.</div></div><hr />

Champion is also listed as &quot;Group v1.&quot; I wish I knew if that meant Leopard will now become a /tgb'able group buff ...</div></div><hr />
