There are shaman in EQ2, so it would make sense that those who played EQ would play EQ2.  Either people played EQ2 and decided it stunk, or they were so turned off from SOE games after EQ that they refuse to try another one.  Or is there just a really spectacular board for EQ2 shaman that has siphoned off all the activity from this board?</div></div><hr />

Most of the Shaman (Mystics and Defilers) from EQ2 use the forums at SOE.  There is very little external community since most of the things you need are provided by SOE.<br />
<br />
No, it's not a complete bust.  It had / has it's share of problems, no different than EQLive.</div></div><hr />

People who were dinging 50 in my guild are leaving out of boredom. Other guilds are reporting the same. A lot of the bigger well known guilds on my server folded, and lots of others are leaving just out of boredom in general or disgust at Sony's Station Exchange program.<br />
<br />
Start up and make a new character and you'll see all but a few servers at Low population. The other few are medium only.<br />
<br />
They changed the game way too much that a lot of people didn't know what we're playing anymore. The game starts to feel closed off once you go through most of it. Way way way too many instance zones and the access quests are insane. There's just too much that they force down your throat. <br />
<br />
I could go on and on, espcially about how simple it's gotten but the biggest problem is that it's not a world. It's an Online RPG still but it spent too much time trying to NOT be EQ that it fails as an attemped sequel. They should have just called it Everquest:The Instance Era<br />
<br />
Or whatever... Some people are still having fun and it is fun for most people for the first several months. But it's definately not a true sequel to EQ.<br />
<br />
If you want an EQ sequel, so far it seems like your best bet is to wait for Vanguard</div></div><hr />

I am still playing and enjoying myself.  I am interested in seeing how the expansion in September fairs and what the implimentation of PvP brings to the game.<br />
<br />
I am however on the most populated server, so I can't say I see what other servers are seeing by way of declining population.<br />
<br />
I do not play a defiler or a mystic however.  I plan on it eventually, but I didn't want to start one right away, I was afraid I'd always compare it to the Eq1 shaman.</div></div><hr />

 Well truth is there are maybe 2 or 3 better boards then EQShaman for EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true.<br />
<br />
I would like to point out that this site is not and has never been affiliated with EQShaman. The current owner links to us as if the Crucible is the EQshaman forum, but it definitely is not.<br />
<br />
This has been driving me crazy for 3+ years!</div></div><hr />
