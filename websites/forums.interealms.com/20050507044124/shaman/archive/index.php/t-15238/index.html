<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hopped in last night and ran around aimlessly untill I began to get a sense of direction here. I managed to determine that the king room is next to the &quot;pool room&quot;. Are there any other static spawns I can camp? I went down to the old idol of the thorned camp and killed 5-6 mobs in a cycle, including the chiefs PH ( its the single goblin that stands below the wood plank, correct? ) Self buffed at 4k hp and 1250 ac I didnt have much problem with any particular mob, cept for some resisty ones periodically. Be aware that the SK mobs can HT you for 1000. <br />
<br />
Exp ranged from 1/2 AA blue per kill to a full for the goblin cave masters. Max hit I took was 205. 1 ultor, 2 BoS's, 2 epics, and alpha dog seemed to kill just about anything. Like others have said, keep your resists buffed, and buff yourself correctly. You will get dispelled at some point. <br />

Most of what I am doing here is to twink my warrior, but i'd like to get <br />

for myself. Are alot of the named in this dungeon just random in any spot? Or are the static?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hunted in Droga with my cleric at 59.  I started at 13% and by the end of the day had dinged to 60.  We got a breastplate and several other drops (I dont recall the stats) but it was alot of fun and well worth the time.<br />
<br />
We camped a single room near the entrance for hours, and the last 2 hours we remained the named ones popped in those place holders.  So according to what I have seen they were semi static but with odd timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the old chief room under the plank was a safe spot. The chief spawned against the wall on the ledge above the plank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything see invis now?  or same as before, you can run all over until invis drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nothing saw invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BAsicly it seems that all the old static spawns are the same, they just have new mobs. I dont know if there is any new spawns though, i haven figured out where those arms drop yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Droga is fun..really fun.  It brought back memories of scouting dungeons pre-kunark (Guk and Sol).  Then again, maybe I'm just wishing it was?  Either way it's a fun to place to run through with a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The king spawns in the room behind the pool room in the NW section of the dungeon.  In a two hour timeframe, he popped a couple of times for me, dropping the hammer and an earring that apparently is used for the prisoner quest.<br />
<br />
In the room directly above the king, another named spawns--something Seer.  He drops the Sword of the Bloodsworn.  In about a four hour camp, I got him to pop exactly zero times.  The night before, though, I saw another group get him at least 2 times back to back.  They said that he had just gotten done spawning four times in a row.  He's easy to get to and can deal with him without any wanderers.<br />

Also, a good discussion of the prisoner quests going on at:<br />

If ANYONE has something to add to the quest information, please post it.  I'd hate to do a turn in for a no drop FT2 neck item usable only by the finger-wrigglers.</div></div><hr />
