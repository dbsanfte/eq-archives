<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well...since there are new high ZEM xp zones...think a 59 shaman w/ my gear could solo in Hates Fury?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did they really adjust the ZEM or are they just annoucing that the ZEM's have always been better than average in those zones??  I ask becuase I've levelled several characters using MM, Gunthak, Dulak and Nadox and always gotten excellent experience in them compared to other zones that I've tried.  Now I've done this as a duo/trio, so its probable that there were better zones to go to if I had a full group :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They called them the current &quot;hot spots&quot; when they announced they had upped the ZEM in them in the patch message.  I too have used a few of those zones for lvling up characters but none of them ever compared to Paladual Caverns.  In the patch message it stated that it brought all those zones up to PC's ZEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally Rgallnor.. I highly doubt you could hold your own solo in Hates fury... and, quite honestly.. The run though that part of Nadox and down that dock to Hates might prove... interesting.  If I were you though.. I'd at least give it 1 go.. worst thing that can happen is losing some exp and being naked for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well...soloed Nadox for a couple of hours today.  Only made about 8%.  Not much.  But...Nadox was stated to be for lvls 50-55 so that could be why.  Gonna try Hates Fury...run should be easy.  Ive done it before...just need a IU.  Your right...worse that could happen is I could get pummeled and retrieve my corpse.  Now...if anyone with some experience wants to save me the time (plead) please let me know what your experience with soloing the zone in at Hates Fury.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs in HF are pretty tough for thier lvl. They only hit for a max of 170 or so, but have a ton of hps. Troll casters arent that bad, but Luggald caster can be a royal pain the ass...priests will ch 3-4 times a fight, arcanists like to use ice comet, etc...so watch your mana and your health.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to get a feel for HF, I'd recommend hunting at the zl. There are 7 static mobs, and one roamer that comes down the stairs from time to time. 3 spawn on the lft side, 4 on the right. Start by pulling the rat just inside the door to the right, then root split the 2 trolls in the middle of that side, clear, then get rat near the stairs. Nothing on other side should aggro, but watch out for the pat if it comes down the stairs. If one of the luggalds on the left side is a caster, you may just want to leave them all alone, becasue he will just stand there and fry you while you are sorting out the other 2. You can actually get some decent drops here...lots of twink gear drops randomly in the zone, but they are fairly rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried torigrans last night with my 56 bst it was slow but steady. The kills came very easy so I stayed. My 65 shaman was in the grp with him and getting 1% xp per kill. <br />
<br />
Tonight Im gonna try hates fury. Should I whip up some itu pots or just train the see invis mobs to zone line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hate's Fury is tough at 61, I know. Maybe with epic or some other free damage, it's not so bad. But like Cirin said, they have WAY too many HP. My Beastlord's old guild was raiding in Nadox, we took the party to Hate's Fury, and simply couldn't kill fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried Nadox with my 53rd monk/52nd shaman combo and I was disappointed in the exp.  I had been hunting Nurga for a few levels and it is better exp than Nadox.  It was nice to not to have to deal with caster mobs but still did not equal the exp from Nurga.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been to the &quot;new zem&quot; Hate's fury. Don't bother. This is from a 65 perspective. A better place to go is in nadox, if you come to the &quot;bridge&quot; in nadox, and are facing west, the left hand tunnel leads to hate's fury, the right to the back part of nadox, which is far and away better bang for the buck (if you insist on LoY). I myself stil lspend a healthy bit of time there, as aa xp isn't horrid. It's dangerous, and quite a ways in the boonies for a CR. I usually bind in gunthark, and carry a swirling mist on me (instagate). If you an keep up the dps, work your way to the back of the luggald's, heading to the right, in the back is a room of undead, with a mob that con spawn that has some so-so loots. nothing specacular, and not worth much. on the upside, that room has mobs wiht less hp than HF, hit about the same, but are also less resistant to spells. the difference in hp (and still being the same levels as zi HF) makes it much better for the solo or duo shaman.</div></div><hr />
