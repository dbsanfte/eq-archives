<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone else put at least 20 points in charisma when they created their shaman, just because it seemed low, and it was my first charater.  I have thought of rerolling my Shaman to fix the stats, but never seemed to actually do it.  It was a dumb idea, but I have had no problems with Odaya.  Anyhow to the point, has anyone else made this mistake?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i put 10 if i remember correctly :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">5 Dex<br />
5 Agi<br />
10 Wis<br />
10 Int<br />
<br />
Created June 20, 1999.    Had no clue what I was doing.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not as bad but i put 10 points into sta and only have a base wis of 100 =) Definitely not as bad as some but not quite as min max as i could be. Not like it really matters at this point since my equipement puts me at 390 wis which is well above max even with aa's to up it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I put 7 into str, 3 into agi, and the rest into wis, cause I liked having nice round numbers. <br />
<br />
/shrug :p then again I started over 3 years ago, people made barbs because faction was important, and nobody knew anything about how to play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Putting points in to charisma isn't a dumb idea at all if you're new to the game and have no idea what stats do what.  In tradition D&amp;D style games, charisma is often one of the most important stats, depending what kind of character you want to roleplay.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I put 15 points in to wis and 15 points in to int because my friend told me that shamans were a hybrid class that uses both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I put my points on the frog such that I have 100 agi/dex/wis/stamina .. no real reason.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">5 or 10, can't remember at the moment.<br />
<br />
Did anyone mention, that Charisma is still listed as secondary stat for shamans during character selection? Of course it helps our uber 'charm animal'-line  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I put 10 into dex, 10 into wis, and the rest into agil.  Yah I had no clue.  And that hurt, cuz back in the day when I started, we didn't have easy to get great gear for noobs.  The best gear available to a lvl 50 then was stuff you wouldn't wanna even twink with nowadays.  <br />
<br />
But now?  Hah, um.  I don't miss it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Barb shammie with base wis of 95, and base str of 105, because I wanted to increase my melee damage, heh.  (Yes, my first character--started just after Kunark came out.)<br />
<br />
No, it won't matter in the long run; I wouldn't bother to reroll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I should add in the tips thread that you should never reroll a character based solely on stats.<br />
<br />
If you want to, or you want a different race, fine.  But little swings in stats makes zero difference - in either the short term or the long term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wish I had putted all points in agi actually.. The only stat I cant max without buffs even max Timetwinked :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">25 wis, 5 cha.  I was listening to a druid friend of mine that told me that we were big animal charmers cause we got a pet.  The things you learn over the course of 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">25 Wis, 5 Cha - it was one of the highlited ones and seemed really low - those were the days :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">25 WIS 5 CHA here also.  Glad I'm not the only one ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ditto on the 25wis 5cha, the book read charisma was secondary to wis!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe I see a trend here, I knew enough to know that wisdom was the &quot;important&quot; stat, but not enough to not trust the other green number. Besides, I had read that you could charm bats in SolB, so I was just planning ahead ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to mention 5 cha, rest wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My original shaman on prexus was the strongest shaman on the server at level 1.  :D<br />
<br />
On my 2nd go around here on SZ I went all wis/stam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">20 wis, 5 int ... I was embarrassed by my slow sense heading development on my other character ... this was before kunark and before Cann.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My shaman is oh so charming, but a wee bit of a dummie. I did put some points in stamina so - all evenly split into the nice green stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">10 Charisma here.  It was green, and it seemed to make sense for a witch doctor type to be more charismatic.<br />
<br />
Besides, (as a GM), I always hated players who min/maxed.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can't beleive no one has said it yet...<br />
<br />
High Charisma lets us *slow time itself* with our slows!<br />
<br />
It's UBER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't remember the exact numbers, but I had<br />
tried to even them out. Wish I could modify them<br />
now, but at level 65 I'm certainly not about to <br />
start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wish I'd put points into Cha.  At high end most people are maxxed wis, maxxed sta.<br />
<br />
Cha = greater chance for DI to go off........<br />
<br />
which is better than having a wis/sta of 450.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, Shamans WERE a charm class in beta, and even for a while on release, Charm (Befriend?  Details getting fuzzy here) Animal wasn't bad, I remember using it well into my 30s on fish in Kedge Keep.  So CHA wasn't SO silly.<br />
<br />
I decided I wanted 5 in AGI because I'd read about the 75-AGI thing, then most in Wisdom... but then I saw the bit *in the Online EQ Manual* about how DEX helps you channel, and since that'd be important, I put 5 in DEX.<br />
<br />
a year and a half later, they finally pulled it out of the manual.  Heh.  But it lives on, I was playing an alt in Dreadlands yesterday, and one of the casters wanted a DEX buff to help cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mostly into stamina, although I had no clue why :)  Now I'm glad I listened.  I keep (probably like alot of you) 2 Opal Steins (+25CHA) in my backpack, for vendor selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I keep (probably like alot of you) 2 Opal Steins (+25CHA) in my backpack, for vendor selling.<br />
<br />
i have the two steins, a medal of merit, and the 10cha sarnak bracer; i can get my cha to 175; just for vendoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You know cha only affects merchant prices up to 120 cha, after that its worthless.  Actually it might be 115 or something like that, but its no higher then 120.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I can verify that up to 125 counts for vendordealing, but no change up to 170 (which is what I can max it at now),</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">110 is just fine for max prices in PoK.<br />
Luckily, this is the exact ammount I can get to with CHA buff without having to take off my Brain of CT to raise my CHA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I went 10 sta, 10 wis and 10 cha. Bought the Trilogy just about at Luclin release, had no friends that played, just got a new comp that could actually run EQ (Old one was a whopping 166MB), and guide that came with game said Shaman was jack of all trades, so split my points into all highlighted areas on char creation for first char.<br />
<br />
Funny, I still have not figured out proper min/maxing a year and a half later when making my Troll Beastlord, but his croc makes up for his shortcomings</div></div><hr />
