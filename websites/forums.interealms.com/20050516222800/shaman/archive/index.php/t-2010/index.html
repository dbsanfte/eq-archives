<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figure I could med all the time with a horse, or get a JBB. I dont have the money to get both, and actually I am a bit short to get either of them right now, but what would you suggest?<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JBB for your level (though remember it is 45 to work). If you are 55+ then I would say horse as being able to med at will is very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horse only works outdoors, and you can SoW yourself anyway.  Sure, the medding feature is very nice, but it's really only useful when in outdoor groups.  And that nowhere near overshadows the benefits of the JBB.<br />
With the JBB, soloing is taken to a whole new level.   <br />
<br />
In short:  Free 263 DD &gt; horse medding <br />
<br />
Least IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a huge fan of horses- in fact I think they need to be added to the &quot;big three&quot; (epic, jbb, fungi) - but I still think a JBB will give you more bang for your buck.  Mana free damage at a solid rate is just too powerful to ignore.<br />
<br />
The combination of a horse and the JBB just increases your damage output.  With the horse, I can toss an ebolt, root, jbb blast... reapply root when it breaks... and still be just about full mana by the end of the fight  (or toss a VoS or a second ebolt and still be able to cann back to full in a short time.)  <br />
<br />
The standing medding (while blasting) allows me to get the ebolt and root mana back- so it effectively adds damage per second.  Still, the damage it adds can't compare with the JBB.<br />
<br />
If you spend much time outdoors soloing, between 45 and at least the mid 50's:<br />
<br />
JBB &gt; Fungi tunic &gt; Horse &gt; Fungi staff &gt; Iksar BP<br />
<br />
All in my opinion, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In this front page of most fresh threads theres 3 threads about JBB. None but this about horses.<br />
<br />
Just get the JBBs everyone, stop asking stupid questions. I'm not gonna buy a horse till the day they sell donkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It wasn't a stupid question. Do be so arrogant.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, a couple of advantages of horses are:<br />
<br />
1 - They are easy to find. JBBs bening sold on the open market seem to be quite rare.<br />
<br />
2 - They sell back for a good price with no hassle, so if you decide to liquidate your nag to buy a JBB, no problem.<br />
<br />
having said that, I can't see anyone having a problem selling a JBB  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well i did forget to update that I am currently level 51... but I think a JBB is what is for me. I saw 4 selling on one day last week, and none this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">JBB, no contest in my opinion, will give you a nice powerboost and throw some more fun in the game for you, at least it did for me. And it never gets obsolete, well worth the cash. And with the JBB you can prolly amass the same amount of pp with some creative camping in no time. ;)<br />
<br />
I want a horse now though :p <br />
<br />
Anyone know how much mana you get per tick at 60 medding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That sig is crazy Deacis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the horse compliments the JBB well, moreso than vice versa, but it really depends on a lot of factors.  I think in your case I'd definitely go JBB first.  I know you decided already, but I like to gab. :p<br />
<br />
I like that sig a lot too, Deacis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't forget that the horses have Safe Fall, think about 150 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree Bigguss<br />
<br />
JBB + Horse is amazing outside.<br />
<br />
JBB &gt; Horse &gt;&gt;&gt; Fungi &gt; Iksar Chestplate  (outdoors)<br />
<br />
Fungi == 15 hp tick == 7.5 mana tick<br />
<br />
Horse == about 25 mana tick when blasting with JBB.<br />
<br />
Horse about 3 X Fungi but situational.<br />
<br />
Horse NOTES:<br />
a) turn horse models off....  you loose safe fall but allso all the<br />
anoying horse movement problems.<br />
b) only works outside<br />
c) no auto-med when auto-attack<br />
d) no auto-med when running around<br />
e) horse eats and dringks a lot....  stock up on supplies.<br />
<br />
Get the JBB first.  The horse is greatly effective when blasting<br />
with the jbb.<br />
