anymore, I was wondering if this would be a better idea to address casual versus raiding loot issues?<br />
<br />
I know that brenlo said the ep loot for sale via ldon is a big fat &quot;NO&quot; (in so many words hehe), but what about this for the casual player:<br />
<br />
You can do ldon raids, and get a new type of ldon raid point as a reward.  Then, after you've saved enough ldon points, you can buy raid quality gear?  Perhaps they have three types of raids, easy, medium, and hard, and you can get three different corresponding points.  Hard raid points buy EP+ gear, medium buy VT+ gear, and easy buy.. dunno, vindi gear maybe.  <br />
<br />
No long flagging, very little planning, probably can be done in 2-3 hours, but at least you are still raiding.  Might take you making a post to gather 18 players on a saturday together.  Or spending 30 minutes /ooc'ing to form a raid, but at least the loot is tied to taking down a bigger mob.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'm all for casual players having access to better loot.  i just hate the idea of god-like loot being available just for doing something repetitive with a group over and over.  It breaks with the idea that good loot comes from uber boss mobs, something I dont' like.  Having ldon raid points would let the casual work towards something better incrementally, while still retaining the notion that good gear comes from big mobs.  <br />
<br />
Maybe this is what people should suggest to Brenlo, because, and I agree with him, having god-like gear buyable from merchants isn't going to happen, nor should it.  But, at the same time, I hate to see the casual player fall farther and farther behind.  <br />
<br />
Right now, its a fairly big discrepancy, but in a couple more expansions, with the same trends, its going to be a much greater discrepancy.  To the point that the raider will never, ever want to group with a non raider, just because of the power difference.  <br />
<br />
In some ways, non raiders failling behind hurts my few nights I get to casual play.  I can't seem to ever find a group that is worth my time.  Some nights, of course, are good, but other nights, its a living nightmare.  Between paper tanks that can't hold aggro, and clerics saying &quot;OOM&quot; every other mob, and the fact that you can't ever get groups in GoD (cause the vast majority of players can't handle it, or are intimidated by it), it means that the gear discrepancy issue does effect the raider.  <br />
<br />
But, at the same time, I don't want to see the casual player just do something repetitive with little risk and end up with raid quality gear.  So why not add a ldon raid point system, addressing time constraints and requiring raiding in one blow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the point of a lot of the non-raiders perspective...isnt hitting PoF/PoW/PoE for armor drops over and over and over just as repetitive and have the same lack of risk? (It did when I was raiding the EPs every week at least...clearing all of the minis in fire/water for molds-half of us could be asleep and it wouldnt matter).<br />
<br />
I would be interested to see Brenlo's take on something like this idea however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, because of the type of work it took to get there.  And you aren't buying it, you are looting it.  The issue is, should I be able to build towards a great item from day one, or should I have to raid, flag, work as a team with large numbers, overtake gods, to get a chance to farm stuff. <br />
<br />
The issues for me is, ldon points buying EP+ loot<br />
<br />
1.) means that loot is not tied to a big boss mob, breaking the fantasy reality that the item is something from a god.<br />
2.) required no planning or coordination with large numbers of people and degrades the value of that type of eq community building work (yes work, not play).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First, read this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22299) thread on LDON raids and strategies and what folks had to say.<br />
<br />
Your idea isn't a bad one at all, I don't suppose. Raid work for raid-quality gear. Fair enough, aye? But in order for it to work, there are going to have to be some serious revamps made to LDON raid structure. As I said in the thread I linked above, the LDON raid my guild tried (that's singular LDON raid, mind you, there is NO reason to go back) was just not worth it. A ton of time, three wipes, and no reward whatsoever.  Raid size, poor reward, poorly thought-out raid environments ... the frustrations of LDON raids would drive most folks back into the single-group LDON content in a quick hurry. I would not ever take an open raid into an LDON dungeon. You couldn't pay me enough. <br />
<br />
I'll agree there are huge discrepancies between raiders and casual folks, but in the current situation (as far as LDON design is concerned) I don't know as though LDON raiding is the way to fix it. Good idea, though, on the whole.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, they'd have to rework ldon raiding for sure.  Just throwing the general concept out there to see how the casual players would feel about it.  The idea that you can join an 18 man pickup raid for a 2 hour &quot;easy&quot; raid, earn raid points, and eventually buy VT loot with those points.  Or slightly more planning and coordination, join an 18 man hard ldon raid, earn hard ldon points, and buy an EP piece eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;isnt hitting PoF/PoW/PoE for armor drops over and over and over just as repetitive and have the same lack of risk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not really, because of the type of work it took to get there.  And you aren't buying it, you are looting it.  <br />
<br />
Mostly likely, unless your guild uses pure randoms, you're using some type of &quot;buy&quot; system for loot off mobs.<br />
<br />
DKP is basically a fancy LDON system.    &quot;Awarded&quot; loot is basically points as well... just not as cut and dry... but you still get &quot;points&quot; for showing up, dedicated, quality of upgrade, etc... whatever your criteria is.<br />
<br />
It may look different on the surface... but doing an encounter over and over (eg: &quot;farming for loot&quot;) is basically the same as doing an ldon over and over and over... and in the end, you'll &quot;buy&quot; the loot you want one way or another.<br />
<br />
If  a person wants to drive themself crazy doing an LDON over and over for 2500 pts to get a piece of Elemental Ornate quality armor... I say more power to them... the current gear gap is too high.   Time and GoD still offer upgrades over Ele-Ornate, and high end raiders will always have better gear... AND... have access to the same options and non-raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;It may look different on the surface... but doing an encounter over and over (eg: &quot;farming for loot&quot;) is basically the same as doing an ldon over and over&quot;<br />
<br />
Aye, I agree it looks similar, and in fact, with a dkp system, it is very similar.  The two big differences I see, as I posted above, are more about the reality of the game.  The fantasy reality if you will.<br />
<br />
Don't you guys care that the game retains some semblance of eq-reality?  Meaning, don't you care that god-like loot should drop off a god that required a horde of coordinated players to take down?  I do I guess.<br />
<br />
In addition, don't you care that community building via guilds is a large part of EQ?  That the guild structure, in and of itself, is a good thing for the attitude in EQ?  That the relationships and cooperation, Time rotations, etc.., are part of what makes EQ special?<br />
<br />
If everything was instanced, and everything was buyable, whats the point of raiding anymore?  Whats the point of planning and coordinated anything?  <br />
<br />
I know that I started later than some folks, and earlier than others (a few months before pop came out), but even I remember EQ feeling a whole lot more real, more concrete.  I remember thinking, if I want that gods cloak, I need to get together with 40 people and kill that god.  <br />
<br />
The idea that I could just log on 1 hour each night with random people and buy that gods cloak destroys the reality of EQ for me.  At least requiring a lesser raid over and over, to build raid points, mimicks the old school notion that good gear comes from boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you referring to people who do nothing but LDON's?  <br />
<br />
First off, it's not as if they are buying something everynight.<br />
<br />
Second, the top of the line gear requires 1492 points per piece.  At 51 points per SUCCESS that is 30 successes.  Figure an hour a success (I'm being generous if you are into &quot;Russian-Pickup&quot;).<br />
<br />
Now you have a &quot;nice&quot; BP or Robe, a step up from Ornate but again, far, far short of anything you can get in Elementals.<br />
<br />
Third, you have to augment it.  Figure another 2400 points to augment any particular 3-slot item (510, 760, 1150) and you're looking at another 40 + successes.<br />
<br />
So you've spent 70 hours, are 70-0 and have * 1 * piece of NEAR (but still) sub-Elemental gear.<br />
<br />
If you play 4 hours a night, (One you're not a casual), and you're looking at * A * single upgrade every 17 days of non-stop, four hour a night playing.<br />
<br />
However I have been in a DKP-raiding guild and I guarantee I got better than 1 piece of gear every 17 days. <br />
<br />
Again, I don't begrudge raiders THEIR gear as they spent loads of time flagging, back-flaggin etc. <br />
<br />
So why do they begrudge me my gear (which is FAR sub to theirs) and think their time is better than mine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Faern, I'm not sure you're understanding what I'm suggesting. I want you to be able to get raid quality items.  However, I don't want you to get them doing single group content.  Its not a &quot;you don't spend the time&quot; argument.  <br />
<br />
Ldon loot every 17 days is fine.  Just like I spent 14 days getting VT keyed (cause we rotated and helped everyone in the guild) and then probably got a piece of loot every other week after that.<br />
<br />
The major difference is in the storyline/route/reality required to get that piece.  All I'm suggestion is that in order to buy ldon raid level gear, why not require ldon raids that incrementally earn you points just like single group earns you points now?  (With the caveat that yes, ldon raids need reworking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice idea but I think your missing the point. A casual player has a hard enough time trying to get 6 people together and now you want me to get 18 people together?<br />
<br />
Let me explain my situation so you can better understand. I've been playing for around 5 years. I was in the top raiding guild for 2 years. After 5 years of grinding the magic is long gone but I still enjoy the game. I have a job and work 6 days a week. When I go home there is stuff going on all the time so I don't have much time for myself. LDoN is the only thing keeping me here, it's my best avenue for advancement that a respectable job holding adult can take. It's not going to hurt anything by putting elemental type loot on a ldon vender. If you raid your going to have much better gear anyways and &quot;your&quot; magic will still be intact. It doesn't really matter though because they already said it ain't going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do care about the fantasy and the &quot;feel&quot; of the game... but I'm afraid that real life and EQ life do not always get along well.<br />
<br />
I always want the raiders to have their content.  I have never been &quot;against&quot; raid content.   I want people who can organize and experience it, to go off and kill the mystical dragon guarding the mountain top and save the princess.    And I want you to loot the glowing sword of froglok kings.     Not mocking, I'm serious.<br />
<br />
But now for the RL realities... some people just don't have a lot of time... some people don't have the desire... some people even don't have the skill... or just want to hang with 3-4 friends.    Doesn't matter the reason really... we need to provide for them too.<br />
<br />
I truly don't see the harm in allowing someone, to do mind numing adventures with their friends (or pickups) and one day get a +150mana/150hp/150end  BP, with a nice built in effect, and even some aug slots.<br />
<br />
Raiders should have the best loot... I believe they put in considerable effort to keep a large group of people happy.<br />
<br />
I just don't believe that non-raiders should be so far behind... I believe they need options, even if those options take weeks of mind-numbing adventures to get... the key here is non-raid upgrade options, that are doable without being uber.<br />
<br />
If they can do it and maintain a high fantasy setting, then more power to them... but anytime a named mob has good obtainable loot, it's perma-camped... whereas in LDON, it's available to everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How hard would it be to pick one night and have an open ldon raid?  Set in stone, every.. say, Wednesday night?  <br />
<br />
But I guess you're right.  If it takes a good portion of your play time just to get a 6 man group going (meaning, I assume you don't have any regulars you play with), well, then, setting up a mini raid probably won't work for you.<br />
<br />
I guess its a tricky situation hehe.  I mean, would they give a blackbelt to someone who only practiced 15 minutes a day, but did so for 10 years?  The blackbelt goes to the person who practices for 2-4 hours a day, 5 days a week.  (been a while since I practiced, but thats how it was for me:)<br />
<br />
At any rate, what's a better alternative than ldon raid points?  How can you not devalue the community and game reality aspects of killing gods for loot, while allowing the casual player to advance and explore the content he has purchased?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">anytime a named mob has good obtainable loot, it's perma-camped... whereas in LDON, it's available to everyone.<br />
<br />
Well, that's competition for you - mob racing, politics, alliances and so on and so forth. For many, myself included, it is one of the two biggest issues with the raiding scene, the other one being the conflict with RL commitments and demands. For other people it's either not a major problem or even a plus.<br />
<br />
We all play the game for different reasons. To each his own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong but the LDoN system is already in place. Nothing is going to change except adding a few more pieces of armor. It's not going to make any difference from what it is today.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the casual player base is quite large and it would be in Sony's interest to keep them happy as well as the raiders because without the casual players, Sony might not make enough profit to keep this game going. Hell, I have 3 accounts myself. <br />
<br />
Ahh hell, it doesn't really matter anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well at least Sony is consistent, they have no clue!  Putting elemental quality equipment for about 3k points isn't about to break the balance of the game and it would give the &quot;casuals&quot; a chance to have a real nice item or 2.  Anyway, when you properly augment the existing LDON stuff its pretty nice.<br />
<br />
The real issue is whether the LDON focus items are going to be useful for 65+ spells.  If not the casuals are taking an additional hit.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
In raiding guild myself so this is not selfserving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the big differences, as I see it are:<br />
<br />
1.  Since GoD is out, casual will be one step behind raiders again since the buyable loot is &quot;only&quot; EP:).<br />
2.  A reward of equal value is given which does not reinforce the lore/reality/story/history of EQ, nor would it reinforce the community and relationship building which I think are of great value in EQ.<br />
<br />
Prior to LDON, did casual players not exist?  Yes, they existed, except their expectation of what was obtainable was different, and, the discrepancy between the casual and raider wasn't as extreme.<br />
<br />
I guess, if you want a way to obtain gear equal to a raider's, you probably don't want to start off by requesting items that are already one expansion behind.  What ever solution you think is best, ought to be one that gives casual the opportunity to get gear, not on par, but exactly equal to a raiders gear.<br />
<br />
I was thinking, if raid points existed, and good loot existed to buy them, I bet someone would go out of their way to declare &quot;sunday afternoon is open ldon raid day!!&quot; or something:)  Then all the ultra-casual player would have to do is show up.</div></div><hr />

Currently the LDoN Armor for Shamans from EF is great.  Slap on some 40 HP augs, some focus effects and you have near Ornate quality armor.<br />
<br />
No long flagging, very little planning, probably can be done in 2-3 hours, but at least you are still raiding. Might take you making a post to gather 18 players on a saturday together. Or spending 30 minutes /ooc'ing to form a raid, but at least the loot is tied to taking down a bigger mob.  <br />
<br />
Look at the bolded type.  It sounds like you want quick easy to get loot.  If thats not the case and you have to put in several weeks worth of 2-3 hours a night raids to get that loot, then kinda makes you not a casual player hehe.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm all for casual players having access to better loot. i just hate the idea of god-like loot being available just for doing something repetitive with a group over and over. <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with casual players having good loot.  Casual players shouldn't have god-like loot.<br />

It breaks with the idea that good loot comes from uber boss mobs, something I dont' like. Having ldon raid points would let the casual work towards something better incrementally, while still retaining the notion that good gear comes from big mobs.  <br />
<br />
I disagree with the bolded statement.  What that does is give someone loot who hasn't put in the time to get it, unless they do LDoN raid style adventures as you suggest for as long as it takes to get flagged to do the god-type mobs.  <br />
<br />
Maybe this is what people should suggest to Brenlo, because, and I agree with him, having god-like gear buyable from merchants isn't going to happen, nor should it. But, at the same time, I hate to see the casual player fall farther and farther behind.  <br />
<br />
Why shouldn't they fall farther and farther behind?  Some one who raids/plays a ton will ALWAYS have better gear then the casual player who doesn't.  Equal time for Equal Gear, that is fair.<br />
<br />
Right now, its a fairly big discrepancy, but in a couple more expansions, with the same trends, its going to be a much greater discrepancy. To the point that the raider will never, ever want to group with a non raider, just because of the power difference.  <br />
<br />
EQ is not about fairness.  Choose your groups as you see fit.  I group with guildies, people I leveled up with, and RL friends thats about it.  Or members from other guilds at my guilds level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway what I'm seeing here is nothing new. When they made the compass perma 200 skill everyone cried sour grapes. It was a good change that didn't affect anyone except some newb but still they complained. The same thing happened when they put in the new tradeskill window. Even though it was an improvement these same people bitched and complained. And now we see it here as well with the mere suggestion of putting higher level gear in ldon's the raiders have gone into a tizzy even though it's a plus for the casual player and doesn't affect the raiding player at all.<br />
<br />
It's sour grapes. <br />

<br />
I agree with you.... but that's where I say this is a game... and everyone should be able to enjoy a good level of reward... no matter if you raid it ever night, or it takes you 2 months of LDONs to get a fairly kick ass BP which is still lower quality than the high and very high level raiders.<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind with LDON (also with some guild systems)... once you win... you go back to &quot;0&quot; basically.   2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months... whatever it took to get you that BP.... it's gonna take the same to get your second item if you go after it with the same focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bludletters, just so you know where I'm coming from..<br />
<br />
I raid.  Thats the only way I get loot. I have my VT key, and have done so many damn backflagging pop events I want to puke just thinking about Bert again:)<br />
<br />
My point in making this thread was to see if any solution existed that would keep the casual player and the raiding player close enough gear wise, that they could still group, that would keep the raider feeling like they accomplished something, and keep the casual feeling like they are somewhat keeping up.<br />
<br />
I just see a trend where, two years from now, it won't be even remotely worth your time to group with someone without a powerhouse guild tag.  That limits both what the casual player and the raider can do with pickup groups.  Unless, of course, you are perfectly happy only grouping with your guild, and never want a pickup group again in your life:)<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently the LDoN Armor for Shamans from EF is great. Slap on some 40 HP augs, some focus effects and you have near Ornate quality armor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The difference between ornate and EP is already huge.  I'm just looking down the road.  Say, two expansions from now, Ldon gear is the same, and dropped &quot;expansion named X&quot; gear is +400 hp +400 mana.  The gap is widening.  I agree with your basic notion, if you don't put in the time, you don't get the loot, but couldn't EQ offer multiple paths to similar loot?  If a casual player puts in 100 hours, don't they deserve an upgrade similar to what a raider gets?  The only difference in the time put in, is the casual player does 1 hour chunks, the raider player does 4-12 hour chunks.  <br />
<br />
However, what I don't want to have happen, is a zero risk scenario, where a casual player can just do something easy and repetitive for a month, and get the same gear that requires a raid force to obtain.  So, I thought, what if there was a middle ground, some sort of smaller raid, that lets you incrementally build points in the same way that a guild gives you dkp.  Thats all.<br />
<br />
&quot;What that does is give someone loot who hasn't put in the time to get it&quot;<br />
<br />
I disagree.  Why is 12 hour chunks of time more valuable than 12 one hour chunks of time?  <br />
<br />
I still play.  Alot.  With a full time job.  However, I forsee a day when I won't be able to play 6 hours every night and 12 hours each weekend day.  What happens to me then?  Does that mean EQ is basically over for me unless I want to stop exploring challenging content?  Because I assure you, people that aren't in guilds getting EP gear won't be doing vxed or tipt anytime soon. They'll probably struggle just doing the unflagged zones in the beginning of god.  Will Omens be even worse?  What about the expansion after that? <br />
<br />
&quot;Equal time for Equal Gear, that is fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Couldn't agree with you more:)<br />
<br />
&quot;no matter if you raid it ever night, or it takes you 2 months of LDONs to get a fairly kick ass BP which is still lower quality than the high and very high level raiders.&quot;<br />
<br />
See, thats the problem.  How much lower is acceptable? Where do you draw the line?  Half strength, 3/4 strength?  IMO, if anything is going to be done to address the growing discrepancy of gear, it needs to set the equation at 1=1.  12 hours of playing, whether its during a 12 hour raid, or during 6 two hour ldon raids, needs to yield the same value.<br />
<br />
To be honest, because I raid alot (or used to, in between guilds atm), I could care less what they do for casual players.  But for those of you that play 6 hours a night.  Think about how you'd feel if you had a family, full time job, lessons to bring the kids to, yard to maintain, etc.. and your favorite game offered you no route to keep up.   Buying expansions would be pointless (if the trend continues), so would you have fun, say, stuck in PoP content for 3 years? Nope.  <br />
<br />
And if EQ loses all its casual players because future expansions are worthless to them, that degrades the raiding game as well. Less money for SOE means less work done on EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Delvean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First, the discrepency between raiders and non-raiders is already huge. You don't need to wait for 2 years down the road for the power house guilds not wanting to group with casuals. It is going on now and has been for some time. I am, in my opinion, a very well equiped casual paladin. I buff to 8500 hp (with tribute) and 1550ish ac. That is pre-elemental and pre-VT. The ultra high end paladins are now at 13k buffed hp and somewhere around 2500 ac or more. I think it is pretty safe to say that I could not hold a candle to a ultra high end raider. Even paladins in just time gear beat me by 2-3k hp and 500 ac. This does not even take into account effects like stun resist and shielding and high end focus effects which casuals have no possible method of attaining.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't believe that I should have the quality of gear as these people because obviously they play much more than I do. However, I do believe that there should options available for non-raiders to achieve close to the same level of gear if they invest the same amount of time and effort. Who says that raiding it so much harder than single group content? Well, sometimes it is, but that is through poor game design. The developers use up their creativity making raids interesting and challenging, that often times single group content is a dull, boring pull mob and kill for 3 hours. A system is needed to bring the challenges and rewards of raids to a single group setting. The following is my proposition.<br />
<br />
Instanced dungeons would be used to make a plot line for the single group content similar to the plot line of raid content in expansions like PoP. For instance, a minotaur overlord is terrorizing the farmers in the karanas. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate him and slay him. A NPC would send you to an instanced dungeon where you would need to clear until you find a minotaur servant who you would need to severly damage until he surrendered and told you the location of the overlord. Completing this adventure would give you a flag. When you go talk to the NPC again, he now sends you to a new instanced dungeon where you must clear to and kill the overlord. Completing this also gives you a flag, which allows to to continue onto the next adventure.<br />
<br />
There would be a lock out time on each adventure of 3 or 5 days whether you succeed or fail. You must zone in first before the lockout would happen. The adventures would be repeatable even after you beat them, you'd just need to wait for the lockout to end. Loot would drop from the boss mobs from each adventure, or spawn in a chest after you win if an assassination was not the goal.<br />
<br />
There would be tiers to these. Something along these lines.<br />
<br />
Tier 1: These would start at the difficulty of current high risk LDoN adventures. There would be 3-4 different themes, with 2-4 adventures in each one. You would need to complete all of the themes to get flagged for tier 2. Loot would be comparable to current high risk LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
Tier 2: These would be a step up from tier 1. More like the difficulty of the GoD sewer trials. Again there would be 2-3 themes, with 2-4 adventures for each. Loot would be similar to what can be found in ssra and the GoD sewer trials. Something like 100-120 hp items. All themes must be completed to gain access to tier 3.<br />
<br />
Tier 3: A step up from tier 2. Again, 2-3 themes, with 2-4 adventures from each. Loot would be on par with VT and pre-elemental PoP gear. All themes must be completed to gain access to tier 4.<br />
<br />
Tier 4: Step up again. There would be 2 themes with 2-4 adventures each. Loot would be on par with elemental gear. Same rules apply for access to tier 5.<br />
<br />
Tier 5: Another notch up. Loot on par with time gear. Same rules as before.<br />
<br />
And so on, the could continue to add more tiers as more expansions come out.<br />
<br />
Rules would be something like this:<br />
<br />
1) The lockout would keep you from doing any more adventures in that particular theme for 3-5 days. You could do another adventure from a different theme.<br />
2) At least 2/3 (4 out of 6) of the people in the group must be flagged for the tier you are going to adventure in.<br />
3) There are no points awarded for completion of these. Loot would generally be 1 item per adventure.<br />
<br />
This gives non-raiders an equal path of progression as raiders but in a single group content. The loot achieved should never be as good as what raiders can get. I would say keep the loot about 1 expansion behind the raid loot in terms of quality.<br />
<br />
This system retains the feel of loot dropping from the powerful mobs in EQ. That minotaur overlord has his awesome cape that drops as a reward for ridding Norrath of his evil presence. The legendary wizard you rescued fomr the depths of the hobgoblins' lair rewards you with a ring of power. Etc. There is no endless grinding to buy items off of merchants.<br />
<br />
Here's how I imagine the rate of progression would go. Say there is 3 themes in tier 1, with 3 adventures in each theme, and a 3 day lock out period on each theme. A group that was determined could get to tier 2 in 7 days. On the first day they could complete the first adventure for each of the 3 themes. On the 4th day the lock out ends and they complete the second adventure for each theme. On the 7th day they are then able to complete the final adventure in each theme and they get flagged for tier 2. That is 9 loot items (1 per adventure), in 7 days. This may seem like a lot, but a group of people capable of doing these this quickly plays a lot already and most likely has better gear than what drops in tier 1.<br />
<br />
Those that did not have the gear to be successful in tier 1 yet, would have to farm LDoN's to get their gear up to the level that it should be. Those that complete tier 1, but found tier 2 to still be too difficult, would have to farm the adventures in tier 1 until they were geared to where they needed to be. And so on. This follows the same logic of raiding where you need to farm the same mobs over and over until your raid force is geared enough to progress further.<br />
<br />
That is what I would like to see for the casual/non-raiding player. I see no reason why they couldn't create a single group, alternate path to raid progression that was equally challenging with rewards worth the risks.<br />
<br />
Some may say that this already exists in GoD, but it doesn't. I can gear up from LDoN and the first 4 GoD sewer trials and make my way to vxed. In vxed, I will be extremely challenged to kill the named to gear up there. Even if I get everything I can from vxed and LDoN, tipt is a solid brick wall that I have no chance at all to succeed in. The tiers in my proposed system would be such that if you spent time gearing up in tier 1, you would be able to complete the adventures in tier 2 where you could gear up for tier 3, and so on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thats a pretty good idea Delvean.  Only thing I don't like is the rate of return:<br />
<br />
&quot;Loot would generally be 1 item per adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats a 1 in 6 chance of getting a good drop (assuming a full group).  Thats a little high imo.  But thats all stuff that could be adjusted, tweaking etc.. maybe the boss mob of each step has a 40% chance to drop the good item, and 60% chance for a crap item hehe.<br />
<br />
In general, that'd be fine imo.  Some sort of story line, some sort of ongoing quest-like adventure that can be completed in steps, etc..  <br />
<br />
Actually, the more I think about that, even raiding, I'd love to do that sort of stuff in my downtime hehe.  There's a few new quests I want to try out, like the new god augment quest... but man, talk about a pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
I wish EQ had more quests like the prayer shawl in general.  Like, 2-3 excellent quests per slot, per class, per expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't disagree with you Ungkor and think a system to give non raiding/non guilded people good gear would be a good idea.  But casual players in nearly the same gear as high end raiders wouldn't be bad.<br />
<br />
Kinda like asking the JV wrestler to have match with the 4 time returning state champ in that weight class.  <br />
<br />
6 hours a day x's 5 is 30 hours and then add another 24 for the weekends thats 54 hours a week you play.  Now 2 hours a day is 14 hours a week.  Simple math shows to be fair that it would take them almost 3.8 times longer to get that same item.  So if it takes you 2 months, it should take them over 7.5 months.  <br />
<br />
Would you put that much time in doing just for that item and nothing else for that amount of time?  Just seems out of reach when you look at the figures.  Because in the time you got your 1 upgrade I have gotten 3 or 4.  So now you are 2 years behind the power curve.  <br />
<br />
When I grouped with ppl I didn't know I died alot more then if grouped with ppl I have worked with time and time again.  Our gear and our past dealings are what makes it go better.  <br />
<br />
You can be a better shaman then me and if you gear is inferior and your group can't work together you won't suceed as easily as if you have regular groupmates.  <br />
<br />
It not a fault on either side.  Its just simpley the amount of hours played thats the factor.  Equal gear for Equal time would be the fair way, but if anything I said above makes sense then you can see its not really going to allow casual players to &quot;hang&quot; with Raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Good point Bludletters,<br />
<br />
I guess it does boil down to equal time for equal loot, which in turn means if you play less, expect less.  <br />
<br />
Still, as it is right now, a non raider can NEVER get an EP/Time piece of gear. Ever.  So even if it took 7.5 months to get a really good item, I bet some people would work on it.  Now, the numbers need some sort of adjustment.  <br />
<br />
Now, I wouldn't say we should base our arguments on these made up numbers, but rather base them on the general idea that non raiders should have routes to equal gear.  What the exact play time is for such an adventure is of course silly to argue about, because it doesn't exist.  But in general, I wouldn't be opposed to to quests, instanced quests, ldon raid points, or some sort of system, whereby, if you put in equal time, you can obtain equal items at some point.<br />
<br />
I like the above posters idea that you can only complete the instanced quest stages every few days or something. So, while it might take you 4 months to complete the long quest for uber item X, you can still be doing your normal ldon runs, saving for armor, augments, spells, farming, etc...  <br />
<br />
It would give the non raider something to shoot for long term, just like a guild has &quot;getting to time&quot; or &quot;getting to Tacvi&quot; as long term goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Equal gear for Equal time would be the fair way<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I am much more of a casual player than a raider myself. My schedule is too erratic for real raiding and I don't like the politics that comes with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure where the whole idea of &quot;equal gear for equal time&quot; came from. That's not the way it works in RL and it has never worked that way in EQ.<br />
<br />
Think back to 1999. You could have killed 1,000 snakes in West Freeport and it still wouldn't have helped you advance past level 5. Or you could have kited outdoors well into the 40s, but it wouldnt' have gotten you any of (what passed for) the &quot;good loot&quot;, which was found in dungeons. At least much of the loot was droppable, so you could kill hundreds of HGs to trade for it :)<br />
<br />
Everquest's real motto has always been &quot;equal reward for equal risk&quot;. The only things that have changed over time are:<br />
<br />
1. Watering down of &quot;risk&quot;. Remember rotting corpses in PoF? Nigthmare CRs in LGuk or Chardok?<br />
<br />
2. Beefing up of rewards for relatively low risk activities, e.g. LDON, AAs, etc.<br />
<br />
3. Higher rewards for long quests that require dedication, e.g. the 8th Shawl.<br />
<br />
4. Fluctuation in the amount of SOE's resources dedicated to extirpating any deviation from this motto.<br />
<br />
As an aside, &quot;casual&quot; doesn't necessarily mean &quot;low risk&quot; and &quot;raid&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;high risk&quot;, especially in the PoP era.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I like Delvean's idea. If properly implemented, it could  reward skill as opposed to the amount of time you spend in game, which is a good thing IMO. LDON was a step in the right direction when it was released because at least it forced people into dungeons. And yes,there are still 65s that find &quot;normal&quot; LDON hard to win because they have no clue what they are doing. Little things like thinking that Druids can Slow, maxing INT on a Priest because &quot;I build my character around INT&quot;, Monks wearing DEX/AGI jewelry and so on. I am sure they spent a ton of time getting to 65...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">In addition, don't you care that community building via guilds is a large part of EQ?  That the guild structure, in and of itself, is a good thing for the attitude in EQ?  That the relationships and cooperation, Time rotations, etc.., are part of what makes EQ special?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe your server is different, but my experience is that raiding guilds can be much less of a community then non raiding guilds. From the time I was 55 until I quit EQ I went through three different raiding guilds that were constantly turning over members or just disbanding. Too many people stick around to get just what they need to apply for that next higher guild. One of those guilds I was lucky enough to be a member of from doing West ToV until the Elemental Planes. Sadly it disbanded when I was gone, but even in that time we had so many people that just got what they needed and moved on. <br />
<br />
On the other hand I'm currently hanging with the family guild that I was in from the time I was level 5 until I was level 54. The same core of people is still there and hasn't changed at all during almost two years. Saying that only raiding guilds are real communities isn't very accurate. I have been trying to help them find little things to do, but the difference in gear between people that have never raided and have raided lower PoP/Ssra is so bad that it is very limiting. Having led raids in both I can definately say trying to get together 12-18 non raiders to hit a minor mob like the acrylia burrower is much more challenging then killing a PoP god with a raiding guild. <br />
<br />
If my play times ever improve I will go back to raiding because that is what I find to be the most fun in EQ, but these people really deserve to have the same kind of gear I could get even if it did take much longer.</div></div><hr />

Yes exactly near ORNATE quality gear nowhere near EP gear.<br />

Why oh why do we always see an attack of the green eyed monsters from raiders when someone suggest having near EP gear from ldon ?.<br />
<br />
I do get the feeling from reading some of the posts on this thread and various others that some of the raiders here seem to think they are superior to non raiders.<br />
<br />
My 1 point here is i know a lot of raiders have alts who are twinked right from lvl 1.<br />
Now my question is why do you twink these toons ?.You dont NEED that Funghi etc at lvl 1.<br />
You do it because its nice to have and makes playing more enjoyable.<br />
Why so jealous that someone who hasnt killed a god should have nice gear ?.<br />
<br />
Ah risk vs reward you say ?.<br />
Farming hmm now i can go to Acrylia,Droga etc and farm the **** out of these places and make myself a nice pile of cash.Good reward for very little risk.<br />
Hmm perhaps you raiders dont farm either because that would be going against your beliefs in risk vs reward.<br />
<br />
Hope no EP or above guild ever takes on the AoW etc because thats once again low risk vs high reward.<br />
<br />
I hope no raiders ever sell Ornate patterns as the people buying these are getting good reward for no risk.<br />
<br />
I am literally sick of hearing this risk vs reward argument bull**** from raiders.<br />
<br />
A raider dies on a raid im pretty certain hes 100% certain of getting a rez ?.<br />
Some &quot;casual&quot;(as you raiders like to call them) dies against his non uber mob trying to get a reasonable bit of gear is not 100% certain of getting a rez.<br />
Hmm wonder which one has the higher risk.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me what the actual &quot;risk&quot; as such is on going on a raid.<br />
Yes you may **** up a few times and wipe but once youre used to it it turns into a farming opportunity.<br />

I have never been in a real raiding guild, but I think there are a few &quot;family style raiding guilds&quot; going, at least on E'ci. Na Koa was one for a while, not sure if they still are. But it's true that some high level raiding guilds don't appear to have almost any sense of community.<br />
<br />
...these people really deserve to have the same kind of gear I could get even if it did take much longer.<br />

I don't think I understand why &quot;these people really deserve to have the same kind of gear&quot; follows from &quot;the same core of people is still there and hasn't changed at all during almost two years&quot;. They may be nice folks and know how have fun together, but &quot;deserve to have the same kind of gear&quot;?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would argue that something along the lines of Hard LDON would be (and already is to a significant extent) a viable alternative for those of us who do not raid on a regular basis. It can be intense and fun and challenging and yield good gear to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok Wulfbane, Risk vs Reward = Dumb, we understand your feelings which is why I said Equal time for Equal gear.

Point is that if you play 50 hours a week vs 10 hours your loot will come faster. Period.  The original posters idea was to try and make the gap not so big.  There is NO way of making the gap any smaller it can't be done.  Those who put more time will have the better gear.  Those that put more time in, in a shorter amount of time will have it faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not necessarily true. It matters diddly squat how much time you put in if you are not in a raiding guild. You could play EQ 18 hours a day for 7 days a week, but if you aren't in a raiding guild, you will NEVER achieve the same quality of gear.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone is thinking of saying, &quot;well, if you play that much just join a raiding guild and then you will get the gear.&quot; This is the worst argument I have ever heard. People have different play styles and not every one wants to be in a raiding guild, or enjoys advancing through raiding. The problem with Everquest is that the only way to get high end gear is to raid. There is no other alternative. If you don't like to play the way they want you to, then you are never going to keep up with the Jones'.<br />
<br />
Then there is the other argument people like to spew, &quot;well, if you aren't raiding high end content, then you have no need for high end gear.&quot; So, for the rest of my EQ life, I am supposed to kill the exact same crap over and over because I can't get the gear to do something harder? I personally dislike LDoN. It is boring and extremely repetitive. There is no challenge what-so-ever. Even hard adventures are just mind numbingly boring. It is an experience grind except for LDoN points instead of experience. Why do I need better gear? Because I want to do harder things. I want to take a group of friends and go kill something big that we couldn't before. I'm a big fan of doing more with less, but skill only takes you so far. Eventually you just need better gear in order to progess. <br />
<br />
I want to see single group content that is fun and is a challenge. I want encounters that are as much of a test of skill as they are of gear. I want those encounters to hold upgrades for me with better rewards than just another 5 ac, or another 10 hp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I feel like it takes far more skill to do most of the single group content I try then when I raid.  <br />
<br />
Unless you are the raid leader, and its a first kill (and you haven't talked to other raid leaders/guilds to see how its done), then, like me, you probably are assigned some simple role, like spam cure the MT of disease for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Raiding, man, I feel dumbed down raiding.  And the flags to get to the mobs to raid them?  Talk about time sinks.  Farming shards, farming emp keys, backflagging grummus 30 times, running to try to catch rallos zek up, etc.  <br />
<br />
Raiding is NOT skill.  It's most certainly time.  The strongest guilds are those who's players have the highest playtimes.   Of course, because they spend so much time online, they typically become fairly skilled in their classes abilities.  But don't kid yourself, its the time spent playing that gets you the opportunities to kill the flag mob, to kill the big mob, to get the loot.  Not skill.<br />
<br />
At any rate, what I think you guys are feeling is the loss of the sense of adventure that dungeon crawling and raiding sometimes brings when you compare them to ldon style &quot;grind for money and buy&quot; type stuff.  Its not skill, its knowledge.  Researching spawns and pathing.  Doing something no one has done before.  It isn't skill, its adventure.  Its venturing forth into the unknown.  Ldon's are the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the instanced, incremental quest stuff mentioned above (for excellent end items), but make it like a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; type book. Choices made during the quest perhaps spawn different instances, so players end up taking different routes for the same piece.  Anything to reduce the cookie cutter ldon style adventures that are basically all casual players have right now.</div></div><hr />

First Off   Raiders vs Casuals<br />
Secondly  Time vs Not so Much Time<br />
Thirdly     Time Spent = Productive Time Spent<br />
<br />
Raiders who spend more time being productive will always have better gear then Casual Players who don't raid but spend the same amount of time being productive.<br />
<br />
This is the issue that is getting people concerned/upset.  So in 2 months when Raider has gotten 3 or 4 upgrades and the Casual Player has gotten 1 upgrade it doesn't fix the issue.<br />
<br />
Forget about the risk or time or whatever other factor you might want to use.  Bottom line is that there is not a way to fix this issue that some people seem to have great emotional distress about.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rich get richer and the poor stay poor&quot;<br />
<br />
It will eventually balance itself out after there are no more expansions.  When there is no more new gear to get and people go to other games or the casual player finally finishes &quot;the race&quot;.  The Raider just finished &quot;the race&quot; faster.<br />
<br />
Like I said before spend your time as you see fit, group with the people you want to group with.<br />
<br />
On a side note tho.  If you went to college, got a degree, searched for a job, and got hired in your field. Would it be fair to have some person who spent that same time that you did in college, but spent that time drinking beer and watching porn to make the same salary you did?  The answer is no he didn't spend the same amount of productive time that you did.  <br />
<br />
Would if hired at an appropriate pay scale, this same person ever catch up with in salary if he now spent the same amount of productive time doing that same job.  Again the answer is no you have the degree,  and there is nothing he can do, short of going to college, to catch up in pay.<br />
<br />
Same thing in this game.  If you want the gear that a raider  gets become a raider.  If you don't have the time or the ambition to do that then be happy with the gear you have.  I am not being rude only realistic.  Don't expect, and this is not directed at anyone person in any way, to be handed gear just for playing because you think you deserve it.  Play the game when you can.  <br />
<br />
LDoN was a great idea.  It gave really great gear for the time involved and you could work towards it a little at a time.  There is nothing wrong with that.  When OoW comes out I am sure they will implement better gear from LDoN type encounters, so that the gap doesn't grow.<br />
<br />
I would be happy to see someone who can play 10 hours a week get the equivalent of my BP by doing a quest or some other method where as they could get great upgrades but the time invested being productive would have to be similar thats all I think most people are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Delvean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Saying the way that it is, doesn't mean that that is the way it has to be. Joe may go to college and study computer science and make a great living when he graduates, but that doesn't mean that Jim can't teach himself how to program on his own time and also make that exact same wage.<br />
<br />
I agree that the more productive time you spend in EQ, the better your rewards will be. However, if a non-raider spends as much productive time as a raider, I don't agree that the raider's gear should always be X times better. That is the way it is right now, but it doesn't have to be that way.<br />
<br />
Create an alternate path of progression involving single group encounters that are equally challenging and rewarding as raiding. If raiding 5 hours a night gives X reward after 7 days, then make doing productive single group content 5 hours a night for 7 days give Y reward where X ~= Y. I don't care if I get less upgrades when I play less. I do care that when I play the same amount of time, there is no avenue for me to get anywhere close to the same quality of gear.<br />
<br />
I would not want the single content reward to come from doing LDoN 5 hours a night for 7 days. I would want it to come from something much less repetitive and more challenging.<br />
<br />
Also, I see no reason why there is not alternate advancement quests to get to the elemental planes. There are quests to give you access to PoV/PoS, tactics, CoD, torment, BoT, and HoH that do not require raiding. Where are the quests to give access to sol ro and the elementals? The plane of fire and earth are as much experience zones as they are raid zones. A single group in the plane of water and air can get a couple pieces of equipment and some quest drops.<br />

<br />
Why not ?.<br />
<br />
So raiding is not repetitive then.Ive obviously misread the quotes from raiders on here stating raiding involves sitting on your arse for hours just to kill a mob in 30 mins or so.<br />
And once again please tell me what is challenging about raiding apart from what i said in a previous post.<br />
The 1st few LDoNs you do are a challenge but after that theyre not.Same could be said for most raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again why oh why does it worry all you raiders so much that people can get gear equivalent to yours without raiding.<br />
Just answer me 1 simple question....<br />
<br />
Why does it worry you if a non raider gets raid equivalent gear ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think youre really missing the whole point of my arguments.<br />
<br />
What is basically being said by the non raiders on here is that if we play 40 hours a week same as you then why shouldnt we have other avenues to getting equivalent gear to raiders ?.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
PS<br />
On a sidenote my shaman is bazaar and LDoN geared and im happy with what ive got.<br />
I dont care 1 way or the other if they upgrade LDoN gear or not i can do what i want to do with what ive got.<br />
It just really pisses me off to see this sort of attitude from people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Different types of raids pose different kinds of challenges. Back in the day, Vox and Naggy and then Chardok Royals and so on were CR nightmares (no Summon Corpse back then) when the raid failed. There were traps in Befallen, Unrest, Perma, Howling Stones, Chardok, etc. Was it an enjoyable challenge? Depends on who you ask, I guess.<br />
<br />
Then there was the challenge of gathering a raid force capable of slaying the foul monster at 3am because the monster only showed up every 72 hours, give or take. Hence spawn racing, guild politics, etc. Was it enjoyable? Not as far as this Troll is concerned, but come other people apparently loved it.<br />
<br />
These days (PoP+), raids are more tactical in nature. There are strategies that you need to work out (or read about) before you can hope to win even the Hedge event in PoN, much less something like TT. And I hear it gets only more complex in high end PoP and GoD, although I have no first hand experience with them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all types of raids require a significant amount of planning, coordination, learning to work together, and so on. Many require certain AAs for certain classes (try doing TT without MGB :) ) One mistake by one raider and the whole raid can fail. Is that a challenge? Sure. Is it an enjoyable challenge? Again, depends on who you ask.</div></div><hr />

Yes but like i said earlier once youve wiped a few times and got it sussed then it turns into a farming opportunity.<br />
As for requiring certain AAs that doesnt come into it thats like saying a group in BoT for example needs someone who can heal.<br />

<br />
Well, that assumes flawless and effortless execution of every well understood encounter, which can't always be counted on. I have seen quite a few raids that should have been easy and yet came to an early and embarrassing end because somebody hailed the wrong NPC at the wrong time or agroed something that should have been left alone. When you have up to 72+ people in a small area, all kinds of things can happen and, besides, there are often new people on the raid, &quot;friends and allies&quot;, etc. In my experience, raid preparation, politicking and management is a huge HUGE headache and, in a somewhat perverted way, a challenge -- even when it stops challenging your game skills and becomes a test of your political skills.<br />
<br />
Having said that, it is true that winning a raid encounter opens opportunities to, in effect, farming, be it items in Sol Ro or easy XP/loot  in the Elementals. That's the way Sony designed its reward for the risk and the challenge of raiding and one could certainly argue that the risk/challenge vs. reward ratio is in some cases out of line. Or you could argue that, for many people, the way raids challenge players is not the most exciting way to structure the whole &quot;risk/challenge vs. reward&quot; thing, which is what the proposal under discussion here is about.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am not sure we are on the same page here. I am not talking about raids where MGB saves you time and mana while preparing for the encounter. I am talking about raids like TT where you NEED MGB to win because the mob AE debuffs the raid at certain points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;TT where you NEED MGB to win because the mob AE debuffs the raid at certain points.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not really on topic, but I thought I'd comment hehe.  Last time we did TT, we had everyone run out except the MT and a cleric chain, right before the debuff.  Debuff happens, everyone runs back in.  No mgb necessary.  <br />
<br />
A cleric, shaman, dru were designated to rebuff the MT almost instantly.  The chain switched to fast heals at that point to ensure that the buffless tank was kept alive until he was rebuffed.</div></div><hr />

Why do you NEED better gear?  I define need as unable to function without it.<br />

Why do you want better gear?<br />

What would this new gear allow you to do which you currently can not do? (If this is nothing, then you didn't need the loot, because you didn't need it).<br />
<br />
Where would this upgrade in gear allow you to go?<br />
<br />
Would an instant upgrade to Rosark's make you happy, why?<br />
<br />
Have you actually tried any gates trials, the start of the BiC quest, have you seen the drop from the ring in riwwi, have you farmed the mobs in natambi for the neck?<br />

Have you asked SnowwSilverhammer about his non-raider upgrade path?<br />

Do you have the best you can get from BoT named/ornate?<br />

extended blessing(can't remember what it's called, just use the prayr shawl, it's better :) )?  One of the better things to get, but use AA's becuase that will effect Quintessence.<br />

This can best be answered with a quote from Delvean:<br />
<br />
Then there is the other argument people like to spew, &quot;well, if you aren't raiding high end content, then you have no need for high end gear.&quot; So, for the rest of my EQ life, I am supposed to kill the exact same crap over and over because I can't get the gear to do something harder? I personally dislike LDoN. It is boring and extremely repetitive. There is no challenge what-so-ever. Even hard adventures are just mind numbingly boring. It is an experience grind except for LDoN points instead of experience. Why do I need better gear? Because I want to do harder things. I want to take a group of friends and go kill something big that we couldn't before. I'm a big fan of doing more with less, but skill only takes you so far. Eventually you just need better gear in order to progess. <br />
<br />
To get better and move along in the game you need better gear.  Sure if you want to mash Can4 for hours and hours, you can go in wearing banded, a rusty mace and kite shield like yourself, and pray you have enough HP fully buffed for Can5, but undeniably gear makes you more powerful, and to really pull off some crazy sh*t you need to be powerful.  I can main heal and tank in the EPs, can you?  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to &quot;diss&quot; you but telling people they're being greedy (or implying it anyway) for wanting great gear is flat out retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not disagreeing that upgrades are good/wanted/needed, or trying to 'diss' anyone.  I'm just trying to figure out the motivation behind the upgrades (ie new shiny, need better, want a bigger eUnit).  <br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to letting people get upgrades as long as they actually need (my definition of need).  However if people are just wanting them because of what they see comming from late GoD, then i disagree.<br />
<br />
Basically what I was trying to do with those questions is to crack some people's skulls, and get at what they were thinking.<br />

Ok to answer in a nutshell why they want better gear since, according to you, they obviously don't need it, is everybody likes new toys.  If they put in productive hours towards getting that gear the same as me but over a longer period of real World hours they should have equal gear.  Do they need it?  No.  Do they want it?  Yes.  Should they have it?  absolutely.  <br />

I beleive that people should be geared based on the content they are going to be in.   And that the power of droped gear shoud be based on what droped it (Just wondering if some of this should be adjusted, but i think we can all agree timeless bp molds shouldn't drop off of moss snakes).  <br />
<br />
There is an upgrade path for a non-raider into most EP level gear though gates.  However this would take some work, as it would take a good number of AA's, and decent sellable gear to acheive, but it is possible to get.  I'm not saying this should be the only path, but it is one path which is available.  The same can be said about drops from hard LDoN's also, though they aren't as close to EP gear, but it's easier to get them.<br />
<br />
Oh and about you in EP with Self buffed HP of 2400...Skilled is not the term you ar elooking for that word would be lucky.<br />
<br />
Lucky?  No.  All it takes is a decent tank/cleric, and knowledge about how not to get agro.  If you don't get agro your hps never play a role aside from using them for mana...  However i do think that better gear is needed for this role.</div></div><hr />

If I wanted to play like that I would have played an enchanter or necro.  I didn't pick a shaman to hope and pray that a mob never turned and faced me.<br />

So for you nekid self buffed you would have 2122 HP leaving you 378 HP from gear.  Now even if you take away the 10% bonus for ND3 you have 1982 Self buffed nekid HP.  418 HP from your gear?

Not skill so much as gear that has made you a &quot;better&quot; shaman.  You know what I mean?</div></div><hr />

 I have a few questions about why the non-raider's want better gear (I'm not debating this point, just wondering)...............<br />
<br />
Other focus effects: If i can't thing of them, they aren't needed <br />
<br />
So you lucked into an EP guild and now your gear is getting massive upgrades?<br />
<br />
Congratu-freakin-lations.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't see WHY you NEED that gear since obviously you joined said guild to see more in EQ.<br />
<br />
BTW, neither I nor anybody else need to justify or explain ourselves to you.<br />

I am talking about raids like TT where you NEED MGB to win because the mob AE debuffs the raid at certain points.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are on the same page i just cant see your point.<br />
As i said its like saying a group NEEDS a healer its the same thing.<br />
As someone else posted you dont need the MGB's anyway but lets see a lot of exp groups function without a healer of anysort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Are any of the raiders here actually reading these posts.<br />
<br />
No one  says they NEED better gear they would like better gear.<br />
<br />
And before you say well they should go out and earn it then thats the whole point of this thread.<br />
<br />
THE ONLY WAY TO EARN EP LEVEL GEAR IS RAID.<br />
<br />
I really cant understand why you say doing hard LDoNs hundreds of times should be less rewarding than raiding.<br />
<br />
This is a game its all about having fun but you seem to begrudge people that unless they &quot;work&quot; for it as you call raiding.<br />
<br />
To people who say well raids go wrong sometimes,you done any Hard LDoNs with a pick up group lately ?.<br />
<br />
All people want is an alternative path to raiding but when you look out from your ivory towers you deem that this shouldnt happen.<br />
<br />
Do people need Bentleys when they could buy a cheap Ford. ?<br />
Do people need mansions when they could buy an apartment.?<br />
Etc etc.<br />
<br />
Its not about NEED its about enjoyment.<br />

As i said its like saying a group NEEDS a healer its the same thing.<br />
<br />
The comment about AAs was part of the following paragraph:<br />
<br />
...all types of raids require a significant amount of planning, coordination, learning to work together, and so on. Many require certain AAs for certain classes (try doing TT without MGB :) ) One mistake by one raider and the whole raid can fail. Is that a challenge? Sure. Is it an enjoyable challenge? Again, depends on who you ask.<br />
<br />
The point was that raids have a logic that is, in many ways, different from the logic of XP groups. You need different AAs like MGB, you need different spells like RGC (although now it is also useful in hard LDON) and, most importantly, the game pace is different. &quot;Guild progression&quot;, loot allocation, raid scheduling, DKP formulae and database maintenance, mob rotation, intra-guild and inter-guild politics -- it's a different game in many ways.<br />
<br />
It's neither better nor worse than XP grinding in group or solo, just different, and the challenges that it poses lie elsewhere. They are in part political, in part strategic and in part tactical. Some people love it, some people hate it, and some can't be a part of it for RL reasons.<br />
<br />
But I digress :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Everything you asked was answered multiple ways by multiple people above, but I'll recap:)<br />
<br />
Why do you NEED better gear? I define need as unable to function without it.<br />
--- Take 6 people into GoD, that are bazaar geared or less, and let them try a vxed or tipt trial:)  They'd probably think to themselves that they truly need better gear.  When people pay for an expansion, they expect to actually be able to have fun in it.<br />
<br />
Why do you want better gear?<br />
Convienance.  Taking some of the work out of the play.  Being able to chat a bit more and feel safer without continually canni'ing to keep up.  Not dying as often so you can do more in a day.  Trying new things out and having a better chance of success.  Etc..  AND, EQ is about loot. Sure, the game mechanics are fun in and of themselves, but its mainly about getting stuff.  Its about working towards something.  Sometimes that something is xp and AA, sometimes its gear, sometimes its a quest just to say you did it.  Sometimes its a flag to see something new.  But gear affects the ability to do all of that, and gear is a reward in and of itself.  That combined probably makes gear the main focus of most players.<br />
<br />
What would this new gear allow you to do which you currently can not do? (If this is nothing, then you didn't need the loot, because you didn't need it).  <br />
See above.<br />
<br />
Where would this upgrade in gear allow you to go?<br />
See above<br />
<br />
Would an instant upgrade to Rosark's make you happy, why?<br />
I'm guess then answer is no for most. Its the journey that is fun.  The sense of accomplishment.  Grinding Ldon's is repetitive and quickly becomes boring.  This thread was about alternative ways that non-raiders could get upgrades.  Quests, Ldon quests, Ldon raid points to buy raid gear, etc..  Basically, adding flavor and diversity to the game, making the routes to rewards feel more personalized and challenging.<br />
<br />
Have you actually tried any gates trials, the start of the BiC quest, have you seen the drop from the ring in riwwi, have you farmed the mobs in natambi for the neck?<br />
Without good gear, I bet the answer is no.  And the BiC quest requires raids.  Try to get a group in GoD, when you are the one member of the group that is perpetually oom, dies when a gates named even breathes on you, can't be an effective backup healer cause A) shaman healing lacks and B) you don't have the new heal or focus effects.<br />
<br />
Do you have the best you can get from BoT named/ornate?<br />
Even if you did, you still are light years behind EP geared players.  That means you are a weak link in a group.  This thread was also debating the growing discrepancy between raiders and non raiders.  Two more expansions, at this rate, and EQ will be effectively split between raiders and non raiders.  With raiders never wanting to group with non raiders.  Its almost at that point now.  In addition, this thread was about time required to do these things.  Typically, you aren't going to be able to play 1 hour a night and get ornate drops in BoT.  The goal was to see if people could come up with incremental quest/mini raid type ideas, that let the more casual player work towards items equal to a raiders.  <br />
<br />
I can tell you, a skilled shaman with only 2400 hps self buffed can hold their own in the EP's. I've done it.  <br />
Good for you.  Not sure why thats important.  You survived EP with low hitpoints, probably playing with people better geared than you.  Even so, how much did you get done that night?  How much more could you have seen and done if you were better geared?  Did you perhaps die when a few more hundred HP would have saved you?  How much downtime was that?  Sure, you were functional, but function isn't the issue. Its about fun, rewards, and seeing what you payed for.  <br />
<br />
IMHO sham don't NEED any focus effects.<br />
By the same token.. does anyone need any gear?  Would you play naked?  Would you group with a naked group and trying something hard?  Why not?  <br />
<br />
Gear does affect what you can and can't do.  It adds to your enjoyment, creates less downtime, allows you to explore, is a reward in and of itself, gives you a concrete physical sense of acomplishment, takes some of the hassle out of the game, etc..</div></div><hr />

I know its DIFFERENT.No one has said raiding is the same as exp grouping.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'm not opposed to letting people get upgrades as long as they actually need (my definition of need).  However if people are just wanting them because of what they see comming from late GoD, then i disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;let them eat cake&quot; eh.<br />
<br />
Its all about ENJOYMENT.<br />
<br />
Would you take a better paid job even if the job you do now provides for your family etc.<br />

If yes why ?.<br />
<br />
You dont NEED that extra cash although it is damn nice to have it and makes life more ENJOYABLE.<br />
<br />
Damn theres that word enjoy again mustnt mention that one as non raiders are not allowed to enjoy the game.No sorry we are allowed to enjoy it but only to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok now to some other points people have raised.<br />
<br />
People say raiding is tactical must be carefully planned which makes it more skillful etc and theres an enjoyment in knowing it could go wrong etc.<br />
<br />
Fair enough but why then do i always read on here that backflagging is the most boring thing in EQ.Surely when doing raids for backflagging you need tactics skill etc then and that means you enjoy it ?.<br />
<br />
Why does Quarm drop loot ?.<br />
<br />
He was the end mob in the toughest zone in the game.<br />
Therefore when youve killed him it means you have progressed as far as you can so why do you NEED loot from him ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">The best gear comes from large raid-force mobs.  People who can't take down large raid-force mobs shouldn't have the best gear.<br />
<br />
That said, augmented regular LDON gear is roughly equivalent to Ornate armor.  I would not have a problem with having a set of LDON raid point gear that was rougly equivalent to elemental armor, assuming that the time required to acquire the points was equivalent or greater than the time raiders spend getting EP gear.  That still preserves Time-level gear, plus high-end GoD and OoW gear, for the raiders.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think the casual raid crowd is going to be happy with the effort level that would be necessary to make acquiring this EP-level gear fair.  <br />
<br />
There are about 100 active members of my guild.   Each EP-level mob drops 1-2 good pieces of loot.  Therefore, I can expect it to take around 30-50 successful raids before I see a piece of EP-level loot.  To make this fair, a &quot;casual raider&quot; might have to attend 50-75 successful LDON raids to get one fully augmented, EP-quality piece of gear.<br />
<br />
So would the casual raiders be satisfied with one EP-level piece of equipment every 12-18 months with one successful raid per week?<br />
<br />
Could you even be successful once per week with pickup raids?</div></div><hr />

*****************************************************<br />
<br />
Just for laughs I put together a spreadsheet of LDON armors and augments. I didnt pay attention to points AT all, just tried to put together the BEST set I could with the best augments, all the focus I needed etc. If I completed this set I would be +1200hp and +1500mana quite a respectable upgrade. To do this I would need to acquire (insert drumroll here) 60,490 LDON point (spreadsheet is available if you don't believe) <br />
<br />
So lets assume i have 3hrs a night 4 nights a week. I am also going to assume I get a group fast, we kill fast and am in the same group for the night (Not easy assumptions at all). So I assume 153 pts a night (3 quick easies OR 1 hard and 1 easy). At this rate I would need 396 nights of LDON or 98 weeks of playing to acquire this set.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that this amount of time commitment is 'a tad' bit more than what it takes to get EP qear.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I'm only arguing to show the flaw in your numbers.  I'm also assuming you are upgrading all 18 non weapon slots, because if you are just covering EP mold slots you are spending 7561.25 points per slot which is off.  (please don't give me neg rep bumbs untill you've read the entire post, after that i don't care).<br />
<br />
According to your math, it will take you 1584 hours of play time to get that set of armor.<br />
<br />
Now for a hardcore EP raider (level doesn't really matter, upgrades come at about the same speed regardless really):  They get an EP mold once a month (This is quite a bit faster than i'm getting them right now, and i'm raiding 6 nights a week in the EP).  I have the same number of upgrades, 18, so this will take me 18 months to get (ignorning the EP bp actually drops in time becuase raid location doesn't matter).  Also each raid takes say 4 hours.  <br />
<br />
Now if we crunch this time, we find it takes a total of 1728 hours to get all these upgrades, but it only takes 72 weeks (4 weeks in a month, sue me i'm lazy).<br />
<br />
So now asseming these numbers are relatively accurate (you can always debate numbers, so just bear with me)<br />
<br />
It takes the raider 144 more hours of play time to get these upgrades, or an additional 10% more time spent.<br />
<br />
However the raider is playing more time per week (only raid time here).  The raider is raiding for 24 hours a week as opposed to the casual persons 12 hours a week, or 100% more time on gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
The raider is however able to acquire their full set of their gear in 72 weeks as opposed to the casual's 98.  This is done in 73.4% of time time.<br />
<br />
So the raider is getting their gear about 28% faster week wise for a 100% increase in play time, is this fair?<br />
<br />
Nah, don't bother answering that question, it's not even a retorical question, or at least i don't mean it to be. <br />
<br />
What i'm trying to show with this post is that numbers aren't that hard to make say what you want.  <br />
<br />
Personally I do think that a casual player needs and deserves a path for gear upgrades.  However I don't think that LDoN should be the more of a source than it currently is because of the time commitment required for each peice of gear that needs to be upgraded.<br />
<br />
edit:  Yea, i kinda didn't count the range slot  :D but it really wouldn't change much, just increase or decrease a few irrelivenant a few numbers here and there for the raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">You can purchase something for all 20 slots (Armor, Primary, Seconday and Range).<br />
<br />
Basic armor item is 1492.  Given that a level 65 (who would acrue full benefit from the stats) earns 51 points per adventure - WIN (normal) we are talking 30 wins before you upgrade a single slot.<br />
<br />
Figuring 3 wins a night that's 3 upgrades a month SANS augments.<br />
<br />
Now figure about 2200 per item to fully augment (1150 + 700 + 310).  All of a sudden we're looking at 1 item fully auged each month with some points left over.<br />
<br />
Note that cash drops have been nerfed as have the Tribute values for LDON items.<br />
<br />
Note also that LDON items themselves were nerfed when it was &quot;discovered&quot; that a dedicated LDON player could acrue equipment that was &quot; NEAR-ELEMENTAL.&quot;<br />

<br />
If there's such a big disagreement about LDoN armor being near-elemental quality, and how unfair it is for casuals to obtain such quality gear... then how come no one is complaining about how good GOD trash mob items are?  From several posts on eqshaman, a bazaar equipped group can do the first six trials easily, and get gear superior to elemental gear from those trials.  So what is the complaint about peeps actually spending time working on LDoN gear when GOD gear is &quot;easier&quot; to farm?<br />

Not really.    You don't say how many upgrades you are talking about, but ONE augmented item = around 3000 LDON points = around 60 successful normal adventures = 60-80 hours or so, including overhead time to form your group/get to dungeon, etc.<br />
<br />
My numbers:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are about 100 active members of my guild.   Each EP-level mob drops 1-2 good pieces of loot.  Therefore, I can expect it to take around 30-50 successful raids before I see a piece of EP-level loot.  To make this fair, a &quot;casual raider&quot; might have to attend 50-75 successful LDON raids to get one fully augmented, EP-quality piece of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
30-50 successful 2-hour raids = 60-100 hours or work per item.  Pretty equivalent.<br />
<br />
You can argue the numbers back and forth, but that's really the job of the SOE guys who have to balance this stuff.  The point is, the EP are not some awesome gravy train of upgrades, it takes a LOT of effort to farm elemental molds and items.</div></div><hr />

Fundamentaly, it's a question about the underlying game model and, by extension, human psychology. What do people find to be &quot;fun&quot; and are, therefore, ready to pay money for? How many people like soloing versus single group progression (LDON etc) versus small raids (Epics, low level PoP encounters) versus large raids (high level PoP)? How do you accommodate a broad spectrum of playstyles while maintaining a semblance of world unity?<br />
<br />
I don't think there are &quot;right&quot; answers to these questions any more than there are right answers to other basic questions of MMORPG design like PvE vs. PvP or item decay. Some things are pretty obvious, e.g. character progression for defeating trivial (&quot;green&quot;) content would be bad and so would be unbalanced risk vs. reward encounters. But other things like deciding whether a 72 person raid is more fun than a 12-18  person raid depend on the designer's guess as to what his customer base (or a significant portion thereof) would find to be &quot;fun&quot; in the long run and can only be tested via trial and error.<br />
<br />
Remember how the death penalty was halved a few months after the release? How rez spells were made available at lower levels? How light blue cons were added? How SOE boosted XP gain for killing higher level mobs and then again for grouping? Game balancing and rebalancing (DOT kiting nerfed and then unnerfed, etc) is a never ending process. What is being proposed here is just another playstyle tweak, building on top of LDON -&gt; Hard LDON -&gt; GoD trials encounters and opening up an alternate character progression path.</div></div><hr />

I agree with most of what you write but my post was aimed at Weissblaus comment that people &quot;SHOULDNT&quot; get the gear.<br />
He obviously doesnt believe non raiders should get the gear raiders do but doesnt state why they shouldnt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">The best gear comes from large raid-force mobs. People who can't take down large raid-force mobs shouldn't have the best gear.<br />
WHY ?<br />
<br />
No one has yet answered this basic question ?.<br />
<br />
From a RP, MUD, or common sence perspective:  The morepowerful the mob, the better it's gear (Originally in the basic EQ).   <br />
<br />
Example, in Blackburrow, a gnoll pup will geat beat on by the elite guard, therefore the elite guard should have better stuff to enable him to beat up on the gnoll pup.<br />
<br />
So, now if we keep in mind checking relative power to other mobs, we need to keep increasing the value of the loot that drops (there are exceptions to this but not as many).  So at the high end of the spectrum you have naggy and vox with unarguably the best loot in the original EQ, beucase they could own the place.<br />
<br />
So now, we have our loot orders with out even bothering to set what the raid mobs are.<br />
<br />
The raider's loot isn't better becaue the raid could beat up the non raider.  It's better because the mobs the raider beats up on could kill the mobs the non raiders beat up on.<br />
<br />
SHOULD there be some challenging content with very good rewards for non-raidsers?  Without a doubt, yes.  But then again I think that it would be possible to do the Gates trials with bazaar gear and the appropriate AA's...  <br />
<br />
Worse case, you *could* make a group to farm vxed named similar to Sham, Cleric, Enc, Pal, 2 WS (weaponshield) tanks (monk,rng ect).  Let the charmed pet tank everything but the names, and have someone pop WS to tank the named for 12 seconds, and then the next for 12 seconds while the hasted quadding charmed pet kills it for your loot.  Personally I think people are gun shy of the gates trial content because of the way it came out, and because of all the reports of problems.  I DO think it requires a decent number of AA's to successfully function in there..<br />
<br />
The moment you twink another char youve blown this statement out of the water.<br />
<br />
Relative to the hign end of the game, this is no longer a problem, because everything is basically no drop, and therefore really can't be twinked..  Unless guilds are of course flagging alts and giving them rot loot, but I don't see that as an issue you can really base an arguement about.<br />
<br />
Thought of something else:  If a twink is someone that is given gear that they are unable to get because the source of it is too powerful... Wouldn't it follow that anyone who bought something from the bazaar from a mob they were not able to kill became a twink?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not arguing that twinkings bad heh i think everyone does it.<br />
My point goes back to your argument in that you say raiders get better loot because they kill mobs non raiders cant.And to the people who say non raiders dont deserve equivalent loot to raiders as they dont kill gods etc.<br />
<br />
So why should a raider twink up his alts as they obviously havent killed the mobs for the gear.<br />
Why is it ok for a raider to twink their alts  so that their alts are wearing undeserved gear for the reasons the raider states yet it is not alright for people who spend 200hrs or however long doing LDoNs being able to get 1 piece of EP equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to your 2nd point yes they are twinking but who cares thats nothing to do with raider equivalent loot for non raiders.<br />
<br />
Some very good arguments you wrote but still basically no answer to the big question of why should 200hrs in LDoN not reward you with 1 EP equivalent piece of gear.<br />
<br />
Why would it hurt you,what difference would it make if a non raider was wearing gear equivalent to you.<br />
<br />
Do people get jealous when they see someone wearing a Funghi who hasnt killed the king.NO.<br />
<br />
What are you all afraid will happen if LDoN armor is made EP equivalent ?.<br />
<br />
Nothing will happen.<br />
<br />
Jealousy i think is the main reason for this.<br />

<br />
Here is my opinion. Raiders get better loot because they kill bigger mobs. If you would like better loot, kill bigger mobs. If you have CHOSEN not to play that portion of this game, then I guess you are &quot;stuck&quot; with what you can get yourself. <br />
<br />
That being said, I think there should be better loot paths for non-raiders. I think the EPs should be opened via a 1-groupable quest (long, hard, but fully 1-groupable). I think that they should upgrade LDoN armor AND augs (and price them accordingly) to better than VT, close enough to EP. Opening the EPs to non-raiders who wish to do the quest would also open up the mini-minis in those zones, who have respecable loot. <br />
<br />
I like to raid, but I also do lots of non-raider stuff. But the people who are saying that they shouldnt have to raid to get &quot;raid quality&quot; loot arent seeing the oveall picture. THis game is divided into two basic theme, raiding, and non-raiding. If you dont wish to raid, then dont. However, the best loot is obtained by raiding, so your CHOICE has cut you out of that portion of the GAME.</div></div><hr />

BECAUSE IT'S HARDER<br />
<br />
Risk versus reward.<br />
<br />
An endless series of one-groupable blues/whites &lt; one really hard encounter that requires a raid force of 72.  The problems of gathering that many, equipping that many, setting up loot rules, educating them on the encounters, etc. are orders of magnitude more difficult than setting up some pickup group.  That effort should be rewarded accordingly.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, if that effort is only rewarded with something you can get elsewhere, why would anyone raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">&quot;BECAUSE IT'S HARDER&quot;<br />
<br />
No, really it isn't hehe.  People on raids have very narrowed, dumbed down tasks to do.  CH chain, cure MT of this, keep this single add mezzed.  Really, grouping can (not always) be much more indicitive of a players skill.  <br />
<br />
Few nights ago I was on &quot;keep the mezzed adds debuffed&quot; duty.  I watched a timer and kept slow/malos/cripple on 5 mezzed mobs.  For an hour.  Most mind numbing boring experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like's been posted and discussed above, there really shouldn't be any reason why equal time shouldn't = equivalent loot.  <br />
<br />
However, I think we all agree (and if you read the prior 50 some posts), most people supporting equal time = eqivalent loot, are in favor of NOT letting people simply kill one million easy mobs for EP type loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't see why anyone would have a problem with this type of scenario leading to good loot:<br />
<br />
Quest for Ubah Loot A<br />
1. Instanced Missions getting progressively harder.  Some dropped loot along the way.<br />
2.  Farming and internal keying like raiders have to do.<br />
3.  Very difficult endboss mobs requiring the group to play very well.<br />
4.  Incremental steps so people can work on the quest in stages each night.<br />
<br />
Instead of 1 ldon = 50 points, save points for crappy gear, how about you have to do a string of 50-100 ldon's that are all one quest.  You have to farm for key pieces in one phase to get to another.  In another, you have to fight a really strong boss mob to move to the next, etc..  <br />
<br />
The quest is, say, a mission from your deity, so it has some sort of lore backing why the end item is good.  Its a gift from your god.  The missions get progressively harder, so by the end, its say, harder than an ldon hard mission by some degree.<br />
<br />
Really, I only see two arguments against non raiders getting good gear:<br />
<br />
Argument 1:  Not enough time spent.<br />
Argument 2:  No game reality supporting why the item is good.  Wasn't a big mob, shouldn't be big loot.<br />
<br />
To argument 1, I say, no one supports a method that requires less time for raid level gear.  People just want an incremental way to work towards it.<br />
<br />
To argument 2, I say, if the &quot;mission&quot; is a quest, with lore, a gift from your god, etc.., the game reality is maintained.  <br />
<br />
SOE will kill EQ if they don't support non raiders.  Really.  The discrepancy will grow so great, that non raiders will just stop playing.  Raiders are shooting themselves in the foot if they don't support some route to equal upgrades, because it will kill the game they love.  <br />
<br />
You don't have to make it &quot;easier&quot; to get the items,  you just have to provide another path.  Make the non raider spend equal time, just let them do it one hour a night.</div></div><hr />

Wulf, your arguement is just not cutting it for one simple reason. We play a game called Everquest, and in Everquest, there is, and ALWAYS ALWAYS HAS BEEN a path to the very very &quot;best&quot; loot in the game, and that path involves LOTS of people getting together to raid. The game you want, the one where everyone can get anything just by grinding out time in single, small groups is called Diablo 2. Anyone can score any item avaialable in the game at anytime in Diablo 2, no raid required.<br />
<br />
But we play Everquest. Everquest includes raids, and raiding is where the best gear is, end of story. Stop trying to justify your position by trying to change this game at its most primal, fundamental level. <br />
<br />
Also, stop making generalizations like &quot;raiders dont want non-raiders to get better gear&quot; because they arent true. I am a raider. I think that there should be an alternate path to beter gear for non-raiders. I am not alone, either, lots of raiders agree. What we DON'T want is for it to be as easy as killing 50 mobs in a trivial dungeon over and over without any real risk. Also, I firmly believe that there is some gear and some zones that should NEVER be opened, until they are truly trivial, zones like VP, VT, Time, Qvic+ in Gates, etc. <br />
<br />
At this point in the games evolution though, there should be better gear available to the non-raider. Questing for EP access is one way that could be accomplished. Upgrading the available gear in LDoN is another. Both of these expansions are showing their age. The future of EQ is OoW and Gates, I think, and its time to realize that the EPs are not what they used to be. <br />
<br />
SOE has screwed themselves though, yet again, by not having any sort of future in mind when this stuff is created. Didnt they realize that the EPs would become a LOTless meaningful eventually? If they did, then WHY did they make the Gods in the same zone as the XP-1 group content in 3 of the 4 EP planes. They should ALL have had a &quot;B&quot; like Earth, IMHO. And why didnt they REQUIRE full access to the EPs for enterance into Time. As it is, you only need 1 flag to get into Time. PoE B. Thats it. Loot the Gods, combine, your in Time, no flagging required. It would have been a simple matter to add an item you get off the Seer or something that you ONLY get once you have flagged for ALL the Planes pre-Time and make THAT part of the combine. <br />
<br />
I dunno. I think the EPs will be opened eventually, but I think its on a back burner for now because there is too much on the SOE platter now. A new expansion, massive issues with the latest still around, class balancing that is going to require SOME big moves once we hit level 70, etc etc etc. We'll see I guess. As it stands now, they have shot themselves in the foot by making the gap between raiders and non-raiders SO HUGE that they cannot seem to satify either segment of the population, much less keep both happy.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry that was me highlighting a false part of the previous post i also dont think the EP's etc should be just opened up like BoT etc were.<br />
But i do believe there should be other ways to gain entry to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not expect to get Time gear from LDoN,BoT etc but what i would like is the chance to get Time gear etc without raiding.<br />
<br />
What i am really trying to understand is what harm it would do you and other raiders personally if they gave EP equivalent gear as rewards in LDoN ?<br />
Would it make the slightest bit of difference to the way you play and how you spend your time in EQ ?.<br />

Fear, Hate, Nagafen and Vox were ALWAYS intended to be a part of the game from day 1 out of the box. Since it would obviously be a LONG while before anyone was ready to try this stuff, some was unfinished when the game shipped (hence, the beginning of the entire cluster **** of expansion after expansion being unfinished). EQ was definitely designed with the idea of a Raid FIRMLY in mind. <br />
<br />
Also, I can remember doing smaller raid-type stuff. 2-3 groups into the Efreeti room or 4 groups doing the Fire Giants long before Nagggy was remotely possible. In my 30s, we needed a &quot;raid&quot; to take out Sir Lucan for my paladins Soulfire piece. <br />
<br />
Then Kunark shipped, and a COMPLETE zone designed ONLY for raiding was born (VP). Other zones in other expansions followed this pattern, ToV and ST in Velious, Ssra and VT in Luclin, until finally they created an entire expansion with Raiding as the primary way to advance. <br />
<br />
But if you do not think the developers intended people to gather in a LARGE group to kill Dragons from the day they created this game, you are only fooling yourself, Wulf, and you know it. <br />
<br />
I honestly do NOT see &quot;90% of the raiders&quot; saying the garbage you think they are. 90% of the ones who are POSTING here, maybe, but there are litterally HUNDREDS of raiders reading this board, and I take those who choose not to bother weighing in on this topic as &quot;indifferent&quot;. You seem to think that raiders are somehow against you, that what YOU PERSONALLY wear is in some way important to them (me, us? whatever). Heres as clue bro, mostly we dont care. Not one bit. As long as raid mobs keep raiders ahead on the curve, I think what people who CHOOSE not to raid should be able to at least wear decent enough gear to compete competently in the content available to them, and to me, right this minute, its Vxed-Tipt trials. Standard bazaar geared people struggle there. And there arent many &quot;choices&quot;. There are some, but not many, and not enough, IMHO, and that whole issue could be helped along with a few simple changes taht affect MAYBE the 10-15th guilds on most servers &quot;Food Chains&quot;.</div></div><hr />

When LDON came out and it was realized that gear (fully augmented mind you) was &quot;NEAR&quot; EP levels - a cry and hue arose from the EP types.<br />
<br />
Again, the EP planes weren't being opened up to us &quot;lessers.&quot; Nor was the gear AS good, it was &quot;nearly as good.&quot;<br />

<br />
Unless of course one forgets to account for the green-eyed demon of jealousy coupled with his brother the not so flattering &quot;keep the rest of the playerbase down,&quot; devil.<br />
<br />
To reiterate - AGAIN - it wasn't as if the RAIDERS DIDN'T have access to LDON, they did.<br />
<br />
It wasn't as if the gear would be BETTER than EP gear - it wasn't.<br />
<br />
There is no other explanation for the outcry than petty, petty emotions.<br />

<br />
And the ONLY think that LDoN armor came close to EP on was +hps. It still didnt have the huge stats, AC and resists or EP drops. The +hp thing came because it was discovered that an EXTRA +40 hp aug (not just 1, but 2) could be placed into the armor as the system was set up.<br />
<br />
Now granted, at that time, there was an outcry. But at that time there were MAYBE 2-4 guilds per server in the EPs and 1-2 in Time. Not the 10+ in the EPs, not to mention pick-ups on most servers, and 6+ in Time like we have today. When LDoN came out there were no big 200+ hp items like we see in Gates. Time gear was king, and EP was damn close to the best in a few slots. Certainly no guilds had many &quot;fully Time geared&quot; players at that time. <br />
<br />
Should LDoN gear be able to match Qvic+ gear right now? Do you think it should? Boy I sure dont. Well thats what it was like when LDoN FIRST came out. Now, EP gear is fairly moderate compared to some of the stuff Gates is producing. Hell, one groupable Trials can produce BETTER than EP quality gear, and you absolutely DO NOT need to be EP geared to do them (granted, you MUST have a very solid group, nearly flawless play on the bosses, but still doable).<br />
<br />
So, I advocate a kick-up for the non-raider to what I, as a raider, consider moderate. Right now, today, spending 1900+ points per piece to get something NEAR EP quality wouldnt be that big a deal, not at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Ubers&quot; as you call them could not care any less about what you are doing in LDoN.  The facts are they are to busy &quot;learning&quot; new content, getting &quot;uber&quot; gear, and grouping with guildies and friends.  The only thing an &quot;uber player_01&quot; cares about out of LDoN are the HP augs.  <br />
<br />
A casual player will never have the gear a raider does by design.  EQ from the begining was a game about grouping and doing things as a team.  Because of the broad abilities and mindsets of the people playing however, it evolved, into a game of &quot;Ubers&quot;, &quot;casuals&quot;, and Soloers.<br />
<br />
Not a flaw in game design, just the ingenuity of the player base has caused this.  Players will always find the easiest and quickest way to get what they want.  If its levels, AA's, gear it doesn't matter.  They will find a way.  If your way is to come to a msg board and complain thats pefectly acceptable and if I want to spend my time in game getting the EP+ Gear then thats my way and just as acceptable.<br />
<br />
Let me reiterate, Casual Player will NEVER have the same gear as Raiders.<br />
<br />
To reiterate again, Not that they don't deserve to have it they just won't.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you want a game where everyone has the ability to have the best gear play Champions of Norrath for the PS2 its alot of fun.</div></div><hr />

That is very close to exactly what I am saying. Remember, I also advocate OPENING the EPs, so the non-raider (or, part-time raider who doesnt belong to a raiding guild) can have SOME possibility of full EP level gear. Mini-Minis in the EPs drop very very nice, 1-groupable items. Fire belt, Earth ring, Water weapons like Sharkspine, etc etc are all very very nice, quality items. <br />
<br />
So I am saying non-raiders should have a path to gear that is comperable to near-Top of the line from PoP. Spin it any way you want to Faern, I have been round and round this topic, and my convictions are firm. <br />
<br />
Raiding is, always has been, and always SHOULD be the ONLY path to the TOP of the current items in the game. But non-raiders DESERVE paths to much much better gear than they currently have available in a reasonable manner.<br />
<br />
EDIT: note also that EP access would open up the quest for an item that MANY MANY top players STILL wear, the Signet of the Arcane earring (see my magelo). It would also open up the quest for the 3rd and final version of the Gate necklace (I will stick it in my magelo inventory also, since I do indeed have it). <br />
<br />
Also note that this path would allow the non-raiders to become better geared overall, thus making the Gates items that are actually BETTER than EP stuff more realistic. Level 70 plus some EP mini-mini drops supplemented by upgraded LDoN gear will make KT a VERY realistic goal for most non-raiders with the dedication to achieve goals like this. People like you, like Snoww, like Izmalis, etc etc, guys who simply DO NOT wish to play the raiding portion of EQ. I have SEEN unguilded, non-EP flagged players wearing MUCH better items than me in some slots from Gates.</div></div><hr />

A casual player will never have the gear a raider does by design.  EQ from the begining was a game about grouping and doing things as a team.  Because of the broad abilities and mindsets of the people playing however, it evolved, into a game of &quot;Ubers&quot;, &quot;casuals&quot;, and Soloers.<br />
<br />
Let me reiterate, Casual Player will NEVER have the same gear as Raiders.<br />
<br />
To reiterate again, Not that they don't deserve to have it they just won't.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the whole premise of the posts on this thread.<br />
It started as some suggestions of perhaps there should be other ways to get EP level gear without raiding.<br />

<br />

<br />
No there shouldn't be.  This is a crusade that will only leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It's like you are trying to explain to a cop why it is ok for you to speed because they do.  It just won't work.<br />
<br />
...and again so you don't think any different...<br />
<br />
If you want to spend the time to get a piece of gear just like what you can get ona  raid it should be obnoxiosly hard to get.  If you have 6 active shaman in your guild, and you raid Time every Sunday, and a TA drops every 3rd Saryn kill, it would take you 18 Weeks (or about 100 hours of raiding) to get that item.  Whats a reasonable amount of time to spend getting that same item for a non raider?  100 Hours?<br />
<br />
The answer is it is impossible to tell.  Or more correctly it would be impossible to get a number for that time which would be acceptable.  <br />
I know if I was gaurenteed a TA after 100 hours of questing or LDoN type encounters what would be the purpose of raiding?  I could get it in 3-4 weeks instead of 18 weeks.  See the problem with that?<br />
<br />
You are not wrong for feeling this way nor for wanting to change things.  The problem is that this game was meant for raiders and groups of people.  It will always be that way.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 sounds like it is going to be tailored to the casual player.  Not that you won't see, power players getting things months ahead of you, mind you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">So why the outcry when LDoN gear 1st came out.<br />
Why the various posts saying they dont deserve it etc.<br />
I already explained this Wulf. Let me explain it another way.<br />
<br />
When LDoN first came out, and you could put two +40hp augs in one piece, thereby bringing it VERY close to EP +hp-level, there was a problem with it being TOO CLOSE to the current &quot;top end&quot; gear in the game. When LDoN came out, there was no Gates. Time was the ultimate, but there were less than half the people flagged for the zone than there are today. EP was cuttig edge in many slots, and most certainly the staple of the very very TOP raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
Now, with the release of Gates, with the increased guilds gaining access to Time and the EPs, and even KT, &quot;EP Level&quot; gear is much more commonplace. Its not the cutting edge. So increaing the level of &quot;non-raid obtainable&quot; gear to EP level isnt a big deal. Personally, I dont even see people argueing with you Wulf. A few posts is it. <br />
<br />
But I think it stops there. Create a new level of LDoN gear to make it EP level, create quests to allow access to the EPs for one-group mini-minis and good XP sources, let people work their characters for Gates and OoW that way. Once you get yourself geared up a bit, Gates offers upgrades that are MORE than adequate in one-group events. I think the non-raiders of today SHOULD have a way to increase themselves to the point where they can more readily compete in Vxed and Tipts, or even just farm them for nameds and/or XP.<br />
This goes back once again to the question i keep asking and you cant/wont answer.<br />
<br />
What difference does it make to you and raiders personally if someone has the same level (actually as you explained its only near EP HP wise nothing else) gear if they dont raid to get it ????.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
You need to stop using the term EP Gear here Wulf. Here is the question you are trying to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What difference does it make to raiders personally if someone has gear the same level AS THE CURRENT CUTTING EDGE if they didnt raid to get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that what youre trying to say? Because my point is AT THIS TIME in the progression of the game, I dont care if you have EP level gear. but you are not getting Time level gear out of LDoN. You cant have a non-raid path to Qvic level loots. EP isnt &quot;top top&quot; end anymore. Its not even the staple of the &quot;Truly High End&quot; guilds. <br />
<br />
But there is no way there should be a non-raid path to the very best in the game, or even a &quot;near very best&quot;. I mean CURRENTLY in the game. Because trust me, once you work Gates at lvl 70, get KT flagged, and start farming that zone for drops, you WILL be getting EP+ gear. In some cases, gear better than some Time loots, certainly more common and available. <br />
<br />
Does that answer your question? The difference is &quot;the best is gotten by raiding&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wulfbane<br />
IT WOULD CHANGE THE GAME ON A PRIMAL, FUNDEMENTAL LEVEL.<br />
<br />
There is ONE PATH to the best gear in this game, that is RAIDING. <br />
<br />
How would it affect us? The game would turn into Diablo 2 thats how. It would get old very very fast. There would be little reason to play for MONTHS much less YEARS if I could log in, get the best stuff, and log out. No raid. No orginization. No &quot;Other half&quot; of the game. We would be left with Diablo 2. EQ would shrivel up and die so fast its not even funny. <br />
<br />
There. That answer your question yet? Cripes. The game is played a certain way. Why are you trying to make a change THIS DRASTIC after a 5 year model that actually still sorta working (last I checked, EQ was still pretty clearly in the Number One slot). <br />
<br />
And Wulf, you KNOW its not gonna change. I appriciate the fact that the path for the non-raider is kinda sucky, and I am MORE than willing to help create change for it. But dont start asking for Time-Qvic level stuff, it defeats your purpose because THAT becomes a bigger issue. Shoot for EP level LDoN, open EP planes, better gear to do Sewers-Vxed-Tipt and make KT your goal. Thats a GOOD ASS path for a non-raider. Stop crusading for the WHOLE FARM when all you REALLY need/want is a little chunk in the corner so you can &quot;make decent progress&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Im not asking you what happens at this moment in time.Im asking you &quot;how would it affect raiders personally&quot; if non raiders had raid level gear ?<br />
<br />
It better not effect anyone personally!  If this game means so much that you let something little like gear make you feel like less of a human then you got issues WAY bigger then this game.<br />
<br />
&quot;1 4RE No+ l3E+ Lik3 j00 PlE@$3 g1VE m3 PHa+ l0o+5 &quot;<br />
<br />
Thats what I hear when people complain about not having the gear I do even tho I play so much more then them.  If you want gear equal to mine WORK for it by playing as much as I do.  If you can't devote the time I can, then don't expect to have the same stuff.<br />
<br />
Join an open raid, get yourself EP flagged albeit months from now and single group stuff for EP gear.  Get yourself thro trial 1-6 in GoD and go farm in single groups the yard trash in Yxxta for awsome loot albeit very rare.  Loke at the Bone ring I wear it was from yard trash there.  My other ring came from a mini named in Earth, the augment on that ring was from a trial group.<br />
<br />
There is a way for non raiders to get nearly the same AND the same gear that I have it will just take you MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call shenanigans.<br />
<br />
First off you aren't getting &quot; the best.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Second, the amount of time required to get a full set of NEAR-EP gear is not as simple as &quot;log in, buy gear, equip gear, log out.&quot;  You are being disengenuous if you think it is.  Refer to my other post on how long it would take to get fully equipped in THIS day and age with all LDON.<br />
<br />
Third, why should I pay (the same amount as you) for &quot;decent progress.&quot;  I, others (and I suspect Wulfbane as well), in all liklihood put in MORE time than you and your raiders.<br />
<br />
Fourth - don't try and sell the fence-sitters with the &quot;Raiders are more skilled&quot; line of bull-droppings. As I've said - I've grouped with MULTIPLE Time-levell folks on Xev and they flat out SUCKED:<br />
<br />
SK's who couldn't hold aggro<br />
Mez Breakers<br />
Day late and dollar short on healing<br />
<br />
But thanks for letting all of us know that raiders ARE affected and ARE concerned with loot obtained by others.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I am not the least bit concerned if suddenly level 40's can get great stuff, or better stuff off of merchants.<br />
<br />
Wanna know why?<br />
<br />
Cuz I can go BUY it MYSELF.  <br />
<br />
There is NO other reason for Raiders to be concerned with non-Raiders than flat-out jealousy, envy, or a primordial need to ensure that Raiders have something to hold over the heads of others, or link their pixels in auction and group say.<br />
<br />
IOW - like Wake Forest fans, you're in the lucky sperm club and want to keep everyone else down.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have to agree with my friend Blazz on this for the most part regarding easy upgrades and Diablo 2.  But, really introducing the next step up in in LDON armour at about 3k points would solve all this thread bickering since thats a ton of adventures.  The solution is so simple I'm a bit surprised that there is such debate.<br />
<br />
I continue to say there is nothing wrong with casuals getting one or two really nice pieces of armour from playing LDON a lot. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">If non raiders could get The best available gear in the game without having to do the bull**** requirements for raiding. then some of the raiding game would dry up.<br />
<br />
Raiders know this. And to have a successful raiding guild means you need a few leaders. and lots and lots of sheep. The sheep and some of the leaders burn out cause it is intense and so they need more warm bodies all the damn time.<br />
<br />
If People could get the same quality gear as a raider then the raiders would have many less bodies. So it threatens them.<br />
<br />
I still say. Multiple paths to a goal. Single group challenging content should be available for all the power levels of gear in the game. The raiders should get bennies like Fancier graphics. Or particle effects. But not things that dramaticly affect the gameplay on a basic level. <br />
<br />
Now if it requires 72 people to drop Bob the uberlord of smarmieness and it takes then an hour to do the encounter that is 72 man hours used to get maybe 3 to 6 peices of loot. (Counting minibosses and such) To Complete the encounter mind you. not learn it. You don't get the credit for learning it cause Single groups have to learn the content too. <br />
<br />
There should be a way with 6 man groups to take that same 72 man hours and get equivilent power level gear. Period.  So it takes the group 12 hours of adventuring together in say 10 80 minute adventures Of various quests. That would be fair. That would be balanced. And would allow the raiders and Non raiders to coexist and not have 2 seperate games made for the various subsets of the population. The lack of intresting quests in a game called everquest is almost criminal I can come up with a smattering of 80 minute runs useing the existing technology in the game with fleshed out storylines in very little time. Now it wouldnt be award winning Literary achivements. but Come on folks. SoE is just milking us.<br />
<br />
The Only part of raiding that is any harder than Single grouping is logistical problems and personality conflicts. The gameplay itself is boiled down to its basic components with very little overlap. The numbers are bigger but that is it.<br />
<br />
In fact challenging content for 6 men is harder overall on those 6 people due to a lack of a span of abilities. In other words due to the class based nature of the game When taking 6 man runs you are forcing the group to go in lacking something. IF they would take into account this and allow multiple pathways then the game would support itself based upon that dynamic. <br />
<br />
Some folks would raid sometimes for a fast chance at loot and other times take incremental steps towards a goal. Much like Raiders do LDON's to get the easy 40 hp augments. And Non raiders do pickups for a chance at the raid loot.<br />
<br />
What is unbalanced about EQ as a whole at this present time is Raiders have all the cards. Every damn one of them. They get to get the best gear then use that gear in the content designed for non raiders. Then based upon feedback by the vocal minority change the easier content so that it is more fun for them. (As in harder for the non raider) (Get drop rates nerfed, change the hp totals of things)<br />
<br />
What is challenging for a 6K Sk and a 11 K SK  are so far apart it isnt even funny. And the best argument I have ever seen for it is raiders need these power gains so they can raid. But they never take into account that they don't need it when they dont raid. And that it simply breaks the normal non raiding game due to the amount of power they weild.<br />
<br />
There are two choices for the long term health of the game. Nerf raider gear. Or bring Non raider gear up to the level of Raiders. (Or at least pretty damn close but my opinion is they should be the same)<br />
<br />
Otherwise the gap will get bigger, the resentment between the two camps will get larger, and over time it will tear the game apart. Because designing content for both groups as it stands isn't cost effective and frankly I would assume is practiclly impossible due to time contraints. <br />
<br />
A Qivic (Raiding)  tank vrs non raider tank with the same amount of AA will be so vastly different in playtime and Power level as to be rediculous. And that is what EQ has become a rediculous mockery of what it once was. A damn fine MMORPG. <br />
<br />
I just wish SoE had the balls to repair it. But growing a sack is currently being evaulated. God damn corporate stooges.<br />

The discussion Wulf and I are having is not about whether or not non-raiders should have access to EP level gear anymore Faern, its about non-raiders having access to the &quot;best&quot;. In case you havent been paying attention, I SUPPORT non-raiders having access to EP level gear, and I dont even think it should be THAT difficult (3K points for armor is too much, 2K sounds fair, doable, still a grind, but makable). <br />
<br />
But Wulf wanted a FIRM answer to his question, and it had nothing to do with EP gear. His question related to the TOP gear in the game. I told him how I feel. I dont want to play Diablo 2. I like EQ the way its set up now, the way its been set up from Day 1. If you WANT THE BEST, raid. <br />

Its not the threat to us, so much, as the threat it poses to the GAME itself. To say raiding would &quot;dry up&quot; is an understatement. Raiding would cease to exist. Certainly I am not going to spend 6 nights, 4 hours a night, solving Uqua encounter to get access to the loot in Qvic if I can get it someplace else WITHOUT that level of aggrovation. No one would. Not when I could have 1000 &quot;points&quot; toward a piece of loot that good anyway. Heck, better, we still dont know whats at the end of Gates. But in for a penny, in for a pound. <br />

I agree with you Snoww, but not to the degree you want. In your scenario, people would have a path to the VERY VERY best loot available in Gates right now. Without raiding. Raiders dont want fancier graphics, or particle effects man, they want BETTER GEAR. So we raid to get it, because THATS HOW YOU PLAY EQ. Thats how we have ALWAYS played EQ. Should there have been a path to CoF before Kunark that didnt involve killing a DRAGON? <br />
<br />
Honestly guys, I am mostly on your side here. I will go so far as to say that you SHOULD be able to get something between EP and Time level loot at this point by an alternate path. But NOT the stuff at the end of the ccurrent expansion. No way. That just isnt how EQ is played, its not how its EVER been played, and its not how I want to play it in the future.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot I wanted to respond to this:<br />
Third, why should I pay (the same amount as you) for &quot;decent progress.&quot;  I, others (and I suspect Wulfbane as well), in all liklihood put in MORE time than you and your raiders.<br />
Arguements like this are flawed, though. Spending 100 hours killing Moss Snakes in EC isnt gonna get you anywhere. I spend my time on the path that provides me with the gear I want. I raid, because thats where the gear I want is. If I wanted a pair of Aged Mystic boots, I wouldnt do Normal LDONs over and over, then whine that they don't drop there. If you want something, you do what it takes to get it. In the case of the game called EQ, the best loot is obtained by raiding. Thats never going to change, and it has nothing to do with &quot;keeping non-raiders down&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My opinion of the give the ability to get EP level in LDON argument is doing triviel things ad nasuem simply to get a peice of gear is stupid. I don't care if you are raiding something for the 50th time or making a ldon run for the 300th time.  Raiders tend to harp on Risk Vrs reward but once the risk is gone the reward is still 10 times better than what I can achive with my group of friends. And since we have less to throw at an encounter and normally less time to do it in is our risk more than a raiders? They risk more man hours because they have and tend to bring more people. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But Wulf wanted a FIRM answer to his question, and it had nothing to do with EP gear. His question related to the TOP gear in the game. I told him how I feel. I dont want to play Diablo 2. I like EQ the way its set up now, the way its been set up from Day 1. If you WANT THE BEST, raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ with decent quests to achieve raid level loot wouldnt be diablo 2.  That is a way over exaggeration of the effect it would have on the game.  As it is now when your guild moves on form an encounter and you still have not gotten the gear you wanted from it.. what do you do? You have no recourse but to either take others in a pick up status  or get people to come during off times and try it, or go Oh well and walk on looking for something else.  Another option would be good. And remember it isnt like these would just be cakewalk runs like a LDON normal. Challenging content for 6 man groups. Based in a storyline set of encounters. (Course They would have to design it. That is another story)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not the threat to us, so much, as the threat it poses to the GAME itself. To say raiding would &quot;dry up&quot; is an understatement. Raiding would cease to exist. Certainly I am not going to spend 6 nights, 4 hours a night, solving Uqua encounter to get access to the loot in Qvic if I can get it someplace else WITHOUT that level of aggrovation. No one would. Not when I could have 1000 &quot;points&quot; toward a piece of loot that good anyway. Heck, better, we still dont know whats at the end of Gates. But in for a penny, in for a pound. <br />
<br />
<br />
When LDON came out and the raiders needed to do 2 runs in each instance before getting to the raids.. What happened. Did the raiding game die? When LDON came out and you could get better augments than anywhere else in the raiding game with a 6 man run. Did the raiding game dry up and blow away? The big targets still got dropped. If they did give the casuals a leg up with some single group good gear runs the raiding game wouldnt dry up. It might take a hit due to less overall people wanting to deal with the bull****. But large targets have thier own appeal. And raiding does have appeal to many people outside of just lootcentric reasons.<br />
<br />
Also much gear from Gates can be gotten in single group instanced expiditions. Some of it is time level is it not? Yet raiders only have the gear to handle the expiditions yet the raiding game isnt gone. It has not dried up. That argument is false. The only thing that giving more casual people a leg up will do is increase compitition for the end game which is exactly what raiders don't want. They don't want People cluttering up thier hidey holes of great xp. (Simplistec terms there of course that isnt the only reason)  <br />
<br />
As it stands Raiders can get to the best gear in the game by raiding and single group content.  Non raiders have no such choices because they lack the gear from raids to succeed in the end game single group encounters. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with you Snoww, but not to the degree you want. In your scenario, people would have a path to the VERY VERY best loot available in Gates right now. Without raiding. Raiders dont want fancier graphics, or particle effects man, they want BETTER GEAR. So we raid to get it, because THATS HOW YOU PLAY EQ. Thats how we have ALWAYS played EQ. Should there have been a path to CoF before Kunark that didnt involve killing a DRAGON? <br />
<br />
<br />
If a non raider could get into tacvi or qvic or wherever and succeed in those areas how would it hurt raiders at all? Instanced zones mind you (And zone names might be wrong I am not there so Dont know)<br />
 <br />
I have people telling me koda'taz is a great single group thing. With some incredible gear. Has this killed the raid game?<br />
<br />
Oh and yes. there should have been a way to get to a cloak of flames (Or equivilent Maybe a cloak of the nightime fire.) Requireing 6 man people going through sol A and killing some spawns there then travelling to Permafrost to find out the connection between Vox and Nagafen. Thwarting a plan of Vox's to escape her confinement. (Not actually encountering her of course) Heading back to Sol B to deliver the news to the gnomes who are there about the escape attempt, and to get more information about the Nagafen Vox connection.  Then going through and taking care of certain Giant spawns  to foil Nagafens plots.<br />
<br />
Same item.  Power wise. Different name. Different avenue for success<br />
And when people ask what you did to get it you have a story. Just like The Nagafen killer Has a story. But the power level is the same. <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly guys, I am mostly on your side here. I will go so far as to say that you SHOULD be able to get something between EP and Time level loot at this point by an alternate path. But NOT the stuff at the end of the current expansion. No way. That just isnt how EQ is played, its not how its EVER been played, and its not how I want to play it in the future.<br />
<br />
If we could get to the meat of expansions and not be blocked by a single design principle then probably everyone would be happier.  But EQ will flounder if all it caters to is raiders. Because raiders chew through content faster than it can be created and WILL leave. The non raiders and casual raiders are the bulk of the population and EQ will not survive without us. But there is simply much content that while I am capable of doing it I am limited to a singuler path that I activly dislike doing. That many people dislike doing. I am simply more strident and stubborn than most. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Should there have been a path to CoF before Kunark that didnt involve killing a DRAGON? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The gap between raiders and non raiders is MASSIVE now compared to pre Kunark hell pre PoP even and each expansion just makes it bigger.<br />
No one really knows how many raiders play compared to non raiders but the gap is going to get so big that there will end up being no raiders and then EQ will die.<br />
Raiders may be the hardcore of EQ but i seriously dont think they're the majority.<br />
Like ive said which i think you missed is i dont want better gear im happy with what ive got and only got 5 months left till EQ is gone for me but i think its a fundamental flaw in EQ that there is no alternative path open for non raiders.<br />
EQ is a game to me something to do when ive got some spare leisure time but if i played 50 hrs a week or whatever it cant be right that id have to spend those 50 hrs raiding if i wanted really good gear.<br />
Someone says it would take 100hrs to get a TA raiding (although they never mentioned that if in these 100 hours they get other drops too) so whats wrong with being able to spend 100hrs doing something else to get a TA ?.<br />
And no i dont mean 100hrs killing moss snakes in EC.<br />
Various people have come up with ideas but theyre just batted down with the stock answer that if you want the best gear RAID.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">This argument has been hashed over and over, and the answer is now clear.<br />
<br />
PoP progression was a horribly bad idea and it's come close to ruining the game.  For all kinds of reasons, but from a design prespective it's left EQ in a real fix.  <br />
<br />
Blazz is sorta kinda right, but not really because without raiding the difference in characters was not large in old EQ.  It was a more inclusive gameplay.  <br />
<br />
I like raiding.  I raid because I like working in a big group to kill a big mob.  <br />
<br />
But I have no illusions that there's more risk.  Especially in PoP, are you kidding?  What risk is there?  I remember suicide corpse dragging in Fear and Guk, and I got jack for that.  Going into Runnyeye at level 20, that was risk.  Going into a big raid there's no risk at all.  Corpse summons, SoS, graveyards.  The risk thing is over.  <br />
<br />
And generally speaking there's less skill - except on the part of the raid leaders.  I respect the role they play, and I think putting up with tons of stupid BS is a legitimate skill.  But the skill thing is so vastly overplayed.  <br />
<br />
And Twoflower's math is not applicable to a lot of folks, and doesn't reflect the non-mold upgrades that exist far more commonly in the EP.  Stuff like Pearlescent Seascale, Earthen Toned Band, PoE cloak and Ent Leaf, all of which I looted in one group settings.  <br />
<br />
A casual raider like me is vastly overrewarded for time and effort over hardcore non-raiders.  It's a broken dynamic in EQ.  <br />
<br />
And ldon is horrible.  Anyone who can endure doing that over and over deserves more.  <br />
<br />
Everyone wants to improve, grow and progress. If they lose that sense, they quit EQ.  I still like EQ, and I want folks of all types happy and playing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">When LDON came out and the raiders needed to do 2 runs in each instance before getting to the raids.. What happened. Did the raiding game die? When LDON came out and you could get better augments than anywhere else in the raiding game with a 6 man run. Did the raiding game dry up and blow away?<br />
I am only going to respond to this one portion, I have made my case, nothing is going to change the way you people feel about it, so there is no need to bother anymore. However, this example you have used is EXACTLY why &quot;EQ Solo&quot; isnt gonna work. Because the SUPER HARDCORE people are gonna BLOW through it, otherwise the items would need to be so rare and much harder to get if you want to keep these people happy. Hell Snoww, given that scenario YOU would probably be maxxed out right now, going &quot;why bother, I got everything&quot;. <br />
<br />
I disticintly remember who shot STRAIGHT to the top of the LDoN leaderboards, it was members of the hardest hardcore guilds on my server. They smoked out adventures, maxxed thier charms, bought their spells, auged their gear and off the went. Only recently did the Leaderboards in LDoN start so show a greater percentage of non-raider than raiders, and even THATS a misnomer, because people camping Emp keys in Ssra are &quot;raiders&quot;, just like me, even though I am campig Saryrn in PoTime for a new weapon. I am just camping him with my guild. <br />
<br />
Another overall problem with your theories is relatively simple. Some people disagree. Pretty sure thats still allowed where I live. I like the game as it is now. I do not enjoy &quot;farming&quot; things but I love the thrill of a new raid, the first time you beat stuff after getting stomped a few times. That game would cease to exist. There would be no raiding. Your really not seeing it clearly if you &quot;think&quot; thats enough to make me raid, with no loot reward at the end (after we FARM it, that is). <br />
A casual raider like me is vastly overrewarded for time and effort over hardcore non-raiders.  It's a broken dynamic in EQ.<br />
I am not going to argue whether its a broken dynamic or not, its been working 5 years, it hasnt imploded yet, despite a TON of other issues (lousy CS, lousy code, buggy content, ec).<br />
<br />
I do, however, take exception to the statement that a casual raider is &quot;overrewarded&quot;. I am in a guild with a fairly smooth running DKP system and I am rewarded for EXACTLY what I contribute, thank you very much. Yeah, the gear is better, and eventually, is easier and easier to get. But I work for every piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact # 1<br />
EQ is a game which you pay a monthly fee to play<br />
Fact # 2 <br />
Unless you buy your time in larger portions, ie. 1 Year or 6 months etc we all pay the same amount to play.<br />
Fact # 3<br />
A single game will NEVER please all of those that play it.<br />
Fact # 4<br />
EQ is still popular enough for the majority that it is not threatened in any way of failing any time soon.<br />
<br />
What can we draw from this?<br />
<br />
Play or don't play it doesn't matter to SOE they have made the money back already that they put into it.  If this drys up I hope you enjoy playing whatever game they produce next under whatever name they do it under.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">I do, however, take exception to the statement that a casual raider is &quot;overrewarded&quot;.

<br />
I don't care whether your particular DKP calculation is accurate or not; you are rewarded in context of your equally situated casual raiders, and presumably those who show up more get more.  This is not disputed.  <br />
<br />
My point is most raiders, and especially those like you and me, are overrewarded for the effort expended.  I'm sorry if you take offense, but it's a simple fact we have better gear and access to zones with much better exp than folks who put in x2 to x5 the time.  If &quot;time=work&quot;, something is not fair.  You've stated you play 10 hours a week, I'm not much more.  If we are not over-rewarded (and I always feel ready for a new upgrade all the time), then non-raiders are not sufficiently rewarded and provided a progression path for upgrades, imho.  And I don't even like the term &quot;non-raiders.&quot;  Even non-raiders used to raid in Fear/Hate back in the day.  My server had a calendar and casual family guilds did those zones all the time.  I probably did Hate /Fear 80 times with my casual non-raiding family guild.  But PoP killed my guild, and dozens on my server just like it.  No one felt like they could progress.  They tried but eventually petered out.  It's just now those accounts are being canceled, but it was PoP that did it.  <br />
<br />
Cobbling together a random magelo is not enough; the gameplay dynamic is off track.  Somewhere on the continuum there needs to be a change or this game will continue to wither and decay.  <br />
<br />
And you must admit that a change in quantity can as dramatically alter a dynamic as a change in quality. Because folks geared off Naggy / Vox does not mean that EQ was defined by Naggy / Vox raids pre-Kunark.  Raiding never had the role then that it does now - although GoD is actually a step in the right direction because an inteprid group can succeed more in GoD than they can in PoP.  <br />
<br />
There will always be haves and have nots.  That's fine.  But you need to design the dynamics correctly for best results, and in my opinion, they aren't in EQ.  Things can be a lot better, and there can be more open paths of progression.  Do this, and a lot of frustration will ebb.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Are you asking how a DKP system works Wulfbane?<br />
<br />
If so in its most basic sense you are rewarded x points for each raid/kill you attend.  Some guilds give % bonus depending on the mob killed or raid etc.  So basically the more you are there and participate over time it will be easier for you to get gear.<br />
<br />
  If you blow your DKP as soon as you get it then no, but if you save your DKP and pass on a few minor upgrades you will clean up later on and you may get 2-3 pieces of loot on one raid based on your DKP balance.<br />
<br />
Not always like that.<br />
<br />
If you aren't asking how DKP works then I would be interested in what you were really asking.</div></div><hr />

What questions did you ask which weren't answered?  And you bet I think that haves and have nots can both be more happy than they are now.  I actually don't think major changes need to occur, other than to PoP progression.  <br />
<br />
Do what Uggok suggested some time ago and simply put in more Sebilis type content that offers meaningful upgrades to all comers who are able to group there - and stop this BS of locking exp rich and single group item dropping zones behind keys and flags.  <br />
<br />
Reward raiders with item drops and the thrill of raiding because you want to raid.  Too many folks raid who don't like raiding, and it's pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Never argued this. And I will disagree about the games &quot;definition&quot; durig the Naggy and Vox era. Sorry but those 2 mobs were what our server REVOLVED on. When Hate and Fear joined the mix, my server had some adventerous people create a site with message boards, and, as the primary function, a calander for guilds to &quot;reserve&quot; Planes on a schedule. This was all BEFORE Kunark. <br />
<br />
My entire point is pretty simple. The game is the way it is with regard to loot because thats the way it has always been. <br />
<br />
Is the gap too big? <br />
I think it is. <br />
<br />
Do non-raiders have effective paths to make reasonable progress? <br />
I dont think so. <br />
<br />
Do I think there should be alternate paths to the loot that is going to be gotten at the endgame of the current lastest expansion?<br />
Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
I wanted loot. I looked at what I had to do to get loot. So I did those things. I joined a guild. I farmed key parts, and VT parts, and did flag mobs ad naseum, and died repeatedly to some events and THAT WAS THE PATH to the loot. This is a game. You play it. I am not uber. I am not cutting edge. I dont have to play 5 hours a day 7 days a week. I raid some. Some weeks 20 hours. Some weeks 5. <br />
<br />
I chose this. Because this is where the loot is. The game defined it for me. I looked. Kill dragons with a large group of friends, score top gear. I am in. Thats how I choose to play. <br />
<br />
Non-raiders, especially hardcore-non-raiders, are CHOOSING not to go down that path. This has nothing to do with how easy, how hard, how dedicated, how whatever. Some people choose not to raid. Some choose to raid. We all know whats available at the end of each of these choices. If you dont like to raid, all I can say is &quot;I hope you like whats available with the choice you made&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Blazz we're agreement I think.   <br />
<br />
My only issue is not choosing to raid is a valid option.  These folks are slammed to the end of progression too fast and too furious.  Or something like that....  <br />
<br />
And this isn't even an issue, because you said you agreed with this too.  <br />
<br />
So basically we're not really disagreeing at all...It just sounds that way.  :p<br />
<br />
GoD actually represents a real improvement, except they screwed up so many other aspects of it, not the least of which were the graphics bugs.  It's still shocking how much people hated that expansion.  And yet, down the road I expect it to be have the best playability of any expansion since Kunark, or maybe Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">So basically we're not really disagreeing at all...It just sounds that way.  :p<br />
Well I dont exactly disagree with Faern, Wulf or Snoww either. I am in favor of closing the gap and giving non-raiders a MUCH broader swipe at the games content. My disagreement with those fellows comes when we begin to explore the &quot;degree&quot; of that process. <br />
Reward raiders with item drops and the thrill of raiding because you want to raid.  Too many folks raid who don't like raiding, and it's pathetic.<br />
I honestly think this view is unrealistic. Why would people spend SO much time learning Raid Mobs if there was no real reward? Raiding would flat out die. The entire game would become one big BiC quest. I am not saying that style of game is bad, I am saying its not Everquest, not in any of the 5 years I have been playing. <br />
<br />
I do agree that they borked up PoP though. Forcing guilds to bloat their rosters to have enough people to effectively progress through this content was a large mistake, one they are TRYING to rectify now, with the whole Gates scenario. Single group &quot;flags&quot;, 54 man limit instanced &quot;raids&quot;, these are pretty solid ideas to build on. There is one-groupable loot available in Gates right now that is BETTER than most EP items. <br />
<br />
We will begin to see a stead trickle of people out of the guilds now, though, you watch. It has already happened to some degree, a couple more established Time guilds on my server often complain of getting the numbers to do Time efficiently, since they have become accustomed to 54 player raids.<br />
<br />
So they released PoP, borked the gap, borked the Guild rosters, then released an entirely broken expansion, that still isnt fixed, with another expansion on the horizon and here we STILL sit, playing, raiding, one-grouping, whatevering, 5.5 years after the games initial release. /shrug, I am really sorry some of you arent havig as much fun anymore, I still got lots of game to &quot;play&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Yep I am on the extreme edge of the spectrum here with what I feel would be fair to all players. I know and accept this. I have tons of content left to play. More than most because of my non large scale rading stance. And I probably have explored my surroundings I can get to much much more than most.<br />
<br />
Like spectrals from PoJ. Got most of them there. And when I finally got a couple I wanted to mem (Before the spell revamp) I leveled to 63 and 64. <br />
<br />
Like Storms quest for tactics access when 95% of the game didnt know about it. And got my entire guild flagged for it based upon my efforts at dragging people there. <br />
<br />
Like some of the spawns and patterns in Quinmi, ferubi, and Riwwi.  That I am now working at getting my guild geared up from. <br />
<br />
If it is single groupable with barely level 65 people with 30 or less AA I have probably been there done that. Because that is what my guild is. I myself ahve been 65 for a long time. and have 413 AA now. And hot boxes that have more AA than anyone else in the guild. So At one time I played alot. A whole lot. But raiding in Velious at the true beginings of the raid game turned me off so bad that I can't really stand sending 42+ people at a target. It is an exercise in frustration. <br />
<br />
The game pretty much abandoned me at that point. Luclin was raid centric till they made some adjustments. Pop was wholly Raid oriented. And was a big kick in the balls to lolay customers raiders and non raiders alike. <br />
<br />
Ykesha had no soul. Some neat areas but flavor was lacking for me. Not sure why. <br />
<br />
LDON was cookie cutter in the extreme and was a great premise that was mismanaged so horribly that the only reason people do them at all is because they are mindless carnival like games of incremental advancement. <br />
<br />
God before the revamp was pathetic. Made for the raiders who were geared up it hit so far off the mark to be laughable. And the Out and out lie of planning  to raise the levels is so completly wrong to not even be funny. Do you really think that that lie was anything mroe than a cursory scapegoat of an excuse, think for a minute about what raising of levels would have entailed. Spells alone that noone had any hint of? From SoE.... yeah right. Marketing would ahve blared it from the rafters at first chance to make a buck. Something would have leaked.  The whole God was designed for level 70 is an out and out lie. they just slapped the numbers down and ran with it. Giggling to themselves about how the expansion was so hard it would make The EP's look like moss snakes. In fact soemwhere they even had some comment about that. But it was shipped buggy incomplete and aimed wholeheartedly towards the 100% uber crowd who didnt like it much.<br />
<br />
Now God is better. But there bugs still abound. Like pets that are tougher than thier masters who mitagate slow when thier masters don't.<br />
Like all the stupid little things that monk up the game with Direct X 9 Like getting out of the water and ducking and not popping right back up. <br />
<br />
SOE has completly forgotten about a subset of thier population so they can run monty haul games. And the **** needs to change. It needed to change 6 months ago but they wont realise it or do a damn thing till subscription numbers really take a hit. That hit will come from WoW. Just like the last changes came about from CoH release. <br />
<br />
EQ will be fine. But it will lose its foothold and people will leave once they have a chance. When the company is as dishonest and disloyal to it's playerbase as SOE has been there will be reprocussions like people swearing to never ever buy another SoE Title.<br />
<br />
Oh and yeah I still think we need 250 to 300 hp items coming out of Single groupable stuff. (With a ramping path up covering the entire gamut of Power levels and focuses.) It shouldnt be as fast as raiding but by god it should be there with enough story hooks and reasons to make it a true RPG instead of the tactical abortion that it is now.<br />

I know you know, Snoww. You and I have been round and round on this topic for months. Your well-stated poins of view have gotten me father into the Non-Raider camp than I have ever been. I mean, I am ACTIVELY PROMOTING the idea of opening up the EPs. Not a lot of raiders doing that. Lots of indifference on that side of &quot;the game&quot;, but not tons pushing for it. <br />
<br />
And I am also going to agree that a better game may exist inside that &quot;model&quot; you have running in your head. A game where EVERYTHING is obtained at a snails pace of dedicated gameplay through 1-groupable quests and mini-raids. But that kind of model scares me, Snoww, I am not gonna kid you here. Diablo plays to that model, to a degree. I love Diablo, played it for months, then shelved it. Busted it out for some expansions, then shelved it again. Its a GREAT game, but its not EQ.<br />
<br />
Now maybe there is a way to avoid the whole &quot;diabloesqe&quot; feeling by combining the content and loot with clever &quot;gatherable, progressable&quot; quests, like BiC. BiC seems to be the step we need, actually. Tons and tons of this quest is one groupable. Couple 3-groupers, so far but I think thats it.<br />
<br />
I think SOE IS trying to adjust Snoww. Look at Gates. Go look at the loot table for KT. I am pretty sure they expect EVERYONE to be able to get there eventually and score that loot. Some is EASILY Time level. Ikky single groupers are next, and look doable at lvl 70, even for average players. A ton of Gates IS all about 1-group progress. Trust me when I tell you that SOE knows they dropped the ball with the PoP flag system. In Gates, we see the &quot;next generation&quot; of it, one-group flagging. Its still not perfect, but its growing, and adjusting. <br />
Thats it in a nutshell thats all people want. (refferring to 250-300 hp gear)<br />
And in 3 or 4 expansions, you will be able to get it unless you decide to play the game AS ITS DESIGNED. I am sorry Wulf. I respect you, and appriciate your cause. I am even in your corner, believe it or not. <br />
<br />
You wanna see better gear? <br />
Get to KT. <br />
<br />
Dont tell me is too hard. Try. Get into the Trials. They are like LDoN. Tricky at first, til people started solving them. Vxed and Tipt are practically solved now, and soon, level 70 will allow even the most basically bazaar geared players to get through them all and into KT. Thats the CURRENT game path design you have. If you want to change it, then look for things that will help you get there, and stop pressing for absolutely impossible solutions. You know fully well those things wont happen, but you have a REAL chance to get some stuff changed, like LDoN and the EP access. Why not concentrate your effort in that direction, cause past that is a BIG ASS brick wall, and we both know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cure for PoP progression now is to ignore it.  They just aren't going to do the tuning that would be needed.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully GoD and OOW will permit growth and character expansion so that you can.  I think GoD is definitely heading in the right direction.  <br />
<br />
With levels, people will slam to content where they can get solid group upgrades - in content that currently exists.  Who knows what OOW will provide, but ANYTHING else will essentially be a bonus.  <br />
<br />
I'm actually very encouraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">And in 3 or 4 expansions, you will be able to get it unless you decide to play the game AS ITS DESIGNED. I am sorry Wulf. I respect you, and appriciate your cause. I am even in your corner, believe it or not.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Like i said when i started it was 99% group content.<br />
Same when Kunark and Velious came out.<br />
The gap is just too wide between raiders and non raiders.<br />
Yes EQ is now designed around raiders but please dont try telling me it always was.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You wanna see better gear? <br />
Get to KT. <br />
<br />
Dont tell me is too hard. Try. Get into the Trials. They are like LDoN. Tricky at first, til people started solving them. Vxed and Tipt are practically solved now, and soon, level 70 will allow even the most basically bazaar geared players to get through them all and into KT. Thats the CURRENT game path design you have. If you want to change it, then look for things that will help you get there, and stop pressing for absolutely impossible solutions. You know fully well those things wont happen, but you have a REAL chance to get some stuff changed, like LDoN and the EP access. Why not concentrate your effort in that direction, cause past that is a BIG ASS brick wall, and we both know it.<br />
<br />
This sort of quote always annoys me.<br />
&quot;You can go play in old expansions&quot; it basically means.Once us raiders have finished with them.<br />
<br />
Heh youve struck another pet hate of mine.<br />
No i would never say EQ is too hard.<br />
Would have to agree with Tugela on this point.<br />
1000's of people screamed that GoD was too hard etc when it was 1st released.<br />
Why ?<br />
Because a lot of them could not be bothered to work around how to do the encounters because of the mentallity of a lot of them is &quot;i want to see all the new zones NOW&quot;.<br />
People were doing the encounters,so they could be done, <br />
but because someone was &quot;uber&quot; and couldnt storm through them they were too &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
PS<br />
By the way Blazz none of this is personal against you in particular as at least you tend to argue with respect and good points but more yours and other raiders attitude of no one but raiders deserve the good gear.<br />
SoE would have to fundamentally change EQs design as youve already stated but hey this happened when they introduced raiding on a massive scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">I am really not intrested in the Elemental plains as Xp zones. That would just open up part of one area that would still run into the block of advancement by raids.<br />
<br />
Then I could get the gear to do what? More Ldons? It would open up more of GoD and some of Omens.<br />
<br />
Snoww, now you sound like your just crying in your corn flakes. The game is PLAYED one stage at a time, with access to one area &quot;preparing&quot; players for advancement into the next. EPs have one groupable minis with gear FAR better than you can get anywhere unflagged. &quot;Opens up more of Gates and OoW&quot; is exactly how you play this game. Once you get there(EPs, Vxed-Tipt-Sewers), you see the NEXT place to go (KT), then the next (Ikky), not to mention whats potentially in OoW along the way. Isnt this EXACTLY what you wanted? <br />
But at the end of the day all roads belong to raiding.<br />
All roads to what Snoww? To better loot? To FUN? Are you having fun Snoww? I have seen lots of your posts where is sounds like your having fun, to me anyway. If you have a decent, progressible, playable path, then what difference does it make whats happening in &quot;THE OTHER HALF&quot; of the game? EQ has two halves, raiding, and non-raiding. Play them both, or don't. <br />
Like i said when i started it was 99% group content.<br />
Wulf when I started it took MONTHS, not DAYS to level up. Of course the game was 99% group, what do you think you were going to use when you charged that dragon, store-bought armor and weapons? Hell, the funny part about that is I actually BOUGHT a Combine Long Sword so I could farm wisps for cash at lvl 14, somewhere in April of 1999. Besides, I have already given you examples of raids before 50. Efreeti, Sir Lucan, deep Mistmoore, Froglock King, etc etc. But when the game started, it was 90% about playing. Now, its 90% about getting to 65, THEN playing. <br />
&quot;You can go play in old expansions&quot; it basically means.Once us raiders have finished with them.<br />
Hey, guess what, I never got to Time until 3 months AFTER Gates shipped. I got hand-me downs too. My guild isnt in some hurry to see Tzxkhjf or however those End Gates zones are spelled. We JUST got to Time. We STILL need plate molds for clerics and knights. You non-traiders equip yourself. Maybe you 2-box so you gotta collect stuff for 2, but in EQ, a duo is about 3 times as good as soloing.x Raiding guilds have MANY more armor and weapon slots to fill. I didnt see VT til PoP. I didnt see Time til Gates. I probably wont get too deep in Gates before OoW. And hey, even after OoW ships, I will STILL be in Time, because its got loot I want. 4 expansion old stuff. <br />
<br />
So, your behind me. There are people still hitting Ssra, Emp, VT. heck, at level 70, I am thinking smaller guilds with 20ish active can start whacking the Emp. Know something else? Theres LOTS of people behind you. Lots ahead of me. Its a GAME. We are PLAYING it. I play the Raiding half. You dont. And because you dont, you seem to want the entire game built around how YOU have chosen to play. <br />
<br />
Because a lot of them could not be bothered to work around how to do the encounters because of the mentallity of a lot of them is &quot;i want to see all the new zones NOW&quot;.<br />
People were doing the encounters,so they could be done, <br />
but because someone was &quot;uber&quot; and couldnt storm through them they were too &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
I dont understand what your saying here. Is this a complaint about the difficulty of Gates? I already agree that the gap is too large, therefore all the content needs to be balanced one way or the other. I already agree that non-raiders are, and have been, lacking a path to adequatly progress in the game at a reasonable pace. <br />
SoE would have to fundamentally change EQs design as youve already stated but hey this happened when they introduced raiding on a massive scale.<br />
Again, Wulf, I disagree. A period of this games evolution was a lot less about raiding because there WERENT many places to have raid level encounters. As we got higher level, the game GREW to accamodate that with more raids. Naggy, Vox, Fear, Hate, and Air. Thats a decent chunk of &quot;raid content&quot; for the FIRST year. Kunark brought a BUTTLOAD of Dragons, awesome quests for weapons, and wonderful zones for people to further progress on their own. <br />
<br />
But if you want me to put my finger on when they made EQ about raiding, I would have to say &quot;the day I opened the box&quot;, because I was GOING to kill a dragon, man. And I was going to play however it seemed best to accomplish that goal. <br />
By the way Blazz none of this is personal against you in particular as at least you tend to argue with respect and good points but more yours and other raiders attitude of no one but raiders deserve the good gear.<br />
That really isnt how I like to look at it Wulf. I see it as &quot;people who want good gear raid to get it&quot;. Why do I raid? To get good loot. Thats a reason I play. <br />
<br />
Why does it bother you so much that there is a section of the EQ population is getting this uber gear? How does that affect you? Isnt that what you asked in previous posts? Personally, I think all of you people who choose not to raid (mostly, the hardcore non-raiders) are doing yourself a diservice. You are missing half the game. Why would you play a game, and only play half of it? EVERYONE can raid a little on some level you know. Thats how you play EQ.</div></div><hr />

Ah now this is where you seem to be misunderstanding the whole point of my argument.<br />
Ive got absolutely no problem with raiders getting good gear I just think there should be another path to this gear as well.<br />

Would you not agree that EQ is a totally different playstyle today than it was 5 years ago ?<br />
Of course its drastically different Wulf. 5 years ago the majority of the EQ population wasnt even lvl 40 yet. Now, in Todays EQ, if your not level 65, you ALMOST don't count at all (don't start with me, you &lt;65 people, no offense meant). The game has shifted, from being young, to being old. Shift with it. Or don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">All im asking for is a DIFFERENT path in the game.<br />
Wulf, last try, since your right here reading these. <br />
<br />
If Raiders didnt get the best stuff by raiding, and there was a DIFFERENT path to the same stuff, Raiding would cease to exist, thereby drastically altering the basic premise of the game. It would be a COMPLETELY different game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lol this arguments going round in circles :).<br />
Ok you state people only raid for the gear which means raiding is not enjoyable ?.Which must be true as you state if another path existed then raiding would die.<br />
So if it was an entirely different game and you got the best stuff without raiding wouldnt it be more enjoyable for everyone ?.<br />
Now if you only play EQ to get the best gear and you get no enjoyment out of the non raiding game then why bother playing ?.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">So if it was an entirely different game and you got the best stuff without raiding wouldnt it be more enjoyable for everyone ?.<br />
Where did I say this? This question is irrelevant. How about I say flat out I MIGHT enjoy it more, MAYBE even enough to last 6 months, and after that, I have to see. As for other people, thats for them to decide. Certainly, though, its not going to appeal to &quot;everyone&quot;. <br />
<br />
EQ has gear. Best gear is obtained by raiding. So I raid. Cant make it any more simple than that. And you cant alter that basic premise without creating a different game. Whether I would like this &quot;new&quot; game, or whether this new game would appeal to &quot;everyone&quot;, has no bearing whatsoever. It would not be EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Raiding Fire Giants and Efreeti sometimes is nothing like gear and zone access associated with raiding now.  <br />
<br />
There's a huge qualitative difference.  You are just wrong if you say otherwise.  <br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with folks pointing out that it is in fact different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Hmm.<br />
<br />
Blazz. If the content was there and was fun you would play for longer than 6 months. You play for the loot. The method of the loot aquisition wouldnt probably matter much if the achiving of said loot was enjoyable and made to be worth it. <br />
<br />
I play to be with my friends and to enjoy the goofy comments that flare up while playing EQ. The game it self is filler for the most part. Because at the end of the day Killing Bob the destroyer of worlds with 52 people is zero differance from taking 52 level 1 Gnomes and killing a kodiak bear.<br />
<br />
They all have a role to play. But it isnt roleplaying. <br />
<br />
I live for the times when someone in my group is lost and I get to go find them. Without maps. Or when as a shaman I am pulling in the deep and dark places I have never been. Knowing a misstep will kill me. For the times when we are half dead and the cleric is screaming oom and the warrior is begging for a break and there are still 2 mobs in camp that just have to die. For a few weeks back when we got a chain aggro from a stupid wandering where they shouldnt be SK and had 6-7 ferubi mobs dropped in the lap of my little 12 person raid, 2-3rds of the raid dead in an instant. And it came down to a mage myself and a paladin With the mage oom and aggro on 3 things so he died pretty fast. And myself and the paladin mopped up the rest and dealt with the 3 repops in the room while ressing the cleric to get the other up. At one point I was at 2 hit points and my regen kept me alive. through 3 more swings worth before I had enough mana to get a Q off on myself. <br />
<br />
Yeah I still enjoy the game. Despite SoE and the way they have designed teh game for the last few years. There has been just enough to keep me going, but many many people don't play as hard as I do and not raid. In fact many raiders don't push Like I do which is why I am normally in the spots that many don't normally go because it isnt the path of least resistance. <br />
<br />
The game as it stands is alinating a large base of its paying subscribers. And opening content that is years old is simply a please don;t leave tactic while they want to have us buy new Expansions. I can promise you one thing if only raiders bought the next expansion then the game would be merging servers soon after because SoE would panic that the cash cow is drying up and hedging bets to save as much as they can. <br />
<br />
The non raiders. Or casual time raiders are the largest portion of the game, and tehy are being delt with shoddily. And it has to change for one simple reason. <br />
<br />
What is challenging for a Level 65 Raider gear player is over 2X as hard or scaling into impossible for a level 65 non raider player. Another expansion towards the uber will drive too many folks away. The only way that it won't is if elemental level gear (Or pretty damn close) is dropping off the easier yard trash that will give a true leg up for all the non raiders out there. Thereby negating all the work done in a 4 expansion ago Planes of power by the raider.<br />
<br />
Another Ooops we based this on level 70 toons excuse will not fly. The Gear gap has to close. Considerably. Because you cannot design content for both groups of players that is challenging to both under the current framework of EQ. <br />
<br />
I don't envy SoE thier position. But they ****ed it up. And they need to **** or get off the pot. And since raiders have been saying for so long play the raid game or don't get the gear I will say now &quot;Give us some parity here or go F yourselves sony online entertainment&quot;<br />

<br />
There's nothing wrong with folks pointing out that it is in fact different.<br />
yes, I understand all this, but my point here is that for the first year or so the game was seperated by a different sort of &quot;gap&quot;, levels. In fact, it wasnt REALLY until Luclin that the population level curve started make a HUGE shift upward, and more as more and more people reached lvl 60. Now, 65 is where we begin to make any sort of &quot;progress&quot;. THATS the true &quot;difference&quot;, raiding is just a part of that, and has evolved accordingly (more MAX leveled people means you need more raid mobs so people have stuff to do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">More raid mobs is a result of developer turnover and replacements. <br />
<br />
1 Encounter taking 72 people 6 months to competly finish is more cost effective with developer time and money than  12 6 man encounters that folks will finish in 3 months.<br />
<br />
What they have to do is have 1 encounter taking 36 people to do And complete in 3 months time and the same 12 6 mana encounters takeing the same 3 month time period. GoD is a start. If the gear disparity wasnt so great GoD would be a popular place. But them making it semi challenging for the uber has placed it way out of reach for the Non raider/ casuals.<br />
<br />
Only two choices. Lessen the gap by giving casual/ Non raiders access to better gear in current damn content Or nerf the hell out of Raider gear so it can only be used in raids. Monty haul for raiders alone has to stop or segregate the playerbase and split the dev time.<br />
<br />

Thats not my point at all Snoww. My point is that you are talking about something TOTALLY different than EQ at the very core of its existance.I think you woyuld find nearly as many quitting if this were the case as you suggest may if things DONT change. But that big fat middle will stay.<br />
<br />
If casual raiders are the largest chunk of the population, then hardcore non-raiders are probably the smallest. Many many people who dont raid arent at that wall yet, but they are catching up fast. However, once the new expansion ships, they will have things to do. You, and people like you, hit the wall much much faster. Now I agree there should be MORE for you to do, MORE progress for you to make, but the choice not to raid, not to participate in what amounts to over half the content these days, is just that, a CHOICE you made. You dont like to raid. OK. I do. I dislike farming raid mobs, but its a negative factor that is outweighed by the positive of having access to better loot. <br />
<br />
Gosh, I just dont know how else to explain this. EQ is part raiding. It always has been. Recently, raiding has gotten a larger role in the game. Thats the game.</div></div><hr />
