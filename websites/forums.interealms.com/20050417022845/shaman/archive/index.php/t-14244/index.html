<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zmakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went to Jaggedpine Forest to check it out.  Soon as I got in caves a Gnoll Defiler hit me with Dots, debuff and Fear.  I ran out after fear went away.  I was wondering are these commom mobs to deal with or just a few in there and I hit one?  And does anyone have a suggestion on best way to fight these nasty buggers or a basic startegy for the caves.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are a variety of mob types in the gnoll caves. I haven't been in there in a while, but if I remember correctly the following classes are present:<br />
<br />
Necros<br />
Clerics<br />
Warriors<br />
Enchanters<br />
Shamans<br />
<br />
I may be off on some of these, but I am 100% sure of the necros, warriors, and clerics. My info isn't solid on the others because during my few visits here with my paladin, I duoed with a mage who armed his pet with Gnoll Hide Lariats. Between my stuns and the pet weapon procs, the casters didn't get many chances to cast any spells and my resists were pretty high, so I can't say for sure on the mobs outside of the three I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Also, there are several wandering mobs in the cave system and they can make life miserable for you quickly. Make sure you have your crowd control spells up and ready.<br />
<br />
What I have seen many soloers do here is pull from the caves and kill outside below the entrance of the caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cast resist magic, poison, and disease on yourself.  that will take care of most of the spells if you have balanced gear.<br />
<br />
give the dog some gnoll hide whips for the stun proc.  or a whip and a velium weap for the shard proc<br />
<br />
ebolt the casters to begin with, then nuke.  slow the warriors first, then dog and dot.<br />
<br />
the casters see thru invis.  the gnolls and warriors do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i spent a decent amount of time in JP recently (about 3 nights...maybe 8 hours total...solo). Invis when you get to caves, they dont see thru invis, keep making rights till you fall through trap. Theres one right there, but if you back up all the way against the wall you can summon pet and buff and stuff and he wont agro you. (by the way, make sure you root when low on health, they run pretty fast and they will go through wall and you wont be able to loot...pet can still kill him though)Most of the gnolls that spawn are the warriors, so no worries about casters usually, there are necros, shaman, clerics, and one more casting class that do spawn once in a while (roughly I'd say one in 8 or so). I've only had fear cast once, it was on dog, so in my opinion they dont cast it much. I send dog in, slow, root till dog gets agro, cast ebolt, let him chew for a while and canni some mana back, then go in a finish off (of course make sure you position pet behind so no parries,etc). Kill the first one...go further...at the opening pull the one back and take care of him. Then theres one on the hill just ahead of the last one, when your done with him, theres one on top of the hill. Next is one more on the right side of the wall above the hill. By the time you do these (all easily single pulls), the first one should have repopped, I'd say go back and do it over again, or those 3 near the hill might aggro if ya hang out there. If you duo with a pet class, like mage, you could clear the place fast, its probably better xp, only did that once, and only for a short time so not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lefusgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a quick note, they don't path through the wall. Whenever one would run off on me, if my root landed after they seemed to pass thru the wall, when the gnoll died my pet would drop from the sky. So out of curiosity I used vision to bind my sight to a gnoll just as it ran, and he actually jumps up out of the pit trap, and makes his way down the hallway back toward the intersection.</div></div><hr />

Kind of funny how I opened my mouth just yesterday about never being feared, not 10 minutes into a hunt last night, a defiler feared me (thank go it only lasted about 3 seconds). The odd thing was that I somehow jumped out of the trap to the level above, so I never thought of it, but I guess that is what really happens with the gnolls too (never saw the pet drop down before though, it always looked like he would come back through the wall).</div></div><hr />
