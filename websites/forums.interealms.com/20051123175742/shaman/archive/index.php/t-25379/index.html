<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
     I feel compelled to write this guide for a number of reasons. Some of them centering on dispelling myth from fact based on this class, others based in promoting awareness and self education on the subject. I haven't seen any guides as to how to approach PvP combat versus Paladins, but if you have, feel free to link them up. This guide comes from the perspective of a level 35 Paladin on the PvP server: Bleeding Hollow, with a 1 on 1 framework in mind. The majority of this guide is based around the mid-level PvP game, which I think is a good basis of assessment, seeing as the class roots are firmly cemented but not distorted by end-game gear, abilities and spells.<br />

Some links you'll find useful to refer to while reading this guide:<br />
A List of Paladin Spells: http://www.thotbott.com/?c=Paladin[/url]<br />
A List of Paladin Talents: http://www.thotbott.com/?ti=Paladin<br />
<br />
Basic description:<br />
<br />
     A Paladin’s main focus is defense and damage absorption. Able to withstand much punishment, the Paladin’s longevity is marked by the ability to utilize healing spells, access to the best armor type: Plate, and several key spells which sustain their life and the lives of others. A Paladin has access to many types of weapons, most notably usage of the shield, various 1 handed weapons and 2 handed weapons. Paladins have no access to ranged weaponry or offensive spells for that matter (Not considering talent specialization or trade skills).<br />
<br />
How a Paladin Operates:<br />
<br />
     A Paladin is a melee oriented hybrid class primarily wielding three types of spells in their arsenal: Auras, Blessings, and Seals/Judgments. An Aura is a group buff that the Paladin emits up to a certain radius, with him or her operating as the center. A Blessing is a short term, typically 5 minute buff. Seals and Judgments are lumped together because they operate synergistically: A seal is a self only; 30 second beneficial buff that when triggered with a spell called:<br />
<br />
Judgement - Retribution, 9 mana, Instant Cast, 15 sec Cooldown, Lvl 4. Unleashes the energy of a Seal spell upon an enemy. Refer to individual Seals for Judgement effect. <br />
<br />
is transferred into a debuff on the hostile target. For the most part, only one Judgement, Seal, Blessing and Aura per Paladin can be in effect at any given time. I cannot, for instance, have two different Blessings on me and my group; both cast by me. I can emit one Aura at a time. I can only have one seal upon me and only one Judgement upon a hostile target at any given time. If there are two Paladins in a group, one can emit one Aura, and the other can emit another. They do not stack, That Paladin can cast a Blessing on me, and I can cast a different blessing on myself and him/her. We can both judge a hostile target with different Judgments, the same ones do not stack. Since Seals are self only buffs, we cannot exchanges those upon one another. You can tell when a new aura has gone into effect by the graphic effect occurring under the Paladin’s feet. Seals usually have a graphic effect that floats up above the Paladin’s head. Blessings have the standard casting animation. <br />
<br />
     As you would suspect, Paladins use the judgement system to achieve a sort of combo benefit in accordance with their attacks, active seals and auras. Here are some Seals and their related Judgement effects that are common to PvP:<br />
<br />
Seal of the Crusader (Rank 4) - Retribution, 75 mana, Instant Cast, Lvl 32. Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader for 30 sec, granting 85 attack power. The Paladin also attacks 40% faster, but deals less damage with each attack. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time. Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 30 sec, increasing Holy damage taken by up to 80. Only one Judgement per Paladin can be active at any one time. <br />
<br />
Seal of Light(Rank 1) - Holy, 95 mana, Instant Cast, Lvl 30. Fills the Paladin with divine light for 30 sec, giving each melee attack a chance to heal the Paladin for 39. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time. Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 30 sec, granting melee attacks made against the judged enemy a chance of healing the attacker for 25. Only one Judgement per Paladin can be active at any one time. <br />
<br />
Seal of Righteousness(Rank 4) - Holy, 80 mana, Instant Cast, Lvl 26. Fills the Paladin with holy spirit for 30 sec, giving each melee attack a chance to cause 20 additional Holy damage. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time. Unleashing this Seal's energy will cause 47 Holy damage to an enemy. <br />
<br />
Why Paladins are called &quot;Cats&quot;:<br />
<br />
     Paladins have been nicknamed &quot;Cats&quot; on various PvP servers for their ability to withstand tremendous amounts of punishment and practically reset the fight, as if they had &quot;9 lives&quot;. Let's take a look at those particular spells used to achieve this feat.<br />
<br />
(Considering up to level 35)<br />
<br />
[u]The &quot;Time Out&quot; Spells<br />
<br />
Divine Shield (Rank 1) - Protection, 75 mana, Instant Cast, 5 minute Cooldown, Lvl 34. Protects the paladin from all damage and spells for 10 sec, but reduces attack speed by 50%. <br />
<br />
Divine Protection (Rank 2) - Protection, 35 mana, Instant Cast, 5 minute Cooldown, Lvl 18. You are protected from all physical attacks and spells for 8 sec, but during that time you cannot attack or use physical abilities yourself. <br />
<br />
Blessing of Protection (Rank 2) - Protection, 45 mana, Instant Cast, 5 minute Cooldown, Lvl 24, A targeted party member is protected from all physical attacks for 8 sec, but during that time they cannot attack or use physical abilities. Players may only have one Blessing on them per Paladin at any one time. <br />
<br />
Lay on Hands (Rank 2) - Holy, 100% Mana usage, Instant, 60 minute cooldown, Lvl 30, Heals a friendly target for an amount equal to the Paladin's maximum health and restores 250 of their mana. Drains all of the Paladin's remaining mana when used. <br />
<br />
Standard Heals<br />
<br />
Holy Light (Rank 5) - Holy, 275 mana, 2.5 sec Cast, Lvl 30. Heals a friendly target for 491 to 553. <br />
<br />
Flash of Light (Rank 3) - Holy, 70 mana, 1.5 sec Cast, Lvl 34. Heals a friendly target for 145 to 163.<br />
<br />
Notes on the &quot;Time Out&quot; Spells:<br />
<br />
     Divine Shield and Divine Protection both run off of the same 5 minute Cooldown timer, so the Paladin will have to choose the one that best fits the situation. They both have an orange-yellowish bubble effect around the Paladin when they are in effect. Usually, a Paladin will activate one of the &quot;Time Out&quot; spells to get out of sap, snare-root type effects, polymorph, and to buy them time to heal. While under Divine Protection, a Paladin is most likely running or healing themselves. They cannot attack or stun you. They can however cast spells on you, most likely a Judgement of some sort. They must be within melee range in order to use this ability. If the protection bubble is up and they are attacking/stunning you, then they have activated Divine Shield. They probably feel confident in winning the fight seeing as they used it, or they are attempting to finish you off, hold you off until reinforcements arrive. Blessing of Protection does not have the same effect as Diving Protection/ Divine Shield. If you do not see the orange-yellowish bubble and the Paladin is emitting &quot;immune&quot; signals from attacks, they can be assaulted with spells. <br />
<br />
Examining a Paladin’s PvP weaknesses:<br />
<br />
Ranged Combat<br />
<br />
     One of the glaring weaknesses of the Paladin class is the total lack of any sort of ranged combat. A Paladin has no natural means by which he can attack or pull anything that's more then a few steps away. Some Paladins attempt to make up for this deficiency by taking up engineering and using some of the items made in the profession. Other's use other items found in the world. 90% of all Paladin’s are totally unequipped to deal with a ranged enemy. At the very bottom of the Holy Talent Tree is an ability called Holy Shock, which is 320 mana, Instant Cast, 30 second cooldown, and does 205 to 219 Holy damage. This ability requires 30 talent points to have been invested in the Holy Tree before it is purchasable. Obviously, even with heavy talent specialization, ranged combat is not an option for a Paladin. <br />
<br />
Running/Kiting<br />
<br />
     Paladins have very few tools to keep a Player from getting away from him or her. A Paladin has no other option other then staying within melee range to maintain any sort of pressure. Paladins have two spells they rely on to keep an enemy player around for more punishment:<br />
<br />
(Again Considering up to level 35) <br />
<br />
Hammer of Justice (Rank 2) - Retribution, 50 mana, Instant Cast, 1 min Cooldown, Lvl 24. Stuns the target for 4 sec. <br />
<br />
Seal of Justice - Protection, 33 mana, Instant Cast, Lvl 22. Fills the Paladin with the spirit of justice for 30 sec, giving each melee attack a chance to stun for 2 sec. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time. Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 30 sec, preventing them from fleeing. Only one Judgement per Paladin can be active at any one time. <br />
<br />
     Depending on who their up against, some Paladin’s like to use Hammer of Justice early in the fight to get the advantage and make the enemy player panic. Others prefer to save it for the first attempt to heal themselves, or the first attempt for the enemy to heal themselves as a guaranteed interrupt. Still others prefer to try to end the fight with it, preventing the player from fleeing out of melee range. It's important to note as well that the range on Hammer of Justice extends to about melee range and 1/2.<br />
<br />
     As for Seal of Justice, this seal usually comes out with fights against casters, or anyone the Paladin hopes to interrupt often. If an enemy begins to run at mid to low health and the Paladin can manage to stay within melee distance, you are guaranteed that Seal of Justice will come up in an attempt to thwart your melee range leaving plans. It's good to note that the ability to improve the potential proc rate of this seal is available in the talent trees. The &quot;preventing them from fleeing&quot; portion of the Judgement version of Seal of Justice does nothing to prevent an enemy player from fleeing in my experience.<br />
<br />
Shallow Mana Pool<br />
<br />
     Without getting bogged down by endless comparisons, I can safely assure you from personal experience that a Paladin’s mana bar has no sense of endurance. Roughly speaking, a Paladin’s big heal will eat up about 1/3 of their mana bar. Throw in some seals, aura changes, judgements and a purify here and there, that mana is gone in no time. If Lays on Hands is available however, a Paladin usually won't panic, instead redouble attempts to engage you in melee combat to break your morale. As they approach low life, they activate Lay on hands, draining them of all mana (what mana?) and at later levels even restores a bit of mana. Most people who start off attempting to avoid melee combat with the Paladin fall for this trick. They want to end the fight so they come into melee range &quot;for the kill&quot;. This is the biggest mistake. Before you know it the fight has reset and you're struggling to get out of melee range. At this point the pressure is off of the Paladin to heal and protect himself and on you to get out of his melee range, which he or she will not give up without passionate resistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why Paladins win in PvP fights:<br />
<br />
     Simply put, Paladins are built to last. They managed to keep up with the enemy player and whittle them down to zero life. This isn't done quickly. There is no barrage of attacks or one big blast of death. The Paladin managed to engage the enemy player in prolonged melee combat, the Paladin had ample mana to heal himself and utilize his invulnerability spells as needed. Paladins deal slow, consistent damage in melee combat. You'll never see a Paladin win a PvP fight in which the enemy controlled the distance of engagement. They are not dangerous in melee combat from the damage they deal, but from all the benefits they can reap from their auras, seals, judgements, and blessings. They need an enemy to engage in melee to reap those benefits properly.<br />
<br />
Why Paladins lose in PvP fights: <br />
<br />
     Paladins lose in PvP fights when they cannot utilize their powerful blessings, auras, seals and judgements on an enemy because they are consistently denied close combat and/or mana when it matters. Melee and mana is the catalyst for a winning Paladin. If the enemy player consistently controls the distance of engagement then the Paladin cannot kill them. If the enemy can manipulate the Paladin’s ability to regen, expend, and use their mana, the Paladin cannot endure for very long. A Paladin will always, always, always make strides to engage in close melee combat. A Paladin will never, never, never willingly allow an enemy to leave close melee range. If they do, it's because they're planning to run, or they're planning to close the distance again very soon.<br />
<br />
What to do about the &quot;Time Out&quot; Spells:<br />
<br />
     Most players start to panic when they start to see the Paladin &quot;Time out&quot; spells come out. This is displayed in the amount of tactics and mana used in the next wave of assaults. You can tell in a fight between a Paladin and some other class that the Paladin is on his &quot;2+ life&quot; because the style of engagement gets more in favor of the Paladin. Every class seems to become a close combat specialist out of panic or frustration as time goes on. What most people don't realize is that the tension works both ways. The Paladin wants you dead just as much as the enemy wants them dead. The only difference is that the Paladin knows it will take him some time to whittle down the enemy players life total; the enemy player just believes that if they use more mana, more combo points, more rage, more anything, then the Paladin will take more damage and perhaps, this time, die. They eventually get desperate or frustrated, engage the Paladin on their terms, and usually die. <br />
<br />
     In the worst case situation, you have three &quot;Time Out&quot; spells to deal with (Presented in the order most commonly used): Blessing of Protection, Divine Shield or Divine Protection and Lay on Hands. Normally, a Paladin will try to melee you and use the &quot;Time out&quot; spells to get the upper hand again in the fight; be it in health or in morale. You can usually force a reaction out of a Paladin by surprising them (Sap anyone?) or by making them think that they absolutely must close the distance of engagement. If the Paladin senses that you're going to exploit their range weakness, they will most definitely sacrifice a &quot;Time Out&quot; simply to reach you and desperately keep you in melee combat. <br />
<br />
     Most people don't realize that when a Paladin calls &quot;Time Out&quot; it's a good opportunity to change the situation. If Blessing of Protection is up, they are susceptible to spells. If they use Divine Protection, they are most likely going to heal themselves up and fight on. If they use Divine Shield (You'll know because they're trying to attack you if this is the case) then you know they want to make you panic and use your mana and tricks to recover. If you see a chance to create a distance between you and the Paladin, do so, even if you intend to melee them, especially if they throw up the shields. Why? In effect you are giving them a choice: heal up while invulnerable and then try to close the gap, or maintain the close combat and sacrifice the chance to heal up. Most Paladins are used to getting in one heal while invulnerable while the enemy spends a few seconds determining how invulnerable the Paladin is. By that time the Paladin is most likely loading up a blessing, a seal and a judgement to toss on you for being kind enough to stick around and wait for him to come back to melee combat. Abusing the range deficiency will eventually force the Paladin through all of his shields. The most difficult one to get will be the Lay on Hands if it's available. <br />
<br />
<br />
Only use ranged combat?:<br />
<br />
     No, what I'm saying is that running up and attacking the Paladin dead on is what they expect, what they crave, what they're designed to shrug off. By exploiting the Paladin’s lack of range and dependency on mana you force them to sweat, and they will become more desperate to get you back into melee combat on their terms through using up their mana and their &quot;Time Out&quot; spells. Most people's sense of tactics center around running up to the Paladin and turning on attack. They mash some buttons, watch the life totals go up and down, begin to panic and try to get out of melee combat, which the Paladin won't allow to happen at this point. They then die and wonder why they lost. Rinse and repeat a few times and it is easy to see how misperceptions began. <br />
<br />
<br />
The most effective class against a Paladin:<br />
<br />
     Understand that the most difficult match up for a Paladin is not from any particular class, but from someone who is willing to be patient, to exploit the Paladin’s weakness of range and systematically deny them close combat and mana. By denying them melee combat at crucial times, you deny the Paladin nearly all of the benefits of his Auras, Seals, Judgments, and Blessings. Those types of people are the most lethal Paladin killers in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best class I have seen that can kill a Paldain so far was a hunter. They used the sting that man drained them and rained arrows from a distance snared them and had pet chew at them.<br />
<br />
As shamans we lack the DPS to kill a paladin that knows what they are doing. Heh when i see a paladin I do like my pants and split :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent read!  Just a minor point, but at the higher levels, I found depending on your equipment choices, a paladin's heals won't eat through your mana pool the same as at the lower levels.  They still tend to be quite noticeable on the mana bar, don't get me wrong, but throwing 6 or 7 heals on a single mana bar isn't unlikely, and if they're a balanced int/spirit build, their slow melee pace can keep them in mana indefinately. As you say, it's all about not panicking when in battle :)<br />
<br />
Easily the worst class I've found for dealing with as a paladin was the hunter, as their ranged attack combined with snares and mana drains is just nasty.  Casters can often get in a first shot fairly easily, but their longer cast times makes them more vulnerable to paladin switching to a resist aura (the right one can be chosen depending upon the graphic on the caster's hands) and getting into melee range. Once in melee range, a caster will often drop quite quickly.<br />
<br />
The fact that most paladin seals and auras are instant cast means they can be switching auras etc while they run at you; about the only really important spells they have to stand still for are the heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No problems with paladins yet. Simply deal massive damage to them and keep them on the defensive. I use a bandage when they go immune, and other than that just keep the damage going.<br />
<br />
I met one paladin of roughly equal level I lost too, it was down to last hit, he won, he was good,and I realized after I never even used evade hehe, and I could have vanished.<br />
<br />
Paladins are a tough, tough, tough class though, no doubts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salece</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As a lvl 60 paladin in a PvE server, I'll share with you some of my tricks.  <br />
<br />
Be aware that paladins at high lvl will have access to a spell called Repentence.  By itself it's not a very useful spell, a 6 second effect that put opponents (humaniod only) into &quot;sleep-like&quot; state.  But it's dangerous in PvP because you can be sure that paladins who know their trade will use Repentence as their first &quot;time-off&quot; spell.  In addition it only has a one-minute cooldown, so basically after Repentence, Stun, Shield 1 and 2, Laid in Hand, Repentence will be back on line again.  In short paladins have TWO additional time-out chances.  <br />
<br />
Paladin can also spec on both Blessing of Justice (increase stun chance per hit) and Divine Favor.  Divine guarantees paladin's next healing will be critical, which is about 2100 hp at my lvl.  Also paladins can put five points in talent to make sure (100% chance) that whenever there's a critical heal, it will regain an equal amount of mana (560 mana at lvl 60).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Damn man, I guess it is no wonder so many more people play alliance. Shaman can't even come close to that.<br />
<br />
Gonna be a rough road for us horde.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Eh, shamans have a few tricks up their sleeves.  Shaman damage is unpredicatable, which is a boon in PvP.  Often a paladin will wait until the last possible moment as his life is fading to call a time-out.  A shaman can get a winfury proc at the right moment to kill them before they react.  Also, Nature's Swiftness is a talet point ability that lets your next spell become  instant cast.  Usually this is for a timely heal, but against a paladin, use it with lightning bolt along with melee and a shock for one massive round of damage.  Timing is difficult though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">in time I think that will be alot better, right now people seem jumpy, even as a rogue, I get em down to half and they are already healing.<br />
<br />
I must ask though, why on earth, is there any single reason to play a warrior on the alliance side? It is not even remotely possible for a warrior to beat a paladin.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mill, there's not. Our primary Warrior (who has played Warrior/Tank types throughout most of his MMO career) retired his WoW Warrior in favor of a Pally. My brother (who is new to MMO's with his CoH Scrapper being his introduction to the genre) is also about to retire his Warrior in favor of a Paladin, or possibly a Rogue.<br />
<br />
From what I gather based on their comments, Warriors are the completely useless and gimped class of WoW. Rumor has it they're supposed to be &quot;getting some love&quot; from Blizzard, but if the enhancements they were given in the last patch is any indication, it's a dead class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors can solo iinm.<br />
<br />
The problem stems from asshats like furor who think they need to be Conan the Barbarian mixed with Kurghan.  They want to outdamage everybody, have no downtime and resist all spells all the time. (yes I'm exaggerating - but not by much).<br />
<br />
THEN when their place in the food chain is threatened they whine and talk about needing &quot;love.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sympathy for Warriors. You don't like the class in WoW? Roll the fek up something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When Warriors have a hard time soloing a single even leveled mob, there's a problem. I've watched a level 30 Human Warrior get completely owned by a level 30 Murloc Tiderunner in Southshore. <br />
<br />
Maybe he just sucked as a player? I dunno. I didn't inspect him so I don't know what kind of gear he had, but when my Hunter can take on 2 or 3 same level mobs and a Warrior can't even take on one? I'm inclined to believe they actually do need some tweaking. Blizzard has even admitted as much.<br />
<br />
I do know that our primary Warrior knows how to play. He's a sharp cookie and doesn't follow the WoW forums, so has no exposure to the whinefests there. Nor does my brother, and even though this is only his second MMO, he proved himself very proficient at learning and leveling a melee class in CoH. While many bitched and moaned about how gimp Scrappers were, he quickly out leveled me (even though he started a little over a month later than I did). I trust those two more than anything I'd ever read.</div></div><hr />

Mill man u have to see a high level hunter in action. See unless u duel most fights tend to start at a distance (somewhat but hey it's not melee distance) this gives hunters an enormous advantage. I have seen a fight where the Paladin was absolutely destroyed. They use concussion shot send in pet and then and then drain their mana while using aimed shot. The guy got a critical for 1400 damage with a bow. That paladin didn't last past his first &quot;life&quot; heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This raises a question in my mind: Anybody tracking the DPS numbers you can generate with Cosmos?  <br />
<br />
I haven't played my shaman in a couple of weeks (finally wooed some friends away from EQ to WoW), but I was consistently getting numbers in the 75 to 85 DPS in consecutive, non-stop fights at level 32 against even and one level higher mobs (that's DOT + DMG Shield + Melee + Shocks).  I'm sure I could jack that number up higher (as I would in PvP), but in those fights I was tring to keep mana up for follow-on fights (using bandaging instead of healing and the like).  I would typically end a fight with 2/3 to 3/4 mana down from full.<br />
<br />
Are level 32 hunters a lot higher DPS than that?  At that level, I found Hunters to be one of the easier PvP prey for me unless they got the jump on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At that level, I found Hunters to be one of the easier PvP prey for me unless they got the jump on me.I've watched quite a few duels involving Hunters. It absolutely boggles my mind how often I see them allow their opponent to enter and stay within melee range.<br />
<br />
Hello?!?!<br />
<br />
Here's a clue to those people: Hunters are NOT a melee class!.<br />
<br />
You can focus on the Survival Tree all you want. You can keep TRYING to get higher armor/agility, but you will never, let me repeat that never, EVER be able to go toe to toe with a true melee class, so stop trying.<br />
<br />
I have my PVP/duel strategy, and sorry to sound arrogant about it, but any Hunter with half a brain and a smidgen of common sense can figure it out. It's not a government secret or rocket science. Blizzard gave us ways to allow us to get out of melee range and back into ranged combat. USE THEM! :)<br />
<br />
Sorry to quote ya and not answer your question Krup, but I don't use Cosmos (bloatware these days). I stick with the more streamlined CTMod for the functionality I need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Warriors absolutely can kill mobs there own level, easily, my brother is a 56 warrior, he solos like nobodies business.

At level 53 fighting level 50-52 ursas, as a rogue my dps numbers according to cosmos averaged about 300 dps, I am not making that up one single bit. Some lower, some higher, best was one fight with 528 dps I believe, massive crits.<br />
<br />
I am 55 now, and my whopping 1441 ac is starting to show however. Mobs put a hurting on me, I am proud I can take 2 level 55 mobs at the same time with little problem, but good amount of downtime now. Very happy with my solo power still, will see how real pvp goes soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill man u have to see a high level hunter in action. See unless u duel most fights tend to start at a distance (somewhat but hey it's not melee distance) this gives hunters an enormous advantage. I have seen a fight where the Paladin was absolutely destroyed. They use concussion shot send in pet and then and then drain their mana while using aimed shot. The guy got a critical for 1400 damage with a bow. That paladin didn't last past his first &quot;life&quot; heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
good, at least one class may be able to whup em. I have not fought one in many levels, I hope I still do okay, depends on how my damage scales with his new abilities. It is unbelievable how many paladins are running around, Blizzard really needs to make some changes, if nothing else, give shammies plate, and make warriors way more badass.</div></div><hr />

Those are casters too, and they come in pairs a lot.  I had issues with those with my priest when they were even level too.  Not every class can solo even cons or higher at every level; sometimes you have to fight lower things until its possible.  Weaknesses: everyone has them, no one likes to admit they do.<br />

Sorry to derail the thread, but I just can't stand people spouting off that a class needs some love just because there is one even leveled thing that they cannot solo- cry me a freaking river :)<br />

On topic, I found this interesting to read.  In a lot of ways, the paladin reminds me of my priest except with about three times the AC.  However, priests don't have a ranged fight deficiency :)</div></div><hr />

Like I said, two trustworthy sources have made comments on several occasions how pathetic the Warrior class is in WoW. Not just at one particular level against one particular type of mob. Believe it or not, no sweat off my back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think warriors are great in PvE.  I love having a warrior in my gorup, they barely take any damage doing instances.  However, they do need a PvP boost.  Something that does not improve their already balanced tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't bad in group PvP either.   It's great to have someone who can charge into a large group of alliance and start the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been playing a warrior since release (My Pally was through CB) and I've gotta say that warriors are not that pathetic in PvE.  My 33 warrior can solo level 35 mobs fairly easily, and anything even-con is just like a crunchy piece of toast.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I've seen is poor equipment choices. So many warriors just grab any old green item and whack it onto themselves, and then don't upgrade it for 10 levels.  Or people that keep their armour up to date, and then leave their weapons 10 to 15 levels old!  I was grouped with a 35 warrior who was using two 13.x dps 1handers, and wearing armour mostly tagged for low 20's!  I think it all comes down to experience. As EQ veterans, we all have a good understanding of how equipment choices affect us, whereas many people who come from other game styles just don't realise it to the same degree.  <br />
<br />
In PvP however, I definately feel the pain.  I can kill a cloth class if I'm very lucky. Our stun is on a 30 second timer (shield bash) so we can only interrupt a caster every 30 seconds or so. With talents, that will silence them (in that school of magic only) for about 8 seconds. Anyone who is remotely savvy on their class can pretty much walk circles around a warrior.  We have ranged attacks, but they will never win a battle for you. Our melee is decent, but we have to be in melee range.  We *can* absorb a lot of damage, but that only means it takes a bit longer for us to die while our opponents run circles around us. I pretty much avoid PvP on anything even level now, as it's just frustrating.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c.</div></div><hr />

(I'm a 39 priest at the moment, spec'd discipline with enough shadow to get mindflay.)<br />
<br />
Paladins' abilities should be nerfed.  Specifically, the total immunity one should not cleanse them of roots, dots, or debuffs.  There should be a bigger penalty to be paid for a complete, insta-cast clear.  I think it would be more balance if druid roots, priest mindflay, rogue sap, hunter concussion, etc. other snares should still snare or root or stun even during immunity; the immunity should be vs. damage, like the priest shield.

Not to mention you say a group of 40's WOULD take you down in 15 seconds. That a have or would? I mean you didnt mention any other high lvl toons with you. A 49 shaman and a 45 rogue. 15 levels is a big difference even if its 9 toons. I'm sure if a same battle you wouldnt use potions to live longer right? I mean it would be fair for me to say you could do every single thing even if you didnt have any on you. That damn rogue had endurance to use his abilites how overpowered is that!!!<br />

Sorry mill its just hard. You flew off the handle after a patch saying rogue were nerfed than came back and said maybe was just mob ac. My pally is just getting to 50 and when i have mana and LOH is up takes me awhile to get killed yeah. But some mobs die of old age depending where i am at and what adds i get. I get maybe 3 heals think i might of just gotten to 4 heals with my mana pool. Just think to many people fly off the cuff when they face a full mana/loh up pally and take the ideal situtation and turn that into PALLIES ARE OVERPOWERED!! Its getting rediculous the claims i hear anymore. NO my mana regen isnt fast enough to give me all my mana back in one fight. Not even close. NO my loh isnt always available to me just like you might not always have good healing potions to use at all times. NO my mana isnt endless. I heal for 1100 points and can do 3 to 4 tops. What would you prefer pallies do? ONLY HEAL OTHERS and not themselves?</div></div><hr />

There's a reason every site has pages and pages of requests to nerf paladins.  You're tired of hearing it because everyone that isn't a paladin is saying it.  Even non-paladin alliance think they are out of whack.  I feel truly sorry for alliance warriors -- they are really left out in the cold. <br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion: is it Divine Protection that is the 8 second invulnerability?  Why should that cleanse all DoT's, remove roots, snares, and all other debuffs.  Paladin goes invulnerable from both physical and spell damage, then he should still be afflicted by dot's that were cast prior to the ability, further, he should be snared a high percentage.  <br />
<br />
Have LoH be proportionate to the mana the paladin has -- still have a good hp to mp ratio on it, but tie the LoH to the mana.<br />
<br />
And by the way, notice how Horde shaman got nerfed last patch, despite everyone calling for paladin nerfing.  Hurray for Horde.  Outnumbered 3-2, nerfed, but still pressing on.<br />
<br />
Paladins get no respect.  You win a PvP fight or a duel, and everyone shrugs it off, &quot;Meh, it's a paladin... hit the &quot;I WIN&quot; button twice and it's over.&quot;  Lose...and everyone will think you're very very weak.  <br />

By the way, they get even worse with Repentance...That whole ability should just be removed.</div></div><hr />

See is a difference between nerf and tweaks. You're suggestions arent game breaking. I Dont see a reason with loh as it is now why i should have an ounce of mana after i use it. I could see tying it to less melee damage that i do for a time after using loh since you should be weakend maybe from it. But what i dont want to see if people just coming in here mad and saying nerf pallies because it catches on and alot of people just think pally should be spelled overpowered with no rational thinking why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">This raises a question in my mind: Anybody tracking the DPS numbers you can generate with Cosmos?<br />
I track mine with regularity.<br />
I wield the 2h mace from SM final boss that's 38dps.<br />
I'm fully talented into Enhancement, with windfury weapon as my weapon buff of choice.<br />
<br />
If I'm simply grinding on things going for minimal downtime, I'll drop my 4 totems and simply melee a mob to death (level 43 vs level 44 mobs in stranglethorn).  This will give me about 100dps if I remember right.<br />
If I pop off a few shocks mid combat, I'll get about 120dps, but I have downtime after which I don't much like.<br />
If I really want to go for max dps, I'll pop off stormstrikes and shock every chance I can.  Doing this will give me about 150dps or so I think.<br />
<br />
One thing though, is that the dps I get is very variable, depending on the rate windfury goes off.  If I fight something and it doesn't proc, my dps is crap.  When it goes off though, my dps goes through the roof.  At level 40 or 41 I was fighting something about level 38 or 39.  I attacked it, hit stormstrike, procced a windfury, shocked the mob, and meleed for 1 more hit to kill the mob in 3 seconds, with a 300 dps recorded for the fight.  It doesn't happen often that I get spikes like that, but it happens often enough.  When windfury goes off, I get about 300-600 damage happen in that one melee round.  Getting a double windfury proc happen is phat dps too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As a comparison, my 35 mage will consistantly get about 100dps in a fight, but I can only keep that up for about 15 seconds of combat.  By that point, I've run out of HP to keep tanking the thing I'm killing, or I've run out of mana to keep nuking.  Luckily by that point, I've already done enough damage to kill 2-3 mobs of roughly my own level.<br />
<br />
Every 3 minutes, my mage's dps is really really high.  I'll pull with fireball, land a fireball on the inc, do a fireblast, pop my talent that turns my next spell instant, and pop off another fireball, possibly doing an instant cone of cold if I need uber fast dps, and then channelling my arcane missle into the creature alternating with fireblast until the creature is dead.  I don't know exactly what my dps is when I do that, but I know I can usually kill a mob of my own level about 2-3 seconds after it gets within melee range of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I play a paladin and absolutely love it. I will also delete WoW the instant I'm forced into PVP.

Some Horde druid 2 levels higher than me just stared at me, I thought for sure I'd get attacked but instead I got to log for 5 min until the flag dropped to be safe.  I hope any changes to paladin affect PVP only, but knowing the idiots that design RPGs you can rest assured that they will destroy the class utterly in both PVP and PVE just like they did the mage and warrior class in closed beta.<br />

Oh well, can always roll a rogue/hunter like everyone else and have it easy.

     Keep in mind I'm not trying to pick a fight, I'm just curious: how many did the Pally take out before he went down in those two minutes? Were any of the strategies I suggested above used? Was there any strategy used in assaulting the Paladin, or was there simply a straight &quot;zerg rush&quot;? The reason I ask is because the Paladin is designed from the ground up to endure that type of situation best out of any of the classes. Spend alittle time looking over the Paladin spells and talents, you'll see that the class is designed to take that type of punishment and survive, not much else. <br />
<br />
     I find it intresting that some people here could cry broken, overpowered and nerf when comming from an EQ shaman background. We all know where that road goes. I think some classes need more love more then we need tuning/nerfing to see the &quot;overpowered&quot;ness fade.<br />
<br />
     At any rate, I'm sure we can purse an intellectual conversation over the Paladin abilities as a whole, pro and con rather then the &quot;Shaman slow is sick, nerf!&quot;...I'm sorry, bad flashback. I mean &quot;Paladins are sick, nerf!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Warriors can solo iinm.<br />
<br />
The problem stems from asshats like furor who think they need to be Conan the Barbarian mixed with Kurghan.  They want to outdamage everybody, have no downtime and resist all spells all the time. (yes I'm exaggerating - but not by much).<br />
<br />
THEN when their place in the food chain is threatened they whine and talk about needing &quot;love.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sympathy for Warriors. You don't like the class in WoW? Roll the fek up something else.<br />
<br />
These are ridiculous comments.  I've stated before, if you don't play a warrior, please refrain from commenting on the state of the class.  If anything, I don't know how Furor could sit back and watch how bad warriors have become.  I thought with an insider like that, things would get better but I guess being a &quot;quest&quot; guy doesn't allow for the influence.  I remember Furor's write-ups on warriors way back when and they sounded great.  They are not so great anymore. Warriors can hardly do what they are supposedly designed to do... mediocre dps at best and extreme difficulty in gaining and maintaining aggro.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I love the brilliant arguments like &quot;don't like it, pick a different class.&quot;  Just brilliant.  Just like everything on the WoW forums.  Complain about the free mounts for warlocks and pallies and you are met with &quot;go make a warlock or pallie then.&quot;  Complain how paladins are too powerful and get &quot;go make a paladin then.&quot;  Profound, really, it is.<br />
<br />
PvE, yeah I do ok.  I can mostly solo one mob that is my level.  If I get lucky and use a potion, I can take something 1 level higher maybe.  But PvP is just sick... warriors are not very good unless you are fighting someone way lower than you.  My experience with PvP so far has been as follows.  Gaggle of Alliance decides to pick on Tarren Mill or Crossroads (or insert any other lowbie area that they for some reason think it will be fun to kill quest npc's and such).  Gang of Horde comes to defend.  A lot of standing around looking at each other, someone gets bored and decides to charge someone and gets jumped by 20 people and instantly annihilated.  Fun stuff.  So when I PvP, it's never one on one, I usually go after someone and end up ganged up on by 5 or 6 others and dead.<br />
<br />
I will say this.  Fighting casters as a warrior is tough unless you get a jump on them with a stun of some sort.  No matter how much AC I have (currently around 4500ish with a shield), it doesn't help me versus dots or nukes.  Not at all.  So, fight a mage and it goes like this.  Charge him and stun him, start whacking him... mage wakes up and roots me then blinks, then nukes the **** out of me... me dead.  Fight a priest and he dots me, runes himself, heals himself, nukes me, dots me... me dead.  Pummel and other stuns do not last that long (like 4 seconds) and the refresh is such that I can't just spam it.  So inevitably they can get their spells off.<br />
<br />
And frankly, I don't see AC doing that much for me in PvE combat either.  And plate offers no special mitigation over mail.  The only advantage of plate is that ultimately, plate items can give you a higher AC value.  But I've &quot;eyeballed&quot; it with shield versus no shield (1500 ac difference) and I can see no real difference between how much damage I am taking or how often I am hit.  Maybe someone with a parser can prove otherwise.<br />
<br />
So there are too many things to list that are wrong with warriors.  As I said, please don't comment if you don't play one, you just look ignorant.  Read the warrior forums if you wish to know the details.  I won't go into the issues of miss rates, useless talents, no hp advantage over other classes, dubious nature of AC, inability to generate rage, high rage cost of special moves, crappy taunting skills, poor threat generation etc.  The list goes on.<br />

Sorry I got into this conversation late, but just noticed this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I think warriors are great in PvE.  I love having a warrior in my gorup, they barely take any damage doing instances.  However, they do need a PvP boost.  Something that does not improve their already balanced tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't bad in group PvP either.   It's great to have someone who can charge into a large group of alliance and start the fight.<br />
<br />
One thing I agree with.  My wife plays a priest and she agrees that on the rare occasions when I DO actually have aggro in an instance, I don't take as much to heal.<br />
<br />
Problem is getting that aggro and keeping it for longer than 1 second.  The other two regular groupmates are a shaman and another shaman or a rogue.  I can't get aggro off of those guys at all.  I can't get aggro off the priest either after she heals me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">And frankly, I don't see AC doing that much for me in PvE combat either.  And plate offers no special mitigation over mail.  The only advantage of plate is that ultimately, plate items can give you a higher AC value.  But I've &quot;eyeballed&quot; it with shield versus no shield (1500 ac difference) and I can see no real difference between how much damage I am taking or how often I am hit.  Maybe someone with a parser can prove otherwise.<br />
I can't believe you don't notice the difference.  Since I recently got the SM shield the difference in damage reduction between shield and no shield or plate vs. mail is huge.  I don't know how you tank in instances but we pull like we did in LDON- huge pulls.  It's not uncommon for me to have 5+ on me at any one time.  That mitigation and shield blocking is working nonstop and you shouldn't have to parse to notice it.  Our priest has switched to shadow dps mode after I got plate and started using a shield in our instance runs- it's made that much difference.  Just equipping that SM shield took my mitigation 41 -&gt; 52%. Insane.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there are too many things to list that are wrong with warriors.  As I said, please don't comment if you don't play one, you just look ignorant.  Read the warrior forums if you wish to know the details.  I won't go into the issues of miss rates, useless talents, no hp advantage over other classes, dubious nature of AC, inability to generate rage, high rage cost of special moves, crappy taunting skills, poor threat generation etc.  The list goes on.<br />
<br />
I play paladin main, warrior as our tailor/enchanter alt.  I rue the day I rolled a warrior in retail (played warrior in beta).  I'm working him towards artisan tailor but I can barely take logging him in even with full rested exp.  The only thing that has made him fun so far is dual wield- he's pure fury spec so far as he will not be instance tanking unless paladins are destroyed as a class in PVE.<br />
<br />
As bad as warriors are, however, I'd give up just about anything off my paladin to get an ability that gives flat 10% dmg redution and a taunt ability.  Not holding aggro well is a huge Achilles heel for paladin main tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well, that taunt ability in defensive stance lasts for precisely one millisecond.<br />
<br />
I do think it's possible with a group of ex-EQ'ers that understand aggro to have a warrior hold aggro pretty well.  This is if and only if, they let the warrior do his thing and establish aggro before they attack, just like in EQ.<br />
<br />
If I go in and battle stance, charge, demo shout, switch to defensive stance, sunder armor, sunder armor, sunder armor, sunder armor... and THEN the rest of the group joins in, then things are probably ok.  As it is, the shamans cast their high threat nukes, the priest has to heal them because they can't take the beating, she gets aggro... ping pong starts, etc.<br />
<br />
So, establishing and maintaining aggro isn't automatic.<br />
<br />
I too have the shield from SM.  I have a 3k+ AC without it.  I really can't tell a difference.  Certainly not to the point where our priest can switch to shadow spec hehe.  Also, no difference with plate other than, like I said, the plate items have higher ac on them.  But then again, as I've mentioned, the priest definitely notices a difference when I am tanking rather than the shaman.  I dunno, I'll test it again, you're probably right.<br />
<br />
We typically only fight 3 at a time, possibly with a couple adds later in the fight.  Seemed like that was what was laid out in SM.  Zul'Farruk was the same way, bunch of 3 pulls.  But we usually only have a group of 4 of us for instances.  Certaintly haven't had any trouble in them, but we are typically kind of careful with pulling (usually highest level pulls since low level aggro in this game is outrageous).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Meh...blah blah. I don't get it with the &quot;nerf paladins&quot; calls.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I used to dread the long fights against paladins, but post-40, they really aren't a challenge anymore.  In fact, I find them rather easy - they are just a one-trick pony.  They can't do anything but close melee.  <br />
<br />
They don't have much mana, I can mana burn through their very shallow mana pools.  Then all they are is a gimpy warrior with no range.  I heal when they do, and I have a lot more mana, fear and shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">First, paladins are not overpowered. They have simply a designed role what they fulfill well, but outside of that role, the paladin has huge limits. In PvP fights or PvE even, the paladin goal is to outlast the enemy, because paladins just don't pack the punch. By all means the warrior kills the same mobs much faster, the difference here is that the paladin can heal himself/herself, while warrior can't. At the same time, the warrior has special abilities which allow to do more damage and also give various effects. Albeit they last tad too little.<br />
<br />
Some wrote here &quot;what's the point of having a warrior in Alliance when there's the paladin?&quot; - there is a point. No matter what, the tank in PvE is the warrior and not the paladin. In higher end instances and raids the warriors are wanted way more then paladins. Paladins don't tank as well neither heal well enough. In PvP of course that doesn't matter. Lack of ranged damage and/or closing the distance between the opponent is a downside to both, warrior and paladin alike. Paladin will last longer due to spells, but in the end, if the opponent has any idea what to do and keeps the distance, the paladin would lose. Best bet for paladin in cases like that is to just leave the fight.<br />
<br />
But don't make the mistake by assuming that the paladin has little manapool. I play paladin and at level 50 I have about 3000 HP and about the same manapool. Even tad above HP. It all comes down to balancing the stats and enchantments. Sure it is not as high as the manapool of some priest or mage, but it's still good enough. With various gear I also have bonuses to my heals, which means that I can use even lower level heals (which take less mana) and still heal nicely. Also, one of the Blessings what the paladins can cast increases the efficiency of the heals, thus again allowing to use lower level, lower mana costing heal for bigger effect. Also, depending on the paladin specialization, there are ways to reduce the cost of healing spells, or get additional damage means. For example, my paladin has the Consecration talent, basically this is PBAoE effect which damages anyone on the area close to the paladin. It's not a very huge damage, the Rank 3 of it deals some 200 or more damage, but it deals it fast. So if paladin reaches someone and manages to force them to stay on spot, by using stuns and seals to do it, that additional kick can be used for additional damage. Other Blessings coming from talents allow to absorb the damage. But, again, there is nothing what the paladin can use over the range from his/her class arsenal to deal with those at the distance.<br />
<br />
So if you're a class who has remote damage means, use it and keep the distance (mage types, hunters, priests). If you're a DPS close combat class like rogue, then most likely your high and fast DPS may turn the tides, if the paladin doesn't know how to really act in that situation, in that case it comes down to experience and gear and such :) If you're a warrior, then going solo against the paladin who knows what to do is definately not a smart thing, you may use your Mortal Strike to reduce healing effects for a time and such, but all in all the paladin who knows what to do will kill the solo warrior. But, not all paladins out there do know, a lot - if not most - are just bandwagon jumpers and easy targets. <br />
<br />
However, in some large scale battles what the upcoming Battlegrounds will perhaps bring things may get interesting and will take coordination from both sides. Having 2 sides clash with large forces should be fun and give all classes the chance to shine - warriors get the backup healing they lack and can focus on their work instead of survival, paladins can focus on their work instead of worrying too much about closing the distance and so on. Who knows what will be then the fights between the Horde warriors and Alliance paladins, when both have the support of their sides :)</div></div><hr />

PvP is suppossed to be designed in WoW around the rock, paper scissors principle.  The Paladin can survive, that's their schtick (or however you spell it), but can't really pound out the damage, so you, as the opponent, survive longer.  The Horde has no class built for survival like that, but that doesn't make the paladin invincible.  The shaman can be an effective counter to a paladin if played well.  Purge drops the seals, and frostshock counters the melee advantage of the paladin, by keeping them at range.  A well played shaman, given space to run, or given good tactics and coordination in mass PvP should send the pali packing.  That said, in mass PvP the paladin should be your last target as they will last longer and do less damage AND if they heal they'll soak their thin mana pools.  Kill the casters first.</div></div><hr />

avoid them, make the Paladins heal other players. Either deal with them last, or hit them with massive power, and ignore them when they shield.<br />
<br />
Have not ran into more than a couple in a group, I do forsee problems with many of them, they could easily, easily charge into a group of 25 horde, and wreck a few casters before safely getting away.

<br />
PVP pallies run seal of command, which has a roughly 7% chance to proc an extra attack which is done as holy damage so it completely ignores armor.  This attack can crit as well, but it can also be blocked, parried or dodged.  Also because it's holy it can be modified by spells/effects that increase holy damage (e.g. judgment of crusader, sanctity aura).  If you get lucky and get a melee crit + a command proc + command crit you can do massive burst damage, but that's not a common occurrence.<br />
<br />
In PVE you only run command (pre upcoming seal of crusader nerf) on big damage, high delay weapons or if you like seeing the big numbers.  Post nerf it will prolly be the de facto seal for 2h PVE pallies as well as PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I see no need to panic when facing paladins on Battlegrounds (yes, me being a paladin is saying this). Paladins alone will not win the battles, it takes the effort of the whole team, whole army. Paladins are nice bonus to Alliance, but so are the shamans to Horde, so I'd say that it really evens out. I believe that it might be quite spectacular battles between 2 well organized sides, which are fun to watch and participate, but luckily no side has such a distinct advantage, which would make them certain winners. Paladins are not such &quot;tickets&quot; to the victory for the Alliance.<br />
<br />
As for the Battlegrounds battles, then as a paladin, I can assure you that it would not work to force me to heal the group. I would not be in the role of the primary healer in large scale battles, for that Alliance has priests and druids, like Horde does. Sure the paladin can throw in a backup heal in critical situation, but I would definately not blow my mana on heals and it would be not wise to think that paladins will perform the role of the healers in such battles. Definately not. Sure, paladind doesn't really pack mega DPS either, so wouldn't be a strike force, but that's not the goal, the goal of the paladin would be to move on with the strike force and hold the ground. I would see paladins in the assault force just for that role, to hold the line/ground while the DPS classes do the damage. I'd also see paladins in defense positions - in main keeps, in sentry towers, resource area guard teams.<br />
<br />
But, no, do not take it for the granted that the paladins will spend their mana on heals in such battles, there are other classes who's job it is. And there will be plenty of opportunities for paladins and shamans in cases as such to show, what they really can do :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point you are missing, is that massed paladins simply cannot be killed, and all the while they are doing damage.<br />
<br />
Their shields need to only absorb a certain amount of damage, not timed immunity.<br />
<br />
I never played a Paladin because I knew they were severely overpowered, and simple to play, and that the Alliance would have a huge population advantage, all of which is true. People take the path of least resistance usually, Paladin is that path.<br />
<br />
Shaman are powerful too, but, they can be killed in the blink of an eye, like 6-8 seconds by a good rogue, hunter, mage, a Paladin cannot. Shaman have an unreal amount of skills/spells they need to use to be effective, totems, spells, etc. And they only have one life.<br />
<br />
there are very talented Pallies out there, i would be willing to bet most people from this board are among them. But I just get sick of seeing pallies everyone knows are dumbasses charging into a group of 60's and immuning, and the group not being able to do anything.<br />

Sorry Mill, but please, NO!  Shaman are balanced as we are and we should be able to own pallies in 1v1 PvP, but in mass PvP I can see how Pallys have a big edge.  The shaman forums are filled with nerf frostshock and nerf shaman threads, mostly posted by clueless tards who don't know how to play their class.  Getting plate will only make this worse, plus I honestly don't think it fits.<br />
<br />
And the horde does not have a valid off tank.<br />
Well, you're totally right here as far as the end game goes. Shaman off-tank well only to certain points which vary depending what gear is available to your playstyle.  After that a shaman is little more than a speedbump.  My guild's top shaman mostly plays on a PvE server now because everytime he shows up for PvP the PAlliance targets him first because he's a shaman and in instances he can't off tank hard hitting mobs.  That said, I'd sooner see a different approach to fixxing this like seeing horde races get rage building bonuses, that would obviously only affect the warrior class.  That would give horde warriors a boost (one I think is deserved) and help out the faction as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. Paladin charging a group like that can indeed shield up for almost 20 seconds, using 2 different invulnerabilities (single self only and targettable for group members) and if has LoH up, can win additional seconds by using it. After that the paladin is dead. And know what? That paladin can't even do anything at all within those &quot;20 seconds of glory&quot;. First invulnerability what paladin would use in such case will let paladin attack at 50% speed rate. Considering that the paladins are already at the bottom of the DPS chain, what do you think is the paladins DPS when they can attack only at 50% of speed? Even newbie rogue/mage/hunter/whatever has more DPS.<br />
<br />
Second invuln, the targettable group one, will prevent the paladin from doing any action at all. Complete immunity with complete restriction of actions hostile actions. Can only heal someone and considering the time of casting for healing spell, the invuln wears off by the time the heal goes off. Single heal hardly makes things unbalanced. And then that wears off and paladin has only LoH ready, which drains all of the mana. And that's that. All what that paladin just did is run into certain death and managed to survive for 20 seconds and shine like a candle with all the auras around him/her. Anyone fron Horde side with any brains would just ignore that glowing fella and move on, because that glowing fella can't do a jack while he/she glows. And as soon as the glow is gone, he can be killed easily, if he charged, as you said, into the enemy mass.<br />
<br />
Your example above about 5 paladins charging the fortification and surviving, while shamans can't do it - come on :) Only edge what those 5 paladins would have in that situation is that they can blow out their invuln spells for another &quot;20 seconds of glory&quot; and have decent AC due to plate mail. Rest is same as with shamans: paladins can heal each other - so can shamans; both can use best shields to get additional AC boost; paladin DPS sucks so bad that they wont even be able to do much in that fort, most likely shamans would cause even bigger mayhem then paladins with their multiple totems and own DPS (which probably is even better then paladin DPS, heh). And heal each other as needed. Sorry, but in that example the edge what paladins have is only marginal and will mean nothing, both teams would have equal chances, with paladins perhaps surviving somewhat longer (but not necessarily, as shamans have higher mana pools generally) due to some class perks. But making any difference with such an act? No, the paladins would make no difference and would not beat the fort down and would end up just as 5 paladin ghosts, after causing pretty much minimal strife.<br />
<br />
1 on 1? Shaman are great, no question. Row often does 1 on 1 happen on a pvp server? Rare, for every shaman out there there are two pallies + friends.<br />
<br />
So how does this fit with the &quot;nerf paladins&quot; claims? It's PvP server for crying out loud, obviouly you will rarely find 1-on-1 situations there. Have you never been playing the PvP games before? Whole MENTALITY of PvP server enviroment is 'get a team and find hapless silly chaps who were stupid enough to go out alone and gank them big time'. Just get your own team, take a hunter per paladin and done. Paladins have really no chance against ranged attackers in random encounters like this. They will survive for a while due to heals - just like shaman does or any healer who has heals and knows when to cast them - but not for long. Paladins can't do much at all over the range, and only range means what they have is a single bolt (if they spec in one talen tree, fully), which has short range, does small damage and takes bloody 30 seconds to cool down (basically, just a limited pulling NPC tool). Where's the problem here? And moreso, where the heck is there a need to nerf paladins?<br />
<br />
Now to pve, how long can a shaman tank a level 60 elite mob? How long can a Paladin? Want to compare the auction houses on the alliance and horde side? We are out equipped the majority of the time.<br />
<br />
Eh, I can't. Sorry to dissapoint, but fighting an elite mob of equal level to me means that I MUST have top notch gear. Which in most cases doesn't happen, there's always something which is weak. Paladin DPS sucks so bad that it will take a day to kill such elite mob. At the same time, the mob will smack at the paladin pretty hard, even with all the defense. Which means pretty frantic healing and if the paladin has small manapool and has not taken talens which help to reduce mana cost and give some chance to get mana back, the paladin will go down fast. With well planned talens and really really good gear, the paladin would be perhaps able to survive for a while and who knows, if he/she knows what to do and when, perhaps even win. After an hour (and even that with certain, very few mobs). During this same amount of time, you shaman + warrior have killed few tens of such mobs. All what this would do would be as it was in EQ, when shamans first soloed some dragons - it just showed the skill, which allowed to survive some tough encounter, after a very long battle, which in the end, on big scale, meant nothing - couple of other classes killed 10 mobs during that same time, and were better off. This would be basically something for what you could just pat yourself on shoulder and say &quot;I soloed lvl 60 elite&quot;, but nothing else.<br />
<br />
Basically, you have not played a paladin (which, btw, is not as easy as you imagine) and especially to higher levels. If you would have, then you'd see how full of BS are all these talks and claims. Exactly like the BS given to shamans in EQ from the people, who never played the shaman themselves. Claims in EQ to shamans were &quot;But you can slow!&quot;. In WoW, claims to paladins are &quot;But you can invuln yourself!&quot;. So? Since when, in both cases, only these things solved anything on their own?<br />
<br />
OK, the point of this longwinded reply is - don't assume anything and decide anything without knowing it from the personal experience. First, being a paladin is NOT easy and is actually pretty difficult at post 50 game. When the feature, the Battlegrounds, actually are in and you have actually tried it, you'll see that things are totally different. Sure, it is not easy to deal with a SKILLED paladin, just as it is not easy to deal with a SKILLED shaman. Use the means available for you to deal with paladin. There are potions which ABSORB Holy damage, the damage the paladin does. Get the sweet lil' bombs from engineers for extra burst of damage (amazing how people underestimage the bombs the engineers can make!), it's amazing how some well placed bomb blasts can make your enemy panic and turn the tide. Learn the weaknesses of the paladins - there are weaknesses, paladins are not invincible juggernauts - and use them agains the paladin. Remember the single most biggest weakness of the paladin - no range attack. Just because you can't beat the paladin in straight melee (since shaman is not primarily a melee class, while paladin is; besides, it's not 100% certain that you can't beat paladin in melee) doesn't mean that paladin is so overpowered and you're so weak. It simply means that your class is meant for different course of action and has different tools at hand, use these.</div></div><hr />

What happens to the paladin when the shields wear off? Do they vanish or sprint and elude you? I'm curious how a rogue, the most powerful class in the game and who can disengage at will, loses to a class with no ranged or escape abilities?<br />

they are back to their group, awaiting the pull. Disengage at will? Your pvp inexperience is showing again. Any class worth a damn, but for pallies lay a dot on a rogue, always, makes vanish useless. You still have aoe stun though.<br />

8 Seconds at 60 with a 1 minute refresh.  That may seem like an eternity, but in all honesty it's enough time to stop * ONE * opponent from beating on you long enough to channel a heal and a potion or one divine heal.<br />
<br />
Not to rag on you Mill, but if you're calling for nerfs to Paladins and you don't understand or know their spells, or haven't played one, then something is amiss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I don't want to, neither plan to point a finger at you either Mill. I understand that it may not be always easy to be a shaman in WoW, because the WoW shaman and EQ shaman are different (albeit both are good classes), but you are still way off about paladins. Not only you. I'd really suggest to play the class first, up to the high levels, and then say bad things about it or call the nerfs. Reading the stuff people say what paladins can do makes me, paladin, often raise a brow and think &quot;***, me being a paladin and I never knew that I can solo own whole Horde army!&quot; or any other 'legend' people make up about paladins. Most of your thoughts here are also 'legends', btw.  Sure it's good when your enemies see you as this, makes them fear you and all that propagandistic cumbayaa, but that's that, propaganda.<br />
<br />
Trying to match a paladin in straight melee is not what the shaman is meant for. Melee for the shaman in WoW is a  backup means and shaman is decent with it, but by no means a primary mode for shaman, while melee is primary mode for paladins (albeit low DPS). And no, nowhere did I say that the paladin cannot melee. Paladin CAN melee, the difference is in DPS, where other classes have double the DPS on any day then the paladin does. Oh, and paladins have no DoT's which would prevent the rogue from stealthing. DoT's come from other classes and items, what everyone else can use just as paladins do, and paladins as a class have ZERO advantage here. Only special effect, and short range, is PBAoE spell which lasts for few seconds and can be avoided by anyone easily.<br />
<br />
Not gonna go into PvP details here, and I have had plenty of that experience myself. I have fought shamans and won and lost, so the shaman who knows what to do knows how to handle. And yes, paladins do have smaller manapool that other mana classes, because paladins are still foremost MELEE class and need to focus on few stats: good STR for damage, good STA for HP, good INT for mana, good SPR for regen. At least. Good AGI would be nice too for better AC and avoidance and chance to crit, but trying to keep even 4 stats in good balance is pretty difficult, not to mention 5. Focussing in one makes the rest weaker and paladin with huge manapool sucks in other stats and is worthless. Thus yes, main aim with stats is the melee related stats and rest have to be upped with the remaining options, which are not many.<br />
<br />
Basically, play one yourself, to the high end, and then talk about it :) I can just say, as a paladin who has also played shaman (and other classes), that you are misinformed about paladins and once you learn and understand their strengths and weaknesses, you will fare much better. Here, being the good person that I am, I'll give you a link to one site which has more data on class spells and abilities and talents, hopefully that will help you:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I admit it si probably wrong to wish a class nerfed. Perhaps it is simply the fact we are so outnumbered by hordes and hordes of screaming paladins, many of which are really stupid annoying people. You should see some of the people on our server. They run from anyone within 5 levels of them, but just love to wander around killing newbs, blah.<br />
<br />
And I really am tired of a Pally being able to pull all of the guards from a town, with complete invunerability, or run through a pack of horde with complete invunerability, just is silly.<br />
<br />
A 60 rogue should not need to chase a 37 pally halfway across the zone, using mount, sprint, etc to finally kill the little thing either, and that is how bad it is.<br />
<br />
Once again, shaman is great, in 1 on 1 pvp. When the battlegrounds come out, if ever, you will see Alliance probably kicking ass all the time because of their pve ability against our guards. few uber archers in a tower? Simple, shield up and charge. What would shaman do? Take massive damage on the way in from their lower ac.<br />
<br />
The ability for one class to survive for up to a half a minute, totally invunerable is just a little much. Why do you think so many people play Pallies? It is not the name, it is because it is a terrific all around class. Almost all of the chinese farmer people are Paladins as well, yet another thing that pisses us off. Aszshara was a  friggin Paladin den before the feather nerf.<br />

Self shield = 12 secs, shield other (which does not stop spells) is 10 secs = 22 secs melee shielded.  Against mages, shadow priests, shaman, hunters and druids a paladin has a whopping 12 secs of invulnerability. Go paladins!<br />
<br />
Almost all of the chinese farmer people are Paladins as well, yet another thing that pisses us off.<br />
Which just goes to show what idiots these people are.  Why would you choose the lowest dps class in the game to farm mobs with?  And even against undead, full dps spec'd with sweet weapon I cannot come close to rogue kill rate. I duo'd with my crew rogue in Aszhara and Plaguelands- forget about it.  He does 3 to my 1.  Post nerf I am willing to be he can do 4 or 5 to my 1 now.<br />
<br />
Chinese farmer anecdote: I ran into one of these assclowns farming the undead in Aszhara (rogue of course).  He tried to duel me then taunted me and spit on me, etc. So I just targeted him, hit /f and put him on follow. I then made an assist macro for him.  He'd run around, target an undead, I fire off my undead nuke and then let him kill the mob for me.  Then I'd loot.  This went on for quite awhile before he figured it out, it was pretty funny.<br />
<br />
It got more fun when he started ratcheting up the cursing.  Then I got to play a game that I call &quot;Fear Pong&quot;.  I let him engage an undead, then make sure I position myself such that I can fear his mob into another pack of undead.  After eating a death he decided to leave me in peace.  The joys of a PVE server...</div></div><hr />

Could always tell the farmers, because they were absolutely awful in pvp, and would run right back and keep farming no matter how many times you kill them.<br />

I ran into one of those Chinese folks in Winterspring farming the Undead. I think his script was messed up because first he invited me to his group. I joined thinking it may be a lowbie needing help with a quest. Nope, 60 Rogue.<br />
<br />
Then when they didn't answer two questions I disbanded. Here's where it gets weird.<br />
<br />
For about 45 minutes they would follow me doing nothing. Once in awhile they would assist me on a MOB, but mostly just stand around.<br />
<br />
They would also open multiple trade windows but put nothing in there. Oh and kept attempting to re-invite me to a group.<br />

On Sargeras we keep a list, each faction discloses farmers on their faction for the other side to gank, informed members of the other faction generally agree not to step in during these fights.  It's one of the few areas we can mostly agree to.  The only major issues at this point is someone gets screwed out of loot in a party and identifies another faction mate as a farmer, but word of mouth usually fixxes this.</div></div><hr />

Well Iz, it'll be good to see another friendly face, especially another former EQ shaman.  Look for Tarhorn.<br />
<br />
A few notes on Sargeras, while there is a strong carebear movement it's still a vicious server, especially for lowbies.  Every night the lvl 20-30 towns get smoked and there is little response from the horde.  When the horde organises the alliance gets owned mostly, but mostly we don't organise.  The horde side has it's share of stupid drama, but not nearly as bad as the Alliance.  Currently the horde outnumbers the alliance, but it's really close and you wouldn't know it from looking at the world defense channels.  Sometimes high lvls from both side meet in the STV arena or some other place of choice for duels and group vs group combat.  Mostly when this happens it's friendly with people using MC to have fun (last week some guy went AFK and the horde MCed him and dragged him to the top of the continent all along the shoreline).  Do not attack the alliance in the arena during an event (you will be ganked, maybee even CCed and no one will help you).  The server is heavily populated and on some nights it's almost unplayable.  The AH is seriously screwed recently, don't put items in there until they stabalise it.  Also, there are some establised gank zones where you should expect to die (the dorf NPC everyone wants you to see in STV is camped by alliance rogues, Booty bay ...).  It's a good community though, and one of the few balanced servers population wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Paladins by far are the closest thing to EQ Shaman in WoW.  No question about it.  <br />

That is why I play one and we already got nerfed why nerf palies into oblivion? Is it just some sort of blinded rage that is fueling this on all boards I go to?  I thought the Crucible would be different.  Palies are by far the worst dps of ALL classes at 50+... it is really after 40 that we start going downhill.  I say nerf rogues they are way overpowered... but I wont be serious about it because calling for a nerf on a class you have never played or dont even know the abilities on is a tard move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Hroth,<br />
<br />
the general concensus is that pallies are overpowered in pvp, because they are so damned hard to kill. I still do not believe the dps numbers, at least not in pvp, I get hit for 300-500 all the time and have to bandage and/or potion to win a fight, if it ever lasts that long. I have seen Paladins crag about 1200 damage crits on many occasion, fasle?<br />
<br />
Rogue is one of the fastest classes in the game to kill, provided you get the jump, and in group pvp, you often will. We are design to jump, a well played almost of any class will not just die, they have a perfectly good chance. Most people die to rogues simply because they do not have the hps, a bad, bad pvp mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Mill I see your point but Palis do have downsides as well.  They may be hard to kill but they are not going to kill anyone with ease either.<br />
<br />
I started a rogue and a shaman recently just to see what all this fuss was about and although it is low in the pvpin right now but that little rogue owns where my pali just cant or couldnt at that level.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being civil at least in your reply to me.  My pali has gotten boring as I cannot with any regularity cause level dps and palis dont have alot of abilities to make combat exciting.  I am just a healer in plate handing out BoKs.<br />
<br />
Anyways ill go back to my mace rogue.  So far he can take out mobs faster and easier than my pali could.  Well non undead ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I've got to admit, I've always seen pallies as closer to bards than shaman, especially in their first iteration before they became what they are now.  People hated bards in PvP, because they could never seem to kill them, but at the same time, it was a pretty rare situation where a bard could kill someone else.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between surviving and winning, and so many people don't seem to see that distinction.  A paladin has great survivability, it's true, but their capability to win is nowhere near as high.  Frankly, the people that are screaming 'Nerf Paladins' all talk about how they are so hard to kill, but you know what, they never seem to talk about how a paladin 'owned' them in combat; it's all complaints about how they just took so damn long to die.  Think about that for a bit.</div></div><hr />
