At least you arent on CET or GMT time. Try having the patches go through the middle of the day starting at 11am or Noon and last til 5 or 6 pm. Oh and when they have those 8-10 hours patches days that end just as you are getting off work, People in CET pretty much are lucky to play an hour or two before bed. I imagine it's worse for those in Asia since their patch times start during Prime Time. I feel sorry for the high end Asia guilds that have to quit a Time instance or GoD during Prime Time just for a stupid patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Currently, somewhere out there in the enormous internet, there are some level 3 problems which are affecting a great deal of internet services.  Some of you folks may have difficulty connecting to EverQuest until these problems are resolved.  We hope that these issues are resolved quickly so that you can log on and continue your EQ experience.<br />
