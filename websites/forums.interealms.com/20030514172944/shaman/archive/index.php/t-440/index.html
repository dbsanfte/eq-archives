<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sabore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know Kirns spawn time is?  Lookin' to maybe get a couple pieces during a raid I'm doing, but heard 4 hours and heard 2 hours.  Lookin' to find out for sure.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4 hrs. Don't  forget to kill the pet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if the pet isn't killed, Kirn won't respawn until you have a patch or server outage.  People that leave the pet up screw other shaman.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi guys; decided to pop over from The Glade and get a little help from y'all . . . my guild is in process of setting up a Hole raid to work on Ranger and Shaman epics.  I've *heard* that the spawn time on High Scale Kirn has been changed to 15 minutes, allowing for multiple Shamen to complete this portion of their epic in one raid.  Can any of you confirm or deny this?  We have I think 5 Shamen who need to complete the step and it'd be really nice to do it all in one go.<br />
<br />
On a related note, would 2 groups mid-50's be sufficient to take Kirn out or would we be better advised to have 3 groups?  FWIW, we'll have a 55+ Warrior and a 59 Cleric with us, if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all input.  :)</div></div><hr />

Can't confirm the spawn time.  I'd be surprised if they had done it.  That would essentially make the epic farmable, and they don't like seeing that many epics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It certainly makes it easier, but essentially farmable?  I dunno. :confused: <br />
<br />
The Spiroc Lord in Sky (drops a Warrior FA piece) can be set up such that it spawns instantly after it dies.  I'm very sure this doesn't make the Warrior FA farmable. :eek:<br />
<br />
It would be terrific if they reduced the spawn time on Kirn.</div></div><hr />
