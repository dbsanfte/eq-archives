Are beastlord/enchanter slows overwritten by BON if their slow is cast first and ours second? <br />
<br />
If BON is cast first, and a beastlord/enchanter tries to slow after the mob is slowed, do they get a &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; message? <br />
<br />
Situation: I was slowing a Sol Ro mini raid (I believe it was Jiva or Xuzl) and had a beastlord who insisted BON was &quot;not a good enough slow&quot; (yes, direct quote). The beastlord kept slowing after BON landed, but I never got a spell overwrite message. He slowed ahead of me a couple of times, and I landed BON almost immediately after his slow stuck ... I asked him about it later, and he said he never saw his slow wear off.<br />

Meh?<br />

Yes.  Balance overwrites every slow, just like Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">p.s. I think the beastlord had his ego bruised and was trying to bruise yours back.  I wouldn't sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both Turgurs and BoN over write my beastlords slow.  Not sure about tigirs. Sounds like the beastlord was ego trippin to me. <br />
<br />
On my bst I preslow if the shamans are busy with other mobs. I dont know what he meant by &quot;not enough slow&quot; hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Overwriting is based on % slowed by which is why turgurs and balance will over write each other. Any other slow will be overwritten by them and will not take hold if they are on the mob. Balance is for all intensive purposes turgurs with a resist mod, faster cast time and shorter duration. Nothing else changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the BST is thinking of the original incarnation of Balance of Nihil that was only 60%, compared to the BST's Sha's Revenge which is 65%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Confirmed:  Sha's Revenge is overwritten by Turgur's and Balance of the Nihil.  It will not overwrite them.<br />
<br />
If you run a log, just go back and see whether the critter &quot;loses its fighting edge&quot; after you've made it &quot;slow down.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The BST was either lying or stupid (or both).<br />
BST slows are overwritten by Turgur and Nihil.<br />
If he said his wasn't being overwritten, he's lying.<br />
If he said his would overwrite yours, he's lying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think he's just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If hes one of the typical beastlords on our server Tordail, hes got a serious E-penis problem...dont sweat him. Take care bro and see ya :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fancy sharing the name please Tordail, so I can avoid him on Karana? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And yet, this is common in several beastlords I've run across recently.  <br />
<br />
Then there are those who love screaming out slow messages - even if your slow landed first....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Weird... none of the beastlords in my guilds have such a hard-on about slowing. They'll slow on multiple pulls, just from a coverage/saturation principle, but none of them seem to have any problem with the fact that in those case, their slow is merely a stop-gap solution until a shaman get's around their target.<br />
<br />
They seem quite content with having 'merely' more useful bufsf than us (Ferocity, Paragon, Spiritual Dominion, Spiritual Vigor) and better damage output.<br />
<br />
None of them are ex-shamans that made Beastlords though, that I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks Shandy, I did go back through my log and found exactly the phrases you had posted ... I didn't see it in the raid spam since I have all stuff from everyone else (spells, melee, etc) filtered to a spam window I keep minimized. <br />
<br />
Yeah Gart, he was one of those who likes to pop a slow macro AFTER mine had landed ... of course, his was one of those paragraph long messages about how &quot;%T has felt the wrath of so-and-so and such-and-such and has now been slowed by so-and-so for 65%!!!!1!!111!&quot; ... which worked until I asked him in the raid channel why he felt like he had to spam the raid if his slow wasn't landing. It got quiet awful quick lol. :p<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Helfdane and Urdegish, this beastlord (who had already made two server transfers) was getting ready for a third one (or so I hear). You guys have been denied the pleasure of grouping with E-Penis Man! [insert theme song here]<br />
<br />
*wipes tears away*<br />
Oh, I crack me up. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">God I hope hes not coming to my server hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe reminds me of a Bertox raid we did a while back. I was the only shaman present to slow during the whole event so one of the beastlords sends a tell asking if I minded her helping on slows. I tell her sure, knock yourself out.<br />
<br />
So raid starts. The way Bert works is basically the puller constantly trains us with anywhere from 5 - 7 mobs at a time for about an hour with a few nameds sprinkled in for flavor.(you know what I'm talking about if you've been there). I'm having a blast slowing left and right and throwing the occasionnal heal when about 2 thirds of the way through the event I get a tell ....<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nuts, how the hell are you keeping everything slowed ! I can barely keep up with the pulls.&quot;<br />
<br />
That just made my day  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hehe, yeah, there have been times where I get into that same situation with being the only shaman and having 10 mobs inc all at once.  Usually I just keep hitting everything.  Having TA and Balance is really nice for these times, don't burn though hardly any mana and able to keep up with the slowing without slowing down.  <br />
<br />
My beastlords are good about slowing.  All of them are in the shaman channel so they help slow when they know I'm the only one there or there are a lot of mobs.  Typically I never call slows in raid cjat unless it's on something who's rotation depends on it getting slowed asap (like quarm).  If I'm the only shaman on, I don't call them either just cause I don't feel like spamming the bsts.  They know I will do my job without having to spam them about it.</div></div><hr />

Same with my guild actually. Many of them like using their slow not for the slow component but as a way to pull an add to offtank.</div></div><hr />
