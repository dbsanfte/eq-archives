<p><b> Rough estimates on Hawk &amp; Falcon Eye accuracy increases</b></p>

<p>Mainly to see if the rumor of 'Falcon Eye acts the same as Eagle Eye' was true.  Doesn't seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
<U>Test: How does Hawk and Falcon Eye increase Archery Accuracy?</U><br />
<br />
Short: Hawk, <B>about 2%</B>; Falcon, <B>about 7%</B><br />

<p>Hawk Eye does sort of look like a crap buff now, but then again, for it to be useful at the level it is achieved it would almost need to be unbalancing.  Still, it does give a Ranger a slight edge in Archery compared to a Warrior of equivalent level, which I spose is sorta the point, if you look at it a certain way (Rangers being the best Archers in the game).<br />
<br />
Falcon Eye looks to be a good stand in til Eagle Eye, at least.  I'm not sure what sort of increase in damage that Accuracy improvement may net on Trueshot (not having the Disc myself, yet), but it would be interesting to see. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Thanks for the excellent analysis of all three buffs <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>LOL, i've yet to meet a warrior with even 150+ skill in archery <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
Let alone compare to a Ranger of equal lvl, for some reason all the warriors i have met [ respect as well ]  envy most rangers maxxed archery skill, mostly its cause most of them have an idol in the ranger and just pull once, but also thier dex is horrible. But i must comment very nice test, , hehe i'll be the first to say it what about eagle eye?<br />
EDIT <br />
DOH just read the next post <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
i'll be reading that too, execellent work <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Greetings,<br />
<br />
Browsed the Luclin Strategy guide at Best Buy the other day, it had Hawk Eye marked as a 10% increase in archery hits buff.<br />
<br />
Aye, alot of times items printed in those books are incorrect, but thought I would post what was printed.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Guide might be correct, in a way.  From what I've seen, it is my guess that 6E is our Archery skill, so at level 15, when ya get Hawk Eye, max skill would be 80.  Adding 10 to that would be a 12.5% increase for that level.  The increase will be less as ya go up in level because you're adding a constant to a number that is increasing.<br />
<br />
In that respect, which is only my guess (but one with some evidence =P) is that at maxxed Archery (240) Hawk Eye would be a 4.17% increase, and Falcon Eye would be a 8.33% increase.  Those values fall within my estimated bound; and those would be good numbers to use when comparing all the Bird Eye spells with each other.</p>

<p>going to add my 2cp to this<br />
<br />
but when I have the hawkeye buff up I "seem" to have greater range.  I don't have any hard evidence on this, just going by eyeball. of course I am using a Runed Oak Bow and 150 range arrows, so I can damn near hit the horizon anyway.. <br />

just an observation  from a 37th Ranger hunting in EW.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I think greater range has already been disproven several times.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Has anyone posted a e-mail to The Rangers Glade admin so the new spells will be listed in the spells section.  I saw much of the information in these forums but I certainly do not want the credit that they give for the info.</p>
