<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was reading the latest issue of playboy today and it had an article about EQ in it.  <br />
Title of the article:  Online Treachery<br />
It talked about griefers and how people who have no lives play the game.<br />
It mentioned a guild Fires of Heaven in the article as stating that members must have no lives, will attend raids 8 hours a day, and will never quit.  I'll see if I can scan the article in or if someone can that would be cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impressive.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What did you tell the store clerk?  Uh..im buying it for...uhm..the game reviews?<br />
<br />
I on the other hand like to carefully scour the...information at hand, and most importantly the screen shots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Playboy has a lot more articles than it has nudie pix.  If I wanna see porn I'll get a real porn mag like Hustler.  <br />
<br />
EQ has been getting increasingly negative reviews in magazines and newspapers.  The BEST thing I've seen about it in print in the past year is that &quot;It makes a lot of money.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
Methinks there's a trend here.  Maybe I should wake the **** up and quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not sure what reviews you've been reading but Planes of Power just got a 90% in the latest PCGAMER.</div></div><hr />

PCGamer has obviously never played a character past level 50.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Playboy is a damn good magazine, of course because of hot chicks, but if you really know much about Hef, he is a damn visionary. One of the real true to his morals guy.<br />
<br />
My philosophy is, if your woman doesn't look good enough to be in playboy, keep searching. Only live once, and you should spend it with a chick who is hot.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it was HBO or not, but a documentary about Hef is cool. He does what he wants, with no guilt or shame. America needs to get over it's sexual prudeness(that a word?)<br />
<br />
Not all people that play EQ have no lives, not all people who read playboy have no lives, I think it is quite the opposite, most people who play games like EQ know exactly waht they want. Who the hell cares if you are outside prancing around in the flower garden or sitting in front of your computer? What is wrong with some personal sloth? As long as you stay in shape, screw them stupid anti-computer peeps.My woman bitches about me playing somtimes, yet she spends all day around horses, riding a horse isn't any better then playing a video game.<br />
<br />
Sorry if ramble,  massive hangover, played a 8 hour heroes game last night and pounded a solid 26 beers or so. OW. work sucks.<br />
<br />
brah</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D Good to see me and my friends aren't the only ones still enjoying drunken Heroes 3/4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Playboy is a great magazine. Beautiful women (Mill hit it on the head - beauty may be skin deep - ugly runs to the farking bone), average cartoons and often some fiction worthy of notice (Harlan Ellison among others has written for them).<br />
<br />
Their football picks usually sucked (Hey I'd be dstra - er disctract - er distracted too,) &quot;Huh? Holy Cross over Miami in football? Yeah sounds good.&quot; So they got some guest writers.<br />
<br />
Hustler, while more, ahem 'raw,' has some articles that seem out there until 6 months pass and then - whoa - he was right.  Remember this is the magazine that ousted Bob Livingstone amongst others during the Clinton Impeachment.<br />
<br />
Whether you disagree with him or not, I advise watching the movie &quot;The people versus Larry Flynt&quot; with Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. Oh btw, the judge in an early scene IS Larry Flynt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Somebody posted to our message board about the Playboy EQ article with the standard disclaimer &quot;of course, I only read Playboy for the articles&quot;.... my guildie's response was &quot;yeah, and I only eat Nestle Crunch for the rice!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">let me get this straight....there is someone here who would spend four bucks on playboy for either the pictures or the articles when you can see more flesh for free by typing sex in your browser search field?</div></div><hr />
