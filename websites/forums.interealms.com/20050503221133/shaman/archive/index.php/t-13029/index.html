<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have played my shammy for almost 2.5yrs, and the great social experiment of EQ is almost over for me.  I've been mostly a lurker, occassional poster on these boards over the past 2yrs, but have found it very entertaining (flame on johnny storm) and informative.  As I reflect on all the hours I happily wasted in front of the computer (even happier when i was drunk  :D ) I pause to ponder just what made me continue to play the shaman class.  I had played other classes: wizzie, war, monk, no class really held my attention for long.  I came to realize my love for the shaman class was not just because of the incredible versatility, independence, groupability, solo-ability, or bad-assness.  No, it was just plain FUN.  Even as I was runnin around in full cloth armor with my mighty splintering club at lvl 25, I was having a blast.  <br />
     At 61 I still appreciate the hell outta the shaman class.  We are more adept than any class (IMHO) at doing amazing things, and still be half mana to boot. However, I never appreciate my class more than when breezing through the nexus laughing at all the KEI krak whore addicts (hehe) dependent on some chanter to make them more effective.  Bah!  I can go 0-FM in around 5minutes, and that's without torpor. <br />
     The shaman class, of course, is not perfect.  Alchemy, worthless stat buffs, alchemy, spell drop rates, and alchemy are just a few of the obvious and legitimate gripes that concern us.  Despite the gripes, I still feel compelled to salute the original devs that laid the foundation for the shaman class, as I have taken much pleasure in their creation.  I also salute the crucible, as it has given all us who are endeared to our alter ego shammies a /rant outlet  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree whole-heartedly! *salutes*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I totally agree, before I started my shammy, I had played the game for a year, and gone through every other class in the game, and I was about ready to quit, but then I started feth... and SOE has been getting my money ever since :( hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After 2 years of playing a shaman and with an alchemy skill of 170 I STILL don't understand when people complain about alchemy..<br />
<br />
A few points, Alchemy is in NO WAY necessary to persuee, you won't get turned down for a group because your alchemy skill is to low, it is a BONUS given to the shaman class, I rember the old adage &quot;Don't look a gift horse in the mouth&quot; If you don't alchemy is fair or balanced, don't do it! I guarntee your shaman will not feel the slightest sting, because as you people have repeated over and over &quot;Its worthless&quot; Great, stop doing it.<br />
<br />
Personally nothing would make me smile more then to read a patch message &quot;Every class may now persue alchemy, stop bitching&quot;</div></div><hr />
