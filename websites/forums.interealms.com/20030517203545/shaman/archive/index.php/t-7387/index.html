<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is another of them &quot;Please help me upgrade&quot; tread so stop reading here if you dont like them. :)<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me with any upgrades? I just dinged lv59 and starting to see my goal at lv60. But I want to get my hp above 1924 so when I get canni5 I can survive it unbuffed.<br />
I also trying to get my AC above 1000.<br />
Money isnt really a problem. Is it possible with droppable items? My guild is atm doing HoT and we just recently started doing Trakanon so please dont suggest anything out of my league regarding No Drop items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have torpor?<br />
<br />
If so, loose fungi... get a SSbp a bit of HP on that and alot more AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Loose SBS...get OOIV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legs... get SS they have 50hp I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back Heiro Cloak<br />
<br />
Helm Slime Covered Rubicite Coif<br />
<br />
If you have torpor / cann 5 you don't need the ODS. Get a Peerless / Matchless dragonwing mantle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boots aren't good either... Barbed Dragonscale Boots<br />
<br />
<br />
Loiose velium fireweeding ring. get a djarn's.<br />
<br />
Get stat food (grobb meat and halas pies)<br />
<br />
<br />
That should boost your hp QUITE a bit probably putting you into your 2k1s or 2k2s I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get as much HoT armor as possible, BP and Greaves are the most important obviously.  Replace JB Helm with Barbarian Cultural helm at the very least.  Heirophant's Cloak for back slot as Suddail suggested.<br />

Here is my magelo.  Not the best but I still need couple of ugrades that I am wiating on drops.  Also dont know how much stuff you can aquire that is droppable and i thnk most of my stuff is no drop.  But take a look and see what can help.  Also 6 ac 65 hps rings help if you cant get this stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my best suggestion and it will have the most impact would be to get yourself a Vindi BP, it has stamina and 100hp's it would put you very close to what you are after and if your guild does HoT they should be easily able to do him.  I dunno how contested it is on your server however.  But also with your upgrades from the SS quest armor you will notice it should put you fairly close, i still wear most of the SS armors that i got from the quest.  Another suggestion is since you are allied with them you could get yourself the circlet of the falakin(sp) which is 70hps and mana head item quest from SS.  The hardest part is to get the silly worm in DN.<br />

Your Magelo looks very similar to my equipment, heheh. :)<br />
I looked over the suggestions offered, and while they are all sound, they may be out of your league/budget.  They are mine.<br />
<br />
A few items to think about:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16313<br />
You might not want to wear it full time, but you can for Canni5.<br />
The better torque drops off a much harder mob deeper inside POI, and is ac12, though you'll be fighting clerics for the better one, since it is also effect: Imp. Healing IV.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13333<br />
is what I'm wearing on my non-jbb wrist.  Another small AC hit for you, but the hp and saves make up for hit I think.<br />
<br />
This is the earring I'm searching for to replace my Twisted whatever Earring:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16449<br />
<br />
Good luck on your search!  Please reply back with any upgrades you find. ;)  We have identical gear in 14 spots, so I'd be interested in finding out what you switch to. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Konnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you expect a long wait on a HoT or Vindi BP, then Barbed Ringmail might be worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
Also if you haven't seen it check out Benevolence quest which starts in Skyshrine, though not sure if the recent changes to Harmony made it harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Check out my magelo in my Sig, I started from less HP than you have now, back in January when I got 60... and just finally broke 2400 hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Basically everything I have I have got with a single group, including my wolfcallers armor.<br />
<br />
and dont forget stat foods.  You can get a lot of HP/sta/wis/mana off them and they don't take up a slot.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Those are DAMN nice boots Henora :)<br />
<br />
Is it impossible to solo the PoM mobs needed for the cards for those?<br />
Or just damn hard?<br />
<br />
Doable with Cana 5? or needs some friends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you can solo in PoM , i did it just takes time and the drop are nerfet BIG time <br />
Btw you need to go tho Nwing in ToV an guild trip<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Im in the same kind of Guild as you are...<br />
<br />
Look at my Magelo! I cant semm to find any good buyable upgrades which are buyable for a reasonable amount of PP. Im looking to buy a Girdle of Mithaniel.<br />
<br />
Also you guys saying &quot;get a Vindi BP&quot; its not easy to get one even if the Guild can do it... There are usually several People who want such a &quot;Uber&quot; Bp (if you are in a guild like mine its Uber), and you need to have Tons of event Points to get an Item like this. I would love on too but i dont really think ill get one in the next time! Vindi is camped a lot cause SolRo is overpupulated, and when we wanted to try him we lost the race.<br />
