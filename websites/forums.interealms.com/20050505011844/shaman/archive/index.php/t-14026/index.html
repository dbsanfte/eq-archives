<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did the ring 10 war yesterday AGAIN and came up with a problem.  We got two waves popping in different places at the exact same time (first time I'd seen That one).  Three giants made it to the area in front of the waterfall, the Dorfs gave the &quot;our expected help didn't show&quot; message and 90% of the heros depopped (none actually fought the giants).  Thurg and Icewell also depopped, but the war continued.  We killed all the waves and got the head at the end.  However, as our member tried to turn the head in, the Dorf depopped.<br />
<br />
The GM's were no help at all.  They said that there was no info in the logs to help them determine if we finished the war successfully.  WHAT?  They can't see if the Seneschal died in the log?  They said to do the event again....   Now we've wasted over 100 manhours on a bugged event that a VT-enabled guild could do in their sleep, for nothing!  And they want us to try again, hope you have better luck?<br />
<br />
I used to find Furor vaguely entertaining, while cringing at the thought of being on the other end of his tells, but BS like this makes me want to get him to send the tells for THIS one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, we can't assist you in this matter further, please submit a /bug report.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A damned shame, as the Ringwar is by FAR the most fun event of the game, hands down, issue closed. <br />
<br />
The entire response from the GM smacks of laziness, if you ask me. Much like when GM's who used to de-pop a mob that guilds would fight over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was this on Cazaic-Thule yesterday?<br />
<br />
I was involved in my first one yesterday. Honestly, I'm not sure which part of it is 'fun'.<br />
<br />
I have a 1.5mb connection, and a top notch computer. I turned everything down to minimum and guess what? Unplayable lag. I mean to the point where I had to let go of my run button serveral seconds before I wanted to actually stop. There were 105 people in the zone.<br />
<br />
In the end I tried edging off to one side with my partner, but we had to join in the main fray as that was where the main pull was. Ugh.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, it was just a huge bunch of players all attacking waves of MOBs. Everyone attacked the Captain and the General even though apparently we weren't supposed to. Everyone camped the bodies for loot. A few good folks stayed at the back for random heals, but on the whole no one cared about anyone else.<br />
<br />
It was the least fun I've had in Everquest, hands down, issue reopened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">By the way, don't think the above post means I think they should stop doing Ring Wars. Other folks in the zone seemed to really enjoy it, so that's definitely a good thing.<br />
<br />
I just think those people have lost their minds, or are playing on a T1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lag is dependant upon so many different things, it just isn't funny. <br />
<br />
Trust me pal, the Ringwar with 40 people and no lag is one of the most challenging, action-packed and deleriously fun events I have ever partaken in, far as gaming goes. Winning a ringwar is like bowling a 300 game, hitting a grand slam home run or scoring with the boss' daughter. <br />
<br />
I loved the chaos. If the ringwar was done every night on my old server, I would probably still be EQing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When we did the Ring War however umpteen times most of the time we had at least one if not two &quot;Split Waves&quot;.   We would have half the wave spawn and move high on the left and the rest of it spawn far away and right near the spires.  You really need a very good scouter to watch for splits like this.  <br />
<br />
I am unsure if that is the same thing you experienced as I just go and heal people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This was on 7th Hammer, and no, we got two full waves spawning in different areas at the same time (left side and right hill).  What makes this such a pain is the 'runner.'  They avoid all aggro and run at SoW speed for Thurg.  It was three of those that broke out, one getting rooted right behind the Coldain heros and the other two just in front of the waterfall.  In the future, we'll sit a group just to stop these impossible waves from reaching that area...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 waves on different sides is common. We quite often got one or 2 per event. We always had a couple groups held back in reserve to catch the runners, just make sure they are non-kos to coldains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think I have seen up to 3 runners at a shot, ut hard to remember exactly. Is this instance a new feature now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Holy sheet!!<br />
 <br />
Someone had it happen to them too!  My guild and a friends guild did a ring war last friday where a WHOLE SQUAD of Giants RAN at SoW speed to thurg.  You know how most times the squads wait about 30-40 seconds? Well these didn't, they spawned on the right side and ran not towards thurg but to the wall then turned and ran right to Thurgardin.  Nothing we did stopped them. No one could get agro. War failed GM's said &quot;working as intended&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;working as intended&quot;: A phrase in the sony language referring to the possibility of an error, but indifference toward the stated. <br />
<br />
In other words, translation: **** you jack@$$, I have a wood elf n00b willing to cyber me for a few pp and your petitions are spamming my queue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough. I found the chaos too much. Perhaps with 40 people or less it would be fun. I'll try it again some day when there's less people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Joursanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Happened to us on Lanys as well</div></div><hr />

Switching to the old player models instead of Luclin models makes all the difference here.</div></div><hr />

I remember getting called by group leaders &quot;need heal in the east~&quot; &quot;Need heal in the west~&quot;  &quot;wheres my cleric,&quot;  and having to run over and heal a few peeps, then running back and healing more people and then falling dead from exhaustion, but not really.  And then i ran oom and i just sat there in awe as these massive giants clobbered these might heroes of men, saviors of d0rfs, and then it was over.  Just like that.<br />

I felt numb.  I wanted more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We failed a war last night under similar circumstances, a  single veteran runner that resisted a total of 10 roots and reached the zoneline (without being attacked by the line of dwarfs). Everything depopped, and that was the end of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The one on CT was more a pickup &quot;hey you over lvl 45 ?GD ring war starting in 45 minutes&quot;. Ive done the ones that were planned and not pickup and ive seen the pickup ones. The planned ones are alot more fun and more cordinated. Lotsa time people dont want the generals killed until all the regular spawns are killed than take out general's and named type. Thats the problem with pickup stuff is getting people to listen instead of do their own thing. <br />
   If you can get into one where a guild is doing it with some extra help usually goes smoother and is alot more fun bigboyg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">All right, all right, I give in. You guys have played a lot more of this game than me, so I'll give it another go. The noob obliges.<br />
<br />
How do I switch to the old player models to help speed things up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's in Options, before you hit the connect button...  just turn all the new models off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman pop AA = Virulent Paralysis very useful at ring war,  Good to use this ability stop Warlord from Charging into Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
Make a Scout on each pop spot is good.  Ring war is possible finish by 30 lv 65 ppls(POP tie 3 guild and well balanced).  Our guild always gather most forces together to kill Giants.   Greater Immobilize/Pertrify Earth is the key of 1st and 2nd wave, best is root them and fight &quot;Before&quot; they charges.   <br />
<br />
About 3rd wave, Shaman can cast Virulent Paralysis on the Warlord at their spawn spot.  If shaman failed, One Main Tank and Cle tank it, Shaman cast debuff disease resist and diseased base slow(Cloud of Grummus) while other ppl move to kill Veteran first. <br />
After use Tashan / AE Tarshi line spell, Veteran can be magical slowed/rooted easily by lv 65 BST, Enc, Shaman, Bard.<br />
<br />
Ring giver use order to gather all dwarf heros prevent them to die.  During 1st and 2nd wave, Dwarf Hero would be able to help clean runners.  <br />
<br />
If double spawned at 1st or 2nd wave, lv 61+ root spell is your best friend.  <br />
Double spawn in 3rd wave of ring war is deadly, hard to find a mid force(30~40) guild overcome them without help.  Send a shaman to use VP hold Warlord.  If most dwarf gather near by,  &quot;For the Dain, Attack&quot; might delay Veteran Giants for a short peridot of time if Warlord not here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You had lag because there were 105 people in the zone. Of course there is going to be lag. Ask everyone to leave GD unless invited to say, rezzes will be given at the end for anyone that died that wasn't on the raid. People there for faction and the lower level players have good intentions, but all they do is make it harder for the raid.</div></div><hr />

I realize there is going to be lag with 105 people. That was the point. There were 105 people.</div></div><hr />
