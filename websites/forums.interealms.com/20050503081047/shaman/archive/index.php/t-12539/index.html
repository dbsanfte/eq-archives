<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a newbie shaman, or rather, I dont know too much about playing a shaman.<br />
I am level 54 and only recently realized I can give my pet weapons and other.<br />
I read a post here about the summoned items (face and belt) and they work awesome! <br />
<br />
My problem is the pets weapons didnt proc (Frenzied Spirit)<br />
<br />
I hastedly did a search in bazaar and bought the only summoned weapon I could find (Blade of Walnan) thinking it was a stun weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
My questions are....<br />
<br />
Whats a good weapon to give a pet?<br />
<br />
Is a proc'ing weapon worth it (veluim shard weapons sell for 10p in bazaar)<br />
<br />
Can the pet proc with both weapons? (lifetap &amp; velium shards)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blades of Walnan is level restricted. Can't remember what level they start procing. Work for lvl 49 Mage pets, but not 44. Fists of ixblat (sic) are not level restricted. Not sure what shaman pet levels are, so can't say when. Velium is very low (25ish I think) and are decent to buy if you will have a pet out for a while. As a mage, I usually don't summon weapons for my pet, except my new waterpet, as he seems to backstab more often with weapons then without. Kinda funny to see one backstab barehanded though. Velium weapons can be gathered very quickly in Tizmak caves in GD, if you don't wanna buy them. Pets (mage at least) can proc with both weapons. Once again, disclaimer as I am a very lowbie shaman alt, with a 54 mage main, your milage may very for dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, dogdog can proc both primary and off hand weapons.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of nice weapons to give our pets, usually I just do a search in bazaar for primary slot items, all effects, max price 50pp. <br />
<br />
This will generally return a list of stuff, some of which may be suitable pet weapons, as people try to sell off things.<br />
<br />
There was a list in the equipment forums some time ago, of proccing weapons for dogdog, but I just mostly buy what is cheap. Some examples:<br />
<br />
Wakizashi of Frozen Skies (81pt dd) - 30-150pp<br />
Gnoll Hide Lariats (stun) 5-50pp<br />
Serrated Bone Dirk (Engulfing Darkness) 25-50pp<br />
Dragon Horn Ykesha (Ykesha 75pt dd) 30-100pp<br />
<br />
Plenty of other choices out there, but again I usually go for what I can find cheap.  What I really need is an unlimited supply of journeyman's walking sticks for the puppy, the tash proc would come in handy a lot of the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This question was asked in another thread, but I don't feel like linking it.  Depending on what you are fighting will determine the procs you want.  But the basics are: stun for casters, snare for fleer's and damage procs for more damage.<br />
<br />
And Agrad explains it will, limit your search from 0 to 50 or 0 to 100 pp and you can guarantee that you'll list all the cheap velium weapons available.  (I've seen velium daggers for like 5pp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ohh...J stick action for fluffy, that would rule. Now I just need to have some people farm them so they are about 50 plat each :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure about other pet classes, but for us:  Only True Spirit (61 pet) will proc the blades of walnan.  The proc is up to a 150dd, magic based, scaling up with pet level.  The 49 pet for sure, and iirc the 44 pet as well, will proc the hands of ixiblat.  They're basically the same as the swords except the (up to) 150dd proc is fire-based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Currently, the fists proc for lvl 1 pets :). Can we say PL BL/Ench/Mage really easy with a pet kit. *grins*<br />
<br />
I think Blades of Walnan is lvl 44 (pet's level) for proc, cause the lvl 49 mage pets are level 44.</div></div><hr />
