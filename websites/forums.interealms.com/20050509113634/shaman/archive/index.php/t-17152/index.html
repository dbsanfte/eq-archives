<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">don't know why I am posting this here, but...<br />
<br />
Last night I was soloing a named in Droga. Dotting, lots and lots of Q-ing myself, tanking it in the face (no dogdog to avoid adds because of the push). On average, it takes 6 mins for me to take it down...and then I have to canni 2-3 mins to FM...very long but steady process.<br />
<br />
Then I saw a druid today soloing the same mob, unslowed, tanking it in the face, took it down with 6 nukes in less than a min...and he still has 80% hp...<br />
<br />
I am L65 with  full spell book, gears are average with 3K hp 1.2K ac unbuffed 104aa...<br />
<br />
I finally realized how weak I really am...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm..Id be very interested to see what kind of gear the druid was packing to tank an unslowed mob like that. What was he fighting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on the HP of the mob and if the druid got only crits and had damage focus....it still seems a bit exaggerated though...<br />
<br />
The other point is DoTs take time to work...so his &quot;6&quot; nukes might be pretty comparative to your lets just say 6 1 minute DoTs and you cant really decrease the kill time because your tools mostly dont allow for it.<br />
<br />
Since i dont have all the facts this is what i came up with :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A 65 druid with a full spell book and some AA has:<br />
<br />
a DS that does 40hp/hit<br />
a self AC buff that has a DS component for 13hp/tic<br />
Ice based nuke for 1550<br />
Fire based nuke for 1400<br />
shield spell that gives 600+ hp<br />
Regen spell that heals for 30hp/tic<br />
AA that gives 200hp/tic regen and a 25hp/hit DS<br />
AA DS that gives 350 DS <br />
AA's that increase nuke effectiveness, lowers mana cost and lengthens buffs<br />
<br />
If the druid had Virtue/Focus/Brells +self buffs and REALLY incredible gear I don't think that it is hard to say that it is possible.  doing it all in under a minute?  That makes me wonder, but I'd really have to know which mob it was and the mobs stats (AC, HP, DPS, attack type, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was the King, I have seen 2 different droods did it successfully by just standing there taking the unslowed beating around 1 minute fight.<br />
<br />
I stood there invis and watch, one nuke took off approx. 18% of King's hp. After the fight I asked how much mana he got, he said 27%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exactly.  After the fight, the druid is oom.  The druid has killed the target, and is sitting around medding for whatever length of time to do it again.<br />
<br />
Shaman keep going and going and going and going.  There is no downtime for a shaman.  A shaman will kill the same target in more time, but will be FM afterwards and ready for the next pull.<br />
<br />
Also, a shaman will laugh off an add.  A druid will run screaming from it or hope he channels through a root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Druid channeling is pretty poor, I'm surprised he got off the nukes needed to down the King in under a minute.  Still, pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most people on this board think Shamans are fine and balanced only because they have yet to play any other class in the same environment they have been playing their Shamans.<br />
So what if the Druid has to med up after the fight ? If the Druid was at 27% mana after a minute, his gear was lacking badly to begin with. The poster was at 80% mana and it took him 6 minutes to finish the same mob...<br />
<br />
PS: If the Shaman gets an add he laughs them off, if the Shaman gets a train, he dies and the Druid will just evac. Take a look on the other side. The Shaman class is definitely lacking power in Solo, Group and Raid Environments nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doesn't really matter if he was lom after the fight, since his target is a named that isn't going to be up for a while anyways.  A druid that solos stampeding piglet in tactics will probably have less mana when they are done that I would, but does that matter?  No, because he only comes around every hour or so.<br />
<br />
As for druids having trouble with an add... what makes you think druids have problems with adds?  They deal with adds basically the same way we do - they root them and step away.  The only difference is that their roots are vastly superior, and they get snare as well, so in the unlikely event that their root does break, they have a chance to reapply it before getting smashed in the face.  Only disadvantage they really have is that they won't last as long against two unslowed mobs as a shaman would.  Another advantage they have is that if things go terribly wrong, safety is only an instant-cast evac away, whereas the shaman would probably die.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't know anything about veksar named.  I have never even zoned in to that place.  I am, however, assuming that they do not hit exceedingly hard.  This means that anyone with a heal spell can probably tank it and live.  Druid heals aren't shabby, and I guarantee that he had spirit of wood and used it.  SOTW3 + their self buff DS's give them either 108 or 103pt ds, I don't remember which.  A DS like that will drop an unslowed mob pretty fast, and all he really needs to do is apply a few dots, heal himself when needed, and nuke away.<br />
<br />
As other people said, though, they can't sustain this.  If the mob has too many HP or hits too hard, they'll go oom and be forced to evac.  A shaman, though, can do this forever.  We aren't a burn class - druids are.  Just accept this and take pride in the fact that no other class can play the energizer bunny role and just keep on going and going and going the same way that we can.  Find me a druid that can tank a solro tower guard in the face and win the fight, and I'll agree that druids are overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First of all ordinary mobs around lvl 57ish in droga has 16k hps, guestimate would be that King got 18k-20k.

If this druid was time geared I don't think he'd have any probs doing this, I got a friend who tanks unslowed valley dragons while nuking them down (also a druid of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it only hits for 200 then any druid with decent gear (even with just good bazaar bought stuff) should have no trouble tanking it.  200 is a love tap compared to pop mobs.  Their DS combined with nukes in between heals should dominate something that hits that lightly.  You definately don't need time gear.  You don't even need EP gear for that.<br />
<br />
If the druid nuked it 6 times with winter's frost, that will come out to about 11k damage assuming ID4 and you crit once.  The other 8kish damage could easily have been done via the damage shield.  I have a feeling that the kill time of &quot;under 1 minute&quot; is a little exagerated, and it was really closer to two, but yeah druids are definately better than us at burning down weak nameds.  Oh well I can live with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No way No How No sir.  People just dont look at things fairly usually.<br />
<br />
8k Damage via 53 Points of DS = getting hit 150 Times.  Even if the average hit was say 100 or more as wood only lasts 30 seconds ((lets assume the druid had a lot more defensive AAs and Realize that a defensive AAs rock for ANY CLASS))<br />
thats 15k in damage a druid would take to do that.<br />
<br />
Throw in More AA.  Wood &amp; DS one.  Even with wood thats 100 approximate hits or 10k in damage.  Less the 1250 wood would do<br />
Still 8750 hps to heal.  Im willing to bet the druid didn't have 8k<br />
which would necessitate healing.<br />
<br />
Anyway while the shaman complaining has 100 AA or so.<br />
A druid to pull off under a minute, I'd expect to have 300 AA or more to pull this off.  Im talking Full Defensive AAs Full Nuke Haste AA Full Nuke AA.  Plane of Time gear.  ((to be 80% life))<br />
<br />
In which case, yes a druid at this level of the game SHOULD kick the ass of the shaman posting because he's way way beyond him in AA and Gear.  <br />
<br />
Take a look at the basic spell Summer's Flame: 1400 base damage, 6.25 sec cast, 2.75 sec recast (total time: 9 sec)<br />
<br />
To do 15k or so of damage with SF your talking 10 Nukes with ID.  9 if you crit once.  Thats 81 Seconds of Just Nuking.   If you have a good haste item and 18 AAs in fast nuking your lookingat shaving 19 Seconds off of that.  Thats still 62 Seconds.  An unslowed mob for 62 seconds even with wood to heal 1250 would mean that the mob only does 3k or so in damane ((he was at 80%)) in over a minute.  I guarantee you he had to have defensive AA up the butt to pull that off.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, your not using your pet for whatever reason.<br />
And i bet your not trying to burn the mob down.   Bane, Blood, Poison Nuke Poison Nuke.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let the druid try to tank a summoner in the planes and it doesnt happen.  My shaman can.<br />
<br />
Apples and Oranges.  Druids are faster damage, but they are tissue paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to say that druid is a better druid then I LOL.  I have just average gear and only 12 AA right now so i'm not uber in anyway.  But i have to say a DECENT equipped druid with a full spell book and 100+ AA could probably do it but i cant believe he can tank it.  With my druid if i can snare/root it and it doesnt summons i can kill it but i cant tank even tier 1 mobs hitting for 248 for more then a min.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just checked my log, Dronan hit me for 157 as hardest and it took me 2 minutes 30 seconds to kill him with me, monk and a ranger to chew him down, but only damage I did was epic. Ranger is swiftblade and some other weapon, monk is epic hand plus Fist of lightning, haste was swift like the wind and both monk and ranger were FA'ed, so ATK were over 1500 with all relevant buffs.<br />
I've parsed my monk against other mobs in droga around 100dps with the ranger tanking, and in those fights the rangers dps falls to around 60.<br />
IF this holds true for the fight against dronan, monk did 15k alone, ranger did 9k plus damageshield (mob was slowed 14 seconds after engage - he resisted first and procced with his hammer which I didn't resist, so shoot me ;) ) - AND last but not least, I did a wooping 1k from epic!!! So 25k plus damageshield, round down as you please.<br />
Not sure if I had pet up, doesn't look like that way from my log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not sure a druid nuke/tanked Yeldema.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For a really fair comparison we'd need to know which dots wou were stacking on the mob. A person can easily stack Bane, Blood of Saryne, Ancient bane of Nife and Breath of Ulthor on a mob if a fast kill is what they want. <br />

If the only concern is a kill, then a slow controlled burn gets the job done and that's all that really matters.</div></div><hr />

I've personally seen a druid tank the two rightmost (when looking into the ToV entrance) of the valley dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's possible to do.  Had a druid in my guild solo PoD by DS tanking him.  Time level druids are raid buffed in the order of 7khps.<br />
<br />
Brackencoat = 13 ptDS<br />
Legacy of Bracken = 40 ptDS<br />
Spirit of the Wood = 55 ptDS<br />
Wrath of the Wild = 350 ptDS for 1 hit<br />
Dain Ring = 10 ptDS<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Wild can be pre-cast then recast after the first hit for a total of 700 damage on initial engage.  Spirit of the Wood lasts 5 ticks (30 secs) but can be extended to 7 ticks (42 secs) via AA and equipment.<br />
<br />
Druids also have ATK debuffs which can shift the per hit average closer to min hit.<br />
<br />
Hand of Ro debuffs 100 ATK<br />
Ro's Illumination debuffs 80 ATK<br />
<br />
If the druids has reasonably good AC (in the order of 1000 and defensive AA's LR5 and ID5) then he will be taking lots of hits but those hits will be minimum damage rather than max (80's instead of 200's).<br />
<br />
With a nice corner to wedge ourselves into, we can channel all our nukes/heals (channeling focus 3 helps).  Fully AA'd/hasted nukes take ~4secs to cast and do between 1550 and ~2100 damage.  Fully AA'd/hasted heals do between 2030 and 2500 heals in 2.8 seconds.  On a non-bashing mob, we can channel 5500 heals in 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Druids do well tanking against fast hitting (hasted) mobs with low ATK.  63 ptDS (plus 55 for 7 ticks) will tear fast hitting mobs up.  We prefer fast hitting/low max damage mobs to get the most efficiency out of our damage shields.<br />
<br />
If the druid you watched was tanking mobs, he prolly grew up porcupping for exp.  It isn't the standard quad-kite way that most druids use to level but still a valid way to exp at certain levels.<br />
<br />
I read in an earlier post that this mob hits for 157 max?  That would but his min damage around 60?  Yeah.  The mob can be solo'd by a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">After reading all the replies, I concluded that I need to upgrade my gears seriously...http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=486096 ... the hp and ac in my magelo is not correct, maybe because of the missing augs?<br />
<br />
My gears are lacking. After stacking slow+malos+mal decay+Bane+BoS+BoU, I have less than 40% mana. Then I need to Q+canni5, Q+canni4 repeatedly....I am usually left with 20% mana after the kill. Now this is even worst than the druid. Shame for me to be a shaman.<br />
<br />
Perhaps...300 successful LDoN runs will fix that right up...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Use more DoTs obv.  Get Bane and use it too.  Bane, Blood of Saryn, Ancient:Scourge of Nife, and Bane of Nife put out some hardcore DPS when you slap em all on.  If you get a mage bracer (steel bracer, no rent, increased DoT dmg focus) before you go a-hunting, you'll increase your DPS that much more.  Killing a named mob in a couple minutes is very very possible for a shaman, simply with DoTs.  Killing a bit faster with a combination of DoTs and nukes is also very possible.  I have soloed quite a few named in that area, but I wasn't really going for speed kills mostly.  Still, a normal  mob around king area took me bout 3-4 min using DoTs only . . . and if I was in a hurry to kill the PH and invis to the next camp i was holding, 1-2 minutes.  Run to the next camp while Canni5 refreshes.  Arrive and hit c5, Q myself, and engage with FM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think first druid killed yeldema by charm animalpet and use pet tank it then healing pet before oom, they will evac fast if charm break or overagro summon, lots of them only go try when their instant evac AA are ready, with lvl65, it is lots easier .<br />
<br />
for tanking named in Droga, mob will take more damage from DS than it did to druid, and druid really don't need worry about heal, their spell/aa regen heal is enough to cover about ~5k heal for 1 minutes<br />
<br />
also druid have AA that make their root can't break by nuke, so they can back off anytime if feel can't tanking, as long as mob not summon.<br />
<br />
I think they better off just root mob and nuke the crap out of it untill mob die. safe, easy and fast, but they need go afk for 5~10minutes each time; compare to shaman which take 6minutes fighting and 2~3minutes recovery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I read in an earlier post that this mob hits for 157 max?  That would but his min damage around 60?  Yeah.  The mob can be solo'd by a druid.<br />
First of all, I am talking about two different mobs, one is one of them valley dragons, and I have no idea how hard they hit, and the other is the named in Droga, King Dronan.<br />
I mentioned King Dronan hitting me for a max of 157 - this was the max he could land on me, I got decent gear, around 1200 ac without really trying, guess I could get it a little higher with VotB and what not.<br />
Edit: He also only hit me 6 times or so, before ranger took over tanking.<br />
The druid I mentioned tanking the valley dragons got time gear, his gear is a lot better than mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also druid have AA that make their root can't break by nuke, so they can back off anytime if feel can't tanking, as long as mob not summon.<br />
If you have a look at the room where King Dronan spawns in and add to the size of the room the fact that 5 mobs spawn in there, you'll realize that there is no room for rooting and backing off. I think someone mentioned that you could stand behind Dronan and kill him without aggroing the other mobs in the room - I wouldn't try it though, just call me chicken ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I haven't tried valley dragons but will prolly try it as some point.  The druid trick for soloing summoners is to get our ATK debuffs in before doing damage.  We also need a nice corner to wedge ourselves in so we can channel our spells.  Caster mobs are a bonus since they don't bash.<br />
<br />
A time equipped druid can solo valley dragons.  This would be raidbuffed solo as opposed to self buffed solo.  Would have to pick the right dragons as well.  That silence AE is a death sentence for casters.<br />
<br />
A lot of luck would also be in order.  We rely on the RNG for min damage hits to lower a mob's dps as opposed to the guaranteed slow.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, and a wizard can tank Statue.  Or was it cleric?  Ranger?  Whatever.  Behold the power of /shield.  Use it on casters, use it on MT after disc wears off.</div></div><hr />
