<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 56 ranger friend and I (55 shaman), along with my port-bot (42 druid) were hoping to find the front of the SSra temple uncamped last night so we could plow through some quick xp and see if we could get some of the named to pop.  No such luck.  For some reason there were level 60 people camping this spot.  Why they'd want to camp green/light blue mobs I don't know.<br />
<br />
So I suggested we go to the North-West corner of the zone and check out the Sun Revs which are standing around a little lake.  They look nothing like sun revs in Scarlet Desert.  They're actually giant skeletons.<br />
<br />
We found the spot to be a fairly decent camp.  A good change of pace from shissars and jaggedpine gnolls.  XP was nothing special though and loot was non-existent.  The mobs we were fighting are level 55 warriors.  I think they probably have around 10k hit points, possibly more.  They seem to hit for a max of 160 or so.  Their disease resists were near zero.  Magic resists were low.  Only resisted about 3 turgurs in 2 hours of killing them.  Cold resists were spotty.  To get full effect from JBB, had to use malosi.  Poison resists seemed fairly low also.   Ranger had no trouble single-pulling them.  Didn't even need harmony.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I was able to keep our ranger &quot;tank&quot; healed with just the druid (horse, healing focus, no kei).<br />
<br />
They generally were respawning just as we finished clearing the first set.  <br />
<br />
My strategy:<br />
<br />
 - cast turgurs &amp; send in alpha pet as pull is incoming<br />
 - if turgurs is resisted, cast malosi then recast turgurs<br />
 - cast plague<br />
 - cast scourge<br />
 - canni back a bunch of mana<br />
 - a few jbb blasts (lots of partial resists unless I had to malosi)<br />
 - cast ebolt<br />
 - alternate canni and jbb blasts<br />
 - if I had to malosi and mana permitted, torrent of poison<br />
<br />
The mobs typically died just as the 2 disease DoTs were expiring.  Ranger occasionally had to chain cast snare to pull agro off me after I cast ebolt.  Otherwise, not too much agro.<br />
<br />
I figure this would probably be a decent solo spot, expecially for 56+ shamans.  (A couple banes should replace the ranger's DPS.  And shamans don't tank that much worse than rangers.)  Hope you find this useful.<br />
<br />
If you run out of mobs, there are some wanderers around to add into your rotation, but if you pick your camp right, they'll never wander in.  Zone corner works well.  <br />
<br />
One warning.  Be careful.  There are a couple of stonegrabber &quot;traps&quot; in the rocks between the lake and the zone wall.  If you run your pull through that spot, you'll get anywhere from 1-3 adds.</div></div><hr />
