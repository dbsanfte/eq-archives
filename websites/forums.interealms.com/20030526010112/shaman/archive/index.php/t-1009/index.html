<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Castersrealm says that Disinfecting Aura and Plague of Insects are available at a spell vendor in FG, but I couldn't find it after going into every building in the Outpost and checking EVERY NPC. <br />
<br />
Does a spell vendor exist there?  If not, where do I get these spells?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they mean to say it drops in that zone, definitely not on any vendor there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, those spells are drops, they used to drop from mushrooms but the drops were re-tuned a while after release and I've not seen a mushroom drop a spell since. I've seen low 50's Luclin spells drop from fungusbeast in FG, not sure on the other mob types as I tend to leave them alone for an easy life.<br />
<br />
See the sticky thread in this forum about spell locs for more details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What probably happened was that early on the shrooms dropped spells and where even bigger wusses than they are now and had like a 5 minute respawn. Player sold the spells to vendors early on and thats why they where found on vendors in FG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The single-pullable,  no-faction, still blue at 60 &quot;Domestic Underbulk&quot; in Fungus grove drops low level (51-55?) Luclin spells on occasion.<br />
<br />
I've seen nothing on the Mushrooms excepting the shroom chunks, face item and shrink potion (shrieker essence) in the last two months.</div></div><hr />
