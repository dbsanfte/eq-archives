<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So most of my crew and I decided to start experimenting with our pallies post nerf and our rogue for aggro and tanking.  We decided to do Uldaman as 2 of us still needed rings.  Here was our group makeup:<br />
- 54 rogue<br />
- 49 paladin (me- usually MT)<br />
- 46 paladin<br />
- 45 shadow priest (runs in shadowform 90% of the time)<br />
<br />
We slaughtered our way to Archadeus (instance boss) in lightning time and using 1 hander and aggro seal I could not even keep aggro off the other paladin with a 2 hander and command.  The only aggro I could hold was when we had multiples and my AE would get initial aggro on me. I would lose aggro instantly when the rogue engaged.  I played with all of my seals and could not consistently break 60 dps. The other paladin was averaging around 80 dps.  The rogue and shadow priest were each doing between 140-160 dps.<br />
<br />
So we get to Archadeus and we agree that the rogue will tank, the priest will remain in shadow form and us paladins will kill the spawns and off tank the golems.  Care to guess what happened? I had to heal the rogue once- Arch was able to spawn 1 white guy before the 6 black guys came to life.  We AE'd those and he was already under 20%.  The golems then came to life and got to us with Arch at 5%- he died 7 seconds later.<br />
<br />
The priest never came out of shadowform to heal.  The rogue only required one heal.  The other paladin and I both had to heal ourselves due to dmg from the golems.  From the time we walked into the instance until the time we looted Archadeus: 37:51.  Due to aggro, the rogue tanked 75% of the instance with no issues whatsover.  The paladins acted as healers since we contributed little else.<br />
<br />
Our next task is going to be Princess in Mauradon. If we can heal out of her AE range, our plan is to setup a 3 paladin heal chain on the rogue while the rogue and shadow priest annihilate her.  I will post my results on that this Wed night when we try.<br />
<br />
Oh, I run 3600 hps fully buffed, our rogue runs 3200 hps.  I have nearly 3K more AC but his mitigation/dodge/parry when summed is about 10% less than mine (Juujuu's theoretical numbers aside).<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the reason the nerf to crusader sucked was that the best aggro in this game = dps.  Rogues do dps in spades, hence they are aggro gods.  Heal aggro is also huge, so using paladin healers means there's no risk of heal aggro.  I think we finally found a workable solution for our instance runs until we get our dps classes up high enough to replace our paladins.<br />
<br />
Whee...</div></div><hr />

We're not going to replace all our pallies with rogues, we still need the pallies for heals/offtanking.  On big pulls their AEs will get the mobs beating on them while the rogues kill everything.  Where the rogue shines as a MT is on minibosses and instance bosses if you can either handle or clear the adds (a paladin's primary job).  Rogue aggro lock is so good you can do heal chains on them w/ no risk, esp. if you use paladins to do the heal chains since their heals are already very low aggro.  Our rogue has 400 hp less than me and takes ~10% more damage- who cares? Aggro &gt; all.<br />
<br />
But, like you said, we'll see. I just hope rogues don't get nerfed, that would suck pretty hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maraudon is fine, ya, pretty wussy dungeon. Just do not plan on doing anything higher with a rogue as a main tank. It is not 10% less damage taken, it is not even close. When you figure in 30% more damage reduction, plus block, etc, it is vastly different.<br />
<br />
I know, because when our tank is tanking, he doesn't get hurt very much, when I have to peel an add off, I get my crap pushed in. I have 200 less hps than our toughest 60 warrior he can tank a mob probably 2-3 times as long as I, for real.<br />
<br />
mid levels it is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is not 10% less damage taken, it is not even close. When you figure in 30% more damage reduction, plus block, etc, it is vastly different.<br />
I'm just going off the numbers on our character screens. Yes I have 30% more AC mitigation, but the rogue has 20% more dodge.  I left block out because it's a 5% chance to absorb roughly 40 points of damage with my current shield. In other words, you will not even notice it.<br />
<br />
We'll know soon enough how rogue holds up tanking higher end bosses, but given his aggro lock I'm not sure it will matter when you have 3 paladins dropping 1300 heals every 3 secs in a chain on the rogue.  Again, aggro &gt; all.  As long as he's not 1-2 rounded and has the dps along with the shadow priest to kill the boss before we go oom I don't see how this can fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will fail, because in higher level places, not only do the bosses hit extremely hard, have mega hps, but almost always also summon mobs to fight with them, or are guarded by more elites.<br />
<br />
a rogue cannot tank the higher end bosses with any efficiency at all.<br />
<br />
If you are spending all your time healing the rogue, who is killing the boss? You think a rogue alone can kill a level 57-60 boss?</div></div><hr />

Rogue + shadow priest in our case.  If you're serious about doing 400-600 dps by yourself you can throw another 200+ on top of that from the shadow priest.  What boss will even notice three 60-80 dps paladins whacking at it- far better to use our mana healing someone who can actually hurt the boss.  And offtanking those elites and summoned mobs is what paladin was made for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You will up too much mana keeping the rogue alive, like I said, you can kick ass in lower places, but will get eaten alive in higher ones.<br />
<br />
One of the most important skills I use is feint.<br />
<br />
You Paladin dps is not as important as your ability to eat damage. Our warriors respecced defensive, and even with massive damage, I do not get aggro much, if I do, I feint it off.<br />
<br />
Take just two bosses we fought yesterday, a 57 fire golem that hits for 600's, and has an instant 1100 point aoe. I get one 5 point evis off before I have to run out and get healed. You would have to chain heal me to keep me in there, and would be screwed afterwards when he summons his globs of goo critters.<br />
<br />
Another boss, golem lord or something, his two guards are a 54 and 56 elite golem, and he is a terror by himself, think the rogue is going to want to tank all three? Oh ya, he has instant 1100 point lightning attack.<br />
<br />
Another event spawns 7 56 + boss mobs in a row, if you do not kill them very quickly, you are toast if you have two paladins just healing one silly rogue, you will not last.<br />
<br />
I'll drop it, but just do not want you to plan on doing tough instances with a rogue as a tank, you will die often and not get very far.<br />

I will post our experiences either way.<br />
<br />
You Paladin dps is not as important as your ability to eat damage.<br />
Which is exactly my point.  My big ability to eat damage is apparently 10% more damage reduction + block, which is basically useless.  I'm not seeing this mythical damage reduction.<br />

In both of your examples the paladins would handle the offtanking.  The rogue would handle the boss.  Hey, if we have to make the priest drop out of shadowform for a bit so be it. Sure he'll be pissed at having to heal but everyone has to take one for the team occasionally.<br />
<br />

Damn I can't wait to do these fights, they sound like a blast. Where are all these cool boss fights if you don't mind?  We should already be in Sunken Temple but we took a big delay with the paladin nerf while everyone PLs up a dps class. Meanwhile we're still stuck in Mauradon and have ZF to do yet before we move on to ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Black rock depths. And you will see iz, you absolutely will see a massive difference in damage taken by a rogue vs a plate class.<br />

I cannot tank a boss mob without being healed constantly. Can paladins off tank and heal at the same time, for 30 seconds to 2 minutes?<br />
<br />
You can say it is only 10% difference in damage taken, but it truly is not. Plate is very nice. Hell just look at my hits against people, 200-250 is a good SS against a pally, 800-900 a good evis, rogue, I can hit for 450 or so ss and 1500 evis.</div></div><hr />

Using your logic that levels alone account for a rogue's ability to tank, my paladin should be approaching rogue dps on greens/greys- but he's not.<br />

Hey, like I said above I will post our results either way. If and when I'm proven wrong, so be it- I'll post and you can let me have it with your &quot;I told you so's&quot;.<br />
<br />
All the plate armor in the world is irrelevant if you can't hold aggro- that much I have figured out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I healed Mill (60 rogue) as he tanked Mar.  Wasn't an issue, although he was a bit of a sponge.  The healing aggro was a little higher than normal because he didn't want to lose combo points switching targets, so there was less aggro on the 2-3 mobs also on him that when I healed I usually pulled all aggro except the current target.  Fade usually sent them back and off me and onto someone else.<br />
<br />
I was the healer for the BRD runs Mill is talking about.  And there's no way he could tank BRD with just one priest behind him.  (I'm currently spec'd 17 Holy 21 Disc and 6 Shadow.)  Our &quot;raid&quot; was comprised of:<br />
<br />
Group 1<br />
War War Sham Rogue (Mill) and Priest (me)<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
Sham Sham<br />
<br />
The seven bosses in a row encounter was not to hard to heal.  The hardest part (for me) was controlling the secondary aggro on the fire elementals.  It seems that they melee their top hate target and fire nuke their second hate target simultaneously, which was usually me.  <br />
<br />
I suppose a rogue may tank the encounter, but we'd have to dedicate so much healing, I'm not sure we'd carry the day.  I wouldn't want to run it with a rogue tanking -- it's can be pretty taxing healing a warrior, let alone a rogue.</div></div><hr />

That's part of the reason I'm posting this here and not on the WoW boards- I don't want to see rogues nerfed.<br />
<br />
And you're mistaking my intent if you think we're going to use a rogue to tank the entire instance, we're not because they can't grab AE aggro.  Where I want to experiment is on big single targets like minibosses and instance bosses due to our surplus of healing and lack of aggro.  Some may work, some may not due to the boss scripts.  But it will be a lot of fun either way.<br />
<br />
Hey, if all else fails I can just Divine Suicide the shadow priest so we can wipe again the conventional way vice the unconventional way.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm going for the 30/8/13 build because I like big numbers- when you see lots of small hits on pally after awhile you want some flash.  Watch this video (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-rogue&amp;t=104795&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post104795)  if you want to see what I'm talking about.

Actually, in a group setting with redoubt, improved shield, and holy shield running... it is very noticable.... It is actually the only thing that makes the prot line work.. I am not saying it will work as well as retri.. but it does do better as long as they have parry from the retri line IN A GROUP.<br />
<br />
Solo it is horrible. +50% increase in kill times at least.<br />
<br />
But it was effective enough that I am trying out retri 30/holy the rest atm... but if this doesn't work really well... my build will go to retri 30/prot up to holy shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends on to many variables.....<br />
<br />
Thats one of the reasons warriors are so gimp. For instance, rage... the warrior runs in and starts fighting... warriors defense and mitgation are very low compared to where they should be even in defensive stance so the warrior has taken a bunch of damage just to get to the point where he can get enough rage to toss up shield block... now he gets a block whoopty do what does he get in return? a ton more hits waiting to get more rage...<br />
<br />
Shields in wow are messed up. Warrior shield percentage should be at least = rogue dodge percentages base. 25%. add some talents and skills upping to 35% now with using rage = 100% chance to block if thats all your doing... and remember blocking doesn't even mitigate all damage taken..<br />
<br />
horrible system they have there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Uldaman<br />
54 rogue<br />
Right there is where your post lost any credibility.<br />
Try going to Uldaman with a 44 rogue and 44 paladins at the level intended for the dungeon, and see how well the rogue tanks.  LOL<br />
<br />
Here's a hint.  When you get xp 6 times in an entire instance, and there happens to be exactly 6 bosses in whatever instance it is, that might be a sign that you are a bit overpowered for the dungeon.  Your entire post is pretty much the same as evaluating the group dynamics of a level 55 group hunting in lower Guk and who should tank the Shin Lord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You are 5 levels lower than the rogue.  That level disparity hurts your relative dps, which in turn hurts your aggro.<br />

<br />

Before I answer the flamers, let me address this.  At one point I PL'd a warrior up to 30 to replace my paladin due to issues with tanking. At this point I don't see the point however.  Warriors hold better aggro on single targets with taunt and sunder armor (a lame gimmick reminiscent of how paladins and shadowknights hold aggro in EQ). Where they flat out suck is at grabbing aggro on multiple targets since their AE taunt ability is on a 5 or 10 min timer, I forget.  <br />
<br />
I found in my limited play it was more effective aggro wise to run in berserk stance, taking 10% more damage, and deal out significantly higher damage and have the ability with whirlwind to hit 4 targets at once, which helps on group pulls. DPS &gt; all for aggro, which is a huge flaw in WoW's aggro system.<br />
<br />
Paladins, on the other hand, suck horribly at single target aggro.  They have an aggro seal and that's pretty much it.  Oh, and when you run the seal your dps drops through the floor which means, you guessed it, you lose aggro regardless.  It's one thing to lose aggro to a rogue or mage, it's quite another to lose aggro to a paladin 3 levels below you running a dps seal and doing a mere 30 dps more than you.<br />
<br />
Where paladins shine is on huge pulls, esp. huge undead pulls.  If you go down the retribution (dps) talent tree, you can pick up an instant cast AE (consecration).  This makes tanking 6-8 pulls a snap, far, far easier than on warrior.  If your crew contains multiple paladins like mine does, this adds up to some significant dps, esp. on undead. And unlike warriors, you can fire off the AE as soon as mobs are in camp, not wait until your pathetic rage generation catches up.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you're right, I played a paladin to L50 and never discovered blessing of salvation.  Thank you so very much for pointing this out to me!<br />
<br />
News flash: we always hit the priest and rogue with blessing of salvation! ARGHHHHGHGHGGHGHGH! It does NOT matter if you cannot hold aggro- thank you for playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was the rogue even trying to fade the mobs off onto you?<br />
I suspect not considering the way you described going through the instance basicly in a zerg manner more or less.<br />
I think you mean feint, not fade- fade is the priest de-aggro spell. Feint is the rogue de-aggro ability. But you knew that right?<br />
<br />
Take a look at feint and you'll see the issue. It's on a 10 sec cooldown. The rogue feints, loses aggro, slams down a 5 point evis 5 secs later and he's tanking again.  Rinse and repeat.  The answer is not &quot;gimp the rogue&quot; by throttling back his dps, the answer is &quot;give paladins a working aggro ability&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for your other comments about the level difference, let me just say this. All I heard prior, during and after the paladin dps nerf is that &quot;paladins aren't meant to do dps&quot;.  Well let me say this: &quot;rogues aren't meant to tank&quot;.  There should never, ever be a circumstance on mobs that give exp that a rogue makes a better tank than paladin- ever.  The boss mob in Uldaman still gives exp to all of us, including the rogue- why should he make a better tank than a paladin?  <br />
<br />
A rogue a mere 4-5 levels higher than a paladin does not miraculously gain new tanking abilities that enable him to do this- they were already there. And that's the problem.  Or it would be if I wanted to see rogues nerfed: I don't. I want to use rogues on all our big single target fights as with our crew and healing ability it will be very doable.  And if I'm wrong, you can tell me alll about it- I will post either way.<br />
<br />
I hope the level difference enables us to beat Princess in Mauradon tomorrow night with the rogue tanking- I want my Thrash Blade. Her fear is the only thing I'm worried about- I'm confident a 3 paladin heal chain + vampiric embrace + judgment of light on a hasted rogue is more than enough healing to eat an insane amount of incoming damage.</div></div><hr />

If you can find one hehe. Ive read their bear from gives a huge ac boost and some hps. Ive not seen in in practice a whole lot though. I'd let them do it though if given the chance. <br />

Hey Izm Good luck with test. I think its cool also trying this all out. I dont know if its going to turn out like you'd hope it higher places. In higher places i have a time healing other pallies or warriors. Curiious how the combo of a non priest/druid healing a non tank is going to work out once the lvls all even out. Appreciate you are going to post the results either way. Ive seen the damage rogues take in some of the higher places why I'm skeptical. I do agree they seem to have a better time of it keeping aggro if they wanted. Our aggro seal just doesnt work. Mob looks at me(eventually) but than I dont do any damage and it just turns away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Still missing the point, Princess is a joke, anything in maraudon is not exactly tough. A rogue can tank there, provided they have dedicated healing, which is terribly a waste of time, hell, anyone could tank with three paladins healing.<br />
<br />
What kind of an asshat rogue uses feint right before a 5 point evis anyway?<br />
<br />
By the way, it is impossible to get aggro away from a properly taunting, properly specced warrior, if you give them even a few seconds to grab aggro. This is awesome.<br />
<br />
Izmalis is playing way below his level, so of course a rogue can tank. However, if he gets 60 even and attempts to tank in BRD or higher, his group is going to do really poor and there will be many a dead rogue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As for your other comments about the level difference, let me just say this. All I heard prior, during and after the paladin dps nerf is that &quot;paladins aren't meant to do dps&quot;.  Well let me say this: &quot;rogues aren't meant to tank&quot;.  There should never, ever be a circumstance on mobs that give exp that a rogue makes a better tank than paladin- ever.  The boss mob in Uldaman still gives exp to all of us, including the rogue- why should he make a better tank than a paladin?  <br />
<br />
A rogue a mere 4-5 levels higher than a paladin does not miraculously gain new tanking abilities that enable him to do this- they were already there. And that's the problem.  Or it would be if I wanted to see rogues nerfed: I don't. I want to use rogues on all our big single target fights as with our crew and healing ability it will be very doable.  And if I'm wrong, you can tell me alll about it- I will post either way.<br />

You're either missing or ignoring the point so you don't have to admit you're wrong. 54 vs 49 is a huge difference when dealing with a level 51 mob. Please tell me you understand that.</div></div><hr />

I do not agree that a non-tank class with 3 levels on a mob should be able to tank better than a plate tank -2 levels.  That is flat out bad design.  Gaining 3 levels over an instance boss does not suddenly grant you the ability to tank it successfully if you didn't have those skills to begin with.<br />
<br />
In response to mill, no any class could not tank with 3 paladins healing because you need solid aggro.  Warrior and druid in bear form could also do this, but they lack the other component necessary for this strategy: high manafree sustained dps.  Rogue is the only class that has the necessary aggro lock for a dedicated heal chain, the dps to kill things in a reasonable time and the defensive abilities to survive long enough to make this possible.  Note that by supplementing rogue dps with a shadow priest in full out burn mode gives us plenty of dps to pull this off.  Not even a shadow priest is going to pull aggro off a combat rogue chaining 5 pt evis's.<br />
<br />
Princess is not easy for us- only the rogue is higher level than her.  She kicked our asses last time because the paladins who engaged her in melee spent all their time healing themselves due to her AE instead of dealing their pitiful damage.  The only 2 people last time dealing damage were the rogue and me- I think we can safely subtract all paladin dps, add shadow priest dps in full burn mode, and come out ahead.<br />
<br />
After MR/ZF what's next- Sunken Temple right?  How does it compare difficulty wise?</div></div><hr />

<br />
not once you get to billy zones.<br />
<br />
Sunken temple will be good for you, you will start seeing pulls of multiple elites, and the damage starts to increase a little.<br />
<br />
Iz, it is simply a matter of your level and the places you are giving a false sense of rogue power. You just do not get much of a &quot;tougher&quot; rogue build than I have, if I don't try to avoid aggro, I either die, or suck up so much mana it is hurting the group badly.<br />
<br />
Your group, at 60, using the tactics you are now, will be absolutely horrible in the upper level instances, you will not survive. A rogue should be all about adding as much damage as they can, and using their feint abilities to deflect aggro to the plate wearers. Offtank in emergencies only, when you have evade up.<br />
<br />
What are you going to do, say, in BRD, when you get a pull of an elite golem or two, plus 4-6 normal level 54 guys? Rogue can barely tank one elite, with alot of healing, what do you do about the other guys, when you only have you and a priest(man that is funny) dealing damage? What do you do when you have 4 elite mobs attacking you?<br />
<br />
A smart group will have the warrior round em up and tank, the rogue assists the warrior, as do the other non healing classes, and kill them one at a time, quickly.<br />
<br />
If Pallies suck as bad at getting aggro as you say, you might want to think about leveling up some warriors.<br />

The same thing we did in Uldaman back when we were all in our mid-40's and got the exact same pulls: <br />
- paladin MT starts attacking elite #1 and fires off AE.<br />
- paladin #2 grabs aggro on elite #2, assists MT and fires off AE.<br />
- paladin #3 assists MT, fires off AE.<br />
- rogue assists MT and enters full dps mode.<br />
- priest drops out of shadowform, bitches on Teamspeak, then heals MT.<br />
- paladins 2 and 3 heal themselves as necessary.<br />
<br />
Edit: if there are any casters in that mix, rogue first ganks them in about 6 seconds then returns to assisting MT.<br />
<br />
That situation presents zero difficulty with our current crew.  If they are undead mobs the paladins will smoke them in record time by using 2 AE's each and their nukes.<br />
<br />
For the 100th time: I only want to use rogue as MT on big single targets, not throughout an entire instance.  Beating normal pulls is not where we struggle, we are superbly equipped to handle huge pulls right now.  Unlike sap/poly, offtanking works on anything and nothing offtanks better than a paladin- it is our specialty.<br />
<br />
The shadowpriest should be able to solo the Princess. You have a wide area there once the giants on the bridge are dead. You can use that to your great advantage. Sometimes the MT concept isn't the best one. <br />

<br />
<br />
A five level difference is not a bad design in a level based game.<br />
It's also a role based game: Tank, healer, dps, cc.  5 levels does not suddenly make my paladin a better healer than a priest.  5 levels does not suddenly make my paladin a better dps class than a rogue.  5 levels does not suddenly give my paladin &quot;l33t&quot; cc abilities other than offtanking.<br />
<br />
So why should 5 levels make a dps class suddenly a better tank? That's my argument.  Note that rogue is the only class where this is applicable: I'm not worried about a hunter or mage outtanking me anytime soon. If your only counter to this is &quot;5 levels&quot; then we will simply have to agree to disagree, unless and until we catch up in levels and nothing has changed (my theory).<br />

then you will do even worse. See how well your pallies can heal when you are taking 600 + hits and 1100 + instants. These fights will not last 15 seconds, they will last much longer, for you.<br />

Temple is a neat zone. The common elites and trash are 47-51 in levels, and the end boss is a 55 elite. There are alot of linked groups of 4-8. There are a couple of puzzels to figure out. There is a great event that finishes up the Egg of Hakkar quest there too.<br />
<br />
I haven't grouped with rogues that often. I'm not too familiar with their capabilities - other than killing things quickly. I can tell you that mid 50s Eranikus was hitting my warrior pretty hard (200+ after shield block). I<br />

The warrior has multiple ways of gaining aggro on multiple opponents. Smack something, sunder it once, switch targets, Sunder, cleave, Switch targets. Taunt, sunder, cleave. back to main target. Kill it dead.<br />
<br />
Or Have an engineer warrior. Bombs are good solid starting aggro. My gnome warrior gadgyt is death on a very short stick. <br />
<br />
A thief will dodge yes. Alot yes. But a good 75% of the boss mob fights are not EQ design single guy standing there. They get multiples they get swarms They get all sorts of tomfoolery around. And a thief cant hold aggro lock on more than one opponent. Else all that dps from specials goes bye bye as you lose your combo points. (speaking from a level 59 thief here who has single grouped everything up to BRS on the alliance side.)<br />

Not to mention 3 fire elementals all elite. all 55th+ that all have AE. And cant be split easy. Good luck.<br />

You're right, it is laughable- so is the supposition that a rogue should ever tank better than a plate tank on content that gives exp.

Sundering multiple targets is neither easy nor instant the way a paladin's point blank AE spell is.  I've tried EZ Thro dynamite on my paladin as a substitute for ranged pulling and found that it does work for initial aggro but I go through too much for it to be viable.  I suppose if you have stacks and stacks of dynamite a warrior w/ dynamite can get enough initial aggro + sundering until the cows come home to hold aggro, but that doesn't sound like a really fun way to play.  Paladin AE does enough damage chained that heal aggro from adds rarely if ever transfers to the healer.<br />
<br />

I agree- in this kind of situation we will use the tried and true Three Musketeers method (All on one mob, one person on all mobs) where each person offtanks, then all assist off one.  That isn't where we run into issues, it's the single big target beatdowns with nasty AE's that screw us.  If only one person, the rogue, is getting AE'd we are golden- at least in theory. <br />
<br />
<br />
Have one of the palidens roll up an engineer warrior. Lots of goodness there for proper instance runs. Plus more importantly. It can be a very fun thing.<br />
I have a 30 warrior that I flirted briefly with making our MT, but they are nearly as brutal to level as a paladin. At this point I think we are going to stick with paladin as instance MT for the duration, even if that means some things will be more difficult.  The only question is whether the paladin or rogue will be MT on big single targets- on multiples the paladin still reigns supreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My stand on la pally nerf is this:  <br />
Paladins being the lowest dps class is probably appropriate considering their near priest level healing abilities.  However, if they cannot maintain aggro over other classes there is a problem.  Regardless of DPS, a tank that cannot hold the attention of mobs most of the time is not really tanking.  Paladins need a solid single mob taunt ability and Warriors need a similar ability, but for multiple mobs.  I don't know enough warriors to be able to comment on their abilities though.</div></div><hr />

We had a crew of 5 paladins until our late 20's or so when two of the crew got bored (I wish I had had as much foresight). L20-30 with the paladin quest weapon (Verigan's Fist) is the peak of paladin power.  It's all downhill from there as far as soloing goes.  <br />
<br />
Acting as MT in instances is still lots of fun- unless you've had 10+ mobs beating on you with damage shield up and AE going to see the &quot;damage rain&quot;, you just haven't lived in this game.  The screen is completely blanketed with damage scroll, it's awesome. :)<br />

Paladin heals draw little to no aggro by design, which is why we use them in spam flash heal mode or in heal chains instead of the priest.  The shadow priest alone outdamages the 3 paladins and the 3 paladins combined outheal the priest and do not get aggro (and wear 5K AC of plate even if they do).

I did not mean they actually have one, rather that was the perception, which is why there are so many pallies, and it seems, that the alliance has a shortage of warriors. Given what I have seen, and what people say, the last thing I would want in my group is a Paladin, since everyone says they cannot tank. I routinely humilate Paladins in pvp, and they are my favorite target because they cannot get away. No &quot;I win&quot; button, but for sure a &quot;it is going to take you over a minute to kill me if my buddies don't show up&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Iz's rogue is not going to be making anyone eat crow, at least not efficiently. Yes, I could tank a boss mob, if I had three dedicated healers, but boss fights are very rarely 1 mob alone.<br />
<br />
I am a 60 rogue Faern, and because of my build and gear, one of the toughest out there, me tanking is just stupid. I have gotten aggro in an attempt to alleviate some healing stress, it is not funny, and really not a bright thing to do.<br />
<br />
He will see, no doubts at all in my mind, upper level places, the yard trash makes the Princess in Maraudon look like nothing at all. The bosses are tough, real tough.

You figure out the math. I have 15 seconds of evasion, if it is up, which brings dodge from 22% or so to like 75%, during that time I damned well better get a feint off, or the healer is wasting his mana on me. A boss fight with one priest and one rogue doing all the damage is going to take a long time, long time.<br />
<br />
Nope. Typical decently equipped rogue from casual play will have 3500 hps or so unless you go very high stam route, typical warrior will have 4500, assume pallies roughly the same? Not to mention the blocks, the skills a real tank worth their ass will have to control aggro and mitigate damage. typical rogue will get tons of agility gear for an extra whopping 1 or 2% dodge, and somehow think that is better than an extra 500-600 hps. Typical rogue will be using daggers and doing low sustained dps, if tanking, going to be lower still. Typical rogue will not be heavy in the combat tree with the 5% dodge, 5% parry,  duel wield maxed and mace stun. If Iz is going that route, he will do much better, but still nothing compared to a real tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, given enough healers, you could have a mage tank. Would you want to? He is experiencing the (rightly so) offensive power, and defensive power of a rogue against light to medium mobs.<br />
<br />
In BRD my dps rarely dipped below 400, ranged from 400-700 at times(another nifty treat from warriors, some shout thing), with shaman totems too, I had to work my ass off if I actually wanted to get aggro from regular mobs, for fun. <br />

You crit a LOT more when you have high agility.<br />
My shaman has this agility totem.  It gives me something like 40 more agility when I drop it.<br />
There's also these quests out of that reddish zone south of Swamp of Sorrows that give you +50 stat 1 charge items.  One of them gives agility.<br />
Going from my mediocre ~50 agility up to about ~140 agility, I *very visibly* saw how many more crits I was getting.<br />
And for my shaman, every crit means I get 30% haste for my subsequent attacks.<br />
Now, rogues don't get the flurry buff like shaman and warriors do, but it still pumps up the dps.<br />

this  thinking is why I absoutely demolish enemy rogues. I just logged on a buddy's rogue who is quitting, he is focused heavy on agility as opposed to stamina.<br />
<br />
He has 4% worse crit chance, and 3% worse dodge because he does not have the same combat talents, so add 5% to crit and 5% to dodge and he stands at 1% better crit and 2% better dodge, at the expense of 700 hps, if he went combat like me.<br />
<br />
1% crit and 2% dodge is not worth 700 hps.<br />
<br />
<br />

Shaman can do some silly dps with a nice windfury proc on a  big two hander with flurry, thundering strikes, and grace of air totem. Think upper level one gives 60 + agility? Our shaman lay those down in dungeons and It really can give crazy dps combined with warrior battle shout.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Okay, we rocked Princess in MR last night w/ 55 rogue tanking.  She went down like a sack of bricks.  The funniest part of the night was the rogue bitching on Teamspeak &quot;dudes, I'm at 40%- HEAL HEAL HEAL&quot;. The rest of us were flat out dying laughing- I'm normally at 20% when I tank until one of the offtanks deigns to heal me.<br />
<br />
This was a perfect setup to use a rogue to tank because our only ranged dps was our shadow priest and her nasty AE is what screws us hard.  The rogue ran in, ambushed her, blew evasion and then just lit her up Detro' gangsta style.  After the first fear he never lost aggro again.  I had no idea how far the range was on our paladin flash heals- it's like halfway across the screen.  The only time his hps dropped was when he was eating her AE, otherwise he never got below 90%- granted with 500+ hps that would be difficult to do.  The 2nd time we farmed her the priest managed to die because he, being #2 on aggro list due to burning her down in shadowform, was too far away to get shielded when she feared the rogue.  Player error.<br />
<br />
Mill, no way in hell could a mage tank Princess effectively this way. Only a rogue could have done this. No other class can get aggro lock in melee and still dish out huge dps to kill the mob before the heal spammers run out of mana.  Anyways, that was a ton of fun- our 2nd time we went instance reset -&gt; loot in 38:43, not too shabby for a low dps crew.<br />

And yes, no reason a mage could not do that, no reason at all. With buffs their ac is not too much lower than a rogues, they can dish out massive damage with personal shields to help with interupts, and instant arcane explosion. You have three pallies sitting on their asses doing nothing but heal, be easy to keep mage alive, easy. You are taking a non-tanking class and using massive heals to keep them alive, on pretty weak mobs, nothing special about the rogue here man.

Iz, are you smoking crack buddy? Only a rogue can tank princess now?<br />
Only a rogue meets the requirements for what my crew needs on a big single target. High melee dps. Aggro lock. Near tank level defense.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Princess is not a very strong mob.<br />
She is the anti-paladin mob.  Her knockback AE has a casting time debuff involved that prevented our paladins from healing while in melee unshielded.  Zerging her was not an option- this worked flawlessly as only the rogue was getting AE'd and what does he care about casting? Nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does your whole group go out of their way to do things they are weak at?<br />
My crew functions like a toolbox- we use whatever is appropriate to the job at hand.<br />
<br />
<br />

Isn't one of those full of undead? We will eat that instance alive sideways if that's the case.  Have you seen the dps 3 paladins can put out on a pack of undead? It's insane.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, no reason a mage could not do that, no reason at all.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Did you even read? The reason the rogue works and a mage wouldn't is:<br />
1- does not need to cast to maintain aggro (remember her AE? That tends to cause a problem when you can't cast spells).<br />
2- doesn't get interrupted to layeth the smackdown.  Mage instants all have long cooldowns where the mage is contributing no aggro generation.<br />
3- doesn't ever stop doing dps (i.e. going oom)<br />
4- runs 10% less defense than me, our MT- a mage wouldn't even be in the same ballpark. A mage would get raped sideways from damage spikes.<br />
5- our rogue has 400 hps less than me and I'm a pure stamina build, he's a monkey (sta/agi) build.  If a mage went stamina build he'd have garbage for int, so no luck there.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is going to really throw you for a loop is boss mobs that summon mobs and stuff, can your pallies heal for long periods of time while getting beat on?<br />
No, because then we'll adjust our tactics accordingly.  And yes, we heal while getting beat on- that's why our first 5 talents are to gain a 70% chance to ignore spell interruption + we run concentration aura to reduce that by 25% further.  We cast big heals while we are getting literally mobbed, thanks. And flash heals are 1.5s cast, so that's np at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
How is your rogue specced btw? Hoping full on combat/stamina build.<br />
Not sure other than I know he has the +5% dodge/parry so that he can tank better.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know I think you are a good guy, I just really cannot fathom the logic here man. You will get pwned when you run into a halfway tough boss.<br />
Princess kicked our asses until we adjusted our tactics- now I'm the proud owner of a Thrash Blade, scepter and a bunch of other goodies from last night.  I look forward to our rogue tanking in the future as well when circumstances suggest that as the best option.  Naturally I will continue to post our experiences whether we succeed or fail.<br />
<br />
Please tell me some big tough single target bosses that you think would be a good candidate for this or ones that we should avoid.  Considering I never got below 50% mana and we all don't even have our aquemantas items yet, Princess could have tripled her incoming dps and the rogue would have been fine- but w/o his aggro lock that heal spam would have gotten aggro pong going almost immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fire giant dude in BRD good example of what I mean by a rogue tanking being bad, he hits for 600 +, instant 1100 aoe, tons of hps, level 57. He also summons level 50 ish goos that cruise around and attack people.<br />
<br />
I watched my roomate on a strath raid yesterday, he had to take a pee, so I played him for a second, a rogue in his group got aggro on something, forget what, I did not have time to get a heal off on him literally, was like bam bam bam dead. Rogues were stupid. They only had 3200-3400 hps too. One dumb ass 60 rogue had 2950 hps, I kid you not.<br />
<br />
I have + 121 agility and + 197 stamina, I am doing just fine. My attack power is a little lower than some rogues, but my dps is just silly.<br />

I don't think Iz is claiming that a Rogue can tank in most groups...just that for his peculiar group (4 healers + 1 rogue) it works, and it works well.<br />
<br />
Swap out the 3 paladins for anything else and I doubt this would even be possible.<br />

All that said, I still think Iz's rogue is going to get owned against some of the nastier mobs.  What he has going for him is a chain heal to spread heal aggro.

It's dpm is flat out horrid when used against a single target. It's not even that much damage, certainly nothing in the ballpark of a rogue dropping 5 pt evis's every 6 secs or so.  Even assuming AE chained was enough to hold aggro on one mob (highly doubtful), the mage would be oom long before he did enough damage.  Here's the stats on Arcane Explosion (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=659)  at our level- I oughta know, I played mage in beta. 243 - 263 damage for 390 mana.  That is flat out horrible dpm on single targets and that damage is inconsequential, even chained. A single sinister strike beats that and a rogue has way better defense and hps as well.  Mage tanking- no.<br />

<br />
And things will change, like I told you, when a boss is hitting you for 600 + and instant nuking for 1100, and you have two other elites rampaging around, the rogue will go down, fast.<br />
That isn't nearly enough dps to take down our rogue given the healing we can crank out.  Not close by a long shot unless the mob has more hps than we have mana.  I can't wait to try this guy out- at least after I get my Barman Shanker for my rogue hehe.<br />

<br />
absolute silliness here man, no comparison in hell with a warrior.<br />
<br />
Give a warrior a couple seconds and I cannot get aggro away from them no matter what. They can take damage easily that would make me die very quickly.<br />
<br />
They use more than sunder armor first of all. Shield bash, taunt, demoralizing shout, cleave for multiples No problem holding aggro on three critters and being healed. Can your rogue do that?<br />
<br />
Have you even grouped with a warrior? It really sounds like you have not.<br />
<br />
I am quite sure anyone here besides you will never attempt to say a rogue can tank or hold aggro better than a warrior. This isn't pro-rogue stuff anymore, it is lunatic asylum talk.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you are really just saying Paladins are the worst class in the world. If you were smart, the Paladin would tank and hold aggro as he can, and the rogue would load the dps and feint when gains aggro. Simple matter of healing power being wasted on the rogue.<br />
<br />
By the way, your dps with barman shanker compared to mine with bonesnapper will not even be close. You realize SS is instant strike yes? Delay matters not at all, all about weapon damage man. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tanks healing, healers damaging, and soft squishy class tanking. Might work for maraudon, but it is still very silly and wasteful. But heh, if you want to spend twice the amount of mana healing, go ahead man. Very soon you will run into boss mobs that hit literally 2x to 3x as hard as the princess, will the rogue have 2x or 3x the hps?<br />
<br />
I will go out on a limb right now, and will test this next good instance run, I will venture that a 60 warrior, takes half as much damage as me, on average. Any way to save combat text and parse it? You can use your numbers in theory about absorbtion and dodge but I don't buy it, from the damage I take and how weakly I hit warriors in comparsion to other rogues. Best evis ever on a pally/warrior I think was 865, best on another rogue has been 1700 or so. SS are usually 200-250 on a plate class, 350-450 on a rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
last brd run, best warrior did I think 360,000 damage total. I did 2,600,000 and I almost never had aggro.<br />

I know this is directed at Iz, and although I disagree that rogues make the best choice for the tank role on single boss mob encounters, keep in mind, he doesn't mind spending healing mana because he has 3 healers in one party.  He ended off with half mana, so I'd say his strat on that specific mob worked (as in sure, not terribly efficient, but they lived, the boss didn't).  I don't think that this one victory should dictate any sort of general truth.  I think his party could have done it faster/more efficiently had they swapped out a pally for a warrior.</div></div><hr />

To Millman and Tarthug as well: I agree, a warrior holds aggro on single targets just fine.  That is not the issue.  On a mob like Princess that has a nasty AE and a crew with a priest as the only ranged dps we cannot simply fight her toe to toe and expect to win.  If we replaced a paladin with a warrior and the other 2 paladins with hunters it would be a walk in the park.  Of course then our huge pulls would become difficult and we'd have problems simply surviving overpulls.<br />
<br />
Our strategy, which we will continue to employ whenever appropriate, plays to our strengths, namely survivability and healing.  If rogue/shadow priest dps weren't so over the top, taking 3 classes out of dps completely would not even be viable to take down boss mobs.  Fortunately, rogue dps is out of control insane and shadow priest dps is not far behind.  Vampiric embrace is just icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I play a warrior, and I will concede that warriors have trouble holding aggro on more than two mobs at once. However, warriors and paladins have a very synergistic relationship that overcomes this issue.<br />
<br />
For most of my grouped time on the climb to 60 I was with one or two guild paladins. When playing with paladins in the group I don't worry about holding aggro on everything. I don't need to because paladins make excellent off tanks. I let the paladins use their AE and other abilities to grab initial aggro on everything for multi-pulls. Then I'll taunt one and start a shield block/revenge cycle to hold aggro. This lets whichever dps class is in the group go to town without having to worry about getting smacked around. Often it is even a good idea to have the paladins do initial healing for the warrior as well. Especially if the warrior is pulling. This builds up more hate for the paladins among the mobs and makes the priest/druid less likely to draw heal aggro when they start in with the life saving.<br />
<br />
Exactly. My point is that given sufficient healing, a rogue makes a far better tank than a paladin and probably even warrior since dps &gt; sunder for aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Ugh! I don't know what warriors you've been around, but it sounds like they need WoW school. There's a common misconception among warriors that Sunder Armor is the best and only way to hold aggro. This is not true. Simply using Defensive Stance increases the threat generated by the warrior. Yes it lowers damage output by 10%, but it also lowers damage taken by 10% and grants additional threat to each attack. I find that Revenge has a much better chance of holding a mob's attention than Sunder Armor. Disarm is a big pisser-offer too. That said, the warrior doesn't have to tank all of the time. Paladin or a pet got aggro and you're only fighting one thing? Fine, let them tank. I've got this nice two-hander that can help kill it faster. There comes a time, though, for the good of the group, when you have to put away the toy, break out the sword and shield, kick the target in the shins and chant, &quot;Hey batta batta batta!&quot;<br />

I'm not saying that one of you should reroll as a warrior. I think that you found a good way to take the group that you have, turn it on its ear, and make things work for you. But don't think for a moment that a warrior's inability to hold aggro on multiple mobs is a problem when he has a paladin or two to work with.</div></div><hr />

Embrace the shadow!<br />

Our rogue on Princess was only doing around 120-140 dps due to fear and issues with tanking. Our shadow priest, 9 levels lower, was doing 160+ dps.  I cannot even begin to imagine his dps when he hits the 50+ game. For that matter I cannot begin to imagine the dps of my undead shadow priest since he gets an additional shadow dot that no other race does (to my knowledge).<br />

Yeah the lvls certainly play a part. When my rogue was behind my wifes paladin Id never take aggro. When I caught up and was same lvl I could take it at times and was using feint. She put on two more lvls and I'm behind again and no problem with her holding aggro. If i was two lvls over her Id know I'd be getting aggro from her.</div></div><hr />

Read again. The rouge in her group is higher level than the paladins. The paladins are also trying to avoid aggro by staying out of melee range and spam healing. These two combined means the rouge has no trouble locking the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Ran my little gnomish destroyer of squirrels through Stockades last night. (Level 26 warrior)<br />
<br />
My roomate is the priest keeping me alive. And we had a druid a warlock and a thief as well. All around my level. <br />
<br />
A couple times we got a bad pull (Thief had never ever used sap in her life GoGo pickupgroups) Say 7 or so Mobs. I would lead with a demorlizing shout, and a thunderclap. Switch to definsive and start taunting, (Decided screw that lets have some fun) dropped a Sheep (Big explosive, then a Solid Dynamite, (another goodly sized explosive) Popped into Battle stance and stancesets equipped my honkin big axe. Then fired off Challenging shout (Ae taunt) and retribution (= free riposete per attack incoming on all monsters attack me) My rage bar practicly popped off like an overheated Thermometer, and I started Cleaving like a mad gnome. <br />
<br />
Noone in the group got touched. Just me. on a 7 pull of elites. All comparable level.  <br />
<br />
We had several 3 pulls. Mainly because we could handle it. I would charge in, then back up slapping cleave. Swap targets and sunder the unhurt one, and would be back at the group. With solid aggro on three. The first would drop in a few seconds and I was cleaving the other two. And plop plop they do drop. <br />
<br />
Now I know people will say this is stockades. It will change. And such. Well guess what. I play Feather as well, (My level 59 thief) and our groups warrior (Moreth) Has almost zero trouble tanking as well on multiple opponents. And I still don't have him convinced on stance swapping, (He seems to have some moral obligation against Bezerker stance.)<br />
<br />
And his dps aint too shabby either. Flurry and such can hurt in a balanced Agility and Strength lineup. <br />
<br />
The thief main tank think is a neat idea. Good luck with it. But I still think you are hammering away at that oak board. <br />

Quick aside about shadow priests in general and ours in particular.  Priests are boring and tedious to play in groups if you're stuck healing- you barely get to see the dungeon and the fights because you're glued to the party's hp bars.  That is a really awful way to play and results in a burned out priest rather rapidly.<br />
<br />
Given that we have a surfeit of healing in our crew, it makes more sense for the priest to run in dps mode because 1 shadow priest does more dps than 2 paladins combined.  And 2 paladins can easily replace a priest when they heal.  When you also consider that the priest is running vampiric embrace, he is healing 20% of all shadow damage he inflicts to the entire party.  Since we normally have at least 3, usually 4-5 people taking damage at any one time, the priest clocking 160 dps is also healing 32 dps * 3-5 for virtually no mana.  With just 4 people getting hurt (95% of the time, esp. on mobs that AE) the priest is not only dishing out 160 dps but he's healing 128 dps simultaneously.  A holy priest isn't 1/2 this valuable for a crew like ours- the last thing we need is more healing.<br />
<br />
Shadow priests 40+ are also a blast to solo.  Granted getting to L40 soloing is pretty awful, but not nearly as awful as anything besides shadow spec.  Our shadow priest solos on mobs even con to +4 (never lower level).  Mobs do not last longer than 15 seconds and he only has to stop and drink every 4-5 mobs, if that.  He never leaves shadowform and never gets hurt.  He is a flat out death machine in solo play.  I have no idea how holy priests do it- I think I'd rather eat broken glass (or go solo a paladin) than try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Well, I'm an 11 disc /20 holy /13 shadow spec level 53 priest, and I do ok.  <br />
<br />
I think I have a bit of an unusual build, but it's been working the way I want.  <br />
<br />
In the peculiar circumstances of Iz's group, the 54 rogue probably is the best tank.  It's always better to slap the overleveled character on the boss if they can keep aggro - which rogues can.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, it is nuts to say that rogues tank effectively comparable to plate classes.  They don't.  <br />
<br />
When I'm in the situation of healing a group through an instance, the overaggroing rogue sucks a heck of a lot more mana out of me than an equivalent level plate class.  It's just not close.  <br />
<br />
Warriors definitely hold aggro the best.  Paladins can actually do ok in some situations - at least some paladins can.  I don't know if that's a spec build issue or not.  <br />
<br />
But if I had a group with a rogue 5 levels higher than 3 paladins, I would have him tank too.  Iz's tactics were smart given the tools he had.  <br />
<br />
But to apply a more general theory from it is misguided.  <br />
<br />
If I were in a group with 3 paladins, maybe I'd become a shadow priest too, but I generally play randomly and get any old pickup group.  For this, I like my spec.  I'd like to get more disc talents, but I'm running out of points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">BTW, for fun we went back to Mauradon with 4 (rogue, shadow priest, paladin X 2) and we found that 2 paladins spamming flash heals was more than enough to let the rogue tank.  Given how little he gets hurt I think we could even trio the place.<br />
<br />
So who can give me dirs to the entrance to BRD? I want to take a &quot;fun run&quot; there with my crew to let the rogue tank everything and see how badly we wipe.  The rest of the party won't be able to do much besides heal, but with 4 people healing the rogue I imagine he will live a long time.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the record: heals are never resisted and there is no level limit to land a heal.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">heheheh iz, I will gladly tell ya ho to get there.<br />
<br />
From badlands, know where kargoth is? the horde town? South from there, entrance to searing gorge is on the west wall of zone, go in, stay left, blackrock depths entrance in a wooden stair like thing in the south side of the zone, follow road sw and cannot miss it. You enter some big doors, go left, run down the chain, go through the tower, down, take another chain, from there head straight out and left, will eventually see a straight hallway with a roaming fire elemental and some dorfs, zone is in there.<br />
<br />
Prepare to be absolutely bitch smacked around, especially at level 54. you will get pulls of 4 minimum mostly, level 54 or so elite. At 60, alone, I can take just about any critter in there(non boss), taking at least half damage, but then of course, you have the other 4-5 to worry about :)<br />
<br />
Dogs are non-elite, so go down quick, but still hit hard, and see through stealth, careful of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
For fun, stay left as soon as get in, pick the lock, stay left, will come to a &quot;T&quot; with packs of roaming guards, dorfs all, 1 officer per group(seems to be hunter class with paladin shield ability), 1 or 2 medics, and 1 or 2 soldiers. You cannot split them up unless have mage or improved sap rogue. if you manage to kill all the groups leading left at the &quot;T&quot; will come to a level 57 giant fire golem, he casts an 1100 point aoe, will hit a level 60 rogue for 600 +, and unleashes level 50 or so oozes durin fight that attack the healers. Oo I wanna see Mr. Rogue tank that. A quick burst of 2300 or so damage will not be so fun to heal, especially while the oozes are hitting the healers. Did I mention the guy has like a bazillion hps? Wil take a rogue and priest I would say, at least a minute, withy 4-6 5 point evis's if you can live that long.<br />
<br />
It will be complete, and total carnage.</div></div><hr />

I'll let slide that you called me a &quot;ho&quot;- thanks for the l33t info. :) The problem is that it won't be the rogue dying, it'll be us when things go south.  That filthy whore always vanishes when I call suicide, so the rest of us get to eat the repair costs and he doesn't.<br />
<br />
We're doing Sunken Temple tomorrow, our first time there but I don't foresee any big difficulties.  Apparently our rogue beat it with only 3 other people in a pu group, highest of which was 55 and only one healer. I just hope there's decent loot to be had because after ST it's on to BRD, baby!<br />
<br />
BTW, last night our rogue dragged our priest and I through the faction farming to get through tunnel to Winterspring.  The mobs we had to kill were all +3 - 4 over my level and we were fighting the Chinese to tag them. This is where a paladin really shines: running into huge clumps of mobs, firing off the AE to make sure they're tagged, then standing there getting the living piss pounded out of him until the rogue shows up to kill them.  I never broke 40 dps and never held aggro on MA but man oh man could I survive a huge pounding.<br />
<br />
Know what else works well? Pulling 4-5 mobs and flash healing the rogue who's tanking. All the mobs but the one the rogue is on are now beating on you.  Given my talents and the 1.5 second cast time of my flash heal, I didn't even notice them beating on me. I suspect this is how we'll do BRD at first, that way the rogue is only tanking one mob at a time and the lads are standing around eating damage and healing. It's going to be hella fun when my rogue catches up and I can double team mobs with our tank rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">More fun with our little experiment last night.  We went into Sunken Temple for the first time with the following crew:<br />
- 58 rogue<br />
- 51 paladin (me)<br />
- 50 paladin<br />
- 48 shadow priest<br />
<br />
I can no longer come close to holding aggro on either the rogue or shadow priest.  If feint/fade fails they are tanking.  So, why fight it? Found a way to make heal aggro work to our advantage.<br />
<br />
Rogue becomes MA and MT on a 6 pull. He pulls the whole lot of them and starts getting whaled on.  I immediately begin spamming my flash heal on him which is mega aggro for every mob but the one he's ganking. I then unload my AE and mobs 2-5 are glued to me.  Paladin #2 AE's and heals me. Shadow priest runs full out dps mode with vamp embrance going for healing.  On subsequent mobs I have huge threat built up from my AE and heal spamming and I get to (gasp) play as MT again.<br />
<br />
I really want to test this in BRD and soon- getting impatient!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I'm confused. It sounds like the paladin is tanking after the initial round of heals, and the rouge is offtanking, doing cleanup. How does that make him the MT again?</div></div><hr />

My read is that the Rogue souldn't hold the aggro of the adds versus heal aggro, so it is only the first mob that is tanked by the Rogue.  Since Iz started this with the idea of letting the Rogue MT the boss mobs, he is kinda halfway now.  Rogue gets to pick which one mob he will tank.  Paladin gets the rest.</div></div><hr />

Correct. If you look at the thread title it's on bosses that the rogue makes the better tank due to similar defensive ability and rock solid aggro (really the hardest part).  Tanking zone trash really wasn't much of an issue to this point. <br />
<br />
However, we've now discovered a way to maximize our effectiveness by having the rogue act as MA and MT on the first mob in a big pull. This for us has resolved our aggro problems sufficiently, which is the real stumbling block for having a paladin tank.<br />
<br />
It's not that paladins can't tank well, it's that all the plate armor in the world is meaningless if no one is hitting you. It's also fun using the game's design against itself- a paladin capitalizes on heal aggro to get aggro lock (usually bad) and a rogue capitalizes on dps aggro to get aggro lock (usually bad). We're making what is usually a negative into a positive for our situation.</div></div><hr />

Good plan. Our rogue doesn't have imp sap either (that'll be left to my rogue I'm sure) so I'll pull as normal by simple level aggro.<br />
<br />
I still can't make up my mind between the 31/8/13 build or the 22/8/21 build. Seal fate or Initiative/Imp Sap? Still worried they're ganna fix the seal fate bug.  I also can't decide what's the best dagger build for solo PVE at my level (mid 30's). Remorselessness + imp. backstab means I start most fights with crit stab. If I switched to imp. ambush I could start all fights with crit ambush, but then I'd be postponing when I get cold blood. Tough call.<br />
<br />
It is nice actually having 3 talent lines that matter, unlike 1 on the paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I have pulled as a thief in BRD. When I can sap safely. The run back to the tank with all hell chasing me is easy with sprint. (also we are on teamspeak and the warrior can Shoot right as I am sapping.  and get the damage aggro on him)  With a Paladin it would be alot easier to just have him drop a consicration and run through it with the pack. <br />
<br />
We tend to split up the swarm pulls. The groups paly and I whack the caster/ smaller pulls while the warrior gets the beats from most everything else. Then I chew the non elites up with feint dropping the abuse to the paly.<br />
<br />
It works, and works well. I also play off tank when I have to Evasive will keep me up long enough for the warrior to get over and sunder it off me. <br />

In Stratholme we usually have a Warrior grab one, I Consecrate the rest and AOE Holy Wrath. That gets their attention FAST. Combine with a big hit or two from a 2HS (Doombringer), and I am an aggro magnet.<br />

neither is good if you want to be a &quot;tank&quot;, you will be doing most damage from the front, I advise going mace spec, most of the combat tree, dodge, parry, precision, DW, BF, AR. I think the assasin talents that improve evis and crit strikes. Basically everything to improve damage and survivability.<br />
<br />
We inherited a 58 rogue from a  buddy who is taking a break, we leveled him to 60, totally respecced him and changed his gear around, he kicks ass now, before was a 3400 hps mediocre fighter at best. Get a bonesnapper main hand, and monkey or bear off hand mace and just crush. Barely lost any agility, but now 3913 hps with alot of room for improvement.<br />
<br />
Iz, if you tried a mace combat build, you would never, ever want to to use daggers again in pve, never. It is night and day. I respecced Mill to try out daggers, with a damned good dagger, and had to heal every 2-4 fights in Sm twinkin, with combat, need to rest every ten fights or so.<br />
<br />
Give it a try man, seriously. No class, period, that I have seen, can solo as fast and as reliably as a combat specced, high hp rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They will be fixing the seal fate bug, they have said so, and improved sap, to me, is not worth it.</div></div><hr />

That's a nice build, def. worth considering.  I think for me it really comes down to a matter of style preference. I like doing the rogue type stuff, like sneaking around, landing huge ambushes/stabs, etc... An ambush + remorselessness build is prolly going to be my next respec to speed up my solo PVE time.  Combat is awesome but ss, ss, ss, evis ad nauseum just bores me to tears.  But given how easy it is to earn money as a rogue I'm sure I'll get my respec cost up to 50g in short order as I try everything out.<br />
<br />

As for pve, you will never come close as a  dagger rogue man, I tried the ambush style, it is awful, the only thing you will do, is kill light armored mobs a hair faster, you will do worse at everything else.

I did respec #2 today and tried out imp ambush + remorselessness. Man that is a fun as hell build even at L35. 100% chance to crit ambush at the start of each fight- mobs are beginning the fight at 50-60% and this is on melees (tested on ogres in AM). If I switch to caster mobs it will be a bloodbath.<br />
<br />
I basically crit ambush, swap weapons to put high dmg weapon in main, and just spam ss and evis. When mob dies, quick loot, weapon swap and go gank the next mob. If I'm careful I can usually get a pickpocket off, which I love.  I have MoD and for me it's been huge, gives me a lot bigger cushion on my stealth approach.<br />
<br />
When I get Thrash blade I'll prolly give combat a go, that thing hits like a truck. I guess I just love the fact that all 3 rogue talent lines have pros and cons- that is so not the case for paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">One thing, might want to at least consider mace spec instead of sword, bonesnapper is comparable damage with good stats, and the rogue sword talent doesn't seem to work properly yet. mace stun is a huge, huge deal, often times it will go of several times a fight and can save your bacon.<br />
<br />
Dealing with multiples I found was the biggest drawback to ambush style, you just do not have the tools to wreck mulitples. Also, when you run out of energy, ambush build no good, however, I pvp alot too, I need to be able to last and dish out damage, rather than &quot;gank&quot;. I hate ganking, but ambush is good for that.<br />
<br />
Thrash is 124 damage or so?</div></div><hr />

Totally.  There's a couple of things you have to factor in to make the ambush solo PVE build work:<br />
1- only grind on low hps casters<br />
2- only grind on mobs -1 to -3 to your level so that you rarely miss ambush (and to keep their hps low relative to your own)<br />
3- use slow high damage dagger to ambush, then swap to slow high damage sword/mace to finish off the mob w/ ss/evis<br />
<br />
I broke both rules in my initial testing which resulted in bandaging every 3-4 mobs, but still had a blast. I agree you're totally hosed if you miss the ambush or the mob isn't dead after you blow your initial energy wad. Seal fate and relentless strikes will really help pump up the burst damage- the whole point of this build is massive front loaded damage so that the rogue tanks for a very short time.  This is not a tank build at all, I get creamed fighting toe to toe for any length of time.<br />
<br />
Thrash is 124 damage or so?<br />
Yeah and with a sweet proc. BTW, how did you get your heartseeker plans? I'd love to make one of those someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">AH, 150 gold for the plans. Waited a long time, they were usually 200-250 minimum. I hear that the barman shanker is just as good really, much easier to obtain, it can be soloed by a smart level 60 rogue.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">You just sneak in, toss beer on the ground, a little further each time to move the adds, then solo the boss. For that you need shadow resistance potions. Barman shanker isnt the *best* dps dagger, but it has the best damage spread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Cool, I hope to have heartseeker or barman's at some point. I was finally able to test my new ambush build on the appropriate mobs (low hps casters -2 to -4 levels). I don't have a frame of reference vs. combat to compare to, but this is the most fun I've had in wow yet.<br />
<br />
If you follow the points I listed above to ambush solo PVE you just wreck mobs. 400-600 crits to start each fight and I don't have a good ambush dagger yet. The poor casters I'm fighting are lucky to have 30% of their hps left after the ambush.  If I'm even able to evis it's a rarity. I finally discovered why there are stealth cooldown talents- I'm killing so fast that I have to wait for stealth to repop before I can go gank the next mob. I also have so much time in between ganks that I can usually get a pickpocket off first, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Man I can't express enough how happy I am with this build.  Problem is after I max lethality I don't know what I want next the most- imp backstab (for grouping), preparation, cold blood or seal fate. But these are good problems to have.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Not a chance. Even con nonelites chew me up if I try and tank them. &quot;Gank not tank&quot; is the motto of my build. Soloing elites was trivial on my paladin but other than bragging rights it accomplished nothing since it was a 3 minute affair.<br />
<br />

I just picked that up at L52 but have yet to use it. It adds to an already formidable defense that rarely gets used other than on big pulls in instances. I basically see it as a free cheal for our rogue every 2 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">If you haven't gotten them yet, ruthlessnes to relentless strikes kick ass, which will get your point pre-req's up enough for cold blood and seal fate. From the sound of your build the pont generation from crits ala seal fate would outweigh the amount of benefit you would get working your way down the subtlety tree to premeditation.</div></div><hr />

Can you explain ruthlessness? I had that and relentless before I respec'd and picked up 13 points in subtlety. Is it supposed to add a point AFTER you do a finishing move? Or is it supposed to add a point BEFORE you do a finishing move, assuming you're not yet at 5 cp's? I never saw an extra cp so I figured the talent was bugged and relentless strikes was not worth 4 talents to me.  I figured if I went for seal fate that I'd pick those 4 up last after cold blood.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have with seal fate is that I can't max it until L54 which means I won't get imp backstab until 58-60. I'm also still debating seal fate + ruthless/relentless vs. imp sap + preparation + initiative. I think subtlety has more utility but seal fate will be better dps- I'm just impatient.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">As a combat guy, I can solo level 57-58 elites, if they are not buff ones like the wandering abominations. 59 and above sometimes gets ugly. Casters are also much easier than warrior types if they don't have crazy ass knockdown stuff. I find myself off tanking alot, and I eat up my entire health bar and need to use evade sometimes and ar, I usually kill my mob before the two warriors and other guys combined :)<br />
<br />
Cappi, sounds like you have been around, crimson conjurers in strath, how do you deal with them? I was getting flipped all over the place, and they had bunch of pets running all over the place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">It  gives you a chance for an free combo point after using a finishing move. So if I use a 5 point eviserate or whatever I have a chance to get 25 energy back, plus 1 combo point. I lot of the time I just use it for a quick slice n' dice to finish off the mob. I'm not sure what the situation is with your rogue and grouping, but it might be worth putting off improved bs if you do tend to solo a lot.<br />
<br />
*edit* No clue about the crimson guys. The stuff about the barman shanker was information I got from another post about how solo the boss. I'm only level 54 since a bunch of friends of mine just started playing I've been leveling a shaman more than my rogue.</div></div><hr />

Try it out and tell me what you think... It actually helped me QUITE a bit on the doability side... What I mean by that is that there was stuff I just COULD NOT DO without it. Namely at lvl 50, take down a lvl 49 elite fire warrior in searing gorge. I could win but it was 50/50 ish... depending alot on the type of healing potion I had on hand... but with that ability it adds basically an extra complete heal, and makes it basically guarenteed. Not sure how it helps against those 48 -49 elite shaman there... I couldn't even begin to take one of them down before this... I doubt I will be able to now with it either... 235 dmg per hit... then casts that freeking shock spell for 450ish dmg NON crit, then heals... I had one to about 90% once before I died.<br />
<br />
Those for me are becomming a wall mob...One that defies all of my abilities.... sort of like soloing that first hill giant in EQ when your like lvl 34 and it takes forever..... Gonna have to figure out how to take one of those bastards down. <br />
<br />
With it and 3 points into improved healing... I am considering going 100% str enchants everywhere I can just to eek out a few more dps....</div></div><hr />

At L52 I'm approaching 4k hps and 6k AC. I can take the beating of a lifetime and not go down, even without using divine favor. But I can't hold aggro on single mobs and I can't solo efficiently- that is game breaking for me.<br />

That's putting lipstick on a pig. I guess it depends how you want to play and if you have access to a regular crew or guild. Our paladins are all semi-retired other than on crew nights.  The only good news I've gotten lately is that our rogue has been running BRD with another crew of 3 paladins (no priest, no warrior, no mage- no holy trinity) and wrecking the place, so I know that our crew makeup will still work. <br />
<br />
But when your tanks are unable and/or unwilling to level in solo play, it will be a long damn time before we hit 60- naturally our rogue has already hit 60.</div></div><hr />
