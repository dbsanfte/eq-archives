<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to find a spot that will be good XP for the shaman, at least halfway decent for the warrior, yet not get the shaman spanked into next week if the first slow gets resisted.  Anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
58 SHM has JBB, Spear No Fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make sure warrior gets agro before casting slow.  I would cast torpor on warrior when he was incoming with mob and have him taunt several times while i cast epic dot on mob - then I would slow - almost completely eliminated agro that way.  If no torpor in spell book I think I would let warrior get to 60 taunting all the way and then cast slow.  I too died bunches after slow resists before making sure warrior had good agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IF you can handle the annoying shrooms FG would work. Finished off 59 on both my warrior and shaman  there. The warrior will be able to single pull the patches and really doesnt matter who has aggro since they spend so much time casting instead of melee. <br />
<br />

    Just buff your disease up as much as you can. They respawn pretty quick so can just keep killing them. Not my fave place to go but i solo there sometimes with my shaman and did get through 59 without totally losing my mind. Was actually more interesting before 60 because i couldnt single pull and wanted to keep ahead of the spawn. <br />
<br />
       Couple other places i guess toilers in ME , ahkeva. Sure i can think of some other places i might of done with my shaman/warrior combo but alot going on here today so will try to think of more later. Good luck</div></div><hr />
