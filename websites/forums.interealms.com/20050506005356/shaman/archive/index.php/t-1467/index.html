Can Alchemy be made a bit better?<br />
<br />
We are looking into Alchemy a bit.  There’s a lot of stuff involved with it we have to be careful of with infringing on other classes.  But we are aware of some of the issues with it.<br />
<br />
The Luclin potions which went in are really really nice, but they are also pretty difficult.  It alleviated some of the concerns a little bit but not nearly enough.  We might look at adjusting the durations and the negative effects on some of the buffs.  <br />
<br />
Is he honestly saying that the Luclin potions are still too good?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are some of the Luclin potions so hard to make?<br />
<br />
There were some, like the clarity one, which could only be put into the game on the proviso that you needed the AAXP Alchemy in order to make them fairly regularly.<br />
<br />
Kindly go to hell.  Giving us an AAXP skill is one thing, nerfing the game to require it is a cheap stunt.  People are already wondering if channelling was nerfed to make AAXP channelling more attractive. Still, my beef is not the skill required for alchemy -- it's the insane cost of ingrediants.  Only an idiot would pay 200pp for a 600 mana potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, call me a conspiracist as well, but I seemed to notice a decrease in SoW speeds and it still tickles the back of my head every once in awhile. &quot;This should be faster but it isn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
I can kinda see where they're coming from making the AAXP portion of the alchemy skill required for the braincandy potions. At the same time, I'm just another dog waiting for Verant to throw me the proverbial bone (concerning alchemy).<br />
<br />
As far as cost goes, *shrugs* I'm by far a rich shaman (a.k.a broke). But mana-potions, gate-potions, heck even DS's. This is something that the shaman class doesn't get to do but other classes excell at. There's gotta be some sort of cost to it for it all to balance out. Not saying it doesn't suck... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If no one is willing to pay for it, it's still worthless no matter it you never fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Krytog<br />
<br />
Unless I was actively looking for ways to get rid of money (in other words, was an end-game shaman with a barrel of money and nothing to spend it on), what possible reason would I have for working this skill (up above SoW potion level, I mean, which I hear can be done pretty cheaply)?<br />
<br />
I'll never make money at it- or if I do, not enough to justify the cost I poured into learning it.   <br />
<br />
The effects?  I could just shout &quot;Paying &lt;half the potion price&gt; for &lt;potion effect&gt;&quot; and get a million tells.  The one or two instances where it would be really useful (when no one is around or when I need a stacking exploit) just don't justify the thousands and thousands of plat required to level it up.  I could buy serious upgrade gear for that!<br />
<br />
The AAXP thing is hiliarious... has anyone here even thought about putting points into that skill?  Let's face it- in order to prevent alchemy from being overpowered, it's been defined such that it's only useful to a money-is-no-object end-game raiding guild that needs that little extra boost and is willing to pay to get it (and why not?  Everything they loot is no drop anyway- what good is money to them?)<br />
<br />
It bugs me that our class-specific trade skill was forced into this role, but given the nature of what alchemy is I think I understand it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to such a guild how useful is a 20 resist  -10stat potion? Or any of the +Stat potions for that matter? My guess, nadda. The DS comes in handy but it isnt something to make a profit off of.<br />
<br />
They dont need to make potions that enhance killing stuff. Potions that helped skll ups and utility would be far more lucrative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I actually thought about putting the first level of alchemy mastery to get the class title faster :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, there are mobs where the potion damage shields and potion mana regeneration are vital--either the mob overwrites the others, or the mana spent by the clerics is so obscene as to actually need KEI, bard song, potion, and their self buff to have a hope in hell of keeping up.<br />
<br />
How many of us are at that level . . .?  Darn few.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking VI has a more basic misunderstanding.  Their moms had it all wrong, and they thought the old addage was, &quot;If it ain't fixed don't fix it.&quot;  :p<br />
<br />
/rude VI!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's a big difference between the 120pp (with AAxp alchemy) mana potion which lasts 20 minutes and the 31 dmg stackable DS potion that lasts 15 minutes and costs about 30pp to make with great alchemy skill.  One is useful.  One is not.  <br />
I do use the DS potions when I solo or duo something very hard.  I never use the mana potions, it's simply not worth the extremely marginal effect.  <br />
<br />
What's sad is when a high level druid or wizard asks about it, and I have to tell them what the effect is.  They're like ok, how's about I pay you 150pp per ten stack?  I just have to politely cough and offer them a single charge for that much.  At which point they laugh and port away.  Which is aggravating to me, since it cost me enormous amounts of plat to get alchemy to max, cost me tons of exping time to get the AAexp alchemy, and I'm selling the potion at cost.  <br />
<br />
I think Verant didn't really wanna see these potions being made.  Yak is the old crew tho.  Might be time for him to go the way of the Bradisaur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Which mob do you use the mental potions for Chutoi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The DS potions are also a vital part of DS strategy for unslowable mobs such as the Avatar of War. 31 points a hit on a mob that regularly hits 4+ times every two seconds adds up fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">VI made sure alchemy would have no real use beyond shrink and SOW potions.   I maxed my alchemy just because I had already gone the distance and the end was in sight.   These days you cannot sell gate potions (why bother when Wizards can TL you anywhere for fraction of cost), stat enhancing potions (that negative to one and &lt; 1 hour lasting time detracts big time) and most utility potions that slow casting or very low in time usage.   Those clarity potions?  Lol junk all the way and that was the intention.   <br />
<br />
My advice to any shaman starting alchemy...go no further than 70ish for shrink potions and leave it there.  At least you can make something from SOW and Shrink potions.<br />
<br />
FYI on DS potions...do not stack with some ranger buffs that tanks prefer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I refuse to make potions these days unless we really really need an extra damage shield for a big mob. Guildies have to plead with me to get me to make stuff, I tell them to get them off shaman getting the skill up.<br />
<br />
The skill is an utter waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know a Shaman who just dinged 60... His guildies are always asking me for potions. One day I finally asked them why not ask [ - ] They said he never practiced Alchemy. I thought to myself, hmmm, what kind of shaman is that? Now, I realize he is the smart one and I wasted 15k on a useless skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">alchemy = borken<br />
<br />
I haven't bothered to skill up in over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I trivialized SoW then stopped.  It's just not worth the time money and effort to master the skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got mine up to 80 so that I dont ever really fail on SoW potions.  Would like to get it up further but the cost is way too ridiculous.  Even if they just reduced the cost of the gate ones by 50% to about 75pp I would be tempted to spend the cash to max alchemy as I would be tempted to use the damn things.  Instead I have started a druid on my second account - seems like less hassle to get that char to mid 40's then it is to get alchemy to 180.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got my skill to 120. I recieve daily requests from my guildies (mostly for SoW) potions.  Stat potions for twinks, DS potions for raids and I'm being pushed to do gate potions (not sure why when my guild is on dragon/dorf faction and they can do the thurg gate thingy themselves).  I'm raising alchemy, mostly because I like it, not because its all that usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I do a raging business selling Innothule gate potion 10 packs at 2100pp each.<br />
<br />
1) Easy access to port sits (SRo, and Feerrot)for group/raid pickups<br />
2) Easy access to new CT<br />
3) Great way for melees who go LD or just have to camp early to get out of an unpleasant area (My guild is currently in the process of farming sontalak en masse for ST keys, and many of our melees camp out and end up getting stuck in WW. I make gates for them at cost, and they love me for it...to the point of frequent overpayments just for the convenience factor).<br />
<br />
With the ability to get skill above the 170 trivial, and a philosopher's stone, my current record is 30 consecutive gate potion combines with ZERO failures. That's over 400pp profit on each 10 stack.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I'm the only one on my server who has caught onto this. Business started out a little slow, but is building up tremendously. I sold 4 10 stacks to someone just yesterday. Thx to pocket 1kpp for 5 minutes of combining. At the rate sales are increasing, I figure that the skill will have paid off the 35kish that I've spent getting to 173 in about a month.</div></div><hr />
