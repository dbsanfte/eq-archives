<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been thinkin about this for a while, and its been bugging me. When I first started my toon it was my first EQ char, so i didnt know much about stats, what to put them into, etc. I spread them out like a fool... not really knowing what to put them to.<br />
<br />
I think itd be a neat idea if verant gave customers a one-time option to replace your stats, in case you fudged them up but dont wanna reroll, etc. Knowing them theyd charge us for it :D but it could be something like how we can just change the face in options....<br />
<br />
I think itd be a nice idea to give the people who first-tooned and messed up their starting stats. Itll never happen im sure, but its a nice thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, stats don't mean enough to worry about.  the 20 or so points you get to assign at char creation aren't going to make any major difference at any level really.<br />
<br />
Low levels : INT/WIS/STA give very little return per point.<br />
High Levels : 20 more of any one stat is nice, but relative to your entire mana/hp pool it's not THAT big a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea, its more or less the fact id like to fix the errors i made, My gear consists of majorly hp/ac/mana gear now, but i still wouldnt mind being able to go back and change what i did when i first rolled, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh...a good portion of my starting stats went into CHA.<br />
<br />
Oh well...live and learn.<br />
<br />
Night be nice though...the extra CHA saved me maybe 1K plat in the life of my shaman..but if I could change it to extra STA...then it would be REALLY usefull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its Sony - no such thing as verant.  It's been convenient for them that people associate EQ with verant rather than sony though, as they botch just about everything they do with this game.  Anyone remember when SoL-beta came out?  The original company Verant was bought out by sony before EQ even went live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, if they're going to allow a one time change, I want my shaman to be converted over to a . . . hmmm . . . CLERIC!  Yeah!  At the same level, with epic completed, and a 1 for 1 trade on my equipment.  Now THAT would be a worthwhile change to the game.<br />

I love how often people bring this up like it actually means anything at all (I think about half of all threads in the last few months on every EQ message board I read where Verant is mentioned have some idjit who pipes up with this comment).<br />
<br />
Verant, while it is not actually a seperate entity anymore, serves as a convenient label that is far less cumbersome than the more correct phrasing of &quot;The division of Sony responsible for the production and maintenance of EverQuest&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is a convenient shorthand that conveys the needed information.<br />
<br />
The original company Verant was bought out by sony before EQ even went live.<br />
<br />
Incorrect. EQ went live in March 1999. SOE bought out VI in June 2000 (It had partial ownership prior to that, but until that date it was a seperate entity).<br />

<br />
I spent 14 points in dex when I started. Of course Snoww was created In the way early days of EQ. Back when people thought stats truly would have an effect. The EQ Hint book said it helped you hit better and I was a warrior who felt cursed with shaman Majik. (Roleplaying backstory)<br />
<br />
At level 59 a few years later I had 121 Wisdom. But Man My dex was high!<br />
<br />
It hasnt really hurt me at all. In fact I almost feel it is a point of pride now. When My barbarian Spiritist hammer procs while rabid bearing with a 270 dex every couple of swings I tend to feel pretty good. (Smiles)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My first char was a Monk.  I used the Prima  guide (This was RIGHT before the Kunark release), and surely enough it totally mislead me.<br />
<br />
I figured a monk with high Dex and agil would hit more often and get hit less just like the book said.  Little did I know I would struggle through 40 levels as the &quot;untwinked monk who hits like a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stats still piss me off.<br />
<br />
at least AC and HP's mean something now</div></div><hr />

Or, instead of doing something stupid like getting yourself banned (nothing to brag about), you could just re-roll your Shaman.<br />
