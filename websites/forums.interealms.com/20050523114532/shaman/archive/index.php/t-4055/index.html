<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">or log on so I can send you a /tell ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before you sell it back though, Id advise you to give it one more chance. Try using him for a few days.....Sow boots=insta click.....run get mob....run back...horse=3 sec cast. I can see if it were 10 seconds or even 5 the horse might be a problem...but the 3 second cast is really the only thing I have to do differently to manage my horse med-ing.....and 3 sec is so fast, cast wise.<br />
<br />
...of course the head bothers alot of folks...that you can either take or cant.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, I went a long time without a horse, thinking I didn't need one. Then after reading here about the whole medding thing I realized *Oh ya, duh*.<br />
<br />
Maybe Kimbok just wants to sell his horse for a faster one? <br />
<br />
All I know is JBB + Fungi + Horse = *Life made easy for this shaman*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, I've read different posts about the whole horse thing.  Maybe someone can finally clear it up for me.  I've read that you do not continue to meditate while casting spells, if this is true then what is the point of riding a horse to meditate if all I do is JBB stuff to death?  Oh, and I'm using the money to buy a Lodi Shield  /shrug.  If I do decide to get another horse, I'm sure I can raise the money quickly enough, I'm just still a bit confused on the whole horse thing, and I'm still in the process of getting better gear.  Thanks everyone =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, you can med without getting the sit-aggro.  I guess that's about it.  For that, you pay the penalty of not being able to duck out of spells.<br />
<br />
My own observation last night was that with all luclin models off, including horse models, I did not seem to be medding unless I was actually sitting down.   Meaning the horse is of absolutely no use to me unless I turn on horse models.  I didn't run detailed tests or anything, that was just my impression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gosh, will people quit beating this dead horse! (Hehe pun intended) <br />
<br />
If you are not moving or meleeing you get the med effects from the horse. You can cast or JBB and still be medding. Let there be no doubt about this.<br />
<br />
If you are not casting or JBB'ing your mana bar will not update. You merely have to cast a spell, right click or normal, and the mana bar will update. If you doubt my word chain cast heal till out of mana, cast horse and wait 5 mins. What you will see is the mana bar empty. Now, cast any spell. What you will see is your mana bar fly up. <br />
<br />
I fight Nathyn's guard's in katta. The only spell I cast on the guards is Slow. If I look at my bar I am down 11 percent. At the end of the fight I will be FM. I can't make it more plain than that. If you still don't understand, you need to sell your horse back because you don't deserve the mana regen ability of the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kimbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, blunt but to the point, thank you.  I will most certainly buy myself a new horsie, but I think I'll save up for a horse better than normal run....until then, I'll just have to do with my new Lodi Shield and Divine Inspiration, thanks for all the help everyone, lots of love for ya here =)<br />

Unless you want the horse graphics on it's not worth buying a horse above the cheapest nag, because with the graphics off you can sow yourself and run at sow speed whilst you are on the horse</div></div><hr />
