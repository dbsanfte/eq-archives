<br />
:p<br />
<br />
Errrm....there any guides left to be converted?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banerunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only one's that are left are the one's that are strictly tables. Can't figure out how to convert the tables over to the new format</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which ones? Point 'em out.  I may have missed them, and I'll be happy to convert 'em over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm with Banerunner on this, Spent the last 3 hours trying to convert the tables, no matter what I do I get abou 5 pages of nothing, then the table comes up fine.<br />
<br />
I tried 2 or 3 different tables, so it's not any *one* table, it seems all of them have this problem.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any Idea how we can get the tables in wihtout all the blank space, please post it.<br />
<br />
&lt;table&gt; <br />
 &lt;bunch of  td,  data tr tags&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
that is all I left in, and still had many blank pages before it showed the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, for example, in the PoA guide, I just recoded the tables in HTML instead of copy/pasting anything.<br />
<br />
Ahh, see what you're saying.  The problem is, vBulletin (and whatever the guide software is based on) interprets CRLFs.  Normally HTML code ignores any carriage returns and depends on &lt; BR &gt; and &lt; P &gt; tags for line breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another problem seems to be that the field simply isn't long enough to contain all the guide text.  After converting over &quot;Bow Costs and MSRP&quot; and removing all the carriage returns, there STILL isn't enough room to contain the entire text.<br />
<br />
Going to try to strip some of the unnecessary formatting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Do I need to bump up message size limits on this forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's not the forum, it's the &quot;guide body&quot; field on sitedirector.  And honestly I think it's large enough, the only exception I've seen so far is the massive bow pricing guide (which was mostly HTML and was around 100k in size).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banerunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Waitaminute...<br />
<br />
We have a paladin posting guides on the rangers board???<br />
<br />
NERF PALADINS!!!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, check the Ranger Epic Quest, it got cut-off right at the end also.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Vladimirr, Thanks for figuring that out.<br />
<br />
NERF All Palidins but Vlad!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anduyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Are there any left to do?<br />
<br />
I had to cut a lot out of the html ones last night to get them to fit, and take all of the font tags and color tags out.<br />
<br />
Also, apostrophes and such are getting garbled, probably due to some ascii code incompatibility.  The fix is to copy the text to Notepad or another text editor first, then copy that text over to the web site.  Line feeds are a problem, I had to delete those by hand to reformat the paragraphs.  It's a pain, but I do have too much free time.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look at the arrow table and see what I can do.  It should be that big where it won't fit.<br />
<br />
And if you want to have as much free time as I do, join the Navy and get a shore tour.  I have a 9-5 job, at night, with nothing to do but write web pages.  Fun, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anduyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, nevermind, looks like they're all done.  Hmm, now what do I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I'll leave up the access for you guys, so you can edit one if someone corrects outdated material :)</div></div><hr />
