<br />
I agree though, its truly annoying when a server stays down for more than a few hours.  Ive been playing EQ so long that I can handle 3 or 4 hours of finding something to do, but after that I start to get all fidgety.  Sounds pathetic, but I dont care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know, it's killing me.  26 hours now.  Each time I see the announced up time I say &quot;Hey, at least it'll be up when I get back from work,&quot; or, &quot;Hey, at least it'll be up when I wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
I woke up this mornin' and said &quot;betcha a wooden nickel it's still down.&quot;  Still was, and they have their third ETA for two hours from now.  I'll believe it when I see it.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is I had just taken a few days break and was ready to jump back in, pffft.<br />
<br />
What could have happened that was so bad that they have to perform maintenance for over 24 hours?  SHEESH!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">30 hours and counting, the latest, and also the FIFTH ETA, is 10pm Pacific, the exact time I get back from work, but I will eat my hat if it is up then.  I guess I'll have to *shudder* do something... else... THE HORROR!!!<br />
<br />
