<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GenwedarKulTiras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if there are any entrapranuriel rangers out there who just happen to have or know for certain any information about the PoP spells we get 61 (well 62 actually) and up.<br />
<br />
for instance i have heard that strength of tunare is a group buff, target buff and that its self only so what is it really?<br />
<br />
do we get mask of the hunter still? or is it a ranger only &quot;mask if the stalker now&quot; ? <br />
<br />
Is there such a spell as Protection of the Wild? if so can it really be bought in the thurgadin or icewell?<br />
<br />
what lvl is spirit of the predator?  is that our only tier 2 parchment spell?<br />
<br />
do we still get any of the nukes or new weapon procs verant was playing with in beta and on test server?<br />
<br />
if anyone knows anything i would really appreciate the info.. just reply on this board i check my threads daily.<br />
<br />
( a complete list of spells with name, target type, and effects of spell would be GREAT!)</div></div><hr />

For all your spell information needs. All the data is taken straight from the game files, so it will tell you exactly what a spell does. As for the turn ins....<br />
<br />
SoT and CotR are the only level 62 spells we need to do turn ins for with Etheriel parchment turn in.<br />
<br />
Level 63 and 64 we have Spirit of the Predator, Brushfire, Frozen Winds, Nature's Rebuke, and Earthen roots which we get from spectral parchment turn ins. Note that if you turn in an Etheriel parchment to the druid spell quest guy you have a chance at Earthen roots as well.<br />
<br />
And lastly we have two level 65 spells, Cry of Thunder and PotW. PotW does exist, at least two rangers on the glade have it. But how many level 65 spells have you seen cast yet from ANY class? Anyone had Voice of Quellious cast on them yet (C5)? Very few people indeed.</div></div><hr />
