<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This one really gets me. I Trouble shoot prolems all the time but this one has me stumped. I have 2 DSL services. One is being canceled and the other is the new service. <br />
<br />
On my new service (Pacbell/SBC DSL) im getting really good connection with little PL however last night I zoned into Qeynos Hills and got slammed. 90% Packetloss... so I zoned into Black Burrow and guess what, back to normal. So I continue on towards Permafrost. Zone into Permafrost bam! 90% Packetloss. So Computer #2 is on the New DSL service I try with my Druidbot same issues. So Computer #3 is on the OLD DSL service and what do you know.... no problems.  Changed connections for all computers to different DSL routers and the problem followed the new DSL service. Nothing to do with OS's Video Cards, UI or anything.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a clue on this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To add what I can--from what I've observed, each zone has its own port to which it listens (My firewall tracks ports being opened through it, and when running EQ, it gets many).  I would be curious if zoning back into Qeynos Hills would make problems recurr.<br />
<br />
It is possible that your new ISP is having port availability problems, or is having router problems.  Try this again a few days later, and if the same thing happens, call their tech support and ask about any outstanding routing issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes Zoning back the problem comes back. I'm running a DHCP/NAT Router behind the DSL modem so that may be the problem. Good to know about the ports thing maybe there is an issue with my router.</div></div><hr />
