<br />
<b>Chapter 1: A Strange Vision</b><br />
<br />
Darg pulled his tired hands away from the fire and sighed. It had been a long day indeed. All he was thinking about now was dinner…dinner and sleep. <br />
<br />
He walked over to his table and took a bite from the portion of bear meat he had prepared earlier. It was just right, and he more than welcomed the delicious taste. As he chewed heartily, he took a glance at the hearth, where a fire blazed and crackled.<br />
<br />
Lying not far from it was his tracking wolf, Starch, dozing in and out of consciousness. Darg tossed a piece of meat next to him, and it was promptly devoured. <br />
<br />
The month had been hard on the Barbarians, and the snow fell constantly, even now. However, Darg wasn’t concerned with the snow, he had something else on his mind.<br />
<br />
He kept thinking back to the fight he had engaged in earlier that day with Redwind (General of the orcs who followed and defended Lady Vox, the legendary dragon), and his followers. Sure, he had disposed of Redwind without much trouble, but one of the followers had escaped, and for some reason it loomed eerily over Darg’s head. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a while, but couldn’t understand what exactly it was that was troubling him so much. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and a vision formed right in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Being a shaman, he wasn’t all too surprised by this, yet this vision did not seem to be like those he had seen before. There was a small shadow, which swayed back and forth, yet had no definite shape. As the shadow moved and the vision progressed, it took form. The shadow was running towards something, or maybe away from another, either way it seemed to be moving as fast as it could. Although Darg couldn’t tell what exactly it was, he knew it was neither clever nor agile by the way the moved. Instead, it stumbled and lost its balance numerous times…obviously something was troubling it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Darg’s head cleared, and the vision vanished. As he recovered and tried to make sense of what he had seen, weariness set in. Shrugging it off as nothing, he crawled into bed and tried to push these thoughts out of his head. <br />
<br />
Somewhere out on the frozen tundra, a lone wolf howled. Yet Darg took no notice of this, for he had fallen sound asleep. <br />
<br />
<b>Chapter 2: A Hairy Thief</b><br />
<br />
Morning came too soon, and Darg tried earnestly to go back to sleep. Yet the bright light of the sun through his windows, coupled with the hustling and bustling of people outside his door in the market, persuaded him to rise for the day. <br />
<br />
He pulled himself from his bed and trudged over to the hearth, tossing on a few more logs. As he bent down to wake up Starch, he decided to let him sleep a little longer. After all, it was going to be a long day. <br />
<br />
Passing by his messy kitchen, he made his way to the shower, grabbing a towel and washcloth on the way. The water was the same as it always was, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. Yet he took no notice of this, since Barbarians are, after all, near immune to cold temperatures.<br />
<br />
After showering and doing what little hygenial work Barbarians do, he threw on some clothes and armed himself. Darg and Starch wandered through town, making their way to the raft. <br />
<br />
After a short joyride, they reached the other side, and began their long trek to the outer gate of Permafrost. As they wandered up and began to move more stealthily, Darg felt his pocket move slightly, then go flat. <br />
<br />
He spun around, lunging out his massive arm…only to grasp onto the small arm of dark elf. As Darg began to raise his large hammer, the rogue quickly cried out, “No don’t! I’m not as I seem! Take another look!” <br />
<br />
Instantly the rogue swung his free arm over his face and removed a small mask from it. His image shimmer for a split-second, then formed into that of a halfling. <br />
	<br />
“Oh joy, a lettle annoying halflin' creeture…maybe he doesn't talk much”, though a much displeased Darg. <br />
<br />
He put the little furball down and examined him cautiously, since one can never take their eye off a rogue too long…for fear of getting a dagger through their back.<br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself kind sir!”, squeaked the halfling, “I am known as Fuzz, best pickpocket in all the land.”<br />
<br />
“You did a perty crappy job pick-pocketin' me, why should I think yeh can do it teh others?”. Darg was clearly annoyed with the rather odorous little thing.<br />
<br />
“It’s too cold in this blasted land, I can’t do a darned thing without shivering. It wasn’t my fault, my hand wouldn’t stay still and I accidentally hit the side of your pocket. Believe me or don’t, I’m still the best around!”. <br />
<br />
“That reminds meh, I want meh wallet back, give it back now”.<br />
<br />
“You mean your coin purse?”.<br />
<br />
“IT IS NOT A PURSE, IT IS A WALLET! Call it a purse again and I'll feed yer lettle body to Starch”. Hearing his name and “feed” used within 10 words of each other, Starch trotted over and looked at Fuzz. This apparently made Fuzz uncomfortable, for he quickly moved around, positioning Darg between him and the dog.<br />
<br />
“Terribly sorry..er..uh…what was your name again?”.<br />
<br />
“My name is Darg, and this be Starch, my loyal trackin' wolf, now give me meh wallet back”. <br />
<br />
Becoming even more uneasy, the halfling apologized profusely and handed the wallet over to Darg. As Darg began to walk away, Fuzz trotted behind him, asking him many questions which Darg had no interest in answering. Finally, in frustration, Darg turned to Fuzz and said, “Look, I'm goin' teh hunt Ice Giants. Yeh can come if yeh want, but I'm not going to be held responsible if  yeh get squashed under a giant's foot.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz’s eyes gleamed, and he seemed to brandish a rapier and a short sword from almost nowhere. He quickly shouted, “Then off we go!”, and took off in the direction of Permafrost.<br />
<br />
“Why me, I haven't dun anythin' wrong…I feed meh dog every day and kill those derty goblins. Argh…why is teh Tribunal pissed at me, what did I do wrong?”, thought Darg. And with that, the two began to quickly run in the direction Fuzz had gone in, hoping not to find squished halfling at the end of the Fuzz’s tracks.<br />
<br />
***More...MUCH more to come...thanks for taking a little time to read it <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />***<br />

	<p>Its fairly enjoyable story-line wise so far <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
As far as little nit-pickity things go, it could use small work in its format, and word choicing.  For example, instead of "it seems barbarians are immune to cold temperatures", try something more assertive.  Are you finding this out, or telling me?  If its the first one im not sure i want to hear any more, because it makes you seem lost, but if you TELL me what barbarians can/cant do, are/arent immune too, then the story will flow better, and you considered a better story teller.<br />
<br />
And us barbarians arent trolls, we are very well-spoken, thank you very much! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

	<p>That's awesome so far. Only recomendations I have are these.<br />
<br />
-Darg's speech resembles ogre talk way too much for my tastes. Personally I've always imagined barbarians as having a scottish kind of accent. Ever seen the movie Braveheart? They remind me a lot of what I imagine barbarians as. They say stuff like ye and yer and all that. When I think of barbarians I imagine a bunch of big men/women dressed in animal furs, with leather armor and metal do-dads if ya know what I mean. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> That's really the only big problem I have with it. To me, the characters speach defines the character in any book I'm reading. That's why I don't really like books where they all seem to talk the same. That's also why I like the Lord of the Rings books. But it's your story, I don't think I'm the one to tell you what you can and can't do. I'll still read it either way. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
-Not really a recommendation, just something to clear this up. Is startch Darg's doggy? <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
-Write more! Lol stories about barbarians are some of my favorite. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> You seem to be very good at writing, so I'd like to read some more when you write it. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

	<p><b>Chapter 3: Plotting A Defense</b><br />
<br />
Somewhere deep in Permafrost, a flame erupted around the lifeless body of an orc. It rapidly grew, until it was multiple feet high, growing brighter with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Rest in peace, me friend…rest in peace…” The low, saddened voice of the goblin was barely audible as he spoke, “I will find the man who did this to you, and I will have my revenge…”<br />
<br />
In ran a smaller goblin, “High Priest Zaharn, you are needed earnestly in…”, yet he stopped cold when he eyed the recovered but burning body of Redwind. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my Lord…I had no idea you were…”, but he was cut short. <br />
<br />
Eyeing the trembling peon, Zaharn quietly said, “No matter Ghest, I was done anyway, I believe you were saying I was needed somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Yes my Lord, King Thex Va IV has summoned you and the Priest of Nagafen, it seems to be rather important. Shall you go now, or must I tell him you are busy? Remember my Lord, it does seem urgent”.<br />
<br />
At this Zaharn sighed, “Yes, I will attend this meeting…have you any idea to what it is about?”<br />
<br />
“No sir, I was told nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, lets head out before I change my mind.”<br />
<br />
Ghest went back to work, and Zaharn doggedly made his way to the Meeting Hall. As he reached the chamber, two large ice giant diplomats bowed their heads in reverence and swung open the massive doors. Zaharn quietly made his way up to the large, round, slab of ice that served as a table.<br />
<br />
“Well, Zaharn, I’m glad you could finally join us!”, remarked the King, visibly irked.<br />
<br />
“Save it Thex Va, now why did you summon me here?”<br />
<br />
The King lowered his head, drawing in a large breath. He seemed to be at a loss for words, but he quickly recovered his composure and began to speak. “Our scouts have discovered a large force lodging in Qeynos, I fear they may be coming to try and slay us. They number well over 40, and are a diverse bunch. Even though our scouts have informants among the corrupt Qeynos guards, they couldn’t gather any names, so we don’t know who their leader is. What do you say we should do?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn drew a quick breath and was about to speak when the Priest of Nagafen quickly piped up, “I am sure Lord Nagafen will send some of his best to defend you, after all, he would do anything to protect Lady Vox.”<br />
<br />
Zaharn cast a cold glance at the giant, who immediately silenced himself. Though small, Zaharn was known to be one of the strongest magic users on the continent of Antonica, and not many would dare to anger him. “Even if Lord Nagafen sends 1000 of his best, it would take them at least a fortnight to get here, and that is simply time we haven’t got if the King’s story is indeed true.”<br />
<br />
The situation truly looked grave for them, and they all were deep in thought. All of a sudden, Zaharn looked up and glanced over at the King. “We will send a pair of our strongest giants to Qeynos, they will be the deciding factor in this battle.”<br />
<br />
The King looked puzzled, “And what purpose will they serve by doing this Zaharn?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn had a crafty grin on his face, “If there is indeed a large force at the city, then our giants will surely perish. Yet if the defenses at Qeynos are normal, the giants should have little trouble causing sufficient damage. Either way, we win. Either the giants die because of the added fighters at the city and we know to prepare for an attack, or they cause a large ruckus and come back to report that no one was there to resist. Plus, the large force (if there is one) will surely want to stay and help repair the city and heal the wounded. So it delays their attack on us.” Zaharn turned to the Priest, “Priest, send a messenger to Lord Nagafen and have him send us 10 of his strongest giants. They will tide us over until we know for sure whether or not we need prepare for an attack.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done.” And with that the Priest bowed his head, and left the chamber.<br />
<br />
The King was indifferent to Zaharn’s idea, but glowered as he spoke, “You better not piss of the Lord by requesting such a large number of units, he would surely delight in disposing of us and setting up his own dungeon for the Lady to stay in. He always did want her to be nearer to him.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mock me Thex Va, I know what I’m doing. You may be King, but I am wiser and much more experienced in battle, never forget that.”<br />
<br />
These words angered the King, and he grimaced and left the room, mumbling as he went.<br />
<br />
Zaharn smiled to himself and went back to his own chamber, where he resumed his work. He stared at the runes and back at his reference sheet, trying to decipher the rest of the code. “Blast those damned elves, must they make these runes so hard to understand! No matter, once deciphered and put onto a scroll, they will form a spell which will stand alone as the most powerful ever. None will be able to oppose me then, not even Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen…”<br />
<br />
Yet it was a mistake for him to say this aloud, for the eyes and ears of the Lord were everywhere, even in that room. Silently and unnoticed, a small creature crawled from the room, and slid away into the darkness of the corridors.</p>

	<p>Hey Garf,<br />
<br />
I would get rid of the hygene part and the shower, change it to something like splashing himself quickly with cold water from a bowl near his bed, something like that.  <br />
<br />
Didn't know they had showers in Halas, unless it was a Giligan Island type shower haha<br />
<br />

	<p><u><center><b>Chapter 4: A Frozen Prison</b></center></u><br />
<br />
THUD! The corpse of a massive Ice Giant came crashing to the ground. It had been three days since Darg, Starch, and Fuzz had set out towards Permafrost, and they were now just arriving. <br />
<br />
Darg grimaced, “I travel three days teh get teh this craphole and all the cash yur carryin’ is a few lousy platinum! Yeh cheap son-of-a-bi...”, but he was interrupted by the halfling.<br />
<br />
“Shhh…I hear something, please, be quiet!” Slowly, Fuzz lowered his ear to the ground, not minding the cold snow. “There’s three of em…no wait…two. By God, they’re huge beasts to! Quick, lets dispose of this body and hide!”<br />
<br />
Using Levitation and the halfling’s innate stealth abilities, they were able to hide the gigantic body without much trouble. As they finished their work, they made their way behind a giant pillar, trying their best not to be seen.<br />
<br />
The giants passed by, mumbling to one another, “Zaharn says we’re to do the job and be back in no less than two days. Any more than that and you can guess what’ll happen…”<br />
<br />
Darg did his best to read their minds, but since giants are so huge, it’s anything but easy to do without knowing exactly where in their head to search. As he tried to concentrate he began to wonder, “What job are they talkin’ about. Could it be an attack on Halas! No…not even giants are that stupid. Surely they wouldn’t travel all the way to Qeynos…unless somethin’ very important is takin’ place…”<br />
<br />
However, his thoughts were thrown aside when he felt Starch begin to move and growl quietly. Darg tried to hold him back, but Starch had no collar that could be held onto. Just as the giants were going out of sight, Starch let loose a great howl and took off in pursuit of them. <br />
<br />
The fight was over before it started, and in less than five seconds, Starch lay motionless on the ground.<br />
<br />
The giants didn’t move, they just stood there motionless. Darg looked over his shoulder to give Fuzz a signal, but the halfling wasn’t there. Suddenly, one of the giants turned and snatched something up from the floor of the corridor. <br />
<br />
Barely audible, Fuzz could be heard screaming for help from the giant’s hand. Even though no help came, the giants quickly took off down the corridor, almost like they were running from something.<br />
<br />
Darg sighed and sat down to plan out his next move. It was quiet, too quiet. Being overly cautious, Darg cast invisibility on himself, and slowly made his way in the direction the giants had gone.<br />
<br />
As he crept forward, the sound of a lone voice could be heard. It was a powerful voice, and deep, yet strangely elegant. <br />
<br />
Soon, Darg reached two large doors, freezing to the touch. He peeked inside, and what he saw made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
Standing there in massive numbers, were goblins, wolves, spiders, polar bears, ice giants, strange creatures of different sorts, and none other than the legendary dragon herself…Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
She spoke in haste, and those in the chamber missed not a word. “Long has it been since anyone dare challenge the inhabitants of Permafrost. But now, according to our scouts, there seems to be an attack force rallying within our walls as we speak! The scouts brought back two of their members, a halfling, and an unconscious wolf.” At this she turned to poor Fuzz, “Well foul creature, tell us of your attack force, and spare no detail. Do this or you will die one-thousand horrible deaths.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz was visibly trembling, and could barely speak. Finally, mustering up his courage, he piped up. “I am a member of no attack force, nor do I know of one. I come from a far away land, and care not to harm you or cause you trouble. Please, spare me and this wolf, for we have done nothing.”<br />
<br />
Lady Vox’s eyes grew red, she was visibly angry. “Done nothing! You’ve violated our home and attacked those who live here! What say you about that!”<br />
<br />
Knowing he was in deep…manure if he slipped up, Fuzz tried to be crafty. “Attack! I wouldn’t dare think of doing such a thing. I simply tried to pickpocket that scout on the left because I am looking for a precious herb. The herb is needed to make a potion that can cure my brother of a horrible ailment. Oh yes, and this wolf, I know nothing of it, it followed me here without me realizing it.”<br />
<br />
Half believing the story, Vox turned to her minions. “Search every corner of Permafrost! I want a report of ANYTHING that looks different. Halfling, if you are lying, you will pay dearly!”<br />
<br />
Darg’s stomach felt heavy, and he made a dash for cover. The massive doors swung open and out poured the minions of Vox. His invisibility held up nicely, and he watched them go in silence. He had avoided them, for now. At the moment, the most pressing task was trying to figure out how to save Fuzz and Starch.<br />
<br />
He peered into the doors, and his eyes met those of Lady Vox. She yelled for guards and swiped at him with her huge claws, which caused his invisibility spell to leave him. In an instant he was bound tightly and set up next to Fuzz.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, he wondered how in the world he planned to get out of this one. Peering over at Fuzz, the little halfling half-smiled and whispered, “Nice to see you again, how’s life treating you?” Darg grimaced and looked the other way, “Damn halflings…”</p>

	<p><u><center><b>Chapter 1: A Strange Vision</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Darg pulled his tired hands away from the fire and sighed. It had been a long day indeed. All he was thinking about now was dinner…dinner and sleep. <br />
<br />
He walked over to his table and took a bite from the portion of bear meat he had prepared earlier. It was just right, and he more than welcomed the delicious taste. As he chewed heartily, he took a glance at the hearth, where a fire blazed and crackled. <br />
<br />
Lying not far from it was his tracking wolf, Starch, dozing in and out of consciousness. Darg tossed a piece of meat next to him, and it was promptly devoured. <br />
<br />
The month had been hard on the Barbarians, and the snow fell constantly, even now. However, Darg wasn’t concerned with the snow, he had something else on his mind. <br />
<br />
He kept thinking back to the fight he had engaged in earlier that day with Redwind (General of the orcs who followed and defended Lady Vox, the legendary dragon), and his followers. Sure, he had disposed of Redwind without much trouble, but one of the followers had escaped, and for some reason it loomed eerily over Darg’s head. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a while, but couldn’t understand what exactly it was that was troubling him so much. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and a vision formed right in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Being a shaman, he wasn’t all too surprised by this, yet this vision did not seem to be like those he had seen before. There was a small shadow, which swayed back and forth, yet had no definite shape. As the shadow moved and the vision progressed, it took form. The shadow was running towards something, or maybe away from another, either way it seemed to be moving as fast as it could. Although Darg couldn’t tell what exactly it was, he knew it was neither clever nor agile by the way the moved. Instead, it stumbled and lost its balance numerous times…obviously something was troubling it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Darg’s head cleared, and the vision vanished. As he recovered and tried to make sense of what he had seen, weariness set in. Shrugging it off as nothing, he crawled into bed and tried to push these thoughts out of his head. <br />
<br />
Somewhere out on the frozen tundra, a lone wolf howled. Yet Darg took no notice of this, for he had fallen sound asleep.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 2: A Hairy Thief</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Morning came too soon, and Darg tried earnestly to go back to sleep. Yet the bright light of the sun through his windows, coupled with the hustling and bustling of people outside his door in the market, persuaded him to rise for the day. <br />
<br />
He pulled himself from his bed and trudged over to the hearth, tossing on a few more logs. As he bent down to wake up Starch, he decided to let him sleep a little longer. After all, it was going to be a long day. <br />
<br />
Passing by his messy kitchen, he made his way to the shower, grabbing a towel and washcloth on the way. The water was the same as it always was, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. Yet he took no notice of this, since Barbarians are, after all, near immune to cold temperatures. <br />
<br />
After showering and doing what little hygenial work Barbarians do, he threw on some clothes and armed himself. Darg and Starch wandered through town, making their way to the raft. <br />
<br />
After a short joyride, they reached the other side, and began their long trek to the outer gate of Permafrost. As they wandered up and began to move more stealthily, Darg felt his pocket move slightly, then go flat. <br />
<br />
He spun around, lunging out his massive arm…only to grasp onto the small arm of dark elf. As Darg began to raise his large hammer, the rogue quickly cried out, “No don’t! I’m not as I seem! Take another look!” <br />
<br />
Instantly the rogue swung his free arm over his face and removed a small mask from it. His image shimmer for a split-second, then formed into that of a halfling. <br />
<br />
“Oh joy, a lettle annoying halflin' creeture…maybe he doesn't talk much”, though a much displeased Darg. <br />
<br />
He put the little furball down and examined him cautiously, since one can never take their eye off a rogue too long…for fear of getting a dagger through their back. <br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself kind sir!” squeaked the halfling, “I am known as Fuzz, best pickpocket in all the land.” <br />
<br />
“You did a perty crappy job pick-pocketin' me, why should I think yeh can do it teh others?” Darg was clearly annoyed with the rather odorous little thing. <br />
<br />
“It’s too cold in this blasted land, I can’t do a darned thing without shivering. It wasn’t my fault, my hand wouldn’t stay still and I accidentally hit the side of your pocket. Believe me or don’t, I’m still the best around!” <br />
<br />
“That reminds meh, I want meh wallet back, give it back now”. <br />
<br />
“You mean your coin purse?” <br />
<br />
“IT IS NOT A PURSE, IT IS A WALLET! Call it a purse again and I'll feed yer lettle body to Starch”. Hearing his name and “feed” used within 10 words of each other, Starch trotted over and looked at Fuzz. This apparently made Fuzz uncomfortable, for he quickly moved around, positioning Darg between him and the dog. <br />
<br />
“Terribly sorry..er..uh…what was your name again?” <br />
<br />
“My name is Darg, and this be Starch, my loyal trackin' wolf, now give me meh wallet back”. <br />
<br />
Becoming even more uneasy, the halfling apologized profusely and handed the wallet over to Darg. As Darg began to walk away, Fuzz trotted behind him, asking him many questions which Darg had no interest in answering. Finally, in frustration, Darg turned to Fuzz and said, “Look, I'm goin' teh hunt Ice Giants. Yeh can come if yeh want, but I'm not going to be held responsible if yeh get squashed under a giant's foot.” <br />
<br />
Fuzz’s eyes gleamed, and he seemed to brandish a rapier and a short sword from almost nowhere. He quickly shouted, “Then off we go!”, and took off in the direction of Permafrost. <br />
<br />
“Why me, I haven't dun anythin' wrong…I feed meh dog every day and kill those derty goblins. Argh…why is teh Tribunal pissed at me, what did I do wrong?”, thought Darg. And with that, the two began to quickly run in the direction Fuzz had gone in, hoping not to find squished halfling at the end of the Fuzz’s tracks.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 3: Plotting A Defense</b></u></center><br />
<br />
Somewhere deep in Permafrost, a flame erupted around the lifeless body of an orc. It rapidly grew, until it was multiple feet high, growing brighter with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Rest in peace, me friend…rest in peace…” The low, saddened voice of the goblin was barely audible as he spoke, “I will find the man who did this to you, and I will have my revenge…”<br />
<br />
In ran a smaller goblin, “High Priest Zaharn, you are needed earnestly in…”, yet he stopped cold when he eyed the recovered but burning body of Redwind. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my Lord…I had no idea you were…”, but he was cut short. <br />
<br />
Eyeing the trembling peon, Zaharn quietly said, “No matter Ghest, I was done anyway, I believe you were saying I was needed somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Yes my Lord, King Thex Va IV has summoned you and the Priest of Nagafen, it seems to be rather important. Shall you go now, or must I tell him you are busy? Remember my Lord, it does seem urgent”.<br />
<br />
At this Zaharn sighed, “Yes, I will attend this meeting…have you any idea to what it is about?”<br />
<br />
“No sir, I was told nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, lets head out before I change my mind.”<br />
<br />
Ghest went back to work, and Zaharn doggedly made his way to the Meeting Hall. As he reached the chamber, two large ice giant diplomats bowed their heads in reverence and swung open the massive doors. Zaharn quietly made his way up to the large, round, slab of ice that served as a table.<br />
<br />
“Well, Zaharn, I’m glad you could finally join us!”, remarked the King, visibly irked.<br />
<br />
“Save it Thex Va, now why did you summon me here?”<br />
<br />
The King lowered his head, drawing in a large breath. He seemed to be at a loss for words, but he quickly recovered his composure and began to speak. “Our scouts have discovered a large force lodging in Qeynos, I fear they may be coming to try and slay us. They number well over 40, and are a diverse bunch. Even though our scouts have informants among the corrupt Qeynos guards, they couldn’t gather any names, so we don’t know who their leader is. What do you say we should do?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn drew a quick breath and was about to speak when the Priest of Nagafen quickly piped up, “I am sure Lord Nagafen will send some of his best to defend you, after all, he would do anything to protect Lady Vox.”<br />
<br />
Zaharn cast a cold glance at the giant, who immediately silenced himself. Though small, Zaharn was known to be one of the strongest magic users on the continent of Antonica, and not many would dare to anger him. “Even if Lord Nagafen sends 1000 of his best, it would take them at least a fortnight to get here, and that is simply time we haven’t got if the King’s story is indeed true.”<br />
<br />
The situation truly looked grave for them, and they all were deep in thought. All of a sudden, Zaharn looked up and glanced over at the King. “We will send a pair of our strongest giants to Qeynos, they will be the deciding factor in this battle.”<br />
<br />
The King looked puzzled, “And what purpose will they serve by doing this Zaharn?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn had a crafty grin on his face, “If there is indeed a large force at the city, then our giants will surely perish. Yet if the defenses at Qeynos are normal, the giants should have little trouble causing sufficient damage. Either way, we win. Either the giants die because of the added fighters at the city and we know to prepare for an attack, or they cause a large ruckus and come back to report that no one was there to resist. Plus, the large force (if there is one) will surely want to stay and help repair the city and heal the wounded. So it delays their attack on us.” Zaharn turned to the Priest, “Priest, send a messenger to Lord Nagafen and have him send us 10 of his strongest giants. They will tide us over until we know for sure whether or not we need prepare for an attack.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done.” And with that the Priest bowed his head, and left the chamber.<br />
<br />
The King was indifferent to Zaharn’s idea, but glowered as he spoke, “You better not piss of the Lord by requesting such a large number of units, he would surely delight in disposing of us and setting up his own dungeon for the Lady to stay in. He always did want her to be nearer to him”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mock me Thex Va, I know what I’m doing. You may be King, but I am much wiser and much more experienced, never forget that.”<br />
<br />
These words angered the King, and he grimaced and left the room, mumbling as he went.<br />
<br />
Zaharn smiled to himself and went back to his own chamber, where he resumed his work. He stared at the runes and back at his reference sheet, trying to decipher the rest of the code. “Blast those damned elves, must they make these runes so hard to understand! No matter, once deciphered and put onto a scroll, they will form a spell which will stand alone as the most powerful ever. None will be able to oppose me then, not even Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen…”<br />
<br />
Yet it was a mistake for him to say this aloud, for the eyes and ears of the Lord were everywhere, even in that room. Silently and unnoticed, a small creature crawled from the room, and slid away into the darkness of the corridors.<br />
<br />
<u><center><b>Chapter 4: A Frozen Prison</b><br />
</u></center><br />
THUD! The corpse of a massive Ice Giant came crashing to the ground. It had been three days since Darg, Starch, and Fuzz had set out towards Permafrost, and they were now just arriving. <br />
<br />
Darg grimaced, “I travel three days teh get teh this craphole and all the cash yur carryin’ is a few lousy platinum! Yeh cheap son-of-a-bi...”, but he was interrupted by the halfling.<br />
<br />
“Shhh…I hear something, please, be quiet!” Slowly, Fuzz lowered his ear to the ground, not minding the cold snow. “There’s three of em…no wait…two. By God, they’re huge beasts to! Quick, lets dispose of this body and hide!”<br />
<br />
Using Levitation and the halfling’s innate stealth abilities, they were able to hide the gigantic body without much trouble. As they finished their work, they made their way behind a giant pillar, trying their best not to be seen.<br />
<br />
The giants passed by, mumbling to one another, “Zaharn says we’re to do the job and be back in no less than two days. Any more than that and you can guess what’ll happen…”<br />
<br />
Darg did his best to read their minds, but since giants are so huge, it’s anything but easy to do without knowing exactly where in their head to search. As he tried to concentrate he began to wonder, “What job are they talkin’ about. Could it be an attack on Halas! No…not even giants are that stupid. Surely they wouldn’t travel all the way to Qeynos…unless somethin’ very important is takin’ place…”<br />
<br />
However, his thoughts were thrown aside when he felt Starch begin to move and growl quietly. Darg tried to hold him back, but Starch had no collar that could be held onto. Just as the giants were going out of sight, Starch let loose a great howl and took off in pursuit of them. <br />
<br />
The fight was over before it started, and in less than five seconds, Starch lay motionless on the ground.<br />
<br />
The giants didn’t move, they just stood there motionless. Darg looked over his shoulder to give Fuzz a signal, but the halfling wasn’t there. Suddenly, one of the giants turned and snatched something up from the floor of the corridor. <br />
<br />
Barely audible, Fuzz could be heard screaming for help from the giant’s hand. Even though no help came, the giants quickly took off down the corridor, almost like they were running from something.<br />
<br />
Darg sighed and sat down to plan out his next move. It was quiet, too quiet. Being overly cautious, Darg cast invisibility on himself, and slowly made his way in the direction the giants had gone.<br />
<br />
As he crept forward, the sound of a lone voice could be heard. It was a powerful voice, and deep, yet strangely elegant. <br />
<br />
Soon, Darg reached two large doors, freezing to the touch. He peeked inside, and what he saw made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
Standing there in massive numbers, were goblins, wolves, spiders, polar bears, ice giants, strange creatures of different sorts, and none other than the legendary dragon herself…Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
She spoke in haste, and those in the chamber missed not a word. “Long has it been since anyone dare challenge the inhabitants of Permafrost. But now, according to our scouts, there seems to be an attack force rallying within our walls as we speak! The scouts brought back two of their members, a halfling, and an unconscious wolf.” At this she turned to poor Fuzz, “Well foul creature, tell us of your attack force, and spare no detail. Do this or you will die one-thousand horrible deaths.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz was visibly trembling, and could barely speak. Finally, mustering up his courage, he piped up. “I am a member of no attack force, nor do I know of one. I come from a far away land, and care not to harm you or cause you trouble. Please, spare me and this wolf, for we have done nothing.”<br />
<br />
Lady Vox’s eyes grew red, she was visibly angry. “Done nothing! You’ve violated our home and attacked those who live here! What say you about that!”<br />
<br />
Knowing he was in deep…manure if he slipped up, Fuzz tried to be crafty. “Attack! I wouldn’t dare think of doing such a thing. I simply tried to pickpocket that scout on the left because I am looking for a precious herb. The herb is needed to make a potion that can cure my brother of a horrible ailment. Oh yes, and this wolf, I know nothing of it, it followed me here without me realizing it.”<br />
<br />
Half believing the story, Vox turned to her minions. “Search every corner of Permafrost! I want a report of ANYTHING that looks different. Halfling, if you are lying, you will pay dearly!”<br />
<br />
Darg’s stomach felt heavy, and he made a dash for cover. The massive doors swung open and out poured the minions of Vox. His invisibility held up nicely, and he watched them go in silence. He had avoided them, for now. At the moment, the most pressing task was trying to figure out how to save Fuzz and Starch.<br />
<br />
He peered into the doors, and his eyes met those of Lady Vox. She yelled for guards and swiped at him with her huge claws, which caused his invisibility spell to leave him. In an instant he was bound tightly and set up next to Fuzz.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, he wondered how in the world he planned to get out of this one. Peering over at Fuzz, the little halfling half-smiled and whispered, “Nice to see you again, how’s life treating you?” Darg grimaced and looked the other way, “Damn halflins'…”</p>

	<p>Holy shi*, an update! <img src="images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt="" title="roll eyes (sarcastic)" smilieid="8" />. Revised some of the speach, tweaked a few words, and added a few chapters. Posting the whole story over again for those who haven't read it before.<br />
<br />
<u><b><div align="center">Chapter 1: A Strange Vision</div></b></u><br />
<br />
Darg pulled his tired hands away from the fire and sighed. It had been a long day indeed. All he was thinking about now was dinner…dinner and sleep. <br />
<br />
He walked over to his table and took a bite from the portion of bear meat he had prepared earlier. It was just right, and he more than welcomed the delicious taste. As he chewed heartily, he took a glance at the hearth, where a fire blazed and crackled. <br />
<br />
Lying not far from it was his tracking wolf, Starch, dozing in and out of consciousness. Darg tossed a piece of meat next to him, and it was promptly devoured. <br />
<br />
The month had been hard on the Barbarians, and the snow fell constantly, even now. However, Darg wasn’t concerned with the snow; he had something else on his mind. <br />
<br />
He kept thinking back to the fight he had engaged in earlier that day with Redwind (General of the orcs who followed and defended Lady Vox, the legendary dragon), and his followers. Sure, he had disposed of Redwind without much trouble, but one of the followers had escaped, and for some reason it loomed eerily over Darg’s head. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a while, but couldn’t understand what exactly it was that was troubling him so much. Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and a vision formed in front of his eyes. <br />
<br />
Being a shaman, he wasn’t all too surprised by this, yet this vision did not seem to be like those he had seen before. There was a small shadow, which swayed back and forth, yet had no definite shape. As the shadow moved and the vision progressed, it took form. The shadow was running towards something, or maybe away from another, either way it seemed to be moving as fast as it could. Although Darg couldn’t tell what exactly it was, he knew it was neither clever nor agile by the way the moved. Instead, it stumbled and lost its balance numerous times…obviously something was troubling it. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Darg’s head cleared, and the vision vanished. As he recovered and tried to make sense of what he had seen, weariness set in. Shrugging it off as nothing, he crawled into bed and tried to push these thoughts out of his head. <br />
<br />
Somewhere out on the frozen tundra, a lone wolf howled. Yet Darg took no notice of this, for he had fallen sound asleep.<br />
<br />
<b><u><div align="center">Chapter 2: A Hairy Thief </div></u></b><br />
<br />
Morning came too soon, and Darg tried earnestly to go back to sleep. Yet the bright light of the sun through his windows, coupled with the hustling and bustling of people outside his door in the market, persuaded him to rise for the day. <br />
<br />
He pulled himself from his bed and trudged over to the hearth, tossing on a few more logs. As he bent down to wake up Starch, he decided to let him sleep a little longer. After all, it was going to be a long day. <br />
<br />
Passing by his messy kitchen, he made his way to the ‘hole’. The ‘hole’ as it had been so cleverly named, was an actual hole in the ground with water in it. Although a rather crude way of bathing, it suited the Barbarians fine, and they were content with it. The water was the same as always, cold as ice and chilling to the touch. However he took no notice of this, since Barbarians are, after all, near immune to cold temperatures. <br />
<br />
After showering and doing what little hygenial work Barbarians do, he threw on some clothes and armed himself. Darg and Starch wandered through town, making their way to the raft. <br />
<br />
After a short joyride, they reached the other side, and began their long trek to the outer gate of Permafrost. As they wandered up and began to move more stealthily, Darg felt his pocket move slightly, then go flat. <br />
<br />
He spun around, lunging out his massive arm…only to grasp onto the thin arm of dark elf. As Darg began to raise his large hammer, the rogue quickly cried out, “No don’t! I’m not as I seem! Take another look!” <br />
<br />
Instantly the rogue swung his free arm over his face and removed a small mask from it. His image shimmered for a split-second, then formed into that of a halfling. <br />
<br />
“Oh joy, a lettle annoying halflin' creeture…maybe he doesn't talk much”, though a much displeased Darg. <br />
<br />
He put the little furball down and examined him cautiously, since one can never take their eye off a rogue too long…for fear of getting a dagger through their back. <br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself, kind sir!” squeaked the halfling, “I am known as Fuzz, best pickpocket in all the land.” <br />
<br />
“You did a perty crappy job pick-pocketin' me, why should I think yeh can do it teh others?” Darg was clearly annoyed with the rather odorous little thing. <br />
<br />
“It’s too cold in this blasted land; I can’t do a darned thing without shivering. It wasn’t my fault, my hand wouldn’t stay still and I accidentally hit the side of your pocket. Believe me or don’t, I’m still the best around!” <br />
<br />
“That reminds meh, I want meh wallet, give it back now”. <br />
<br />
“You mean your coin purse?” <br />
<br />
“IT IS NOT A PURSE, IT IS A WALLET! Call it a purse again and I'll feed yer lettle body to Starch”. Hearing his name, Starch trotted over and looked at Fuzz. This apparently made the rogue uncomfortable, for he quickly moved around, positioning Darg between him and the wolf. <br />
<br />
“Terribly sorry..er..uh…what was your name again?” <br />
<br />
“My name is Darg, and this be Starch, my trackin' wolf; now give me meh wallet back”. <br />
<br />
Becoming even more uneasy, the halfling apologized profusely and handed the wallet over to Darg. As Darg began to walk away, Fuzz trotted behind him, asking him many questions which Darg had no interest in answering. Finally, in frustration, the shaman turned to Fuzz and said, “Look, I'm goin' teh hunt Ice Giants. Yeh can come if yeh want, but I'm not going to be held responsible if yeh get squashed under a giant's foot.” <br />
<br />
Fuzz’s eyes gleamed, and he seemed to brandish a rapier and a short sword from almost nowhere. He quickly shouted, “Then away we go!”, and took off in the direction of Permafrost. <br />
<br />
“Why me, I haven't dun anythin' wrong…I feed meh dog every day and kill those derty goblins. Argh…why is teh Tribunal pissed at me, what did I do wrong?”, thought Darg. And with that, the two began to quickly run in the direction Fuzz had gone in, hoping not to find squished halfling at the end of the Fuzz’s tracks.<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 3: Plotting A Defense</b></u></div><br><br />
Somewhere deep in Permafrost, a flame erupted around the lifeless body of an orc. It rapidly grew, until it was multiple feet high, growing brighter with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
“Rest in peace, me friend…rest in peace…” The low, saddened voice of the goblin was barely audible as he spoke, “I will find the man who did this to you, and I will have my revenge…”<br />
<br />
In ran a smaller goblin, “High Priest Zaharn, you are needed earnestly in…”, yet he stopped cold when he eyed the recovered but burning body of Redwind. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry my Lord…I had no idea you were…”, but he was cut short. <br />
<br />
Eyeing the trembling peon, Zaharn quietly said, “No matter Ghest, I was done anyway, I believe you were saying I was needed somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Yes my Lord, King Thex Va IV has summoned you and the Priest of Nagafen; it seems to be rather important. Shall you go now, or must I tell him you are busy? Remember my Lord, it does seem urgent”.<br />
<br />
At this Zaharn sighed, “Yes, I will attend this meeting…have you any idea as to what it is about?”<br />
<br />
“No sir, I was told nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s head out before I change my mind.”<br />
<br />
Ghest went back to work, and Zaharn doggedly made his way to the Meeting Hall. As he reached the chamber, two large ice giant diplomats bowed their heads in reverence and swung open the massive doors. Zaharn quietly made his way up to the large, round, slab of ice that served as a table.<br />
<br />
“Well, Zaharn, I’m glad you could finally join us!”, remarked the King, visibly irked.<br />
<br />
“Save it Thex Va, now why did you summon me here?”<br />
<br />
The King lowered his head, drawing in a large breath. He seemed to be at a loss for words, but he quickly recovered his composure and began to speak. “Our scouts have discovered a large force lodging in Qeynos, I fear they may be coming to try and slay us. They number well over 40, and are a diverse bunch. Even though our scouts have informants among the corrupt Qeynos guards, they couldn’t gather any names, so we don’t know who their leader is. What do you say we should do?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn drew a quick breath and was about to speak when the Priest of Nagafen piped up, “I am sure Lord Nagafen will send some of his best to defend you, after all, he would do anything to protect Lady Vox.”<br />
<br />
Zaharn cast a cold glance at the giant, who immediately silenced himself. Though small, Zaharn was known to be one of the strongest magic users on the continent of Antonica, and not many would dare to anger him. “Even if Lord Nagafen sends 1000 of his best, it would take them at least a fortnight to get here, and that’s simply time we haven’t got if the King’s story is indeed true.”<br />
<br />
The situation truly looked grave for them, and they all were deep in thought. All of a sudden, Zaharn looked up and glanced over at the King. “We will send a pair of our strongest giants to Qeynos, they will be the deciding factor in this battle.”<br />
<br />
The King looked puzzled, “And what purpose will they serve by doing this Zaharn?”<br />
<br />
Zaharn had a crafty grin on his face, “If there is indeed a large force at the city, then our giants will surely perish. Yet if the defenses at Qeynos are normal, the giants should have little trouble causing sufficient damage. Either way, we win. Either the giants die because of the added fighters at the city and we know to prepare for an attack, or they cause a large ruckus and come back to report that no one was there to resist. Plus, the large force (if there is one) will surely want to stay and help repair the city and heal the wounded. So it delays their attack on us.” Zaharn turned to the Priest, “Priest, send a messenger to Lord Nagafen and have him send us 10 of his strongest giants. They will tide us over until we know for sure whether or not we need prepare for an attack.”<br />
<br />
“It shall be done.” And with that the Priest bowed his head, and left the chamber.<br />
<br />
The King was indifferent to Zaharn’s idea, but glowered as he spoke, “You better not piss of the Lord by requesting such a large number of units, he would surely delight in disposing of us and setting up his own dungeon for the Lady to stay in. He always did want her to be nearer to him”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mock me Thex Va, I know what I’m doing. You may be King, but I am much wiser and much more experienced, never forget that.”<br />
<br />
These words angered the King, and he grimaced and left the room, mumbling as he went.<br />
<br />
Zaharn smiled to himself and went back to his own chamber, where he resumed his work. He stared at the runes and back at his reference sheet, trying to decipher the rest of the code. “Blast those damned elves, must they make these runes so hard to understand! No matter, once deciphered and put onto a scroll, they will form a spell which will stand alone as the most powerful ever. None will be able to oppose me then, not even Lady Vox or Lord Nagafen…”<br />
<br />
Yet it was a mistake for him to say this aloud, for the eyes and ears of the Lord were everywhere, even in that room. Silently and unnoticed, a small creature crawled from the room and slid away into the darkness of the corridors.<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 4: A Frozen Prison</b></u></div><br><br />
THUD! The corpse of a massive Ice Giant came crashing to the ground. It had been three days since Darg, Starch, and Fuzz had set out towards Permafrost, and they were now just arriving. <br />
<br />
Darg grimaced, “I travel three days teh get teh this craphole and all the cash yur carryin’ is a few lousy platinum! Yeh cheap son-of-a-bi...”, but he was interrupted by the halfling.<br />
<br />
“Shhh…I hear something, please, be quiet!” Slowly, Fuzz lowered his ear to the ground, not minding the cold snow. “There’s three of em…no wait…two. By God, they’re huge beasts to! Quick, lets dispose of this body and hide.”<br />
<br />
Using Levitation and the halfling’s innate stealth abilities, they were able to hide the gigantic body without much trouble. As they finished their work, they made their way behind a giant pillar, trying their best not to be seen.<br />
<br />
The giants passed by, mumbling to one another, “Zaharn says we’re to do the job and be back in no less than two days. Any more than that and you can guess what’ll happen…”<br />
<br />
Darg did his best to read their minds, but since giants are so huge, it’s anything but easy to do without knowing exactly where in their head to search. As he tried to concentrate he began to wonder, “What job are they talkin’ about. Could it beh an attack on Halas! No…not even giants are that stupid. Surely they wouldn’t travel all the way to Qeynos…unless somethin’ very important is takin’ place…”<br />
<br />
However, his thoughts were thrown aside when he felt Starch begin to move and growl quietly. Darg tried to hold him back, but Starch had no collar that could be held onto. Just as the giants were going out of sight, Starch let loose a great howl and took off in pursuit of them. <br />
<br />
The fight was over before it started, and in less than five seconds, Starch lay motionless on the ground.<br />
<br />
The giants didn’t move, they just stood there motionless. Darg looked over his shoulder to give Fuzz a signal, but the halfling wasn’t there. Suddenly, one of the giants turned and snatched something up from the floor of the corridor. <br />
<br />
Barely audible, Fuzz could be heard screaming for help from the giant’s hand. Even though no help came, the giants quickly took off down the corridor, almost like they were running from something.<br />
<br />
Darg sighed and sat down to plan out his next move. It was quiet, too quiet. Being overly cautious, Darg cast invisibility on himself, and slowly made his way in the direction the giants had gone.<br />
<br />
As he crept forward, the sound of a lone voice could be heard. It was a powerful voice, and deep, yet strangely elegant. <br />
<br />
Soon, Darg reached two large doors, freezing to the touch. He peered inside, and what he saw made his blood run cold.<br />
<br />
Standing there in massive numbers, were goblins, wolves, spiders, polar bears, ice giants, strange creatures of different sorts, and none other than the legendary dragon herself…Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
She spoke in haste, and those in the chamber missed not a word. “Long has it been since anyone dare challenge the inhabitants of Permafrost. But now, according to our scouts, there seems to be an attack force rallying within our walls as we speak! The scouts brought back two of their members, a halfling, and an unconscious wolf.” At this she turned to poor Fuzz, “Well foul creature, tell us of your attack force, and spare no detail. Do this or you will die one-thousand horrible deaths.”<br />
<br />
Fuzz was visibly trembling, and could barely speak. Finally, mustering his courage, he piped up. “I am a member of no attack force, nor do I know of one. I come from a far away land, and care not to harm you or cause you trouble. Please, spare me and this wolf, for we have done nothing.”<br />
<br />
Lady Vox’s eyes grew red, she was visibly angry. “Done nothing! You’ve violated our home and attacked those who live here! What say you about that!”<br />
<br />
Knowing he was in deep…manure if he slipped up, Fuzz tried to be crafty. “Attack! I wouldn’t dare think of doing such a thing. I simply tried to pickpocket that scout on the left because I am looking for a precious herb. The herb is needed to make a potion that can cure my brother of a horrible ailment. Oh yes, and this wolf, I know nothing of it, it followed me here without me realizing it.”<br />
<br />
Half believing the story, Vox turned to her minions. “Search every corner of Permafrost! I want a report of ANYTHING that looks different. Halfling, if you are lying, you will pay dearly!”<br />
<br />
Darg’s stomach felt heavy, and he made a dash for cover. The massive doors swung open and out poured the minions of Vox. His invisibility held up nicely, and he watched them go in silence. He had avoided them, for now. At the moment, the most pressing task was trying to figure out how to save Fuzz and Starch.<br />
<br />
He peered into the doors, and his eyes met those of Lady Vox. She yelled for guards and swiped at him with her huge claws, which caused his invisibility to leave him. In an instant he was bound tightly and set up next to Fuzz.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, he wondered how in the world he planned to get out of this one. Sighing, he cast a glance over at Fuzz. The little halfling half-smiled and whispered, “Nice to see you again, how’s life treating you?” Darg grimaced and looked the other way, “Damn halflins’…”<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 5: A Change Of Plans</b></u></div><br><br />
Lythar smelled it in the air. It was a distinct smell, one of filth and war. He signaled south and began to move silently across the tundra that held Everfrost Peaks captive all year round. Being a ranger was never easy, always having to scout nearby danger and track down certain targets. However this task was far more important than any he had previously taken, and he knew it well.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down in the snow and stringing his bow with an arrow, he waited on the rest of his comrades. Slowly, one by one, men appeared by his side out of utter nothingness. They moved like shadows, never seen or heard until they so chose to be. As the last member of his group arrived, Lythar took a head count. “Five,” he thought, “they’re all here.” <br />
<br />
An evil smirk crossed the ranger’s face. The men with him knew this face well, one of a man who loved to hunt and kill. The elite ranger had no love for orcs or their kind. He had lost his father early in his life during a battle between the Clan Crushbone Elite and the Kelethin Death Squad, as they had been so aptly named. Stepping in for his father, he had been taught to kill mercilessly for as long he could remember. Assassinating a target was no more a job than anything else, as his conscience no longer affected him. He was the best around, no one was more effective or deadly than Lythar. Some wondered why he left the Kelethin Death Squad with the war between the elves and the orcs still raging on, but no one dared to question him. He was more of Myth than a person, and very few who saw his actual face lived to tell of it. <br />
<br />
“On my arrow we attack. I count 32, we kill them all, take no prisoners.”<br />
<br />
The men nodded, and selected their weapons. Two small figures pulled throwing knives from their belts and slipped off in opposite directions. The other pair brandished identical bows, and nodded to Lythar. <br />
<br />
Smelling something odd in the air, the ranger looked over his shoulder. The freezing wind whipped at his face, almost reprimanding him for looking back. He shrugged it off and turned his head to signal the duo, but they were already gone. <br />
<br />
Laughing to himself, he pulled the arrow tight and selected a target. Two large, ugly creatures walked a few paces ahead of their small army, with lines forming behind them. He chose the left leader, and let the arrow fly. It pierced the target’s head, and the monster crumbled to the ground. Almost instantaneously, 4 more of the beasts toppled over. <br />
<br />
Stringing another arrow to his bow, he shot down the second leader. The primitive creatures scattered in utter chaos, and were all dead in less than a minute. Lythar cautiously walked over and surveyed the carnage.<br />
<br />
32 bodies lay motionless in the snow, each of them the empty corpse of an orc. The party checked the bodies, and on one of the leaders they discovered a scroll. It was crudely written, but legible. It read:<br />
<br />
“Serched outside walls, serched guard tower. Found one dead ice giant body, not found other. Attack is false alarm, no one here.”<br />
<br />
The party looked gravely at each other, no one daring to speak. Finally, Lythar found his tongue. <br />
<br />
“They knew we were coming…they had a damned armed orc patrol unit and everything… how in the hell did they know? This changes everything…we have to get back to Qeynos and have the attack postponed, now.”<br />
<br />
He signaled to the other two rangers, “Both of you, go find the other scout parties and give them my orders. Tell them it’s urgent, and if anyone objects, shoot them dead on the spot.” <br />
<br />
Realizing the urgency of the situation, both men left with great haste. Crushing the note in his fist, Lythar’s thoughts raced. “You both go back to Qeynos immediately, find Troo and tell him I’m going deeper in to scout the defenses. I’d like him to come in case I need to make a speedy escape.” <br />
<br />
The rogues nodded and took off, vanishing into the everlasting blizzard. Lythar’s nose perked up and he strung another arrow to his bow. He shot into nothingness, but a cry told him he had hit his mark. <br />
<br />
He crept forward in the direction of Permafrost, and spoke quietly to himself, “This is bad…very bad…”.<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 6: Exposed</b></u></div><br><br />
Deep in Permafrost a Goblin paced irritably, it had not been a productive day for Zaharn. Hundreds of books were scattered all about his room, each of them proving useless for the task at hand. Disappointed and utterly exhausted, Zaharn flopped down in his chair.<br />
<br />
He hated elves, and the very sight of them made him want to retch. Their rune system had proved too much for him, and he had failed miserably at deciphering the ancient incantation. It seemed as though the Elders of the Elven kind laughed at him from their graves, their craftsmanship being the only thing standing between him and total domination of Norrath. <br />
<br />
Cursing them in his mind, he lackadaisically reached for the smatter of papers on his work table. He stared blankly at the runes which were carved on the timeless scroll, and began to wonder. Maybe his decoding sheet was incomplete…maybe his ancestors had missed something. <br />
<br />
It was possible, after all, for the goblins and the elves had hated each other for as long as any living creature could remember. The only known Elven Script the Goblins possessed was from long, long ago, and was stolen material… maybe even a forgery sold to the Goblins by a swindler. <br />
<br />
An uneasy silence dominated the room as Zaharn’s mind turned and tumbled, “You can’t open a lock without the right key…maybe this research is worthless after all…”. Grabbing a blank piece of parchment and a quill, he quickly jotted down a rough draft of the translation sheet. <br />
<br />
After finishing he rolled it up and slid it into his pouch along with the ancient spell that mocked him constantly. Grabbing his cloak and a few coins, Zaharn quietly slipped out his chamber door and made his way through the caverns. He turned a corner and bumped into two armed ice giants, who promptly seized and bound him. <br />
<br />
“What is the meaning of this you blundering oafs!?!,” Zaharn raged, “I’ll have both your heads carved into ice cubes unless you release me now! You damn fools! Do you not realize what you’re doing!?!”. <br />
<br />
They took no heed to his warning and dragged him along as they made their way down the largest hall in Permafrost. They stopped in front of two massive doors, and an abnormally large giant strolled over to Zaharn. It was the Priest of Nagafen. <br />
<br />
“Well little man, what have you gotten yourself into now? What shall Permafrost do without you? Why, we no longer have a High Priest! I guess I’ll have to takeover in your ‘absence’…”. <br />
<br />
He smiled cruelly and gave Zaharn a swift kick to the ribs. The Goblin writhed in pain and sucked at the air to regain his lost breath. The Priest stood there observing Zaharn for a moment, and his look of joy melted into disgust. <br />
<br />
“Take him into the chamber; Lady Vox will pass judgment on him.” <br />
<br />
The two guards opened the large doors and began to make their way through them, dragging Zaharn along with them. The Goblin raged in his mind, instantly thinking of thousands of ways to torture the foolish Priest. A smile crossed his face as the guards hurled him into the middle of a large chamber, and he began to quietly chant. <br />
<br />
Above Zaharn, on all sides, was a council of creatures. At the centermost-point of it all was Lady Vox, glaring down at the small Goblin. He continued to chant, and Lady Vox spoke, “Zaharn, what is that you’re doing? Pleading for your life under your breath?”. <br />
<br />
She laughed, and a booming noise flooded the room. The minions around her shared in her smugness, but Zaharn just smiled all the more and continued to chant. The Lady spoke again, “Zaharn, what ARE you doing!”. <br />
<br />
Zaharn finished his chant, and looked towards the doors through which he had been drug. Slowly, all the inhabitants of the chamber mimicked his motion. As if in answer, a crying out could be heard. It was the most horrible sound of unbridled pain the council had ever heard, and they all reeled back in fear when it rang out more than once. <br />
<br />
Vox calmed them all down, “Order, ORDER! Have you forgotten who I am!?! I am Lady Vox, this peon can not even begin to fathom my power! You have nothing to fear, now let us begin the trial…”. <br />
<br />
She droned on, and the guards at the door looked at each other uneasily. Quietly, one of the guards whispered to the other, “That sounded like the Priest…”.<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 7: Breakout</b></u></div><br><br />
Darg groggily opened his eyes and looked around. Quickly it dawned on him where he was, and he scanned the room. It seemed empty, like a massive tomb built just for him. However, he was not alone in his tomb, and Starch whimpered softly. <br />
<br />
Darg looked over at the wolf, “Looks as though wer stuck in here, pal.” <br />
<br />
He tilted his head down and sighed in frustration. A voice echoed in the room, “Then you aren’t looking hard enough!”. <br />
<br />
Darg jerked his head up and looked around, but saw nothing. Suddenly the rope binding his hands slid off, followed by the one around his feet. He stumbled away from the wall; his newly freed limbs completely numb. A small blur of fur and feet moved to Starch, and the collar binding the wolf fell to the floor. <br />
<br />
Fuzz strolled over to Darg, and smirked in self-satisfaction, “Told ya I was the best in the business…”. <br />
Starch growled at the Halfling, and made a step towards him. It seemed as though the wolf was hungry, and had set his sights on a Halfling dinner. Darg grabbed Starch and pushed him away, “Sorry, but yeh can’t eat the lettle thing today, weh owe ‘em one.” <br />
<br />
Fuzz stuck his tongue out at the wolf, and looked at Darg. “We need to get out of here, fast. I’ve scouted the rooms around us, and it seems as though every creature here is in that one great big hall. Don’t know what’s going on, but we either escape now, or never. I found our stuff on in the next room over, they haven’t inspected any of it yet.” <br />
<br />
The Halfling handed Darg his belongings, and began to sharpen a large dagger. Darg sat down on the rock-hard, icy floor. He could see his reflection in it, and he looked as ragged as ever. As his limbs started to regain feeling, his mind began to wonder, “How teh hell did I end up here, anyway? Damn halflin’ got meh captured…and now it wants meh to help it get out! Grr…damned if I do, damned if I dun’t…” <br />
<br />
Something on the floor moved, and Darg sprang up in surprise. He looked closer, and saw that it was actually on the roof of the chamber, but it could be seen on the mirror-like floor’s reflection. Way up on the celing, a small creature slowly moved. <br />
<br />
It was obviously a spy of some sort, and if allowed to escape it would alert the whole population of Permafrost as to what was going on. Cupping his hands indiscreetly, Darg formed a small flame inside. The creature began to move with greater haste, and Darg turned his heads towards to the spy. He threw the ball of fire with deadly accuracy, and the little monster was incinerated instantly.  <br />
<br />
The shaman stood, picked up his spear, and quietly said, “Wer not safe here, let’s move.” <br />
<br />
They crept over to the entrance of chamber, and Darg peered out. The hall looked clear, and he slowly pushed the two massive doors open. For some reason, his kilt felt a tad bit lighter than before. Fuzz dashed through the small opening, but Darg grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back inside. The Halfling struggled to get free, but Darg pulled him up to eye level. <br />
<br />
He glared as he spoke, “Give meh my wallet.” <br />
<br />
Sheepishly, the ball of fur handed over the wallet. Darg counted the money inside, and whistled to Starch. The wolf walked over and began to growl at Fuzz. Sighing, the Halfling pulled out a few more coins and handed them to Darg. <br />
<br />
“That’s all of it, I swear!” <br />
<br />
Grimacing, the shaman dropped Fuzz onto the ground and made his way out into the hall. <br />
<br />
“Damn halflin’s…”<br />
<br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 8: The Drunken Blur</b></u></div><br><br />
Two of Lythar’s men slipped quietly into a bar in Qeynos, completely unnoticed. The bartender was the only one to see them, but they were regulars here and he was used to their secrecy. The rogues made their way to the back of the building, and pushed open a hidden door. Inside the room 10 people sat silent, their faces a unified expression of grief. <br />
<br />
One of the rogues spoke, “We bring word from Lythar..”, however he was interrupted by a large ogre. “Your comrades have already returned and informed us of Lythar’s findings. We fear the invasion will have to be postponed for a few days, but the troops are getting restless. We haven’t told them why we postponed it, and uneasiness is running through the ranks.” <br />
<br />
The ogre picked up a mug and drained it, wiping his mouth off after. “Where is Lythar? Has be already retired to his quarters to plan out the next attack?” <br />
<br />
One of the rogues glared at the ogre, and spoke flatly, “Had you not interrupted me I would’ve already told you the answer to your question. Lythar is not with us, he has gone deeper into the enemy territory to scout, alone. He sent us to request the help of Troo, is he around?” <br />
<br />
Dead silence filled the room, and the 10 comrades exchanged looks of bewilderment. The ogre spoke again, “So let me get this straight, Lythar went FARTHER into Permafrost territory, ALONE. We lost nearly half a damn scout group to an orc ambush, and this fool goes deeper in, ALONE?!? How crazy is he!?!” <br />
<br />
The rogue glared at the ogre, and smirk crossed his face. “Crazy? I doubt you’d call him that to his face. He’ll be fine, I’ve been a member of his assassin group for years; he can take care of himself surprisingly well.” <br />
<br />
The ogre sighed and flopped down into his chair. A dwarf stood up and refilled his mug at the back of the room. As he returned to his chair he began to speak nonchalantly. <br />
<br />
“You both are carrying 5 concealed knives, why? Did you plan to slit out throats and make off with our money? There’s no need to try and fool us, we’re not as easily taken as the imbeciles you’re assigned to kill” <br />
<br />
The other 9 shifted uneasily as the rogues quickly brandished rapiers and hissed to the dwarf, “What’s it to you? We carry these for our protection. In our business you trust no one, this includes groups of madmen who try to slay a dragon that has lived more years than they can count.” <br />
<br />
The dwarf sipped from his mug, and smiled coolly. “Then how are we supposed to trust you?” <br />
<br />
He stood and placed his mug on the table next to him. The rogues advanced slowly, rapiers at their side. As he moved his arm to scratch his chest, one of the rogues lashed out with his weapon. Dodging the attack easily, the dwarf kicked out at his attacker. <br />
<br />
The rogue tumbled into his comrade, and they both slammed into the corner of the room. Before they could think the dwarf was standing over them. He held a long, gemmed, ancient sword in his hand, and placed the tip of it on one of the rogues’ nose. <br />
<br />
“Don’t double-cross us, we’re not to be taken lightly. If you kill one of us you’d better damned kill all of us, or you’ll not live long to regret it.” <br />
<br />
The ogre chuckled, “That’s enough now, Vish. I think you’ve more than made your point.” <br />
<br />
The dwarf smiled and strolled over to the table, where he drained the mug next to him. He went again to refill it, but found the keg empty. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me, if you will. I’m going to go refill the keg up front.” He eyed the rogues, “Don’t try anything while I’m gone, the gnome over there is mean with a staff.” <br />
<br />
He laughed heartily and toted the keg out into the main part of the bar. As the rogues stood and regained their composure, a high elf spoke. She called out quietly in an elegant voice, “Who wants a free drink? I’m paying.” <br />
<br />
A rush of wind terrorized the room, and a door could be heard shutting behind them. <br />
<br />
“Free drinks? Who said something about free drinks?!?” <br />
<br />
A man of average height stood in the center of the room now, his drum in hand. He looked to be of elven origin, although one could also detect human in him. He had a stern but jovial expression on his face, almost like he planned to tell you a joke and then murder you in cold blood. Troo was the fastest thing around, not even the fabled griffin of the Karana’s could match his speed. However, Troo also liked to drink…heavily. He often walked out of a bar in the wee hours of the morning only to run straight into a nearby guard or even a tree. So, Troo wore armor at all times. It provided him protection while he was fighting, and also while he was drunk. Even with his frequent ‘crashes’ (as they had been dubbed), the bard was still a friend to all he met. After all, what’s funnier that a drunken bard trying to sing? <br />
<br />
The rogues looked at each other and smiled. “Troo, have a job for you. Lythar is currently scouting Permafrost for enemies, and asked us to send you behind him in case he needs to make a quick escape.” <br />
<br />
The bard’s hands became a blur, and soon a small fiddle was held in place of the drum. He strummed a few chords, and looked curiously at the small duo. <br />
<br />
“I want my damned free drink first! Why, what’s this world coming to? People shouting all about free drinks and never owning up to their words!” <br />
<br />
The high elf laughed heartily and handed a mug to Troo. He chugged it quickly, and spoke. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Kaura, that was refreshing. Now this Lythar…isn’t he that crazy assassin everyone whispers about? I didn’t know we enlisted him to help us…” <br />
<br />
Kaura cleared her throat and spoke in Troo’s direction. “You didn’t know because we didn’t tell you, or anyone, for that matter. None of our soldiers would feel very safe knowing they slept in the same town as Lythar. While we have dealt with him on previous occasions, they have not. We know and trust him, but they blindly fear him based on his skills as a killer…fools. Listen, do this deed and every beer you buy in this town for the next month is free. Is that accep…” <br />
<br />
But her voice dropped off. Once again the wind had ravaged the room, and books lay scattered all over the floor. Somewhere in the Hills of Qeynos a lone bard made his way towards the Caves of Blackburrow, narrowly avoiding a collision with a tree. <br />

	<p><br><div align="center"><u><b>Chapter 9: Jailbreak</b></u></div><br><br />
Zaharn could do nothing but sit and listen. The council knew about everything, the ancient spell, his plans for treachery, everything. Lady Vox was obviously enjoying the trial, as her gaze never left Zaharn. <br />
<br />
Events such as this were rather uncommon in Permafrost, and even a little variance from the norm was a rare treat to her. She hated her ice fortress, her prison. She longed to leave it, as she had not seen real snow in hundreds of years. <br />
<br />
Alas, those who had trapped her here had left neither loose end nor loophole for her to exploit, and she could do nothing but sit around all day overseeing her minions’ activities. <br />
<br />
Once, long before even the oldest of Permafrost could remember, she had been an ambitious warmonger. Back before the gnolls of Blackburrow had taken up their home she had used that same series of caves to stage a double attack on Halas. <br />
<br />
With the caves as the only route away from the Peaks, she figured it would be an easy task laying siege to the city. However the Barbarians had proved to be too resourceful, and their beastlords used tamed mammoths to assault her makeshift fortress where Blackburrow now stands. <br />
<br />
When it fell the floodgates were cast open and the armies of Qeynos and Freeport beat her forces back into the innermost chamber of Permafrost. <br />
<br />
Although the attackers were great in number, they stood no chance against the Lady herself with their primitive weapons and armor. She had obliterated them, but not before sustaining heavy losses to her own army. <br />
<br />
She loved it, the feeling of being in battle. The pure rush of killing something as it comes at you with the same intent. Yet that feeling had left her long ago, and now she was content with harvesting minions inside the cold walls of Permafrost…or so she led on.<br />
<br />
“Zaharn!” An Giant Magi spoke, “You are hereby declared guilty of High Treason and plotting to kill the Lady herself. For this you shall be put to death. Bring in the executioner.”<br />
<br />
The large ice doors opened, and a giant wearing a black robe came walking in. He carried an executioner’s axe in both hands, and raised it as he approached the tiny goblin before him.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Vox had stood up. “Bring me that sack he carries, I have a feeling it contains a few things we could put to good use.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The executioner reached down with massive hand and reached for the sack, it was now or never. Zaharn’s hands began to glow with white light, and as he clapped them together he shut his eyes. A blinding flash lit the room, and the council screamed in agony. <br />
<br />
The goblin dashed between the legs of his executioner and made for the large ice doors that separated him from the endless halls of the chambers of Permafrost. <br />
<br />
One of the guards foolishly tried to stab at Zaharn with his still limited vision, and the goblin nimbly dodged the attack. In response, Zaharn formed a small orb of fire in his hands and cast at it at the giant’s feet as he ran off. A column of flame exploded upwards as the orb hit, and in mere seconds the once proud giant was a measly puddle of water.<br />
<br />
As Zaharn made his way through the complex halls, he could hear Lady Vox’s voice echo throughout her keep. “After him, get that damn goblin! Dead or alive, I want him caught!”<br />
<br />
The “damn goblin” smiled inwardly as he ran. All of Permafrost had come to witness the trial, and not one guard was left for him to elude, save the few who stood outside Permafrost itself on watch. <br />
<br />
Zaharn turned a corner and nearly tripped over something lying on the floor. He leaped over the obstacle and looked back over his shoulder to identify it.<br />
<br />
In that spot lay the motionless body of a massive giant, not like those found in Permafrost. The corpse smoldered and fizzled, scars visible all over it’s torched skin. <br />
<br />
Zaharn laughed as he picked up his pace. <br />
<br />
“Foolish priest…” <br />
<br />
<u><div align="center"><b>Chapter 10: What To Do, What To Do?</b></div></u><br />
<br />
Vish closed the door, toting a large keg on his shoulder. He made his way to a table in the back of the room and set the ale down. Grabbing a mug, he gave himself a generous amount, and then promptly gulped it down. Wiping his beard clean, he eyed the two rogues sitting in the corner and smiled. <br />
<br />
“Well now, you’ve seen what we’re up against, enlighten us.”<br />
<br />
One of the rogues put away the rapier he had been sharpening and stood. He eyed each member of the room individually, and then spoke.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I don’t think even Bristlebane himself could make his way around that blasted place right now. The outside alone was crawling with orcs, giants, spiders, polar bears, and who knows what else. They knew we were coming. Well…they knew something was coming, but they didn’t know what, when, or where from. Now that one of our scout parties has been exposed, you can bet that all of Permafrost will be on high alert. We either postpone our attack, or we meet them head on. They’re expecting us now; it’s no longer a game of infiltration and secrecy. In a short time they will have fortified Permafrost completely. Can you imagine trying to traverse up ice ramps with enemies hurtling objects down at you? That’s the beauty of Permafrost, it’s a massive collection of rooms and halls, all made of ice. All they have to do is plant ramps in strategic places and we’ll never be able to gain ground. They’ll just rain down on us with ice spears, and they’ve got enough stalactites in there to hold us off for a year. You’re looking at suicide if you try and attack now, plain and simple.”<br />
<br />
The rogue sat down, obviously not surprised by the expressions on the faces of his 10 listeners. They looked to his partner for a second opinion, but all they received was a nod of affirmation.<br />
<br />
The ogre leaped to his feet and bellowed to his comrades.<br />
<br />
“This is asinine! Just a few minutes ago these rogues were going to slit our throats, and now we’re trusting them to tell us the truth about something that changes our whole plan of attack? Doesn’t anyone else here see something wrong with this? The soldiers are getting restless; they want to fight…they want to slay this beast who’s lived in legends and myths for as long as we can remember. If we don’t attack now we’ll lose morale, not to mention the men of Halas who enlisted to join when we first arrived. We need every man we can get, and the only shaman we have are barbarians. You most certainly can’t win a war without the help of shaman, that’s like trying to slow time itself! I say we attack now, and my opinion is not going to change, period.”<br />
<br />
Regaining his composure, the ogre sat down and took a sip from his mug. Across the room a small gnome rose from his chair. He seemed to be of average height for his race, and he wore a blood colored robe. He scratched his bald head and spoke.<br />
<br />
“About what you rogue spoke of, the ice ramps, have you actually seen them put to use before?” <br />
<br />
A reply came from the darkness of the corner, but everyone recognized the rogue’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, I’ve seen them put to quite good use. 12 or so odd years ago I was walking the peaks looking for Tundra Jack, and I stumbled across Redwind’s Plateau while it was under attack. Apparently Redwind had built a smaller part of the plateau up into a tall tower, and it stood above the rest of the structure. The small group of attackers, 14ish, made their way to the base of the tower. The stoop was abnormally large, and just as they reached it two large orcs heaved a slab of ice over the steps. The attackers tried to climb the ice, but their progress was horribly slow. As the first of the climbers met the halfway point of the ice, 3 small orcs appeared at the top of the frozen slab. They held spears in one hand, and shields in the other. They slung their weapons with deadly accuracy, killing off three of the men before anyone noticed them. As the rangers slid off the ice to provide cover fire, the orcs struck down 3 more of the party members. Despite being excellent shots, the rangers could do nothing more than watch their arrows bounce off the shield of the orcs. Block an arrow, throw a spear, block an arrow, throw a spear. The orcs even began to alternate shielding one another while attacking. It was merciless. In less than a minute the whole party was dead, minus the two or three who managed to flee with their lives. A party of 14 able bodied fighters killed off by 5 or 6 orcs at most. It was disgusting.”<br />
<br />
The rogue took a pipe from a pocket in his black cloak and lit it. Looking as though he had all the time in the world, he took a few puffs. Satisfied, he pulled the pipe away from his mouth and continued. <br />
<br />
“About your attack plan, you do have some minor flaws. What if, in the endless twisting hallways, your force becomes trapped between two of their platoons? Remember, you’ve never seen the inside of this place before in your life, and they walk it daily. The less armored units you placed near the back would be annihilated. What’s worse is that most of Permafrost’s inhabitants have claws of some sort, and can go over the slabs at will. So if indeed you are only under attack from one side, yet you decide to retreat from your attack, you’d have the full force of Permafrost on your heels. You would be, for lack of better words, completely and utterly screwed.”<br />
<br />
The rogues exchanged smirks.<br />
<br />
“We have a few suggestions…if you’d like to hear them. I can’t say they’ll guarantee victory, but they will most definitely help”<br />
<br />
The ogre grumbled and threw a piece of parchment in the rogues’ direction.<br />
<br />
“Start talking…”</p>
