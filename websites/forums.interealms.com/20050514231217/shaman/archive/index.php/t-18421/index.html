<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am usually someone who doesn't dog on a tactic until I have tried it, but rains are the worst spell I think I have ever memmed. With the changes on Rallos Zek about not being able to harm my pet and poof it I decided to try rains. A lot of shamans on this board have said they love rains and they are great. But I beg to differ on that.<br />
<br />
I head into Maiden's Eye to camp my shard and I load up both rains. I pull one, two, up to three mobs and tank them while tossing out rains and I swear I might get one or two hits on any mob with the rain. I toss the rain on the mob my pet is tanking and I will get 1 or two resists. I cast rain on myself with my PR up at 200 and 2 - 3 mobs beating on me and I will only hit them once or twice. I can kill 3 mobs faster root rot with less mana than with tanking and rains. If the only way these are going to hit for full damage is tossing out a Malos before hand I might as well just root rot. Costs me far less mana and time.<br />
<br />
What is the point of these rain spells? And if it is only for raid or group damage then I will point out that I am on Rallos and I can hurt others so that isn't going to work. Unless I am doing something really wrong for when I solo with rains I think these will acutally be the first spells I will delete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would help if you use the right spells vs the right mobs.<br />
<br />
Rains have several uses:<br />
- Fast and low agro dps on raid level mob with low PR.<br />
- Fast and efficient dps on 2-4 low PR mobs in an exp group.<br />
- Fast way to clear trains of greens.<br />
<br />
Rains should not be used for:<br />
- Killing mobs with decent or high PR, which include most of luclin.<br />
- Soloing. Since rains reach peak efficiency when used against at a minimum of 2 mobs that are closed together, you'd be forced to fight at least 2 mobs at once when you could be just dealing with one.<br />
- PvP. Unless your target has very low PR, rains won't do too much. It is best used as a means to force low hp and low PR casters to constantly move, thus giving them less chance to cast.<br />
<br />
Like all spells, Rains' uses are situational. When used against the right mob, a shaman can sustain very respectable dps with rains.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Herm, since you are on Rallos, rains probably aren't the best spells to use on raids or in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Re-read my post. I was using the rain on 2 - 3 mobs while I tanked. Maybe they are high PR but I hardly get a resist on BoS in ME. So explain that to me because I would only get two waves with 2 - 3 mobs. Thought supposed to be 3 waves. In fact if I remember right I was only getting 2 waves with one mob. Pet still soak up a wave?<br />
<br />
And yeah can't use rains on raids on RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is 3 waves per cast with a chance at a resist for every wave. If you didn't see all 3 messages it prolly just got lost in spam. <br />
The big problem with rain is that every mob gets 3 chances to resist it. Sometimes they will resist all 3, sometimes they will resist none. I used to avoind using rain until I got Tears of Saryn. That spell is awesome for LDoN. Often have more than one mob in camp and you can really do some damage like that. Whenever you get lots of resists, just remind yourself that rain spells are relatively low mana for the potential damage. I find myself using rain on just one mob at a time, its low aggro and, as I said, pretty cheap to cast.<br />
Using rain on raids is not always a good idea even if you are not on a PvP server, since there tend to be lots of mezed mobs around. Also remember not to use them when you have charmed pets around. I got a chanter killed in Tactics the other night when his pet came down and he didn't announce he had it mezed. Next thing I know he's dead and I got a hasted mob on me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe but really there isn't a lot of spam when it is just me and dog and 3 mobs. I could swear I would only get 2 resist messages for me and mobs. I will try again in a different place but I really think Rains are teh suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yeah I try to use rains from time to time but usually end up right clicking it in disgust after a couple strings of full resists. They are real fun on mobs that have super low resists, otherwise they are just real frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found that in BoT, even after Malosinia Tears of Saryrn gets resisted a lot.  Even more than Torrent of Poison used to, which doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rains will hit for  a max of 4 times.<br />
With 1 mob its 3<br />
with 2 mob its 2 waves on each<br />
with 3 or 4 mobs its 1 wave on each plus<br />
1 final wave on 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rains work like this (as far as I remember):<br />
<br />
1 target - 3 waves<br />
2 targets - 2 waves per target<br />
3 targets - 1 wave per target<br />
<br />
Your pet won't be hit by the rain, and if the rain hits you, that doesn't count against the target limit.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that Torrent of Poison has an inbuilt resist penalty, even after malosini or whatever it is resisted way more than Bane of Nide seems to be.<br />
<br />
(And yes I know that there's no resist modifier shown on Lucy but ask most shamans if they think it resists the same as bane of nife)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rains are pretty low utility solo and on a Zek I can't see much use for them at all.  If you ever go blue, you will find rains are pretty nice to have up for a little extra DPS in raids and groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Er, just to clarify,<br />
1 target = 1, 1, 1<br />
2 targets = 2, 2<br />
3 targets = 3, 1<br />
4 targets = 4<br />
<br />
You don't count against this four target limit.<br />
For instance, it can be:<br />
1 target = 1+yourself, 1+yourself, 1+yourself<br />
2 targets = 2+yourself, 2+yourself, yourself<br />
3 targets = 3+yourself, 1+yourself, yourself<br />
4 targets = 4+yourself, yourself, yourself<br />
<br />
(I forget if you still get hurt after the max number of targets are hit)<br />
<br />
If not, it's more like:<br />
1 target = 1+yourself, 1+yourself, 1+yourself<br />
2 targets = 2+yourself, 2+yourself<br />
3 targets = 3+yourself, 1+yourself<br />
4 targets = 4+yourself<br />
<br />
Not sure if players count against this limit either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ummm beg to differ. All rains are the suck except the lvl 55 rains+. Those are da bomb.<br />
<br />
Very fast dmg and your basically doing IComet dmg for the same mana a wizard would use. Even if only 2 rains hit, you have just done 1k dmg in seconds, and 3 waves is total gravy. Do you think for one instant a wizard wouldn't have killed for a Malaise type spell for IC before kunark?<br />
<br />
Before lvl 55 however, rains do suck. They do less dmg per wave than the price of the spell. ie 39 gale of poison = 122 dmg per wave for 200 mana. You need either all three to hit or those spells are pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No one here suggested you use rains for soloing. That IS just dumb.<br />
<br />
They are for killing mobs engaged by some other person where you can stand back and chain cast the 2 of them back to back avoiding the recast delays and be doing constant DPS. Plus they can critical hit and typically combine to make it our safest fastest DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dots - mana-efficient damage over time (i.e. slow)<br />
Rains - mana-inefficient fast(er) damage.<br />
Nukes - drastically mana-intensive instant damage.<br />
<br />
That's how it boils down for shamans.  All rains suck in their randomness (mages have the same gripe, 3rd wave almost never lands, and all 3 waves CAN be resisted outright).  What they're for is a chance at good, sustained DPS when you have an overabundance of mana - which I frequently have.<br />
<br />
I use rains on (some) raids (have to be very careful on that one), and in LDoN if we have C3, beastcrack, or a bard around.  Or if there's actually someone in the group healing, other than myself.<br />
<br />
They're extremely situational, but can be very rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think someone did a parse on rain spells across the board and deduced an inherent minimum 20% resist chance per wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just wanted to add that if you rain one mob and another mob comes into range AFTER the initial wave you can get 5 waves out of the rain...2 on each mob plus the initial wave on the first mob.  Also, if a third mob ran into range on that final wave you could get 6 waves out of the rain, but that would be pretty hard to pull off :)<br />
<br />
Of course, rains are virtually useless on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
edit: and by waves i mean different hits to assorted mobs.</div></div><hr />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
While it is not necessarily a great option, it is a viable option when dealing with mobs in say, Droga.<br />
<br />
If doggy has two wooden practice daggers and is hasted, he will get agro sure enough, and after a second or so, you can just keep raining the mob-- and even if it gets angry at you, you can rain doggy if he's on the opposite side of the mob as you without hurting yourself.<br />
<br />
I've tried overloading mobs with dots, trying rains, and trying velium strike... all are equally annoying. haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yup...<br />
Mage Compendium did it awhile back...it affects their rain spells too..<br />
.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall that the test involved fully debuffing the mobs...and then raining...keep in mind their rains can be magic based...so if I understand it, they had a chanter tashing and a shaman using malosinia to debuff the mobs as low as they could get...<br />
<br />
Then they measured the full resist rate...not partials...and came up with a 22 percent resist rate that seemed to be hard coded in...<br />
