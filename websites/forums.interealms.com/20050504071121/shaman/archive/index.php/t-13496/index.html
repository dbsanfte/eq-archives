<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was the lucky winner of a Sceptor of Calekor the other night in VT.  I'm not sure of the effectiveness of this however, it seems I've taken a risk with my dkp.   :P     Anyhow, I haven't had much time to play with it yet and was wondering if any of you other shaman have this effect on an item, and if you've noticed any difference in resists.  For all of you that don't know, Brilliance of Ro is supposed (according to Lucy)  raise the spell cast of the caster by 20 levels.<br />
<br />
Thankees for any input,<br />
Ssik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It doesn't effect resist rates at all.<br />
<br />
It might reduce fizzle rates, but with max casting skills the effect is barely noticable.<br />
<br />
I always considered it a bugged effect, one that didn't do much of anything at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye..its only effect is reducing fizzling...does not effect if XXX mob resists ur slow or not<br />
<br />
hope ya didnt blow the DKP farm on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do either of you actually have an item with Brilliance of Ro on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman in guild has one and what has been posted above pretty much matches their observations.  Perhaps affects fizzle rate, but if it affects resist rates at all it's not noticeable in the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have the Shield off of Aten Ha Ra, it has Brilliance of Ro.  (Aegis of Judgement)...   If it makes me Fizzle less... it's not so obvious a change that I've ever gone  &quot;HEY!!!  I'M NOT FIZZLING!!!&quot;  as well, I've never noticed myseld saying.. &quot;Wow!!!  ALL THESE SLOWS ARE LANDING SO EASY!&quot;... so Basically, yeah, it's not, in and of itself, a hugely useful effect... on the other hand, it's not a thing that can hurt you either....    The best thing about that Sceptre is it looks like a SOD and now you can Anon and tell people you are a Beastlord to avoid Buffing noobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do either of you actually have an item with Brilliance of Ro on it?<br />
Before my guild started doing VT I had heard the effect wasn't very noticeable so I never put in on an item with that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rosco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw this scepter on Lucy and really thought it could affect our resist rate on slows and dots. So I looked for it in the bazaar for one full week before actually finding someone wearing it.<br />
<br />
I asked him if I could borrow it for an hour before buying it and tested extensivly the resist rates of slows and dots with vs. without.<br />
<br />
I reached the exact same conclusion : it doesn't affect resists at all. I didn't notice a decrease in fizzle rate, but it wasn't my main interest either. Though it really seemed I could channel more between hits than without it, go figure.<br />
<br />
But to answer your question, I tested it and it didn't change the resist rate.<br />
<br />
Rosco.<br />
<br />
ps : I play on FV server where the scepter is tradable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You had a question and I have guildies with it who have reported just what i did.  We had a long discussion cause if it did in fact make slow less resistable i would have blown the DKP farm on it in a heartbeat.  After we discussed it tho..it seems that any effect that it does have..either way (fizzling or resist rate lowered)...is so negligible that getting the item JUST for the effect was out of the question.<br />
<br />
We concluded tho that reducing fizzle was the intended effect<br />
<br />
GL to u tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1)Extensive testing done with other spells/items with the same type of effect done many months ago determined that fizzles is the only effect.<br />
<br />
2)One of the Devs stated at a recent Fan Faire that all it is suposed to do is reduce fizzles.<br />
<br />
Don't need a 'Brilliance of Ro' item to test it, btw... enchanters get a pair of spells with the same effect at a lesser value : Intellectual Advancement and Intellectual Superiority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have the shield from aten ha ra. It basically increases effective casting lvl by 20. I have noticed a reduction in fizzles, with maxed spell skills before I used to really get annoyed with fizzles. With this imo its much noticable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, alright, I've had this item for about a week now, and all I can say for the effect is that it's really non-existant.  I don't notice any improvement in my fizzle-rate (my spell castin is maxed).  So if you are going in on this, just consider the stats of the item, focus effect be damned!  <br />
<br />
Your pal,<br />
Ssik Ymra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It doesn't do **** at the level you get it. If you had used the search function you would have noticed this and avoided wasting dkp on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yah the guildies I have who have looted items with this effect also say it does jack and ****.  Better just hope whatever you looted has some kick ass stats (which it probably does) and those alone are worth the DKP spent.  <br />
<br />
I like useful focuses tho.  I really do.  You've chosen the least useful, somewhere behind reagent conservation (for shamans) and summoning haste.  <br />
<br />
Good focuses to look for there are &quot;Speeding Thought&quot; which is 18% spell haste, all spells cept CH.  Also there's an earring from mini AHR that adds 22% dmg to Cold based nukes.  Or even Wind of the Nightcrawler at least makes buffs last longer or whatever.  <br />
<br />
You got hosed on the focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I noticed a definite decrease in fizzles myself after getting my Crown of Energy, but none of the other shaman with it I know have noticed anything similar.<br />
<br />
Don't really see why I would notice all that much of a difference when most people don't, but maybe the RNG hates me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wind of the nightcrawler is 30% benificial spell haste actually =)<br />

<br />
From VT personally I consider the best focuses to be Focus of Mediocrity on the crown. 15% extension and everything pretty much owns.<br />
<br />
The speeding thought already mentioned is very nice.<br />
<br />
The wind of nightcrawler is also very nice.<br />
<br />
Finally preservation of the akheva on the aten mask is the highest mana pres effect in the game other than specific ones like Pernicious Focus for dots etc.<br />
<br />
There are other assorted focuses you can get in there, often times too many to name but those are the ones I would watch out for in particular.</div></div><hr />
