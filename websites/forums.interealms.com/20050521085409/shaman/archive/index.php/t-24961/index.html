<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ikol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I've visited very often for EQ but never posted (at least I don't think I have :).  I saw the listing for the spells, and thought I would rearrange them a little.  Let me know what you think.  I used classifications from a another post, so if it needs to be re-arranged let me know. Thanks.<br />

One thing that needs to be worked out eventually is what replaces what, and what needs to be kept in what combo, especially with regards to HO's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't see a root or snare on the list. Do shaman not get either in EQ2? I made a heck of a Enchanter with root and slow in EQ live ;) Sure hope Shaman get some form of crowd control in EQ2. Anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the other spells get a snare component (eg Ice Nukes in this case).. speaking of which I believe Grey Wind has a snare component, not a slow component. I will confirm tonight when I Get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">courage is a group buff  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ikol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dasha, Thanks moved it.<br />
<br />
I completely did not realize that there was no root or snare, except for 'touch of grey'. That's very interesting, will this limit solo play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No root really bothers me. I suppose if we did have root again, we would be soloing Gods and that would go against the developers wish to make the a truly group orientated game. So much for the root and rot Shaman :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having no root or snare will not limit our solo game..  I think the Ward's make up for it 10 fold..  IMO..  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ikol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If wards prevent a certain amount of damage, would it fit better under mitigation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">instead of moving the spells around..  could you by chance add what the spells actually do..  like Spectral Ward - Ward..  ok what is Ward?  I know what it is but not all do..  I am sure if we can get a detailed explanation of the spells you can put them in a catagory that suits them perfectally...  <br />
<br />
BTW I like your post good job grouping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhodry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Where do I get spirit of wolf from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You get spirit of wolf when you are 80% into 13th lvl or 14th I forget....  Some spells you dont get right when you ding your lvl you have to wait a little bit...  you will eventually get it though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can give you some info for how it plays up to L14, which is where I am . . . <br />
<br />
<br />
Spells I run almost constantly are Courage and Spiritual Seal.  These are group spells.  I use Spectral Ward on the MT or on someone getting low on health.<br />
<br />
If the group has a long way to travel and there is no Ranger in the group I'll hit us all with SoW.  If a Ranger is available, Pathfinding is better.<br />
<br />
In combat I use Contagion, Wailing Haze and Weakness quite a bit.  Smite isn't great but it's a &quot;decent&quot; nuke.  Both my direct heals are more than adequate to fill the role of main healer.</div></div><hr />
