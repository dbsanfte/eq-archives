<br />
LOTS of action.  You will not be disappointed in the fight scenes.  I think they took a few moves off the WWF.<br />
<br />
Good action flik.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All in all great movie:D</div></div><hr />

Ok first off those grenades cmon lets bend light!  Its like ok I realize YES this IS an action flick but you can at least make it semi believable for goodness sake in legend they at least had to create a mirror tunnel to REFLECT the light all the way down.  Its little things like that which keep the movie from being truly enjoyable and lets just not speak about how becoming a vampire makes your body ultradense so that you can break concrete when youre thrown into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utherwayn Leafwalker</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yea the good things...<br />
<br />
Well the scene where he ripped through all the body guards with the stun stick was neat.  Pretty entertaining character design and thats about all I can really bring myself to say lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the movie kicked a whole lot of ass.  You gotta love when he climbed up the wall and dropped the elbow. :D  They're going to have the same guy write part 3, I can't wait.  I had one or two minor issues but over all I thought it rocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys liked it? Personally I thought there were a million continuity errors, the script was cheesy and beat you with a club to get the point across. The fight scenes (when you could see what was going on) were very well done. The WWF moves were just silly and over the top. <br />
<br />
The movie had alot of potential. It also had alot of acting talent. Unforunately none of it really got used. I enjoyed it don't get me wrong, but it could have been 10x better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is the gore factor?<br />
<br />
I'm interested in seeing it, but too much gore really turns my stomach - literally - not a good thing in a crowded theater.<br />
<br />
The scene in the first one with blood spraying out of the sprinklers almost made me leave the theater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This one one has alot more gore then the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinara</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea, there's a lot of gore. And I'm with you, I can't stand the gore either. Unfortunately, my husband loved part I, and he wanted to see Blade II so bad that I agreed to go with him (made for a very happy husband, hehe). <br />
<br />
Overall, I really liked it. I thought the action scenes were fantastic, I liked the plot line, and I liked the script (I found myself laughing quite a bit, and it was intentional).<br />
<br />
That being said, I slept with the light on for the next three nights. :p On a brighter note, I can now sit through Blade I with my husband since it's not nearly as gory as the second (although I still turn my head at the blood sprinkler scene).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The movie was crap. I thought the fight scenes were horrible. Too often the camera was shaking and moving around, which I believe is to cover up bad technique of those fighting. I agree with whoever said it above. The script was terrible. Character development was pathetic. Blade didn't use that sword of his near enough.<br />
<br />
I also think they shouldn't have brought Whistler back, but hey, thats just me.<br />
<br />
The movie was not bad to look at, but leave your thinking cap at home for this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The soundtrack was really good as well.  I bought it yesterday and really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
It's an action movie.  I rarely ever expect to think very hard at a movie like that so I never go away disappointed.  I enjoyed it for what it was and it was a very good movie.  Hope they make another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think this one had more character developement in this one than the last one.  Also all the characters were unique and likable.  I do wish they had shown more of the asian vampire though.  You could tell he was a bad ass.<br />
<br />
There was good interaction with the characters and like someone said I laughed a bunch of times.  Plus in this one Blade was more of a real character than the first.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And I don't care what you say, when he suplexed the guy and the other guy dropped the elbow, I was cheering :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I was thinkin Macho Man right after he landed the elbow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blade 2 rocked.<br />
<br />
I think I like the first one just a tad better but I think that it was partly due to the &quot;newness&quot; factor.<br />
<br />
I know some people complain about some of the script errors in time line or story and other people don't like some of the corny cliches but keep in mind these movies are supposed to be &quot;Live Action Comic Book&quot; style movies.<br />
<br />
They are MEANT to be a tad corny and you have to open yourself up to that.<br />
<br />
While the movie on a whole was just a fun ride all together my favorite scene is the VERY end when Blade is waiting for a certain vampire and says &quot;You didn't think I'd forget about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
hehe anyhow I LOVED it and will be getting it on DvD to put beside my original Blade DvD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm off to see it tomorrow night, gory or not.<br />
<br />
I'll let you know where it rates on MY gore scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't think it was that gory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as the blood, it really wasn't too bad. However, there was an awful lot of crunching, cracking and splatting - ewwww.<br />
<br />
I liked it. It was fast, exciting, and very comic-bookish.<br />
<br />
When does Blade III come out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw it this weekend.<br />
<br />
Overall ok, but not as good as the first one.  Much lamer story IMHO.  Felt kinda duct-taped together.<br />
<br />
What I found very disturbing was the family that was there.  Mom and Dad apparently thought it would be a good idea to bring, their 10-12 year old son and daughter as well as their maybe 9 month old baby.<br />
<br />
What I found amazingly funny was the comments of the punkers in front of us.  The guy with the bright green mohawk amazed that someone would take their kids to this kind of film.  Just goes to show you can't judge a book by it's cover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah.. way to many loose ends in that movie. I personally liked how Blade acted in the first one. The cheesy smart ass remarks he made in this one just didn't do anything for me because they were a dime a dozen. I wish they explained the whole story with Whistler too. I dont think there was a single character that stood out in the movie for me, including Blade hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aizle, I had a similar experience when I saw it.  There were at least five little kids under the age of seven in the theater.  They were crying and the parents kept running them in and out of the theater.  One little brat was running up and down the aisles.  <br />
<br />
I really wanted to hate the kids, but that would only be misplacing anger that deserved to be directed at the parents.  Get a baby-sitter or something, ok?  Better yet, take your screaming brats, err adorable children, to a G rated movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seaghan</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed the movie alot.   It entertained the hell out of me.  Some very impressive fight scenes (and I also got a laugh out of the ending wrestling moves. ) and I liked the horror feel to it (those Reapers sure were creepy).<br />
<br />
Apparently for Blade 3, Del Toro wants to make it take place roughly 20 years after the 2nd movie.  Vampires rule the earth, putting humans, like cattle, into camps.  Of course the Daywalker (not unlike John Connor from the Terminator) returns from exile to save the human race.</div></div><hr />
