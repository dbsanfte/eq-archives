<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking and kinda planning my gear, and was thinking of getting elemental helm and that belt from poair. My crown of ambivalence has served me well so far and wondering whether that belt from poair extends the number of things that the crown does, ie slows, buffs, dots?<br />
<br />
2nd question is atm I am using a Mask of Dark thoughts which is spell haste 4 basically and is nice. However I am aware of solusek items, and wondering how much these can reduce stuff like tears of saryn, malos and turgurs down to. Atm think I can get 2.3 sec slow with my mask and blessing of reverence. <br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1- Belt from PoA (i guess u mean woven steel sash) affect only beneficial spells. To my knowledge, there is no other item than the crown of ambivalence with extend detrimenials (slow, malos, root, excluding dots). Maybe PoTime ones... This is why i stick with this crown, which is good enough, and VERY nice resists.<br />
<br />
2- 18% haste on detrimenial = Speed of Solusek. Shamans have access to 4 items with such haste on detrimenials (not heals): Sol Ro gaunts, Bracer from FR script, range from Lurker ring in PoE and the earing from agnaar (general spell haste 18 on that earing). If you are looking for 22% spellhaste on detrimenial, then you looking for Quickening of Solusek, but is it PoTime loot... I wouldnt change your mask before you get another spell haste really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep the Crown, ull need 2 items to replace it something with Eteminostrum/Chrononostrum and Timeburn/Chronoburn.  Know of only one item with Chrononostrum and one (ench only) with Chronoburn, both from Time.  If u can manage to get Eteminostrum and Timeburn then Id worry about gettin an elemental helm, thats what I plan on doing.<br />
<br />
Arms/Wrist Item from Rathe, Leaf Twined Guards, has Blaze of the Lightbringer thats 20 % deterimntal spell haste if u can get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kelp-lined Mantle from Coirnav have 20% extend duration which upgrade to crown's 15% <br />
<br />
earing of Lightbringers from VT have 20% haste to slow/debuff<br />
<br />
that is the only item before PoTime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ty ty much valued advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kelp-lined Mantle from Coirnav have 20% extend duration which upgrade to crown's 15% <br />

The mantle is benificial only. You need the earring too for the detrimental only side of things. The mantle does have the lower min duration like the crown so it works on torpor but other than that is nothing more than an 8th shawl with better stats. Personally I don't plan to replace my crown any time soon just because the effect is so hard to replace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">god so many focus effects. I guess mana saving things don't stack with each other, for example preservation of xegony with conservation of mithaniel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They don't. You only get the best of any type effect.<br />
<br />
Take my gear for example.<br />
<br />
I've got Pernicious Focus, Preservation of Xegony and Mana Preservation IV<br />
<br />
Pernicious Focus is 30% mana pres but only on dots.<br />
<br />
Preservation of xegony is 15% mana pres on all spells and go old MP4 is 10% on all spells.<br />
<br />
So what happens is when I cast a dot I get Pernicious Focus and get the 30% mana pres.<br />
<br />
When I cast anything else I get the Preservation of Xegony and get the 15% mana pres.<br />
<br />
You can have multiple types of effect on a spell tho but not of  the same type. IE I can decrease cast time, decrease mana cost and extend duration of a spell all at once but I can't save mana twice.</div></div><hr />
