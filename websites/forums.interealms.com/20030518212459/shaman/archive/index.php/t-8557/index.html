last night after i have been looking for a jbb for a few week (only to be rejected at 30k twice i might add), this guys (we'll just call him guy X b/c i'm at work and don't have the name i wrote down) auctions WTS jbb.  So i'm all pumped!  i'm like finaly!  send a tell 30k.. he's all i really need this quest piece would u do 35k. i'm like sure being excited and sooo pumped that i am acctualy getting one.  X says acctualy if you had the quest piece then i'd just trade it striaght across for you.  being lvl 44 and in a small guild of rl friends i'm like ya right like i have whatever he needs worth about 35k.  X says i have the old ui and cannot make a search so if you could buy that item then we can just make the trade.  curious i make the search (can get bakc to you on the item and names later).  i find what he is looking for.. only one if the baz and selling at 9999 .. so i'm all WWWWOOOOTTTT *insert happy swear words here*  heart pounding i race the bank and grab the item faster then you could imagine.. sooooo pumped.. buy that item and send the guy a tell and.. oh look.. hmm.. he's not online.... send friends and shmmy chat a tell.. *** is (this item)  and they basicaly said it's worthless.  soo... just be careful.. i am just too trusting and i was really way to pumped to even think once much less twice.   <br />
also should i continue to save for the jbb?  only about 2k away from getting the cash back b/c i had about enough for a horse and a jbb.  any other suggestions would be appreciated <br />
tks,<br />

Sorry that happened to you.  That's an old scam.  :(<br />
Post the story (just the facts) on your server message boards if you can't reach him within a week or so to give him a chance to make it right.  If you notice him in game again, or if you noticed a guild tag (I'd tend to doubt he'd have one), you can try to speak to his guild leadership or him directly.<br />
<br />
Posting on your server boards will hopefully alert others to the scammers ways.  You might as well post the names of the people involved here also, since he may be targeting Shaman specifically playing on our eagerness to obtain a JBB.<br />
<br />
Better luck on your continued search for a JBB.<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tks, i'll get the names for anyone on VZ when i get home tonite... a friend suggested emailing the gm but i think it would be useless.. what do you guys think?  i mean i know he can't really help me and i figure that if you are going to scam then  you are going to have a bs account (in this case 2).  i doubt anyone will see the guy again.. bs player on a bs account.. but i've told my friends and if we do see him imma camp that @$$ till his gear rots =)..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the better things about the Zek Servers is that you can actually get some sort of revenge, even if it doesn't get your plat back. Post the name of the bastard who scammed you, and I will se what I can do - I am an officer in one of the tougher guilds on VZ, and I will put the word out with a few people in rather high places in the uber guilds - Mr scammer might get rather a nasty surprise....repeatedly. if nothing else, it will word people up to treat the person like a leper</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raxthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Atleast take comfort that something like this has happened to almost everyone at one point in time or another. If it is in the form of dropping a bag of items on the ground, handing the wrong item into a quest giver (before fix), having items stole off your corpse (before consent fix), getting trained on perpose or flat out being scammed. It flat out stinks an nothing will really make that feeling of being betrayed go away.<br />
<br />
Just accept that it suxs and remind yourself that its just a game and get on with playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">happened to me as well a while ago and when I petitioned there was nothing that they could do (so they say).  Basically, only thing you can do is make sure you don't do it again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since he didn't actually break any rules, there's absolutely nothing a GM's going to do, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
While I find what the scammer did to be rather despicable, I still admit I admire the scam a bit.  So much more graceful than just sitting on a fire so that the coins will drop to the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure how the bazaar works on VZ, but I have not even glanced at the /buysell channel or /auc since bazaar went live.  Three years of scams and haggling for crap have made the bazaar that much better of a choice when it comes time to buy something.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you got taken and I hope you do nail this guy to the floor a few times.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Artificially inflating an items price through using 2 diff accounts (or even two friends doing it) is scamming, and people can be banned for it  - it happened on Quellious at least once... some guy selling whoresbane from Najena(?) for 3k apiece, while his friend auctioned wtb it for 5k... yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
Learn your lesson, and don't believe anyone who says they aren't using the new UI and &quot;can you look this up for me&quot; <br />
Why would they want a stranger to, instead of a friend? :|</div></div><hr />
