<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirec</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I don't really play EQ much these days (not while school is in session, anyway), I still browse these boards a lot and figure this is a great place to post asking for advice on this particular subject.  From the posts I've seen in the past 3 years I think there are a fair number of techies hanging around. :)<br />
<br />
A little background: I'm a third-year college student (just 3 semesters left… sigh) attending UT Dallas and majoring in MIS.  I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was a kid (I still remember our old Tandy 1000 with no hard drive and a 5 1/4&quot; floppy lol).<br />
<br />
I'm just starting in on upper-level courses (business and tech stuff), so obviously I still have a fair amount to learn through the school.  What I’m looking for is advice on what I should learn that school won’t necessarily teach me, or be able to teach me.  I have no problem with teaching myself, it’s something I enjoy and something I have the resources to do.  My problem is knowing what I should focus on.  I have a few friends who work in the IT departments of businesses, but they’re the regular workers – they don’t concern themselves with hiring or knowing what skills are needed, most of them stumbled into the jobs by accident and picked up the skills specific to their job over time.  My inquiries are usually met with shoulder shrugs and, “I dunno.”<br />
<br />
I’m not looking to be a programmer; while it’s fun to play around with, I simply can’t see myself doing that day in and day out.  What interests me is actually working with the hardware and software that companies rely on for their information.<br />
<br />
What kinds of things should I be versed in?  Obviously I need to know about actual network hardware etc., and I already have a basic knowledge of that just from things I've picked along the way.  Unfortunately I have a regular office job, no tech job or even internship to learn more from.  I really don't have access to any networks to play with. :(<br />
<br />
What software packages should I know?  Programming languages?  Beyond a bit of VB and C++, I really don’t know much about programming languages.  From what I’ve been able to gather, those two are the main languages I should know something about.  As far as web stuff goes, I know HTML reasonably well, but no Javascript or VBScript.  What about Linux?  I have a friend who just recently began using it, and he commented last week that “Linux is god.”  He doesn’t even use Windows anymore, heh.  I know I have some database classes (Oracle, SQL, etc.) coming up next semester, so I suppose I’ll have to see how in-depth they are.<br />
<br />
I’m looking for some insight from folks who know something about the industry; with just a few semesters left, I feel like I should be actively doing something to expand what I know and make myself more marketable beyond just attending classes.<br />
<br />
Be nice, if I seem naïve – I am!  Just looking for some advice on what I should tinker with next. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The typical arrogant ass who works in IT and knows &quot;everything&quot; isn't going to be on the fast track for the best jobs. Work on your customer service skills, and you'll go far. As an IT professional, the people in the business are your customers, and if you treat them like dirt, they will disregard your advice, and you won't be the first one people think of for promotions, raises and prestigious projects.<br />
<br />
Also work on public speaking. The computer professional who can get up on front of a room full of executives and explain an IT project with enough pretty pictures that they got it is truly rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty similar.  I found I didn't like programming much at all, and I'm much more into the technical side of things.<br />
<br />
The most valuable (and the best paid) IT workers tend to be the network guys.   If you can, learn routing protocols.  You can practice on a cheap linux system using something like gateD or zebra.  Understanding how large private networks interact with the internet over multiple net connections is important.   Few know how to do it well.<br />
<br />
Learn to be a DBA . You have an upcoming class on Oracle/SQL?   If taught well, that will be very, very valuable.  If not, you can still build on what you learn there.<br />
<br />
Learn Linux.   At minimum, learn how to configure it, learn how to install and configure modules, and learn the anatomy of the file system.  If possible, investigate DHCP, Web, DNS, FTP, and routing protocols.<br />
<br />
Hardware knowledge will only take you so far -- anyone can build a computer, and many people know how to troubleshoot them as well.  You can certainly make a living doing hardware troubleshooting and/or helpdesk style jobs, but I wouldnt recommend it.   <br />
<br />
Large networks are so much more versatile and fun.  You can get a job where every day is different, because you never know what a large and diverse network will throw at you.<br />
<br />
The bigger the company, the more specialization you can get away with.  Speaking from experience, you can be the sole IT guy for a 20-person internet biz, and you have to know it all -- desktop troubleshooting, people skills for help desk support, network skills, server and database administration, the works.   In a large company with a 20+ person IT department, you can focus on one thing -- IE, you can be a DBA, or a hardware technician, or a network guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good suggestions so far.<br />
<br />
I would add the following.<br />
<br />
Make sure you know MS Office.<br />
Learn how to manage time well.<br />
Learn how to be organized.<br />
Perhaps starts on an MCSE or CCNA certification depending on which direction you want to go.<br />
Intern over the summer at various different places.  See what it's really like in the IT world.<br />
<br />
and lastly...<br />
<br />
FINISH SCHOOL<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you are not planning on it, but I only have 21 credits left for a BA and I have kicked myself on a number of occasions for not completing that degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirec</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
As far as customer service skills go, I work at the office of a mystery shopping company so I think I'm set for life.  I'm funny like that though, unlike the average employee I believe that you only get as much respect as you give.  Go figure. :)<br />
<br />
For public speaking, you can lump me in with the other 99% of the population who despises it. :D<br />
<br />
Coryn, you hit the nail on the head - I would love to work with company networks.  For instance, my brother has my personal dream job; network support for a rather large architectural firm.  He gets to play with computers and gets paid for it. :(<br />
<br />
I was already planning on dual booting Linux this summer (I don't dare risk doing it while school is in session, Windows apps are required for some classes and I need to keep my puter up and running heh).  Any particular versions you'd recommend?  I was planning on Gentoo.<br />
<br />
My company makes extensive use of databases, in fact that's pretty much our business now - most of what we work with is contained in databases, from the beginning of creating the product to delivering it.  From that perspective I think I'm probably set, between taking some classes and working around people who know that stuff well and are willing to explain it hopefully I can get a fairly firm grasp on how it all works.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on finishing school for sure, as much as it pains me to see friends happily making bunches of money doing what I would love to do - I resolved to get my degree and I'm sticking to it.  Plus, I don't have very good luck and I think finishing my degree is the only way I'll be able to get a job like that.  Falling into stuff doesn't work for me, it seems. :)<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I'd recommend:<br />
Network design/topology knowledge is key.<br />
Learn cisco switches and routers<br />
Learn the Microsoft stuff since Sales/Accounting/whatnot will always be using MS so most every company has some MS network setup.<br />
F5 and Alteon knowledge can be useful.<br />
DNS is important so understand bind 8 and bind 9 in addition to whatever the heck Microsoft uses.<br />
Network protocols are good stuff.  Understand at least the basics of all common tcp and udp protocols.<br />
SSL, Learn all you can about this because more and more traffic is ssl-ified every day.<br />
Databases, take a basic database class.  If you like it, continue learning more.  If you don't, then just learn the basics of supporting Oracle and SQL server environments.<br />
Learn Solaris 2.6 and 2.8.  Most shops use at least some Sun stuff.<br />
Learn a flavor of BSD or linux.  If you know any one of these then the rest are pretty easy to extrapolate.  BSDs and linux use many of the same tools which are frequently somewhat different from what you'd see on a proprietary unix.<br />
Learn basic shell scripting, bourne shell at a minimum, if you plan on doing anything with unix.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I'm not an MIS person.  I'm a programmer/architect who designs and implements systems and infrastructure.  Hence I know what a sysadmin, network engineer, or MIS needs to know since they are my customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jatran</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like great advice so far.  I've been in IT since 1990 after a six year tour in the Air Force.<br />
<br />
Just to add to what Coryn said in regards to the specialization...in my experience, smaller companies give you an opportunity to be involved in more aspects of IT.  <br />
<br />
A large company might have a help desk, a desktop department, a systems department, a networking department and a telcom department.  Working in the desktop section, you may never get to see how the servers are built or how the network is routed.  This of course depends on the company.<br />
<br />
A smaller company might have 3 people that do all the above.  You get exposed to more.  You get to see if you like the networking side and working with routers and switches etc. or if you really prefer to work as a systems engineer and keep the servers running.  After some time you can then start to concentrate on the area that interests you most.<br />
<br />
As Nekoken &amp; Aizle said I think there are some skills that will help no matter what area you end up in...<br />
<br />
TCP/IP | DNS | DHCP | Basic routing &amp; subnetting<br />
Basic troubleshooting tools- ping, tracert, etc.<br />
MS office <br />
Linux<br />
Sun<br />
Organizational skills<br />
Project management<br />
<br />
And Myrea is absolutely right, personality; and how you deal with people can take you a long way.<br />
<br />
I love working in IT and can't imagine doing anything different.<br />
