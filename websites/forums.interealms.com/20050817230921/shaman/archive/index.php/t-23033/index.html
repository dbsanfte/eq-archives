<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you had come into 50k from a friend would you:<br />
(btw im lvl 62 still needing all 63+ spells and no guild)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">None of the above. I would do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Purchase a Metal Linked Crown, a Valorium Ring of Gallantry, an Artificer's Ringmail Bracer, Weatherbeaten Shoulderpads, and Blackened Ooze Boots.<br />
<br />
2. Do LDON adventures for a set of arms, gloves, and leggings: Ghastly (MMC 442), Black Mire (GUK 760) or Incorporeal (EF 1492). At some point, you can add a tunic to that list.<br />
<br />
3. 63/64 spells are cheap on my server. You can probably go purchase them, and if you're frugal, you should have a good amount of money left over for Q, etc. If you don't have enough, you can always farm plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Problem is quin is selling for 30-50k and fo7 is the same............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Problem is quin is selling for 30-50k and fo7 is the same...<br />
<br />
Ahh. Would have worked better if you had put that in your original post.<br />
<br />
I would still do what I suggested. You need some gear upgrades pretty badly in some slots. From there, save the plat you have left, go get your 63/64 spells, and in the mean time, farm. There are plenty of threads here on farming, you should be able to take a group of friends and clean out Droga for named drops, or even Velks (SCHW sell pretty quickly for 4k+ on my server, and the wristband is about the same). It takes awhile, but I also had to save up and purchase my 65 spells as I could.<br />
<br />
If there are open raids on your server, attend them. Your chance of winning a Rune is slim, but it's definitely possible. A lot of times, the higher guilds will raid, and discover they have quite a few 65 spells nobody needs. They flood bazaar selling them, and the price drops. Keep an eye out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's QUIESCENCE not &quot;quin&quot; damnit!<br />
<br />
I hate people who call it &quot;quin&quot;. if you're gonna truncate the word call it &quot;quies&quot; or something. thank god I got BoT, then I can just say &quot;Trushar to %T&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would also suggest the gear upgrade.  Not that my gear is all that great but it has taken me 4 years to get and i love it all :)  I do have a suggestion tho, why the chain bridle?  I know horses are fun, i have one, but if i were in your shoes where spells cost 50k (which is insane if you ask me) i would sell the chain and grab a lesser horse.  Selo speed is nice, but not a necesity really, and a lower bridle will do the same amount of mana regen as a selo bridle.  Just a thought...good hunting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you level slowly, buy Torpor ASAP.  Use the remaining money on gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
If you level quickly, level up and buy Quiescence ASAP.  <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with getting armor upgrades.  Gear makes a big difference in how long you can do things:  more hp means you live longer, more mana means you cast longer.  <br />
<br />
But no matter how good your gear is, if you don't have a key spell, you can't cast it even once. <br />
<br />
And once you begin casting Torpor / Quiescence:  you have moved into a whole new level of shaman power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it's QUIESCENCE not &quot;quin&quot; damnit!<br />
<br />

<br />
I've just been calling it as Q for %t since like a week after I got it, no one knew what the heck Quiescence was supposed to be anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its the 8k horse btw nothing nice...And I do have torp and malo--those were cheap--malo was 7k and torp was 11---thanks for the input so far guys...........But I was also thinking I could have the best gear there is, but if I dont have my spells...............................<br />
Sorry I meant &quot;Q&quot;................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Trushar to %T&quot;<br />
<br />
But everyone knows Quin = Q = Quiescence.  If you suddenly started saying Trushar, they'll all wonder what's he casting and clerics will continue to cast SE/SR right after your Trushar.  After having &quot;Breath of Trushar to %t&quot; for a couple months, my message is now &quot;Heal over Time to %t&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Tordail, make those gear upgrades. Skip Torp (assuming you hav Stoicism). While you level from 62 to 65, you SHOULD be able to generate enough cash to get Quies. Just stick to LDoNs and BoT, and roll on loots. Or, if you prefer, solo. You could probably handle the asslings in PoM on the moat wall. One copy of Y73R pays for Quies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Save it for when OOW comes out and price of pop loot plummets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOL! 50K will buy you almost two ornate chain sleeve patterns (not that you need more than one, just for interest's sake) or almost an ornate chain leggings pattern on Stromm (economy is rather screwed).<br />
<br />
[Edit: Spelling]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">buy torp and quin and whatever else you need<br />
<br />
why would you possibly want to buy torp AND quies.. even if youre only lvl 62 it still will take you maybe a day to get to 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">why would you possibly want to buy torp AND quies.. even if youre only lvl 62 it still will take you maybe a day to get to 65<br />
Because rushing to the end leads to boredom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Server economies vary a great deal. On E'ci, you can buy Ornate Sleeves for 20-22K if you shop around. Ornate Legs, on the other hand, would be 90K+ and much harder to find. Similarly, somebody said that SCHW are 4K+ on his server, but on E'ci it's 2K.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you need money, camping a 31% haste item is probably your best bet. The one in Droga should be easy if you remember that the mob will HT you (hint: or your pet), the one in Veksar may be more of a challenge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bahh I made a mistake i meant fo7 and &quot;Q&quot; not torpor, i have torp and malo--and why the hell is malo soo more exp then the debuffs above it--l<br />
malosinia i think and then the other--please excuse me if i am wrong on the names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd sell the plat, quit eq, and watch a movie.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I'd save that for level 65 spells, and the important group spells at level 63 and 64.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i would donate it to other chars. with like a jeopardy type quiz... ask them a question like...where can king tormax be found... answer right get 1k... and so on and so forth</div></div><hr />
