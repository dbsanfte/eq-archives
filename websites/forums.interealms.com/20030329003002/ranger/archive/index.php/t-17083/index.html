<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faldak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just recently dinged 58 and would like some suggestions on hunting spots.  My in-game time varies so getting into a group is not a real option.<br />
<br />
I have a level 47 cleric bot that tags along.  I have been in PoJ fighting the rats,sentry's, and some of the named mobs.  It seems that in the last week or so that zone has exploded with people.  Along with the trains from the lower levels.<br />
<br />
I have a fungi and swarmcaller (not listed on my magelo profile).<br />
<br />
Suggestions appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your situation seems to be much like mine.  Ever since 53, I've been in Jaggedpine.  I have a cleric friend that I duo with when I can.  There is a time-zone difference so we usually can only get together for a couple of hours.  My boring routine from 53 to 59 (dinged yesterday) has been to solo Timber Griffons and Giant Anacondas, or duo in the Gnoll Caves.  We usually set up in the cave where Barducks spawns.  The MoB's are non-stop pulling and is good xp.  I let the cleric take all of the loot items to help with the peridots and other regents, but with /split on, I still get 250 pp per night .<br />
<br />
58 took me about 9 rl days of grouping with my cleric friend for a few hours and soloing about another hour a night.  Its slow going, but steady xp and no dying.  At 58 all of the Gnoll casters (oracles, curates, defilers) will be light blue to you.  Most all of the Darkpaw Warriors will be dark blue (about 80%).<br />
<br />
I checked before I logged last night and there are still a few Darkpaw Warriors that are dark blue to me now at 59, not much.  Dark blue Giant Anacondas are very rare and all of the Timber Griffons are light blue.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to decide what to do now myself.  My cleric friend is going to be very busy, so I will need to find someplace to get through 59, but hopefully this will help you get through 58.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samoht_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been fear kiting Velium Hounds, mastodons, and brontothingamajig in WW.  Not bad xp and the loot is nice since they sell for 500-1k in bazaar.  I had the zone all to myself last night.  All the hounds and mammoths I want!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valinusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm also 58 with access to a 59 cleric and have been grinding out AA in Skyfire. Not bad xp, but dodging cromo's is a real pain.<br />
<br />
I was considering trying Siren's Grotto - avoiding the actual sirens of course, but going after some of the entrance/exit mobs. Is this do able with a healer, or is there no safe place there to set up camp?</div></div><hr />
