<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sabiniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, my friend had Torpr in his bank.. Thanks Ranjah buddy!<br />
anyway, I still have my fungi tunic and they are selling up to 80k on terris, hell <br />
someone even traded a CoF for a fungi.<br />
<br />
my question is: Should I keep it?<br />
<br />
Iksar<br />
2 pts into regen =22 a tick<br />
fungi= 15 a tick <br />
regrowth = 15 a tick.<br />
52 a tick regen, with torpor thats some nice mana...<br />
<br />
might have to snatch a vindi bp from my old buddy Derakor..<br />
<br />
any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">finally?  You've been 60 for like a week Sabiniz.  :p <br />
<br />
congratulations, it's a great spell.  <br />
<br />
There's another thread talking about keeping or not keeping the fungi after Torpor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd sell it. I don't even bother with regen anymore unless I'm going to be in a long long fight. Torpor and cann4 just change everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless you're severly hurting for money, don't sell it. They're kind of hard(er) to get now and you will miss someday :)<br />
<br />
Congrats on Torpor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are selling it just to get cash for the hell of it...  I wouldn't bother.  Its still useable in some situations and its a nice twink item.<br />
<br />
If you are selling it in order to get some item(s) that would greatly improve your gear...  then it might be worth it.  <br />
<br />
I haven't put my fungi on since I hit 60 and scribed torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sabiniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Hen, yeah I like the spell alot!<br />
<br />
Dunno, what Ill do though either sell it for a crapload of plat or give it to my 50 monk, iunno what ill replace the fungi for isnce i got nothing else to use...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's always the option of using the tunic as, or toward, a nice gift for your friend.  Maybe I'm just wierd that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hit 60 and now I'm letting my best friend IRL use it on his 39 monk til he hits 51, then I'm sticking it on my rogue, monk, or warrior twinks (dunno which).</div></div><hr />
