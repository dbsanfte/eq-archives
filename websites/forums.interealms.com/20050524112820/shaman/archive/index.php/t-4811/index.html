<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been seeing some strange prices in the Bazaar. I normally have a pretty good idea on the &quot;common&quot; prices of items, and I wonder where some of these prices come from.<br />
<br />
Example: JB Greeves. I have seen the up for sale 8 or 9 times on my server (before and after the new Bazaar zone) and the price has been from 15k to 40k. <br />
<br />
Yet I see a pair in Bazaar on a /afk trader for sale for 160k.<br />
<br />
I totally think that people can put whatever price they want on an item, either they'll sell it or lower the price, but that seemed way over the top. I also see items for sale for crazy prices and another of the same item for sale by another trader for tons less.<br />
<br />
Someone was auctioning a Fungi Tunic for 45k (35 to 50 seems standard on my server) and another guy was auctioning his for 110k at the same time. Ummm...huh?<br />
<br />
Maybe the guy did not even have a Fungi, but was trying to price-fix or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some people just figure &quot;what if&quot; <br />
<br />
They are hoping to catch an ENCREDIBLE newbie who might have just purchased 100k on Ebay.<br />
<br />
Though there is a 99.999999% chance that they will still be auctioning those JB legs for 160k 2 years from now, unless they lower the price.<br />
<br />
Hell might even just be a mistake, stuck an extra zero in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the /trader interface let's you sell something that you don't actually have in your Trader's Satchel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a guy on Rathe who regularly sells Fishing Grubs for 1,000,000pp.  Each.  I sent him a tell once, asking if he would come down to 999,999pp 9gp 9sp 9cp each, but he was afk.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I regularly see Regrowth of Dar Khura on 5-6 vendors for prices ranging from 1k to 7k as well.  Some people don't check the competition, I guess. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some people just don't care and it works both ways. I see people with permanent traders in the bazaar. They are always there and always exorbitantly priced. These people have lots of time, a second account and don't care if they rip someone off.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are many people that sell very cheaply. They either have limited time to sell and just want to get rid of it or they're just the generous type that has no need to rape people. Unfortunately, these people tend to be bought out by the nasty people and the same items are then sold at exorbitant prices. :\<br />
<br />
I run a trader at night while I sleep and I always set prices a tad under standard. Not enough to lure the overpricing bastards, but enough that it is a good value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are alot of people who are silly and try to sell things insane prices, like the one guy who has had talisman of the rhino for sale for 50k for about 3 weeks. =) but then there are others who just want to get rid of items, and you end up with great deals, like my peerless dragonhorn bracer for 1.5k last night! i'll stick out the bastards who overprice, or hide low priced items at the bottom of their satchel just so they get browsed, for the people who have genuine deals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not quite sure, but I believe there are several reasons they put trivial items at such high prices.<br />
<br />
On EQtraders, one tradeskiller talked about how she would bury a BD at the bottom of her trade satchel and price it at the pp she would BUY blue diamonds at.  She would bury the BD under a ton of 100k fishing grubs and rusty weapons.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand how it works, but she mentioned it in a thread discussing the new 80 slot limit, and how she wouldn't be able to do it any more.<br />
<br />
Also, some people put it out there so people can always find them.  Need to find 'azuzububu'?  search for fishing grubs and then rclick on his name to locate him.  He's always available that way.  Again, I really don't understand how it works.<br />
<br />
I don't think most of these people actually intend to ever sale the items, and they don't think they are 'ripping people off', since it's quite obvious that no one will buy the item.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Not sure that this addresses the fungi for 110k.  If I had an item that I didn't really want to sell, but was rare enough that it was desireable, I might put it for sale at an insane price overnight.  If it sells, great, I made a ton of money.  But if it doesn't sell,  great, I didn't want to get rid of my only BP anyways.</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty sleazy thing to do, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

People can currently only see the first 30 items you're selling.  If it buried in slot 32, for example, people will have to buy 2 items, moving the item they want into a slot they can see.  Referred to as &quot;mining&quot;... I've done it on NPC vendors after I stupidly sold something I didn't want to to them. ;)  I fail to see why anyone would buy a rusty weapon for 100k to get a BD when there are probably 10 other people in the bazaar selling BD's though.  ;)<br />
 <br />

<br />
I'd personally just make a note of the name and select them from the Traders dropdown... easier then remembering &quot;Oh yeah he always has fishing grubs&quot;.  At least to me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lots of people just go afk and sell their every day equip for extremely overpriced amounts.. that way if someone is a moron and decides to buy that slime coated harpoon for 5k then you make a profit. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The person who snapdragn referred to wasn't doing what she did to entice people into buying her high-priced Fishing Grubs and Rusty Weapons. She wanted to be able to buy BD's cheaply, so she set a low price for the BD on her, covered it with crappy items so no one could buy it, and waited for other merchants to drop their prices to match her BD price. Then she bought their low-priced BD's for tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Bumping the sellable items limit up to 80 will fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">in my server, one afk trader try sell Voice of Berserker for 900k and Malo 70k(standard price 30k), on well he been there like 24hrs a day and maybe 365days a year soon<br />
<br />
