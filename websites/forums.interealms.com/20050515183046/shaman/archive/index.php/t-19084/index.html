<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently set up a mule and unloaded a TON of junk from my bank.<br />
<br />
I have over 125k in my account now and was wanting 100k horse or more likely drogmor.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if any of you have purchased one and if it was worth it?<br />
<br />
They say it's faster than SoC, if it was I would be inclined to buy one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always passed on rolling on the bridles dropped by Seru and Emp because I never felt they were worth my raid points. We have SoW and Scale, so getting around isn't that big a deal. We have pretty good mana regen as it is, to the point where I don't want to give up mobility for extra mana.<br />
<br />
I have a paladin alt with the Holy Steed AA, and the speed is definitely nice; however, in my opinion you'd be better off purchasing some ornate molds (sleeves and bracer) than spending your money on a fast horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well all the running to dungeons in ldon made me buy the 100k dogmor, can't say i regret it. Wanted to get the black horse first to play sk lookalike with skelly form from bracer, but went for lizzy afterall<br />
If you can afford it i say get one.<br />
Didn't test it against SoC so can't comment on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you dont need to save for any purchasable gear upgrades go for it, tho drogmor&gt;horse cause the ears will get in your way, and you wont wanna shrink everytime you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I adore mine, and last I heard running on a drogmor was sorta annoying with a lev type bobble, and I never mind shrinking horse head out of my way, so I'd voice an opinion toward the horsie (besides, tan fits my armor theme VERY well, and I can't imagine a Barb on a lizzie).<br />
<br />
  I had a 100K horse, sold it to acquire Malo way back, recently regained the cash to get a new horse and have promised never to send him glue-factory again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd recommend just getting the cheap one frankly. Yeah it's nice getting to your ldon dungeon 30 seconds sooner if that, and you might use it to run across pok now and then, but I personally don't even think that's worth keeping the luclin models turned on for, much less 100k.<br />
<br />
For a class that can't sow it might be a different story, but with the added height from the horse you barely notice the speed difference vs. sow. I had to time myself when I first got mine because I thought maybe I got a slower one by accident.<br />
<br />
p.s. I sold it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had both the bought chain bridle and now the ornate version.<br />
The bought one is worth the money if you can spare it, don't have anything else to buy.<br />
The ornate one is suprisingly better than the bought version, I'd estimate about 15% better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have the 100k droggie, i don't regret it... my favorite piece of gear. and one that i'll probably never upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have the thunder lizard as well, I like it.  Definitely go drog over horse.  The first time you try to mouse target or loot a mob while mounted you will thank yourself.  The speed is awesome, but remember if you get stunned you start from a dead stop, so it is not the all powerful train making device one might think.  Stopping is slow, so you have to get used to planning ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How much does the 100k mount sell back for out of interest ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How much does the 100k mount sell back for out of interest ?<br />
72k if I remember correctly, vs. 102k to buy it.<br />
<br />
I've noticed if you make a post asking about almost anything in eq there will be people who post things like:<br />
i don't regret it... my favorite piece of gear. and one that i'll probably never upgrade<br />
without backing it up. Such replies don't seem especially helpful to me if you don't say why. Yes a horse is a great piece of gear, but the most important feature only costs 10k, how do you justify spending the additional 90k or so? Especially for a guy with only 125k to his name and has 2320 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I sold mine back after I got CannV. Course, I just had the cheapest one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I run REALLY fast, thats a good enough reason for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have one, never regretted the money.<br />
<br />
1. It run fast, not fast as a good ol' Selo but close. Just like when you got SoW, you'll be addicted to the speed travel ;).<br />
<br />
2. Like any mount, bein able to med/switch spells without causing sitting aggro or while casting your spells is a HUGE bonus.<br />
<br />
If you buy a horse, shrink yourself, the horse head is a pain :p<br />
If you buy a lizard, I hope you won't suffer of the movements :p (personnally, I don't like it :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">moving (even turning around) on a drogmar makes me ill.  I had to sell mine back and buy a horsie!  The nice thing is that as a barb, shrink x 2 = no horse head at all.  As a dark elf enchanter, gnome illusion = horse head mostly gone.</div></div><hr />
