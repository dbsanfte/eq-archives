<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stupid question, eh? Can't see a release date on website.<br />
<br />
Thinking about giving it a go just for charm slot, or even make a froggie to mess with.<br />

What time on monday I am not sure given that there supposedly is 50 megs to patch the day loy opens it may take a bit to get on and play then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">50 megs that day? even with incremental patching now?<br />
<br />
my 56k gonna cry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was thinking of getting my 58 chanter or 51 ogre shaman over on current account, and re enabling/upgrading another to twink a frog.<br />
<br />
Just dunno what class be cool. Never played a cleric or pally to any decent level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Clerics not too hard Millman, you just buff, sit and med, then heal occasionally (or alot pending on tank ;)), rinse, repeat.<br />
Oh and throw in the odd Rez for spice :)<br />
<br />
Frog Paladin might be pretty cool to play, especially if you had a Jeldorin to give em :)<br />
<br />
To be safe tho, I wouldn't bank on really playing in LoY until a day or two after opening, since there's gonna probably be an inundation of bugs and emergency patches (DOH!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And ubers killing all the spawns and complaining when there isn't VT quality loot there, only &quot;n00b&quot; loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, fine with me, first thing I would do is get froggy away from froggy land.<br />
<br />
I just want to get him a few levels to play with my few friends who all started over. We all did necros, and it is great outdoors, but they all bitching about dungeons, dungeons arent fun with three necros.<br />
<br />
First night the new froggies appeared in swamp, was non stop killing of them by people, was funny.<br />
<br />
I do wonder, however, if charms will be introduced in to existing zones as well o just drop in new LoY zones?<br />
