9. I would like to not have to be elemental flagged, or on a raid to kill Tier 3 nameds in order to get the components for my level 65 spell. I can't afford to pay 50k for them in the bazaar, and I don't think that I should have to be in an elemental guild to get my level 65 spells. Maybe make them researchable. <br />

Alan's reply to the above post:<br />
You don’t need all of your spells. Just like some weapons, armor, and other stuff, some of those spells just may be out of reach for some folks. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I personally find this offensive. I had great progression all through the game until lvl 65. Then all progression stopped since I'm not guilded and have no desire to be guilded. Its not about time played, I play plenty. There is no progression past lvl 65 and bazaar gear for me unless I want to raid. I have invested as much or more time and effort into my characters as anyone in a raiding guild, why am I penalized? So I started alts and when they hit 60+ all I can see is quitting EQ, there IS NO PROGRESSION after that for me in the current game.<br />
<br />
Yes I have looked into joining a time based raiding guild. Found a great bunch of mates, liked everyone I meet in the guild. They only have use for 2 shaman in the whole guild, their role on raids is &quot;to die&quot; as I was told. They require 5 hours a nite, 5 days a week raiding time for members. That to me isnt fun, its a job, and one thats doesnt pay anything.<br />
<br />
Gloriana I implore you to address this at the upcoming meeting.<br />

I don't mind not having the best gear or foci.  But to keep my spells from me is just stupid.  It's part of my responsibility of playing a caster.  How many Rangers would be in the game if a Trueshot was the best they could get unless they had access to EPs?<br />

I think everyone is fine with the raiders havin better equipment its ALL the other stuff that goes along with that equipment. Better zones to exp in, this really pisses me of by the way. Better exp and a chance at better drops in an exp just cause your in a raidin guild. Better access to spells. And not just better equipment but INCREDIBLY better equipment. And its not just about time you can spend all the time you want in this game if your not raidin at 65 your not going anywhere. You are in BoT or LDON, on my server that is it. <br />
<br />
Have to agree with litgruv on this one, this is why I will quit. Shammy problems suck, and really only compound this same problem for us. I play an average of 4 hours a night about 4 nights a week. I am not asking for free stuff we are all willing or should be willing to work for what we get but as it is there is just one path. And alot of us hate it. Fix all the other lame crap that is wrong with this game and it will keep me happy, right up until wow is realeased.<br />
<br />
I know wow might have its problems but I am sure gonna go try it out, as will lots of others. And another thing I guaranty that there are a lot more non raiders than raiders and If we all leave for greener pastures its gonna hurt the raiders as well. Oh well something that has just been buggin me as I see my progresion slamed to a hault.<br />
<br />
I realize that this is just me being mad, and to exp in better zones you do need better equipment but in the end the non raider is still gettin hosed.<br />
<br />
But in the end Eq has been really fun and is a good product, guess I am just at a sucky spot in the game for me : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But in the end the problem is at 65 after a certain point ya gotta raid.<br />
<br />
Not really.  Assuming we are talking about 50+ toon encounters for PoP progression.  I am yet to complete the PoJ trials on either of my two 60+ toons after 4 years of EQ.  Granted, the first couple years PoP didn't exist, but you get the idea.  Does that mean I am less of a Shaman or Ranger....doubtfully from the feedback I have received, but I certainly don't claim to be Ubah either.  So the big question, do I deserve to have the same spells?  I SAY YES<br />
<br />
I do want to progress through the game, but the EPs/Time/God/OoW may not be the path I take.  I would be just as happy farming AAs and going for items I can get.  Maybe even starting a 3rd main :P  But SOE has taken the options away for the mostpart.  It's pretty much all or none and the nones get hosed.<br />

<br />
Of course the hard core Time enable raider will have better gear then everyone else.  But if you are really serious about getting your spells and having adequate gear all it takes is some playing time and some research.<br />

PS by a decent Kit I mean in the 3500 to 4k unbuffed hp range.  If you think you need 6k hps to be decently geared I guess we just have different expectations.</div></div><hr />

He's right in a way though - you don't need all your spells to do the job, they're just nice to have. I bet there's only a handful of shamans across all servers who have all their spells. I don't have any Ancient spells, I levelled up without the extra Luclin and LDoN spells, there are some spells I never even mem, and others which are a nice upgrade but the lesser version would still work if I didn't have the better one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats so wrong about having certain things such as spells only avliable to high end people?  I mean, sure i'm in a raiding guild, who is at the Time level.  Sure i've sunk alot of time into the game, why not reward players who can achieve thease things with rewards beyond the armor/weapons/augs?  The truth of it is, once you hit a certain level of sumsuch aa's, level 65, certain level of gear, you hit a dead end without raiding.  One can only farm LDoN for a certain amount of time, or raise money to gear up from bazaar or farm spells for so long.  The simple and sad truth is the end game, once you hit 65 is designed to allow people to raid.  More accesible gear, better zones for levelling, more aa's are all designed to accomodate to the casual player so they have a much better chance of lasting in a raid enviroment.  THere was a time when 100 hp Breastplates were top notch, and only ze ubers had them.  Now, anyone can get them doing ldon's.  I do agree that it could have been phrased in a somewhat more.. diplomatic way, but Alan was never known for that.<br />
<br />
  Have an arguement, disagree with me, reply here.  I'd love to hear it, and debate it.  I can summerize my point though, if it's alright for high end players to get advanced gear/augs/whatnot, why is it not alright for them to recieve spells as well?  And anyone who thinks a Shamans role is just &quot;to die&quot; on a raid obviously needs a boot to the forehead.  I don't think i've died more than 5-6 times on raids in the last few weeks outside of total wipes.  THey are usually for really moronic reasons, like when I got a Vallon split rooted on me earlier today.  Want to see fun?  Try Time as it is now without allowing Vallon or Tallon to touch the walls.  THAT is fun.<br />
<br />

     I really don't get the deal with you retired guys.  You quit EQ, but still post on the &quot;EQ&quot; shaman boards.  That makes as much sense as dropping out of highschool and hanging out in the school parking lot.  As far as the &quot;almost 5k wizard&quot; - wouldn't that be the &quot;almost 5k Time-flagged wizard&quot;?  <br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Everquest is a heavy time-sink game, it is part of the rpg game genre that are known to be time-sink games.  There are two types of people in this world: Process people and Product people.  Process people enjoy the path to a solution and tend to move slower than others &quot;to enjoy the scenery&quot;.  Product people are the opposite in that they are only interested in the end result, and will move quickly to achieve that result.<br />
Amazingly enough, Everquest caters to both groups of people- group content for the Progress people and raid content for the Product people.<br />
I think you are a &quot;Product&quot; person and the route that EQ gave you was unachievable by time constraints, undesirable game mechanics, or general hate for other people...ummm.. pick one.  Hence, because of this you became discontent/angry/raving mad....ummm... pick one again.  The quickest way to become bored with EQ is to run out of things to do- ask the high-end folks.  High end guilds have a heavy turnover before and during new expansions, because they run out of things to do. My &quot;time-geared&quot; monk friend has quit after &quot;Kunark/Velious/Luclin/PoP/RZ/Elemental/Time and is thinking about quitting again before OoW comes out.  He runs out of things to do, and therefore becomes bored.  Had you joined a high-end guild to compete with the &quot;almost 5k wizard&quot; you would probably still be quitting due to &quot;My friends and I ran out of stuff to do at L65 and we decided not to throw more good money after bad once what content we could access was used up.&quot;  Basically, Everquest doesn't move fast enough to keep you occupied.  That being said....here is some food for thought.<br />
 <br />
     PoP was tailored to the 46+ crowd, and it accomplished two things: It got the high-end guilds out of Luclin to make room for guilds below them to progress, and it split up raid content in an effort to split up the bottleneck that Luclin raid farming zones (Ssra/VT) had created.  Instead of 50 players each having to individually camp mutiple mobs to have the ability to raid with their guilds- they chose to go with a flag system where raiding would key them for further raid content.  The only other option is to completely remove the flag/key system.  Sounds like a great idea right? not quite... and here is why:<br />
<br />
Problem:  Casual players complain about group trials to access PoV/PoS and key farming for CoD, BoT, HoH.<br />
<br />
Solution: by Devs is to unlock those said zones with specific levels (i.e. 55, 62)<br />
<br />
Solution results:  Casuals move first to the zone with the best drops, after they have collected up what they want- they move to the zone with the best xp. (i.e. BoT which for accessible zones offered the best drops/xp)<br />
<br />
New Problem: Casuals are now bottlenecked in BoT (Tactics if they did the PoS key quest)<br />
<br />
New Solution: Devs created LDoN with 4 zones of equal content, new drops, and point purchased items.<br />
<br />
Solution Results: Casual Players move to LDoN to collect up the drops, some pick up purchased items.  Casual players get bored with &quot;un-interesting dungeons&quot; (how is this less interesting than BoT?) <br />
<br />
Casuals Proposed Solution: Unlock Sol Ro, lower the cost of LDoN point purchased gear, have equal lines of gear in all camps.<br />
<br />
Pros/Cons<br />
<br />
Unlock Sol Ro- heres the problem with this idea<br />
<br />
    1. No-Drop gear off mini-named is sub-par to LDoN purchased items / Elemental Tradeskill items....gratz rot.<br />
    2. Ornate drop rate is sporadic, you may see three pieces drop in 1 hour or you may see 1 piece drop in 4 hours.  Guess what drops the most- the same pieces that are the cheapest in the bazaar (i.e. BoT commonly dropped ornate.)  <br />
    3.  No easily accessible zone-out.  I still see melees that port in and forgot to buy gate potions.  These guys already had a heads-up and forgot.  How many /ooc's you think there are going to be if Sol Ro is opened up to the masses?  How many people are going to train the zone-in of Sol Ro in attempts to find that zone-out?<br />
<br />
Lower the cost of LDoN purchased items- anyone heard of Black Mire?<br />
<br />
     1. Black Mire gear costs 760 points in Guk, and is &quot;slightly&quot; inferior to Incorporeal Chain which goes for 1492 points in EF.  Stat-wise it is still better than Ornate minus the focus effects.  Black Mire is also designed to wear &quot;upon purchase&quot;.  Yes, you can burn points to augment it, but for may- just the gear itself is an upgrade.  It takes 15 guk wins to unlock the Black Mire, but once its unlocked it just takes 15 &quot;normal&quot; wins anywhere to purchase another piece of Black Mire.  On my server the avg success rate of a normal LDoN win runs around 80-90% and the total time for setup-completion is about 1 hour- 1 1/4 hours.  For those that play less it will take a while, but you are &quot;guaranteed&quot; the item.  There is no named camping, no bad rolls, no kill-stealing- you have the item &quot;in the bag&quot;.  For many classes that cannot solo well, LDoN is a godsend- they get nice gear without having to farm plat.  <br />
<br />
Equal Lines of gear at each camp:<br />
<br />
     1. Great idea, it would kill the &quot; I will only group if we go to X adv camp&quot;.  Putting equal lines of gear will allow casuals to work on new gear &quot;right out of the gate.&quot;<br />
<br />
     This post was long and lengthy, but that point I am trying to get at is that the &quot;majority&quot; of the populous will go &quot;risk/reward in mind&quot; to where the gear drops and then to where the xp is the best.  It doesn't matter if the zone is called &quot;BoT&quot; or &quot;PoTime&quot;.  If you lock people out of certain zones they complain that are being targeted because of a specific play-style.  Make the zone open and they complain they are being bottlenecked.  Revamping old zones does not resolve this issue either unless they are better than what is currently available. (Ex: Droga/Nurga was revamped with Droga giving comparable xp to BoT along with &quot;in many cases&quot; better loot availability, but the zone is mostly empty due to being &quot;a non-PoK portal&quot; zone.  Ferubi gives xp comparable to Elementals with comparable gear, but its a &quot;non-PoK portal zone&quot;  so it is largely empty.  Do you think LDoN would have been accessible as it was without 3 of the 5 zones being accessible by the PoK books?  You can give a herd of cattle 200,000 acres of land to roam on, but in the end they will only hang around the 1-2 acres that has the waterhole.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">True predicus. All true. I dont know the answer. But here is where I am at again. Play 4 hours a night,4 days a week, on average just cant nail the hours down, I could NEVER commit to being in a raid. Lol I cant commit to being anywhere in real life. At times I am able to join a pick up raid, but these can be sketchy.<br />
<br />
Ldon was a godsend, I was compleetly floored that God didnt have a couple of camps that tied right into the existing camps.<br />
<br />
My problems with the current set up I guess that it is a bit to much like work, and I wanna play for fun. I think alot of the problems involved could be solved with the use of more instanced zones, and smaller raid sizes. Ack gettin 30 people togather to go do something in a game like this should be plenty.<br />
<br />
I dont know, its late I am tired and all I know is at the end of the day I feel like I am puttin in my time but I see guys that are playin the same amount of time as I am BUT can commit to a raid gettin farther and farther ahead of me. Again as the game stands I dont think there is an answer. Oh ya but one thing that does piss me off, all the raiders had a first time in new zones as well. Sayin Sol Ro shouldnt be opened up cause people would forget gate potions, or we are all gonna drown if we hit Plane of water. Dont tell me the raiders never had the same problem, we all learn. I just learn a little slower : ) . A</div></div><hr />

<br />
True about the spells. If you're only going to get as far as BoT anyway, what we can get easily is adaquate, Malo(s) being the only exception.<br />
<br />
The other side of that is, if what we can get playing casually is adaquate, we aren't going to buy the new expansions, unless they add something interesting to do. There is very little to tempt me in LDoN &amp; GoD. The gear &amp; spells I have now are more than enough to take me as far as I can go......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can see spells being difficult/expensive to get, but by the look, some/most of the GoD/WoW spells will be impossible to get if you aren't a raider. <br />
<br />
They will have to make some of the spells non no-drop. Adding spells for 65's is ok if some people don't have them all. However, if you up the level to 70, and people go from 65 to 70 and are still using 65 spells, that is retarded. The stuff you will be required to kill for xp at 68 will also required you to have more firepower in the way of spells.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone will say 'but you dont' have to level to 70'.... yeah, I guess you would have all the non-raiders quit the game too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It really depends on the nature of those spells. When competing for a group position, it will be much harder competing if a set ancient spell is gamechanging. Luckily as it was in Luclin the 2 spells weren't gamechanging asuch. The ancient cannabalize is an upgrade every shaman has been wanting, I think there should be perhaps 2 lines of this released, one cannabalize obviously the superior one and maintained ancient, and the other more available.<br />

In response to Predicus's post&quot; Ex: Droga/Nurga was revamped with Droga giving comparable xp to BoT &quot;, the exp isn't comparable and the mobs in droga have much more hp I believe. However, its true it being out of the way and its a real shame everyone goes pop.<br />
<br />
Also, the problem with pop to which the reason why Soe were forced to make access to the zones easier was that  it obsoleted so much old content and coupled with the high exp rate everyone moved to pop. But for the nonraider(or defined casual) it gave only a selection of bland and limited zones to exp in. They provided Ldon to fix this, as gaamechanging as it was, it did not provide any flavour. Every dungeon is essentially the same provided in an arcade fashion, not what the basis of what eq was to a lot of people. Ie, the immersiveness of the world, the fear of danger, the roleplaying aspect which has been progressively lost with continued expansions. Plus, ldon uses a very limited skill set, although this is hard to describe. <br />
<br />
So, my argument is in terms of real game group content it has been particuarly limited. Pop-bland, Ldon, cookiecut.<br />
<br />
(Also, just a sidenote, eq isn't just about gear and exp and sadly this has seems in a way what it has been reduced to, especially the arguments that come out of this. )<br />
(sidenote2, they really need to add the random factor back to eq)<br />
<br />
Unlocking solro, they should put a zone out in this place if they ever did unlock it and would most likely need a respawn increase. It would kinda make sense to open it in a way that the people who need ornate would have access to it, instead of those people that just need it in terms of wanting to sell it or give it to a twink.</div></div><hr />

     I really don't get the deal with you retired guys.  You quit EQ, but still post on the &quot;EQ&quot; shaman boards.  That makes as much sense as dropping out of highschool and hanging out in the school parking lot.  As far as the &quot;almost 5k wizard&quot; - wouldn't that be the &quot;almost 5k Time-flagged wizard&quot;?  <br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I can't speak for other retired players why they still hang around but for me it's pure entertainment as I enjoy spirited debate.  I spent 3 years playing this game and the issues raised here will be present in all future MMORPG's- what better place to discuss them than a board on the game that set the bar for others to follow (and hopefully improve)?  Your subsequent comments on hate/raving mad/whatever were hopefully not directed at me- I am passionate about my hobbies but hate/madness over EQ are a bit over the top.  This is just a video game after all.<br />

That's just a BS statement.  Every one of us paid the same amount of money, and pay the same amount every month (except Legends of course).  If you want to have zones and gear and spells that only the uberest of uber can get, then sell an expansion catered to the mega-raider or make them free zones you patch in.  If you go to a restaurant and you order steak and potatoes and a vegetable, how would you feel if the waiter said, &quot;well you can't have the steak unless you sit in our restaurant for 8 hours&quot;?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lets do a quick scenario here...shaman A is average bazaar/ghetto geared but is talented and knows how to avoid aggro un-necessarily, has a good selection of AA from hard work and hard grinding with his guild, friends and pick up groups. Hes level 65 but lacks Malo(s) (either or) and hasnt gotten group focus either, but no worries hes got single target...hes LFG in your local planes channel and your local LDON channel.<br />
Shaman B is in a smattering of ornate (all looted), some lower end raid gear from Luclin/Velious and has a few choice items from Tier3 raids. She has all her spells and a few AA, mostly up to Cann 5. Shes a hard core raider wannabe, and is essentially pampered by her guild, being lead around by the nose, gets summoned a lot and in general is average at best.<br />
IF any of us were on an alt, we would want shaman A in our group....all things equal we would pick someone with talent and character over gear any day...thing is all things arent equal.<br />
Before I got group Focus of the 7 or Ferine, there were more than a few asshats that tossed me out of their group, or, even more irritatingly made fun of me in French. I may be a country boy and I may not have gear that I looted from gods, but I am a good shaman and a fast learner. 2 years of High School french, a french speaking girlfriend and 3 years of EQ and I understand enough to know when someone is saying a smart ass comment about me.<br />
Here is the real marrow of the problem: people assume you have all your spells. They assume that your born into life with a full spellbook. We are all guilty of this at some point....ever group with a 60+ chanter that didnt have KEI? What did you think of them, either something that you said to yourself or to others?<br />
Spells do not make a class, but sadly they do make some classes jobs easier...Nihil would make my life tons easier. So far I am 0 into GoD, with no hope of ever making it into that content as its essentially a dead zone on Karana....its bring your own group (very few of my friends have it or will even consider it) or its hard core raid city.<br />
How many classes have &quot;essential&quot; spells that cost 35k+? how many average joe 65s can get their spells at that cost? Dont expouse the virtue of playing the market in bazaar to make cash or plat farming, the simple truth is that some people have very limited times to play and would prefer to not starer at scrolling text and chat people up all day to get something for 1k lower so they can sell it at a profit.<br />
Spells shouldnt be that hard to get. Gear being earned I can live with. Wizards/necros/etc should be able to research ALL their spells...its what finger wigglers in all the games I have ever played do, they research them in some musty library or some big tower where ubers hang out.<br />
Priest classes? Our gods should grant them to us when we level (other than you agnostic cats, you should have to pay plat heheh).<br />
Thats the perfect world, I know its a game and we play by SOEs rules, but geez why in the heck should I have to bust my chops EVERY STINKING TIME A NEW EXPANSION COME OUT to get more and more spells. It gets irritating and I think its rather sad that SOE can add yet another artifical cockblock and people defend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">EQ is a multiplayers/social game. Encounters/rewards are balanced Vs groups of players not singles and obviously you cannot expect to loot the same items from a solo kill or from a raid kill. <br />
It is true that you don't need all the high level spells. Group focus is a must only if you raid or your dots are important mainly if you solo.<br />
Also it's possible to get spectral parchments or runes for lvl 65 spells with just a group in plane of tactics (even solo in the pit if you have some skills and luck) or in BoT.<br />
Personally Ill like to see the basic new spells for every class available in vendors and some situational spells to be quested/looted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">everyone is NOT entitled to the same gear/spells.  you ARE entitled to the same opportunity to achieve/earn them.  If you do not want to do what it takes to get them, that is your option.  your 12 bucks does not mean you should be able to automatically get everything everyone else has.<br />
<br />
EQ is being geared more to the high end, because those are the ones that play the most and get bored the fastest.  those who play this game (or any other) for the scenery will make alts and level them up and enjoy the ride from a different perspective.<br />
<br />
all i see are people that are reaching the end of solo content and dont want to join a guild, but still think they should be entitled to all the benefits of being in a raiding guild.  you have two choices.<br />
<br />
one is break down and join a rading guild.  there are those that dont require 5 hours a night and 5 days a week (though some do).  I know one guild on karana that doesnt require that kind of attendance and they are knocking on times door.  they are allied with 3 or 4 other guilds.  <br />
<br />
second is quit the game.  you are obviously not having fun any more, so move on.  spend your 12 bucks on asherons call, CoH, or any of the other games that are out there or will be shortly.  <br />
<br />
here is a news flash though..... ALL of these games will either run into the same problems at the high end or they wont be around for the problem to arise.  there will always be those who get to the end game (whatever that may be) fast, and the longer the game is out the faster people get at making it to the end game.  which means the developers have to come up with more things for the end game people to do, since a good 90 percent (thats a wag number based on my observations, wag = wild a#@ guess) bascially skip the lower content all together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortuantly, this isn't really a very good example as it isn't what is going on.  I've been struggling for a bit to try and equate a good example, and I finally found one.  It's not matter of walking into a restaurant and having to wait 8 hours for a prime steak, it's walking into a hotel with a major meeting going on and being turned away at the door due to not knowing the party inside.  They may be having the best food, and the most expensive wine, but if you aren't invited, then you can't have any.  In retrospect of typing that, it dosen't seem like such a great example after all, but my basic point comes through.  It's a matter of the organization you belong to in game that allows you to aquire new items/spells.  Everyone has the same chance to join one of thease orginzations, presuming they can put in the time required.  If it's worth it or not is an entirely different matter however.<br />
<br />
  Side note, my guild has never enforced raiding, or ever laid any penalities on people who couldn't raid.  We've had people not log on for six months then reappear and get geared up, with no problem.  I'm one of them.</div></div><hr />

     On Brell, there are currently 4 Time Guilds, 5? Elemental Guilds, about 10-15 PoP Guilds, 3-4 VT/Ssra guilds, and you want to limit all of these players to one raid zone?  On top of that you want them to pay an additional $5 to be bottlenecked in one raid zone?  There is a strong indy raid culture on my server, and partaking in the culture can get you Elemental flagged.  Whether casual or hardcore, I would say the majority of the populous partakes in these pickup raids to get flagged for better xp/ better drops, and the amount of time spent doing this is equal to about the time taken to do 1-2 LDoNs.  We have another player on our server who runs open VT runs on the weekend, and only asks for &quot;good attendance rate&quot;.  We have another player on the server that runs open Tormax,Vindi,AoW raids.  I would say a large majority of my server does raid in one shape or form for whatever reason they see fit.  <br />
     When PoP came out, it was tailored to the 46+ crowd.  I could count the number of lvl 46 players in those zones on one hand even if I had all my fingers cut off- it was 0.  There, quite literally, was no gear at that point in the game that could have prepared a lvl 46 toon for the beating they were about to get in any of the Tier 1 zones.  Many players didn't even mess with the Planes until they were 60+, many chose to take the easier route and kill light blues in Velks until 62.  <br />
     GoD had a revamp, and many of the xp zones (not trials) were reset on dmg dealt and total mob hitpoints.  The changes are very noticable to include Natimbi / Qinimi being nice zones for &lt;65 and Barindu / Ferubi being nice zones for the 65 crowd.  The 8 mob types to chose one is purely a cosmetic complaint- its unimaginative, but in all honesty if the mob gives you xp it can be a giant rat for all I care.  Loot table distribution is still horrid, but I think the GoD raiders are hit harder by this than the casuals.  Killing a raid named to only see 1 piece of gear and 3 berserker tomes drop doesn't impress anyone.  All in all, GoD was a lousy expansion for everyone, partly in fact that it wasn't finished and still is broken in places.  GoD wasn't an attack on the casual player as all players got the &quot;WTH?&quot; reaction upon &quot;zoning in&quot;, so pointing a finger at the raiders blaming them is pointless- it was SOE's foul-up.  The last two expansions before GoD were catered to the casual players if you remember -LDoN and LoY.</div></div><hr />

    Going to use an example on this one- Cable Television companies.  Many people enjoy Cable television, but the majority watches 4-5 channels.  The Cable Companies would lose money if they were to charge for each individual channel, because lets be honest- 4/5 of the channels you get are fluff.  That being said, many people would only order 4-5 channels, but over time, would narrow their channel selection to 2-3 to &quot;save money&quot;.  Bringing this example back to EQ so it makes some sense....<br />
     The avg cost for a new EQ expansion seems to run around $15-25, but let's say they split it up to where the expansion costs $10-20, but the raid add-on costs $5.  Over time, the populous will see the avg cost as being $10-20 and having to pay $5 to get the raid content.  With charging a set price for everything you will have people wondering &quot;did I really need all of this?&quot;, but with splitting up the price you will have &quot;I have to pay $5 more to prolong the life of a game I play?&quot;  Internet service providers used to run off the &quot;pay for what you play&quot; system, but eventually moved to the monthly rate.  The &quot;pay for what you play&quot; worked for those that &quot;played&quot; very little, but was hindering to those that enjoyed the internet, but didn't want to have to watch the clock.  The point I am trying to make is that splitting up the cost of an expansion will go from &quot;I save $5 from not paying for content I will not use&quot; to &quot;I have to pay $5 more to enjoy the raid content.&quot;  In the end, it will be all about perspective with how it looks being more important than how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">That itemization and spell creation are so screwed up in EQ it is almost funny.<br />
<br />
There should be gear attainable by a single group of players that is the exact same as the best gear coming out of time. Maybe it doesnt have the same cool look. Or the neat name. Or the particle effects, but there should be a raid path and a Group path to all the content. <br />
<br />
Take Rallos Zek for example the raid path should be kicking his face in in front of all his minions and Boys and with all his gear on. Witht he chance for more of the loot drops per kill. due to all the additional challange and monsters dropped.<br />
<br />
But there should be an another path. One where he doesnt have all of his followers around. A quest path where one woman driven mad by the death of all her family in one of Zeks numerous wars wants reveng at all costs. and with your group of hardy adventurers Travels a lesser known route and peicemeil destroys certain underlings. and steals armour and weapons from Zek then one night ambushes him in his bath with no help or gear nearby. In that time he is weak enough to be felled by a single group Of folks who have taken the time and danger of the secondary path. Same outcome. The blade of the warlord is yours. But Since the group succeeded by stealh it is not flaming like the weapon would if it was in Zeks hands when he died.  You have this second path set up in multiple chuncks that would take say 10 adventures of hour to 2 hours each in instanced dungeons based around tactics layout. (Or 60 to 120 man hours to complete) Where raid of 60 folks would take 1-2 hours. (which comes out to 60 to 120 man hours to complete.)<br />
<br />
The gaps in power between the haves who raid and the havenots who don't is much too great now. Much like the people who used to own a manastone Vrs the ones who didnt back in the old world. It seriously needs to be adressed. And repaired.<br />
<br />
As for everyone not needing thier spells. Again. There should be the advantage of multiple paths for all of your spells. research. Quests. Drops. Hand ins. Blind stupid luck. Purchases for gear or money. <br />
<br />
Basicly there are many many walls to enjoyment in EQ. More than ever we need a way to build bridges over and around these walls. When someone sees a really cool weapon and asks Wow how did you get that! there should be many different awnsers.<br />

-Predicus<br />
<br />
To use your Cable analogy : <br />
The current state of EQ is all or nothing. You either have max satilite with 3 billion channels or nothing at all. No one is arguing to make all the features (channels) seperately purchasable. [ie. 2 bucks for increased bankspace, 5 bucks to add berserker playable class, etc] What we're suggesting is a purchasable EQ expansion at the normal price, and then a lesser cost casual gamer expansion that doesn't contain the end-game content.<br />
<br />
You don’t need all of your spells. Just like some weapons, armor, and other stuff, some of those spells just may be out of reach for some folks.<br />
-Alan<br />
<br />
This is a slap in the face! And all those who agree with this statement need to take a moment to truly realize the impact of what he's saying. Caster's spells are *cough* 'Balanced' against Melee's damage. A melee gives two S***s about 66-70 spells. The melee will get their damage table raised, their additional attack, and most likely their /disc books instantly upon gaining levels. Tanks will get their additional hit points, etc. What does the wizard get? A handful of hitpoints and the inability to reach any of the spells they paid good money to have access to. Effectively making a level 70 Wizard = 65 Wizard + 10 hps. <br />
<br />
The same is true for the shaman. We depend on our spells just as much as the wizard and other pure casters. Alan comparing Caster spells to Melee Equipment is shortsighted. <br />
<br />
And to those who say that not everyone needs all their spells, that's not what we're saying (/ack I'm saying). I have a few empty slots in my spellbook. What I'm saying is that the vast majority of the spells should be available without a /raid force. The ancient line is not in my grasp. I'm aware of that. But the upgrades to buffs, heals, canni, etc [our core 6 spells] should be 1 group attainable or quested. It is a total lack of imagination on Sony's part to just cram these spells on the biggest, baddest mobs available to keep them from the general EQ population. I beleive in No Drop, just not Never Drop.<br />

If it is something that is slightly better than what is available in the expansion to non-raiders, then fine.  If it is something that is substantially better, then I call BS.  We are all going to have to be fighting harder stuff as we progress towards level 70, so we need more tools to get there.  <br />
<br />
Gear has always been the real divider between raiders/non-raiders.  There may be a few spells that are almost impossible to get for non-raiders, but there have never been very many.  To start now would completely unbalance things, no only between classes, but within classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Good idea Snoww, I agree whole-hearted with the idea, unfortunately though- I play more often than most.   LDoN offered gear lines that were superior (stat-wise not focus-wise) that was near Elemental quality and drastically superior to Ornate.  It also takes a long period of time to achieve that gear and max aug it which is fine for me, but raised a lot of issues of time constraints to the casual player.  Going off some of the posts on these boards, the casual player wants near raid gear that is achievable in near the same amount of time played by the raiders.  They don't like the long time sinks because it conflicts with their play-time.  (This issue was brought up many times when LDoN equipment was discussed.)  I think one of the big problems we have is the &quot;Casual&quot; viewpoint of &quot;Hardcore&quot; players and the &quot;Hardcore&quot; viewpoint of &quot;Casuals&quot;.  Finding a common ground is difficult because it you tailor content to the Hardcore then the casuals get left behind, but if you tailor content to the Casual the Hardcore runs out of content.

And while the fights can be intresting in LDON the framework for the zones and the implimentation are poorly thought out. <br />
<br />
Take LDON technology and let someone creative with a flair for DMing (In the pen and paper sense) And you could have much more of an intresting time. <br />
<br />
String missions together. Rather than just random reasons for being there. As it stands now there is a Carny line feeling to the whole affair. &quot;Step right up and rescue the Maiden for a prize..!) Win 10 and you can get the larger cwpie doll. Start the winning now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Have the ability to instance based off of charecter flags. Or items that will triger the start of the mission. So when you kill something in tactics you find an item that when used tells you of a new threat to the world at large. Then have the mission play out while not knowing exactly what type of mission it is. And a longer time limit for start and completion, then once you have completed that mission allow for the next mission to be started the next day if need be. <br />
<br />
The time investment needs to be set up so that there are rewards at all the steps. Either money, XP, Gear, spells, Opened Skills or AA Or even really cool charecter moments. (Ability to change Spear of Fate into a 2 handed hammer and back again with the exact same stats.)<br />
<br />
<br />
City of heroes has something called story arcs. They are missions based around a common goal or idea. Today I had one where the clockworks have kidnapped someone. (Lou the mechanic) When I finally got to lou he was thankful for being rescued but he was working for the clockworks because his wife and children were being held as insurance for his good behavior. And now that this area was out of contact they were in horrible danger. <br />
<br />
Those are the ideas I would like to have seen with LDON. reasons to fight beyond the next shiny bauble. reasons to make the missions fun. Of course with EQ's technolgy I would have had Lou cobble together a suit he could wear  with the remains of the clockworks you defeated and make him a pet under the PC's command  in the instanced zone. So that he could take an active role and seem much more real. If he dies along the way. then the Wife and kids might hate you. (Negitive faction with a group) But if you get tehm all out unscathed Lou might make something nice for you depending on what you need. (Multiple rewards picked from a list.) Or put in a word with the treasure keepers controlling the LDON points and have a nice set of bonus points waiting for you.<br />
<br />
To make a good game you have to have options in charecter choices LDON is great technology with very poor and rushed useage. <br />

<br />
Sorry, if 1 group can attain something it currently takes a raid to do, that is &quot;easier&quot; in my book, no matter how you slice it. <br />
<br />
Also, who says you need 5 and 6 hour raids? What are YOU raiding? Lets see, the other night, we did 4 minis in Fire in about an hour. 8 molds/ep-level gear items. Only the very rare raid is more than a couple hours these days, and if you cant put a couple hours together, then STICK TO THE GEAR YOU GOT. <br />
<br />
Most of the whining I am refferring too is from other threads, its just continuing here. Same story. Make it ALL one groupable, there shouldnt be a difference in Raid attainable equip vs Non-raid attainable, blah blah blah. Gets old. <br />
<br />
There is a path. Follow it. Or DON'T! The gear is there. Go get it. OR DON'T.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I feel exactly the opposite.  Everquest is the only game I've ever played that a slow and steady 4 or 5 hour a week grinding and chipping can't get you everything the game has to offer.  Now given, I've never played UO, DAoC, or AO, but most other games are designed to be played casually or hardcore based on the gamers personal preference.  LDoN certainly changed that dynamic somewhat, but GoD shifted everything back to the old configuration. <br />
<br />
I really don't understand the resistance to something that would allow a more casual player to eventually have access to 3rd tier+ gear if they want to put in the effort.  What would be so wrong with somebody doing a 30 hour quest to get an elemental mold?  <br />
<br />
For the spell situation, why not come up with some sort of turn in system that would allow players to have access to spells in an alternate fashion.<br />
<br />
For instance, SOE could implent a turn in npc whom you could give various parchments to and get a spell from the next tier.  You give the NPC 4 ethereals and you get a spectral.  4 spectrals will give a rune.  So, in essence, 16 ethereals=1 rune.  Everyone could eventually get that, but it would take some time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its called content-hopping, and it is especially noticable with the casual community.  Like someone said earlier, new content is designed from the top down and there is a reason for that.  SOE is &quot;trying&quot; to design content that is challenging to ALL players who partake in the game- your pure casual to your die-hard raider.  This is obviously in their best interest because it nets them the most profit from the game.  What SOE still doesn't understand is that players (especially those that do not complete old content) will try to jump old content as a way to play catch up.  Its an assumption by SOE that everyone will progress in a linear fashion and &quot;wait their turn in line&quot;.   Unfortunately, that never works out right because everyone wants the newest and greatest or at least close to it.  Take Vex Thal/PoP for example.  Those guilds who progressed through Ssra/VT were able to make a smooth progression through PoP up to the Elementals and on through Time.  Some instances were tricky and difficult, but in most cases these guilds were successful.  What came later were guilds who decided they wanted to raid PoP, but didn't want to go through the trouble to farm VT.  These guilds hit a few &quot;brickwalls&quot;, and had to do a bit more of Lower PoP farming to achieve the same goals as those that went through VT.  The casual player doesn't follow the straight line in progression that developers think they will.  They may or may not grind to 65, they may or may not work on aa's, they may or may not raid, they may or may not play the game when something new comes out.  The casual player in general is very fickle, and probably gets a better view of the game because of this.  These are the guys that know that X mob in Y zone drops a nifty item because they got bored one day and went to check the zone out.  These are the guys that have been 58 for 6 months because &quot; I didn't feel like xp-ing today, so I made an alt.&quot;  These are the guys that are posting about odd quest items that they found off of X mob in Y zone.  Some casuals limit themselves to 1-3 zones, and I can see why they get bored.  I don't because I know that is the quickest way to burn myself out.  <br />
    What I do is I may xp in Sol Ro for a week, then I may do some LDoNs for a week, then I may tradeskill/work on quests for a week, and then I may work on my alts for a week.  It keeps me busy and I don't get burned out, and it creates an in-game break that makes each facet of the game fresh when I come back to it.  Two things I am currently working on now is scouring EQ with my monk buddy trying to see how many right-clickies we can collect up; I am also attempting to see how insanely I can twink out an alt without having to level him up to 65.  It works for me and keeps the game fresh.  <br />
     The replay value of EQ is incredibly high- for crying out loud we have people that have been playing for 5 years and are still playing!  Raiding is one aspect of the game, just like xp grinding, bazaar trading, and camp farming.  Each aspect of the game has their pros and cons, and none of them are entirely necessary to play the game.  If you chose not to partake in an aspect you need to except the good with the bad.  If you don't want to grind, don't complain about others passing you up in levels- so on and so forth.  BoT, LDoN, Sol Ro, Natimbi, Barindu, Ferubi, and the Sewer trials do not require Time gear, so if any of these zones are your normal hunting grounds- then don't worry about how many hitpoints the Time Geared guy has.  His normal hunting ground is PoTime- where those hitpoints and resists are needed.  <br />
   Most raids never hit the 5th-6th hour, raiders in general can't stay focused long enough.  The only time you really see that is with new content that hasn't been cracked yet.  Your avg high end raider is putting in about 16-20 hours per week.  Raids usually run for 3-4 hours, sometimes less depending on whats up.  Many raiders log in for the raid, and when the raid is over- they log out.  These same players have other things that go on in their life, just like casual players- they just happen to be able to find a block of time that they can play in.  They also typically don't waste time forming up either like you see with pick-up raids.  Raid force is told to be at Y location at X time- within 20-30 mins the raid is set up and final afk's are taken, and the raid is moving.  They hit what targets they have that are up, and start wrapping up the raid about 2 1/2-3 hours later.  People make assumptions that raiding takes 5-6 hour chunks of time and you have to be on 7 days a week, but that is simply not the case- no one wants to do that. There is simply not enough time in the day.  SOE knows people can't play in 6 hour stretches, so they don't tailor the raid content to take 6 hours to complete.  Being a high-end raider does not require 40-50 hours of dedication a week to the game, and I think a lot of people make that assumption.</div></div><hr />

Scale raids to size/levels and us casual players have a wider option to experience the same content as the hardcore folks.  Most casual players can handle a couple 3-4 hour raids per week.</div></div><hr />

Blazz, it's gotten to the point that I actually agree with you on this.  There is only ONE TRUE PATH to progression: raiding.  If you don't want to raid but still want to progress, EverQuest is not your game.  The sooner people accept that, the sooner people will be happy or at least, understand how the system works.<br />
<br />
There are current and future games that offer more than one way to play the game to max your character, but EverQuest is not one of them. SOE's design philosophy isn't just &quot;top down&quot; (to borrow Predicus' phrase), it's &quot;raid down&quot;- they design raid content that may or may not be applicable to non-raid players.  The best part is they advertise it as &quot;character levels 50+&quot; and technically they're right- if a L50 player grinds to 65, joins a raid guild and then gets flagged for all the zones in the expansion, yes, this expansion's content is for them.<br />
<br />
Makes eminently perfect sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The bottom line for me is that the feeling of making progress in EQ stopped once I made level 65 and acquired all my PoP level 65 spells.  It was really fun up to that point.  Now, without much time to commit for raiding, I have basically given up on advancing my character in any significant way.  It really takes away from the enjoyment this game had for me earlier on.<br />
<br />
I wish Sony would figure out a way to let my progression continue, playing casually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">There's no way to make single group content and raid content equally challenging.  It just isn't possible.  It will either be the single group way is easier in which case no one will bother with the raid because guilds will expect people to do it on their own time, or the single group mob would be so hard that no group needing gear/progression for that mob would be able to take him out.<br />
<br />
And if you think single groups should be able to get a blade of war but that's okay because it has a crappy graphic, well that's just silly.  <br />
<br />
The game is raiding.  That's all it is.  It's been that way for years.  Get used to it or find a new game.  City of Heroes is super casual friendly, I highly recommend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">There should be gear attainable by a single group of players that is the exact same as the best gear coming out of time. Maybe it doesnt have the same cool look. Or the neat name. Or the particle effects, but there should be a raid path and a Group path to all the content.  <br />
<br />
the logic of this is baffling.  if there were equal rewards for killing something with 6 people versus 60, then no one would EVER do it for raiding.  part of the difficulty of raiding is coordinating large groups of people because they are NECESSARY to kill things.  while this may not be great, ie cleric/ench/war demand for certain encounters (rathe, vallon zek, innoruuk, etc.), it is how the game is setup.  if you were to actually make darkblade of the warlord 1 groupable, every single 65 warrior in the game would have it by now and all the casuals would be just as bored as the rest. <br />
<br />
bottom line is, raiding is MORE difficult than 1 grouping things.  it requires good leadership, strong organization, good internet connections, and lots of playtime.  this is the natural way that seperates players.  just because i have time gear doesn't mean i won't group with friends that do not, or that are in smaller or not even in guilds.  if they were actually stupid enough to make all the best stuff 1 groupable we'd have diablo2 on our hands.  simply, raiding IS harder than grouping, and hence it reaps better rewards, and by thinking that you deserve 100% equal rewards just because your playstyle doesn't fit sony's notion of &quot;difficulty&quot; you are sorely mistaken.  lets face it, their notion of difficulty hasn't been all that creative, either.  <br />
<br />
while LDON was not an expansion i particularly liked, it did do some good things for once.  YES, there should be decent stuff obtainable with 1 grp (or less) with invested time, skill, questing, etc.  should it be equal to raiding gear?  NO, absolutely 100% not.  particle effects don't matter for crap, ask any monk or rogue using that purple looking GoD staff how much particle effects matter.  essentially they just need to find a balance of ldon type grpable stuff versus high end raiding stuff.  ldon was a good start, but with GoD gear it really has fallen behind again.  should EVERY shaman be entitled to his spells simply for buying the expansion?  no, absolutely not.  part of the draw of eq is that it pushes you to constantly be improving your character, with a goal of gear, aa, key quests, etc.  i will admit the ridiculousness of GoD being stated for the 50+ crowd.  due to the massive number of people quitting, and the early announcement of OoW, i would imagine sony saw how retarded it was to make an expansion like GoD.  <br />
<br />
The gaps in power between the haves who raid and the havenots who don't is much too great now. Much like the people who used to own a manastone Vrs the ones who didnt back in the old world. It seriously needs to be adressed. And repaired.<br />
<br />
i agree.  but 100% equality is perhaps the single most idiotic argument imaginable.  1 group content is easier than raiding.  it always has, and i don't see that changing any time soon.  to be able to gather 5 other people who can devote some time to working on stuff is infinately less difficult than it is to run, manage, maintain, and control a group of 75+ people who all have different playtimes, preferences, personalities, etc.  while i agree there needs to be more balance, ie quested or ldon type stuff with more appropriate rewards of the times, if you simply made all items in the game doable with a single group you have diablo2 which many have played and many got bored of within weeks.  <br />
<br />
as for spells, yea i agree there should be lots of ways to obtain your spells.  but certainly not all of them.  some things just need to be for the few so everyone else has something to drool over and work towards.  making crucial spells for the elite is probably a bad idea.  defining classes by their crucial spells and hence by their guild status is obviously not smart.  but, that being said, a shaman with time's antithesis slows a mob by 75% just as does any shaman without it.  in general EQ has been decent about spells (most ancients being not THAT crucial) and their availability.  you can bazaar equip any caster class with the vast majority of their spells, and just because your a wizard and do 6500 crits instead of 7500 crits from time geared/focus'd wizards or whatever with your spells doesn't make you worthless.  in fact i'd take a skilled player over a better equipped one (of all but the crucial tank/clr/ench, a whole nother issue there) in most situations.  i've done fire tables with time equipped people that are horrible and don't know how to quad and had much better grps with bazaar equipped people that know *** they're doing.  while equipment &gt; much, especially for the key classes, it still can't make up for skill in a lot of cases.  moreso than many people realize i think.  <br />
<br />
everyone is NOT entitled to the same gear/spells. you ARE entitled to the same opportunity to achieve/earn them. If you do not want to do what it takes to get them, that is your option. your 12 bucks does not mean you should be able to automatically get everything everyone else has.<br />
<br />
finally, some sense.  joril's post is quite correct.  and i agree with your two choices.  there is simply just no easy way to balance raiders vs. non raiders.  <br />
<br />
one is break down and join a rading guild. there are those that dont require 5 hours a night and 5 days a week (though some do). I know one guild on karana that doesnt require that kind of attendance and they are knocking on times door. they are allied with 3 or 4 other guilds.  <br />
<br />
something you may all want to look at.  some guildmates of mine started this group of casual raiders on our server.  they have a few set rules, but not many, and are not exclusive AT ALL in who they allow to raid, barring a few very rare cases.  they flag anyone regardless of guild affiliation, level, personality, etc. (assuming you don't cause a problem to the raid leaders).  so, for example, on my server, you do NOT have to &quot;be a raider&quot; to get elemental flagged.  or even be in a raiding guild.  just get your flags once, like everyone else had/has to do, and don't raid again, its like the other timesinks from expansions, you do it once, then never look back.  level 70 will certainly make the ease of elemental access more accessible as well.  and there's a whole lot of nice 1 groupable things in the elemental planes, and tradeskill drops, and etc.etc.  <br />
<br />
here's the url to this grps boards if anyone is curious:<br />

<br />
i agree.  i'm not sure how hard it would be to impliment, but being able to scale the difficulty of the raid due to the size might solve some issues with clr/ench/war #'s, etc.  <br />
<br />
all and all, i'm not offended or shocked like i'm amazed some of you are about this.  i recently switched mains from shaman to my shadowknight, and i'm not up in arms about him never recieving his ancient spell from ToV or VT (if there were one).  he doesn't have all his spells, including the qvic ancient bite of chaos (quite a nice spell), nor should he, but i'm not FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I WONT EVER GET IT.  i'm not useless because wizards have more hitpoints than me as a tank.  the game is still about fun.  if you're not having fun because you won't get EVERY ITEM AND SPELL OMGOMG then perhaps you need to think about what is fun for you about the game.  for me, doing avatar of war with 10, or soloing zlandicar, or doing the skyiron cudgel of the ancients/greenmist quests were fun.  much about EQ is the work you put into it and the rewards you earn yourself.  for me, that is the fun, and recieving the items/spells/gear/keys is all just part of the process.  sure they need to better balance the ldon type stuff with the increases in GoD gear, so perhaps rather than constantly complaining about how raiders are handed free loot and make you feel inadequate because they play 50 hours a week and you play 40 and tradeskill, key farm, adventure, etc., you should instead focus on trying to encourage the devs to have more ldon/god trials type content for a single group with decent rewards/exp for the time invested.  that being said, it is my opinion, though, that these rewards should never be completely equal to raid gear, otherwise there would be little point in raiding and the game wouldn't hold anyone's attention.  <br />

You know that cheal works on hitpoints, not AC, right?  You know that wizards do orders of magnitude more damage than tanks do, right?  If you don't see an issue with having less hps as a tank than a robe class and do far less damage then I have to guess that you have /defensive and don't notice the difference.  The Holy Trinity is &quot;in&quot; once again, 'tis true.<br />
<br />
I let the rest of your comments slide as I've addressed them in other thread ad nauseum, but when you have less hps as a tank than a wizard, good luck getting a group.  You know it's a &quot;fantasy&quot; game when a caster out-tanks a tank.  This is not helping your case.</div></div><hr />

We all know the way EQ is layed out. There is one wayt o do things. But if you cannot see that the my way or the highway idea is just limited thinking then my ideas will never be more than smoke to you. <br />
<br />
Blazz I don't want it easier. What I do want is the ability to reach the content I paid for in a reasonable manner that is attainable by people who are like minded to myself. The people who dislike large scale raids. <br />
<br />
Please note the part where I said the time to complete should be the same. In man hours. Or the part where the raiders really only do an encounter at 1-2 hours per run. Just with many many more people. <br />
<br />
EQ is not a new spring chicken and the way I have described things will more than likly never happen. So the raiding game is secure for you and the other like minded folks to enjoy. But the descussion doesnt have to stop. I have enjoyed EQ for many many years. And have argued with the developers and trolls alike. And sadly for me I seem to have watched EQ grow from something I loved to something I barely recognize now.  But I still like to talk about what might have been. or What might be in a new game that comes down the pike. I would hope that we could at least come to the agreement that more options for enjoyment by all players would be a good thing. Rather than a my way or the highway approach.<br />
<br />
The only thing my idea would change is that if you did not want to raid you would not be required too. Would that really be so bad? To not be forced to surround yourself with people that are only there for what they can get from your work. If you choose to raid you could and would be rewarded with short intense highly draining fights that would have armies clashing, but if you choose to attack under the guise of a small force the path could be won through with guile, trickery, or the brave acts of a chosen few. <br />
<br />
There is room for both types of playstyle in the game we play, but right now only one is utilized, and the small group people either conform or leave, and when they leave the whole World of EQ is lessened because more fine people are gone. Never to be met again. <br />
<br />
Think about it Blazz. Wouldnt you like to hear how the other side got thier darkblade of war, how they overcame the challanges set before them and won something special. But in a different manner than your larger group of friends. <br />
<br />
I wish I could hear the other stories, but as it is there is only one path. And it is a path I have chosen to not take because it limits me too much. <br />

RZtW took my guild 8 or 9 attempts before we got it.

Are you going to add that time in too?<br />
<br />
You simply cannot make single group encounters that will require the same amount of time/effort as a raid.  They'd also have to limit it somehow to keep people from farming it to death, there simply isn't enough content for everyone to have the best gear unless they decide to instance absolutely everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Diablo 2 was a financial disaster and widely acclaimed as a horrible failure, agreed. To follow that model for success is foolhardy at best and catastrophic to the bottom line at worst.<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
roflrofl, diablo2 as a model for success?  eq has lasted 5 years on the raiding focused system that it has now, and you imply that following diablo2's example for eq would be better?  not sure about you, but diablo2 lasted about 6 months and didn't make crap vs. the money that eq is/has been making.  obviously everquest and its expansions is a superior game in a whole number of different ways.<br />
<br />
I let the rest of your comments slide as I've addressed them in other thread ad nauseum, but when you have less hps as a tank than a wizard, good luck getting a group. You know it's a &quot;fantasy&quot; game when a caster out-tanks a tank. This is not helping your case.<br />
<br />
pure ignorance.  just because a caster has more hitpoints than i do doesn't mean they out tank me in being able to hold aggro, pull, feed hp/mana to my group, atk tap, etc.etc.  i realize sk is not the most raid useful of classes, but i've been an sk main for all of a week of course i'm not going to have more hitpoints than a fully time/god geared wizard.  i'd like to see a wizard pull/tank the way i can on any sk, even a bazaar geared one.  never did i say the gear balance was perfect or that it didn't need work.  good luck getting a group?  i'm fine there, as i can pull for any group just fine, i can tank just fine, i can hold aggro just fine as well.  whats astounding is that this wasn't even the point of the post, you just took it upon yourself to imply that any wizard having more hp than any sk at 65 is a grave injustice.  the  point is, as blazz said, the path is/has been laid out for the last 4+ years.  it is impossible to make single group or quest content equivilent in difficulty to raid content.  try to get the devs to make better groupable gear to bridge the gap between raiders and not raiders, or play something else, as eq is not a game that discourages raiding.  <br />
<br />
and pls, of course the holy trinity reigns supreme.  this is an entirely different issue than the one we were discussing.  i intentionally avoided it as much as i could as its a completely different topic.  you're only useless if you think/say you are.  just because you and others that think like you are bitter about the game being designed around raiding doesn't mean that you have to constantly whine for them to alter it so drastically into becoming a game like diablo2, that literally lasted for 6 months tops before everyone got bored and quit.  <br />
<br />
do i have a problem with a largely bazaar twinked shadowknight at 65 with fair aa's having less hps than a wizard?  you bet i don't when the wizard is in full time gear.  the wizard has earned hp/resists/mana appropriate for the content that he plays in, while the sk has as well.  by your logic any tank class should have more hp with random bazaar trash than the best possible equipped casters?  good luck trying to impliment that, as naked level 65 sk/pal/warriors clearly don't deserve more hp than high end players.  if that were the case why play a caster, would survive longer as a naked tank class hurray!  <br />
<br />
the other important thing to realize is the rarity of these occurances.  the % of casters that have more hp than the average tanks is VERY VERY small.  my sk is really poorly equipped, and there are VERY few casters that have more hp than i do.  to blow it so far out of proportion like this and present any elemental pure caster as &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the average tank is ignorant, inaccurate, and flat out wrong.  class balance is, and always has been, continuously messed up, and i agree that there needs to be a boost to ldon type attainable gear, but the game isn't wrong for having casters so well geared that they have more hp than casual tanks.  gear is a reflection of the content u raid and the zone access you have, so for people at the very high end of course they're going to be decked out.  they always have been in the past, i don't know why all of a sudden its become such a bleeding heart issue, really making me sick.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I think you're looking very hard for things to be sick about?  You certainly sound more than a little hysterical to me.  Take a chill pill, son.  If you always overreact when people disagree with you, you're going to have a very hard life.<br />
<br />
To Drinnar:<br />
<br />
&quot;You simply cannot make single group encounters that will require the same amount of time/effort as a raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tremendously untrue.  Many people can get into top raiding guilds within weeks because they know someone who makes it a smooth slide for them all the way up.  I've known too many dozens to count.<br />
<br />
The guy the raid is hard for is the first guy doing it and his buncha people figuring things out.  How many of us are that first guy?  Virtually none.  In the entire history of the game, very few of us have ever been the first guy to figure anything out -- there are too many things to figure, and most of them have been gotten to first, by somebody else.<br />
<br />
Raiding can be extremely easy; so much so that people AFK while raiding is very common even in the top guilds.  Being able to follow for the most part often means little more than not being too lousy at your job.  That...is not exactly a challenge.  At least for a good proportion of us.<br />
<br />
Compare that to grouping or doing a small raid.  If you screw up, it counts, because there aren't endless replacements for you waiting.  When I raid, if one of our six shamans doesn't get slow in, the other will.  If your slow doesn't land in a group, you can be screwed.  Same with getting aggro, healing, crowd control -- everything.<br />
<br />
Raids can be and often are chock full of screw ups and dolts who barely know their jobs.  It doesn't take much skill to hit 65 these days, or even get most flags.  Being a raider is next to no indication of your skill these days or of the work you have put into your character or intend to.<br />
<br />
Please, this idea that raiders do so much work -- it's way too sloppy and categorical to say very freely at all.  Most raiders are followers and it's quite easy for most classes to get quite a fair amount of slacking in on raids.  <br />
<br />
Does raiding sort out the spazzes and the jerks any better than grouping does, just by its nature?  Not necessarily.  If you screw up your job in a group or are definitely sub-par, you're outta there.  You can do that for years as a raider.<br />
<br />
Now, so much for the amount of work and skill a raider does and has, one half of the holy equation that more work and skill should equal the other half -- that is, exponentially better gear and access to 90% of an expansion's fighting areas instead of 5%, with another 5% left over for banks and friendly bazaars and such.<br />
<br />
Everybody I know who has joined a time guild has gotten tons of gear extremely quickly.  It's like they busted a piggy bank and the goodies just came rolling out.  Within weeks, or less, people who had been fairly new to the game and crying about their lack of elemental gear suddenly were completely stuffed with easily gotten time gear.<br />
<br />
The amount of hours put in, the ingenuity showed, the skill level required to get that gear are a fraction of what other people in the game must do to get gear nowhere near that level, if they simply don't have the flags and guild alliances.  Skill level?  Please.  I know these guys I'm talking about, raid with them myself regularly, group with them, and few of them were exceptional in any way; they just had a good thing going for them when they got hooked up.  And god or whatever bless 'em for that -- somebody has to have a good thing going somewhere.  But to use their combination of good fortune and their ability to spend long contiguous blocks of time on a very regular basis to then posit them as somehow virtuous or hard working or very much more accomplished than others and exceptionally deserving of dramatically outsized rewards merely because someone got them some quick flags as soon as they joined up is just not indicative of a terribly balanced game, or viewpoint on the game.<br />
<br />
Much like the level 46 shaman in Plane of Earth, the guy who has been playing the game for three or four or five months and is in the Plane of Time is not the game's hero and a living showpiece of the game's good design, but shows up the poor design of the game and how much it can be tweaked with to essentially bypass any semblance of balance.<br />
<br />
Not that even the most boneheaded raider will usually admit how easy he has had it -- that would be like finding a wealthy 18 year old frat kid who has never had a job who doesn't insist he's a self-made man and a genius for keeping a B average.<br />
<br />
Please, let's all of us heroes out here have a little humility.  Very few of us are the daring adventurers we would like to claim to be when comparing ourselves to the casual players.  I'd bet solid money that most casual players have explored a lot more of the EQ world than most raiders, at least those of the last couple of years.  Adventurers? Hard-working?  Daring?<br />
<br />
Most raiders I know these days zipped through their levels as quickly as possible with mudflation gear earned or given to them very early on, zipped into a raid guild as soon as possible with very underdeveloped skills, and spend their time there following somebody else's directions to do things that have been laid out for them and already accomplished dozens of times by their guilds and thousands of times across the servers by the time they ever get to the battles themselves.  Then they spend their time split between raiding, LDON, and the plane of earth on the easiest mobs they can find, and maybe at the Plane of Fire tables if they are casters.<br />
<br />
That's IT.  Adventuring?  Exploring? Blazing new trails?  Refining high level skills? Puh-lease.<br />
<br />
The myth of raiders being supermen and somehow better, smarter, braver, more knowledgeable or whatever than the average player is one of the more ridiculous ones EQ players have ever been silly enough to grant their overbloated egos.  Like a tall tale, it gets more absurd with every retelling.<br />
<br />
Which is all fine, as long as you really remember it's all just a story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I am going to try and not get involved in this debate but I would like to add one point.<br />
<br />
When discussing how someone joins a raiding guild that is farming time and gets a lot of loot near instantly you are neglecting the countless hours the rest of the guild has put in to reach that point. Sure, the freshly-joined player may just be along for the ride but someone did put in the effort.<br />
<br />
I remember the endless flagging for Vex Thal, I remember beating my head against Rallos Zek, I remember raiding Plane of Air for ages thanks to bugs, I remember dozens of tries for the Rathe, I remember the ever joyful Tipt/Vexd flagging runs.<br />
<br />
Sure, we have a lot of members who did not do all of the above, but we also have a lot who did and quit. Disregarding the enormous effort that went into reaching the zones the raiding guilds play in cheapens your argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Raiding should no doubt give special items, however, it does not have to necessarily follow that the items dropped have to be &quot;better&quot; than items gained from grouping. It is the enforced mentality of pop that justifies for some that raid items should in cases be better than that earned by a group, in light of the necessary work and time needed to gain those items. However, that is one of the flaws of pop. Backflagging does not need to be a necessary part of raiding. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the argument should be altered slightly, in that people should not have to join a guild of 70 to get the best items. Imagine an instanced raid area, that alike Ldon where it uses the peoples levels to create an appropiate dungeon, a raid area that automates according to how many people you use.  The content would be harder but would drop more of x item. So a 70 man raid, mob y would drop many x items, compared to a 20 man raid where mob y would drop less items. I guess this example, could be extended to cater for a group of 6, however, the chance of the x item dropping is considerably reduced.<br />
<br />
Thats just my view and ideas though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The avg cost for a new EQ expansion seems to run around $15-25, but let's say they split it up to where the expansion costs $10-20, but the raid add-on costs $5.  <br />
<br />
What store are you going to? A new expansion costs typically $39.95 USD for download or in store. Then about the time the next expansion is announced the price will drop to the range you are talking about, but this is several months after the expansion has been out. <br />
<br />
while LDON was not an expansion i particularly liked, it did do some good things for once. YES, there should be decent stuff obtainable with 1 grp (or less) with invested time, skill, questing, etc. should it be equal to raiding gear? NO, absolutely 100% not. particle effects don't matter for crap, ask any monk or rogue using that purple looking GoD staff how much particle effects matter. essentially they just need to find a balance of ldon type grpable stuff versus high end raiding stuff. ldon was a good start, but with GoD gear it really has fallen behind again. should EVERY shaman be entitled to his spells simply for buying the expansion? no, absolutely not. part of the draw of eq is that it pushes you to constantly be improving your character, with a goal of gear, aa, key quests, etc. i will admit the ridiculousness of GoD being stated for the 50+ crowd. due to the massive number of people quitting, and the early announcement of OoW, i would imagine sony saw how retarded it was to make an expansion like GoD.  <br />
<br />
Ldon was a great way to allow casual players to get gear on par with higher end raid content. Not the highest end raid gear, but high enough to be significant upgrades that help people move towards that highest end gear. <br />
<br />
The Ancient spells were introduced in Luclin, and they were expressly stated as not being for everyone. Excluding the ancient spells, all spells should be available to all classes that can use them. Not easily available by any means, but what good is any reward if it cannot be obtained? It should not matter if some one aquires the spells through raiding or through the bazaar. Both should be viable routes to optain 99% of a classes spell lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I have led raids. I have won. I have also led raids and lost. Same thing with more groups than you can count.<br />
<br />
What makes raiding hard. Is the herding cats syndrome. It is the politics and manipulations and expectation management, and most of all motivation skills of the leaders. <br />
<br />
I was pretty good at it. And hated it every second of the way. So I got out. What makes raiding hard is the choreography required and the dumb****s that don't listen and screw things up. <br />
<br />
But with a few capable leaders and plunty of wheat for the chaff you get things done. <br />
<br />
Many many raiders are quite good at thier game. But also many many raiders are simply shaman # 12. Or the wheat. Warm bodies thrown at the grinder.<br />
<br />
I am not saying the smaller group game is better. It is just different It is more focused, With less chance for individual screw ups. With larger chance to make a differance in individual fights. But the way it stands is the raiders with all the things it entails get all the rewards. And for the single grouper the endgame is sooner than with the raiding dynamic. <br />
<br />
And say it with me folks. &quot;That ain't right!&quot; (Grins)<br />
<br />
And for the people that will question my bonafides considering I have been talking up smaller group encounters for 3 years now. I have led raids into hate and fear when kunark was new. And Dragon Necropolis when velious was new. Old content sure. But when the game came out it was bleeding edge. I just didnt like the raiding game. I wanted to play with my firends. Not make personel descisons.<br />

diablo2, what a great game.  how many of you are still paying it?  how many thousands world wide log in daily to play it?  yeah thats a great model to base a online game off of.<br />
<br />
there is no way to make solo or group content equal to raid content and not have it abused.  nor should a single person or even 6, be able to get what 30 to 70 are able to work together to get.  all the AFK people aside and those morons that dont know what they are doing, but can press the attack button when told to.  there are 15 to 20 that are making the whole thing happen.  the raid leaders, the pullers, the clerics (playing a good cleric isnt as easy as most people like to think, but yes its boring), the main tanks.  those people are what make the raids suceed or fail.  oh and yes just like in single groups, one person doing something wrong or not paying attention can cause an entire raid to wipe and fail.<br />
<br />
not to beat a dead horse, but if you are not having fun or you think you should be able to get all the game has to offer with out doing what it takes to earn it, then go play diablo2 again or CoH or any other game that in 6 months you will be bored with...............</div></div><hr />

First, before you get all pissy, look at my magelo.<br />
<br />
Second, I already said this isn't going to happen in EQ.  I don't expect people who don't have the mental capacity to think outside of the current RPG paradigm to be able to imagine a world where raiding isn't considered &quot;work&quot; or somehow a more noble way to play the game.<br />
<br />
Let's drop the words &quot;raid content&quot; and &quot;group content&quot;.  I realize this isn't going to change your mind because you think raiding should be the end-all, be-all of every RPG everywhere, but I'm going to go through it anyway.<br />
<br />
The size of the force that is required to bring a target down should determine the types of challenges that the force will have to overcome (i.e. variety of different spells that go off to reflect the probable wider variety of classes present to combat that, number of additional critters to face, etc) and the volume of loot.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to make one piece of content that simply requires larger numbers drop higher quality gear, or spells.  This isn't coming from some newb who feels entitled to every piece of gear etc.  Future games must design with that in mind.  Character progression should not depend on who you play the game with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">my post was not written directly at you ice cream.  looks like its you who has gotten pissy.  why should i look at a magelo?  magelos can be faked, not saying yours was, just saying they can be and yours could be.  also you could be an ebay or newbe that got PL and got all the scraps from a guild that has been in time for months.  lots of reasons for magelos to look nice.  they mean nothing.<br />
<br />
type your points out and let them stand or fall by themselves.  we arent talking about any other RPG out there.  we are talking about EQ and how the casual gamer thinks they deserve everything in the game.  start a new thread if you want to talk about how games of the future can be dynamically scaling and character progression is limitless and everyone has everything they want, the way they want to get it.<br />
<br />
thats not EQ.  thats the not game that people have been paying to play for 5 years.  the game that has manage to stay the top game in the field regardless of newer games coming out promising alot of what you want... they either failed or have a MUCH smaller paying customer base.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Blazz, it's gotten to the point that I actually agree with you on this.  There is only ONE TRUE PATH to progression: raiding.  If you don't want to raid but still want to progress, EverQuest is not your game.  The sooner people accept that, the sooner people will be happy or at least, understand how the system works.<br />
<br />
Define progression Iz? Please. What you refer to as a lack of progression, I call just being stubborn and unwilling to adjust or accept the games design. <br />
<br />
I told you Gates had stuff for you. You cut off your nose, to spite your face, remember? Except you still asked for &quot;more&quot;. Its in Gates man. Big items dropping of mobs easily killable by 1-group bazaar geared people. But wait, forgot, you want Time stuff off Fire Beetles. Your playing the right game Iz. Have fun for your 10 minutes of it, it NEVER gets boring killing Mephisto over and over and over. Oh, when you have played Diablo 2 anywhere NEARLY as long as you did EQ, let me know. <br />
<br />
 I realize this isn't going to change your mind because you think raiding should be the end-all, be-all of every RPG everywhere, but I'm going to go through it anyway.<br />
<br />
This is where you are wrong. No one said every single game should be exactly like EQ and require large raids and big time-sinks (VT key, backflagging, etc) to get the top loot. The point people are TRYING to make is thats the way it is in THIS game. No one could get Runed Bolster Belts or Cloak of Flames with single groups back when it started, and you cant get to VT or Time or Uqua with a single group now. <br />
<br />
Thats the way THIS game is. THIS game isnt Diablo 2. THIS game isnt CoH. This game is EQ, and raiding is HOW you get the very very best.<br />
<br />
Do it. Or don't. <br />
<br />
But PLEASE stop trying to &quot;fix&quot; the game I play, cause that part of it isnt broken.<br />
<br />
I have stated before that I think they should open up the EPs with back-door quests similar to the Tactics ones. That would open up a nice new level of gear for more casual players. Lots of one-groupable mobs dropping very very nice stuff in there. <br />
<br />
But its not the best stuff. So naturally, 2 years later, it wouldnt be NEARLY enough. Because you folks seem to want to log in, kill Fire_Beetle_896, loot Uber BP of Ultimate Uberness, and log out, in your &quot;hour a night&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cripes people. You just cannot accept certain things, can you. And a BIG problem is if your given that inch, it certainly won't be the mile you asked for, so you will bitch. Yeah, theres a lot of things that could help the casual players advance. Opening the EPs and Sol Ro (but NEVER Time) to 1-group quests would be a start. I am willing to BET it will happen shortly after the release of OoW. Content is 2 years old, its time to open it. But never Time. Sorry, you want that level of gear, <br />
<br />

for you non raiding ppl, simply think of PoP flags as keying.  if you don't like to raid, fine, raid to get your zone access and then stop.  everyone did vp/vt keys.  no one liked doing them (in general), and the people that hated questing did them as fast as possible and never did them again.  they realized that keying(flagging) was a necessity in the game to seperate those who have put the time in and those that haven't.  its the exact same with PoP.  plenty of pickup raids that can get u flagged to plenty of decent zones, like i already said on my server there is a completely open pickup group that is all the way to elementals, and this will only get more powerful after OoW's release.  you don't see me here bitching constantly about how i hate doing the first 1-6 GoD trials because they are single group content.  i prefer raid content, but i'm about to start bitching about them.  i put the time in, got them done, and moved on.  eq is about the challenge (or in key cases very often, time) that you put into it, and the rewards you gain afterwards.  like said before if you want to be handed everything go play diablo2, and burn out 10x faster than you ever would in eq.  <br />
<br />
I understand the rationale you guys may have behind saying that non-raiders shouldn't get the same level of gear and spells, etc., that raiders get. It's just wrong though.<br />
<br />
Putting all the histrionics aside, this is a game. People play for the same reasons -- to have a kickass character. I don't think they should be punished because they haven't played the game a certain way.<br />
<br />
the simple reason that i say raid gear should always be &gt; non raid gear in some form is the simple logistics of it.  for the current setup of everquest at the moment, to do this would make raiding pointless and turn the game into a diablo2 like environment.  <br />
<br />
also i think its important to emphasize just how rare these occurances are.  the average raider is/does put a lot more time into playing than the average casual, especially in large bursts or on a nightly basis.  go ahead and flame but IN GENERAL this is the case, i don't care about any random examples as there obviously are plenty of them.  this game is more about time than anything else, zone access is 1 thing, but the longer you play the better you're going to get.  raid guild players, running out of things to do solo/grp, join guilds to raid, and in general have higher playtime than the average eq people.  these people burn out faster than most, so the high end game is designed to try to keep them interested and give them something to do (OoW).  <br />
<br />
i have no problems with people that play the game casually.  as a college student i am able to give lots of spare time (more than i should heh) to this game.  what i do have a problem with is this mentality of entitlement that people have gotten.  just because i pay the cover at a bar doesn't mean that i'm entitled to any/all free drinks that i want.  just because you buy an expansion doesn't mean you're instantly given some right to explore all of its content on your own terms.  if that were the case go play D and D where YOU control the content.  and lets be realistic as well, here, most people that play a lot, even in non raiding type guilds, do get to experience/have gotten to experience most of the previous content due to guilds progressing, moving on, etc.  to whine about PoP as blocking people is really quite pointless as level 70 is going to completely trivialize every encounter from hedge to quarm, just like PoP trivialized all luclin content.  if you want to see all the content now, follow the path and raid.  if you don't, be patient and wait till the content becomes trivial enough to do with just a grp or a small affiliation of people (can't be a raid omg).  i'm all for them making ldon type attainable gear better, but complete equality, while a decent notion in itself, is not viable at all for the game.  it would unbalance everything, and its pretty hard to argue with the unparalelled success the game has had over the last 5+ years.  <br />

<br />
Did the Tactics Quest key invalidate your killing of the manatek bhemoth?<br />
<br />
Did it take away from the power that you and yours weild against the mighty Diaku of Tactics?<br />
<br />
I just don't understand why you have to invalidate and ridicule people who want to enjoy the game in thier own way. Especially when the two mindsets would rarely ever meet anyways. I mean my group of 6 wouldnt be kicking down the door to where you are fighting anyways. <br />
<br />
I don't bash on folks for enjoying the raid game. And I certainly don't want better gear than raiders get. What I want is to have the concrete power curve between raiders and non raiders leveled. Sot hat there are nto 2 seperate games needed to be developed where one group is utterly left behind. It now stands like the mockery of several old pen and paper games I used to play.  Raiders are playing for a Monty Haul GM. <br />
<br />
There should be mutiple paths to all of the content. Get more people and enjoy that style of play. Take less people and enjoy that style of play. The game playing itself should be the most of the reward not the style in which it was achieved. <br />

Or let me guess. When you played baskettball with your boys, did you always have to get the gold star and the huge trophey with the cookies at the end of the day and your mommy fawning all over you squealing how great you were. All for doing the exact same thing as everyone else. <br />

Sheex,<br />
<br />
What does the VT key require to get.. <br />
<br />
Killing Emperor. And how many level 65's do you need to drop him.? Bazarr geared. Of course. And how often is he up. And look at the requirements to just get to the emperor. Manpower wise. <br />
<br />
All I am trying to get accomplished is to show that if there were multiple paths to a given goal. &quot;The content and Fun&quot; then raiders whould be freed up for more targets. And casuals would as well. All raid  progression only does is drive good people away from the game, there needs to be a path to all the content that is doable for the big and the little guy. And if you don't have the manpower to attack from the front allow people to fight with stealth and suprise and strategy and tactics. <br />
<br />
The game is so out of balance with the gear seperation that there is only one path now. Raiding.  And if you were to design content for the game as it stands now.. what would you do? I want EQ to be heathy and fun. For all the folks that love it. I want raiding encounters. And single group encounters as well. But the artificial rewards for only one style of play is wrong. And it needs to be addressed. Because there is not just one style of play. And we are all paying to play in this sandbox. And if one side leaves how long do you really think the sandbox will remain open for play.  <br />
<br />
The game as it stands is broken on many many levels. While fun to play in especially if you don't open your eyes too wide, I for one would rather remember EQ as a great game that I played and enjoyed for years and years. Rather than how I remember it at this moment a mismanaged patched together zombie that is a pale reflection of its past glorys that only cares about half its playerbase.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Raiders say that casuals should be happy because now with the added levels and power that the casuals have now we can do 2-3 year old content. <br />
<br />
There is a problem with that argument they took our money already. And guess what. If all the casuals would realize that content being sold to them now is only acessable 3 years from now they would stop buying said content. And when an easy 60% of the game stops buying new expansions the game will flat out roll over and die. <br />
<br />
And yes I know that casuals got LDON. and Yekesha, And even a few zones in PoP and the 50+ can sure enjoy tons of GoD. But I ask you this how many zones are in all of those expansions. How many items. How many tradeskills. Give a best guess then look at how much of all that content is useable by a level 65 casual player who raids on occasion. <br />
<br />
I would say none of Yekesha (Maybe exception for hates fury but justa  maybe the rest is pretty darn low level) LDON has some good stuff with the flavor of cardboard cookies. (And seperate raid content that is also made of cardboard.) Pop has a few zones. But nothing past tactics without forceing every raid before it. And GoD is just flat out broken. <br />
<br />
That is my viewpoint. I have spent the same amount of money as you for maybe half the content available. <br />
<br />
Also How did raiders feel with GoD when you had to only take 6 people to pass the trials. It sucked didnt it.  Well they forced you into a single playstyle there. Welcome to our world , except of course raiders have the ability to make smaller groups out of large ones. The casuals have a much much harder time making large groups out of thin air. <br />
<br />
I want both playstyles catered to. Not just one. Is that so god damned wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">You don’t need all of your spells. Just like some weapons, armor, and other stuff, some of those spells just may be out of reach for some folks. <br />
<br />
Just as was said. Some spells are like TA. Unless you raid and put that much more effort into it you wont get them.<br />
<br />
Comparing Fo7, Malos, Quiessence, Blood of Saryrn, etc to TA is ridiculous.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I would ever want Fo7 or Malos in my book is for convenience.  Torpor and Quiessence are likewise nice to have, but by no means geared solely for high-end raiders.  Blood of Saryrn?  All I hear on the boards is people bitching about how DoTs are useless outside of soloing.  These are not spells that drop from the darkest depths of PoTime B.  If there was Quarm-dropped shaman spell that was a 3-tick DoT for double BoS's total damage, I'd drool over it, then forget about it, because I'm not heading to PoTime anytime soon.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, the spells that will end up costing me 50k+ a piece are either convenience items or standard upgrades to existing spells.  There's nothing so remarkable about them that warrants their drops being isolated to high-end content.<br />
<br />
Fo7?  It's a group FoSoul.  I bought FoS for less than 1k.  Why should I pay 49k more for the group version?  Convenience?  not likely.  I've got canni IV and soon canni V.  My group will deal with a short break for rebuffs.<br />
<br />
Malos?  It's a nice, but relatively minor upgrade to Malo.  Not worth 20k simply because it drops in Tier 4 PoP.<br />
<br />
Quiessence?  Nice upgrade over Torpor, but I don't hear anything about Quiessence that makes me think it's anything but a nice spell for xp grouping or soloing. <br />
<br />
BoS?  People don't even cast these in groups because fights are over so fast.  It's a spell for soloers.  Why should it be restricted to a raid drop?<br />
<br />
TA, elemental armor, etc are great rewards for the raiders.  I don't have any problem with rewards for hard work.  Should there be spells that are similarly geared?  Sure.  Make them very powerful and make them no drop.<br />
<br />
The spells I want, Fo7, Malos, Quiessence, BoS, are standard upgrades, not game breakers, for the non-raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">First, before you get all pissy, look at my magelo.<br />
<br />
Second, I already said this isn't going to happen in EQ.  I don't expect people who don't have the mental capacity to think outside of the current RPG paradigm to be able to imagine a world where raiding isn't considered &quot;work&quot; or somehow a more noble way to play the game.<br />
<br />
Let's drop the words &quot;raid content&quot; and &quot;group content&quot;.  I realize this isn't going to change your mind because you think raiding should be the end-all, be-all of every RPG everywhere, but I'm going to go through it anyway.<br />
<br />
The size of the force that is required to bring a target down should determine the types of challenges that the force will have to overcome (i.e. variety of different spells that go off to reflect the probable wider variety of classes present to combat that, number of additional critters to face, etc) and the volume of loot.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to make one piece of content that simply requires larger numbers drop higher quality gear, or spells.  This isn't coming from some newb who feels entitled to every piece of gear etc.  Future games must design with that in mind.  Character progression should not depend on who you play the game with.<br />
<br />
     I understand what you are saying.  I enjoyed Velious immensely and one thing that I did like was the large loot tables that raid mobs had.  Killing boss mobs like King Tormax or AoW would net a guild 3-4 items per kill.  PoP mobs typically give us 2 items per kill, and I think this was to slow down progression so people wouldn't rush through new content as quickly as they have in the past.  Right now the game runs off a numbers system where the amount of people needed will determine the quality of loot dropped.  As raid events become trivial the items they give also become trivial.  I just recently finished up the Prayer Shawl quest, when it came out I believe it required about 3 groups to complete the shawl crawl.  I did the shawl crawl with 3 friends, and it was still trivial.  I seriously think I could have accomplished the crawl with one melee class, but at the time I didn't want to screw up the event.  The shawl while no longer the greatest item is still used by many until they get to PoTime and find something better.  That being sad, if this event is challenging to complete by two people should it net Elemental / Time quality loot?  I don't think so.  SOE seems to run off of some calculation of time/content/group force to determine drop quality- sometimes they hit the mark and sometimes they are off.  I still find hard LDoN / Tipt / Vxed to be challenging and I think the drops from those events are in-line with the challenge.  The only drawback to this is that Tipt / Vxed still require a &quot;specific&quot; group with many classes being left out.  <br />
     Here's where I see the problem with groupable / raidable content:<br />
<br />
1.  Players will take the easiest approach to completing a goal.<br />
     (Ex: using a chanter pet for Tipt / Vxed trials)<br />
     Problem: with this strategy you now need the pet babysitting crew<br />
     further locking in a &quot;set group&quot;.<br />
     (i.e debuffer, snarer, buffers, and the chanter)<br />
<br />
2.  Players will jump content.<br />
    (Ex: Players that zerg to 65 and then app to Time+ guilds)<br />
     Problem: Usually these jumps in content are during a guild's &quot;farming&quot;<br />
     period when they are reaping their rewards for previous encounters. <br />
     The loss of player skill/gear will, for the most part, go unnoticable<br />
     due to the &quot;triviality&quot; of present content.  It may have been<br />
     challenging the first few times, but after a period of equipping <br />
     the guild the content becomes trivial.<br />
<br />
3. Players will go with the best time/risk/reward.<br />
    (Ex: Raiders will hit hard targets once or twice to flag them to a<br />
    farming point.)<br />
    Problem:  How many guilds have you seen that report &quot;We are now<br />
    farming Coirnav!&quot;  It's a high risk encounter and therefore unless<br />
    people need the flag most don't want to mess with the event.<br />
    Snoww had a great idea in putting equal gear in the game for groups,<br />
    but with long timesinks.  Those that chose to progress as a group<br />
    would take longer, but would not hit the ceiling as quickly.  The only<br />
    problem with this is that raiding is still superior in that it will<br />
    accomplish the same goals in better time.  If there isn't the time-sink<br />
    to group content then, whether people enjoy raiding or not, there is<br />
    no reason to raid.   <br />
<br />
    At this point in the game, every expansion becomes a fight between the raiders and the groupers.  Arguments over groupable content rewards and raiding content rewards is commonplace, and I think the developers are finding it harder now than ever to appease everyone.  The raiders wanted more raidable content to help offset the bottlenecks that are commonplace in their environment while the groupers want the gap between time/gear to be shorten or completely done away with.    <br />
     EQ is quickly becoming two seperate games with two seperate environments.  Some guilds want smaller raids so they can have content to experience while other guilds don't because they would have to split up their playerbase.  Casual players want better and quicker progression rates while hardcore players do not want their achievements to be trivialized quicker.  I highly doubt any of these issues will be resolved in EQ.  It looks like SOE is trying to resolve them in EQ2, but it looks like it will severely handicap playstyles to accomplish this.  Things like Trivial Loot Code kills farming, kiting nerfs will kill the soloing power of certain classes, so the best solo'ers will be the endurance/burst dps classes.  Less items in the market plus the add in of equipment breaking creates a higher priced market.  If raiding is removed or nerfed it takes away the current end-game content, so they will have to replace it with something that will occupy/interest long term customers.   Further splitting off the classes like what they are reporting in EQ2 will create more issues when the game progresses in that all classes will be handicapped as to what they can get by their counterpart.  This will create less innovative aspects to classes and further the &quot;mudflation&quot; of abilities that we see today.</div></div><hr />

Especially when the two mindsets would rarely ever meet anyways. I mean my group of 6 wouldnt be kicking down the door to where you are fighting anyways. <br />
<br />
Did you miss where I said this?<br />
<br />
I have stated before that I think they should open up the EPs with back-door quests similar to the Tactics ones. That would open up a nice new level of gear for more casual players. Lots of one-groupable mobs dropping very very nice stuff in there.<br />
<br />
Its not that I am trying to invalidate or ridicule anyone. But the whole &quot;uber gear for 1-group&quot; mind-set is what shortens a games lifespan exponentially. In less than a month of Diablo 2 you can have a couple lvl 99s and all the top gear you could want. Its a blast, I know, I played it. Loved it. Nice game for a 1/2 hour hit of &quot;mad fun&quot;. But it BURNS OUT. Doing this kind of thing to EQ would do the same thing. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think they screwed it ALL up. Put all the gods in &quot;B&quot; EP zones like Rathe Council. Put all the events to flag people into those zones in the &quot;A&quot; parts, and open the &quot;A&quot; from the git-go with a complicated, difficult, 1-groupable quest. Then the tards couldnt interfere with God raids. <br />
<br />
As for the lvl 65 spells, I dont want to hear ANY whining, cause thats bull****. Runes drop all over in OPEN zones. They also drop off a TON of nameds in Tactics, which has a 1-group flag quest. You dont get the spell you need on the turn in, sell it and use the cash to buy the one you do need. Personally, I would like to see ALL future spells done exactly this way. Turn in for a tradable scroll. Its certainly the most fair method of distribution.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just one other thing Snow. I think people are grossly misjudging Gates, because it lacks its &quot;sister expansion&quot; (or siamese twin seperated at birth or whatever) of OoW, where 5 levels and unknowable gear will probably put MOST of even the most &quot;casual bazaar&quot; players into &quot;Farming Tipt/Vexd for spells/gear&quot; stage. As it stands right this INSTANT, there are items dropping in Gates that are quite doable by small, casual groups, items better than EP in some cases. The re-tuning made it trivial for EP people to farm this stuff, so I know its doable by casuals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">with the VT key i was mainly referring to the shards (bah edited i put rift originally hohe) and the time it took to do them.  perhaps the VP key is a better one for the analogy, but then again, it also requires trak tooth which you would probably call a raid (even tho its an easy duo now).  <br />

<br />
i don't disagree with this so to say, but if you honestly think there should be 100% equality then you never played diablo2 and saw how uttelry pointless it was to play for more than a week.  if you want to turn everquest, the game that has been growing/evolving to 5 years into a game with 6 month lifetime then perhaps you're playing the wrong game.  <br />
<br />
The game as it stands is broken on many many levels. While fun to play in especially if you don't open your eyes too wide, I for one would rather remember EQ as a great game that I played and enjoyed for years and years. Rather than how I remember it at this moment a mismanaged patched together zombie that is a pale reflection of its past glorys that only cares about half its playerbase.<br />
<br />
i agree, the game isn't what it was.  and the gap between raiders and non raiders in gear is too large with the 200hp+ unaugmented gear constantly coming out of GoD zones.  then again, i won't use that to argue for complete equality of those that take the MORE DIFFICULT path of raiding.  you can spout all the random examples of unqualified people joining raid guilds and getting pushed thru not deserving what they get, but bottom line is its just not viable for everquest to have single group content as difficult as raiding.  after 5 years, the content would either be too hard for the casuals to ever win if it were = to the type of raid mobs that you're talking about, or, it wouldn't be worth doing for the raider who is geared well.  <br />
<br />
Also How did raiders feel with GoD when you had to only take 6 people to pass the trials. It sucked didnt it. Well they forced you into a single playstyle there. Welcome to our world , except of course raiders have the ability to make smaller groups out of large ones. The casuals have a much much harder time making large groups out of thin air.  <br />
<br />
i for one hated the single group trials.  especially tipt, as needing an 11k+ knight to tank kyv heartstriker jihru was just retarded, and the ultra dps low hp mobs were horrible for my shaman, it's basically why i retired him.  BUT, that being said, you don't see me making a huge scene about being FORCED TO USE A DIFFERENT PLAYSTYLE to accomplish my goals.  i didn't like it, but i did it, moved on, and am not bitching about how sony was infringing on my playstyle.  <br />
<br />
also, casuals having a much much harder time making large groups is due to what factor?  i point you again to the COMPLETELY OPEN raid group on my server, &lt;3bowraid.  <br />
<br />
url:  http://p069.ezboard.com/bowraid<br />
<br />
a group of completely open individuals, most are bazaar equipped, others are twinks from raiding guilds etc., have taken out every pop mob up thru RZ in tactics.  there are a number of people who are guildless and always have been who i see grouping in the elemental planes.  there is absolutely nothing stopping other people on other servers for doing this, all it takes is the strong leadership that some have shown here on tunare.  they flag ANYONE, regardless of level, class, guild affiliation, etc., and with a few rules about obcenities and respect issues.  they do loot nbg, i strongly encourage you to take a look at the forum and just see how well casuals can do when they work together for a common goal.  these are examples of people that actually did it, as opposed to constantly whining about the game forcing their playstyle.  the ones that didn't like to raid did it once, got the flags they needed, and stopped doing it.  nothing is preventing you from doing this.  i don't particularly like 1 group content, i prefer to raid, but you don't see me constantly bitching about how GoD trials forced me into a single group (and also destroying shm usefulness but thats another issue) play style that i loathed with every bone in my body.  <br />
<br />
once again, i agree, they need to bridge the gap a bit more with ldon type stuff, altho actually making questable items not equivilent but pretty near elemental type armor would be a nice change of pace than boring adventure grinds, between the raiders and non raiding people.  that being said, if the entire game were setup around your comfort zone, what would be the point of playing.  different configurations, challenges, playstyles are all valid ideas imo.  at the moment they've just focused the scale too much towards raiding.  by upgrading the ldon type gear it would help to bridge the gap between the two, but still continue the focus that eq is a raiding game.  it has been since kunark, you can either accept it or continue your bitching, i'm pretty much done listening.  <br />
<br />
TA, elemental armor, etc are great rewards for the raiders. I don't have any problem with rewards for hard work. Should there be spells that are similarly geared? Sure. Make them very powerful and make them no drop.<br />
<br />
The spells I want, Fo7, Malos, Quiessence, BoS, are standard upgrades, not game breakers, for the non-raider. <br />
  <br />
<br />
i agree, as long as the raid end spells are not class defining.  in early kunark, the elite shaman had torpor/malo, and the averages ones didn't.  you shouldn't not feel like a (insert your class here) simply because you don't choose to raid.  i'm all for ancient type spells, as long as they aren't completely overpowering and there are lesser but acceptable alternatives for those that don't raid the high end zones.  breath of trushar vs. quiescence is a perfect example.  both are great spells, but the average bazaar player doesn't need breath of trushar, they're just going to overheal themselves.  the raid shaman, on the other hand, with 9khp buffed, breath of trushar would be a nice and useful upgrade.  because everyone in the game is 65, and so are their twinks, and their twinks twinks, etc, for anyone that's played the game awhile, there has to be SOME form of differentiation for players.  AA is one thing, gear and spells is another.  <br />
<br />
Or let me guess. When you played baskettball with your boys, did you always have to get the gold star and the huge trophey with the cookies at the end of the day and your mommy fawning all over you squealing how great you were. All for doing the exact same thing as everyone else. <br />

i love how you claim to seek equality and fairness and that WE are being petty by defending the general basis for the current system (but most will agree ldon type stuff needs a boost with GoD), and then you go and make some comment like this.  perhaps you should get over your stupid petty jealousy first before resorting to insults.  the first part of that paragraph was fine, and then it just all goes to hell and you lose all credibility with me when you say something like this.  we're discussing solutions to a problem, not your inferiority complex because someone else has followed the path that sony set up and you chose not to.  <br />
<br />
I want both playstyles catered to. Not just one. Is that so god damned wrong<br />
<br />
yes and no.  grouping with others to accomplish goals, whether you like it or not, IS PART OF THE GAME AND ITS DESIGN.  whether it be you and 5 friends or you and 20, the difference is only in your head.  of course they should cater to both playstyles in order to keep everyone happy, and by making the gear/drops better for ldon type of stuff it would partially solve this.  with better gear and the time you put in, you too will be able to handle stuff that raiders can.  i'm not sure why ppl get so upset over playing the game for years, ding'ing 65, and realizing that without raiding your content is pretty much stuck.  when i was leveling my first character i was constantly chatting with the high end raiding guild shaman, asking for advice, seeing what they were up to, curious about the content and one day dreaming to be there.  that's the fun of the game for me, and if you don't like the system of raiding that they've set up then go play d2 or coh or wow when it comes out.  everquest does cater to both players, its just not entirely an equal level of catering at the moment, and as i've said many many times before, deserves to be tweaked.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I understand the rationale you guys may have behind saying that non-raiders shouldn't get the same level of gear and spells, etc., that raiders get.  It's just wrong though.<br />
<br />
Putting all the histrionics aside, this is a game.  People play for the same reasons -- to have a kickass character.  I don't think they should be punished because they haven't played the game a certain way.<br />
<br />
It's never going to happen in EverQuest, honestly.  I just hope that in WoW and EQ2 it happens<br />
<br />
How is it wrong? Was it wrong that the crusaders could not take and keep the holy land during the crusades of the middle ages? Was it wrong that the Byzantines bribed the Mongrols to keep them from attacking? Some goals require things, like tactics, logistics, coordination both in real life and in game. If a group of 6 could take out a difficult target, then one Seal team would have come strolling out of Baghdad with Saddam. Again EQ dynamics are mirroring reality. <br />
<br />
If you want the very best gear in game then you have to raid. By the same token though you can have a very powerful character and be Bazaar equiped, it just takes more time, plat, and grinding AA xp. Gear is only part of having a powerful character though, many raiders have fewer AAs because of the amount of time they spend raiding. Raid xp sucks, there is no other way to put it. I know several members of a time enabled guild on Vazaelle who have less than 200 AAs. Compare that with the casual people who have 300 to 500 AAs. My point is there are many different ways to measure a characters power, gear is just one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">There should be gear attainable by a single group of players that is the exact same as the best gear coming out of time. Maybe it doesnt have the same cool look. Or the neat name. Or the particle effects, but there should be a raid path and a Group path to all the content. <br />
<br />
But there should be an another path. One where he doesnt have all of his followers around. A quest path where one woman driven mad by the death of all her family in one of Zeks numerous wars wants reveng at all costs. and with your group of hardy adventurers Travels a lesser known route and peicemeil destroys certain underlings. and steals armour and weapons from Zek then one night ambushes him in his bath with no help or gear nearby. In that time he is weak enough to be felled by a single group Of folks who have taken the time and danger of the secondary path. Same outcome. The blade of the warlord is yours. But Since the group succeeded by stealh it is not flaming like the weapon would if it was in Zeks hands when he died.  You have this second path set up in multiple chuncks that would take say 10 adventures of hour to 2 hours each in instanced dungeons based around tactics layout. (Or 60 to 120 man hours to complete) Where raid of 60 folks would take 1-2 hours. (which comes out to 60 to 120 man hours to complete.)<br />
<br />
You know what would happen? you'd zone in and a guild would be there, 60ish strong, all doing the different parts. Then I guess you would want to make each quest an instance, so that you wouldn't have to wait in a 72hour+ line to get a shot at starting the quest.<br />
<br />
Then they could make instanced elemental zones, with quests to do each part of each ring, a small arbitor could pop, one groupable. Xegony event would be instanced of course, 800hitter, her pet &lt;- singular would be mezzable and rootable. Corn event would still take 15 minutes. Nameds have no adds equiv to krigers, coirnav would be equiv of a bot mini. <br />
<br />
Then time trials. 1 mob in a corner, you pull it kill it another mob spawns in that corner. Instanced of course. phase 2 more of the same, phase 3 you could kill mobs until you get quest pieces, roughly 2 hours to get 1 piece, dropable, you turn em in and the avatar pops 1000 hitter. <br />
<br />
Ok going to stop typing now because that sounds soooo boring. Ya I really want the biggest challenge in the game to be a 4 headed dragon that I root and dot to death. <br />
<br />
The world you guys want no one would be happy. The point is you gear up to do harder and harder encounters to achieve that next plateu. 1 groupable stuff no matter what the reward is not going to be fun for people. I don't have a TA yet, I look at people with one and think wow I'm going to get one soon. But what if I had every good piece of gear in the game and could 3 box everything. Why stick around? the casuals who want that definetly wouldn't so they can leave any time as far as I am concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Sheex,<br />
<br />
I am insulting Blazz in part cause I do like him. He has good arguments much of the time. And what would be the point of one sided arguments. (Grins)<br />
<br />
Course he is stubborn as only a shaman can be. <br />
<br />
When I started playing Snoww. There were no raids. They were not even a twinkle in the eye of Brad and company. Noone had even found Lady Vox yet. <br />
<br />
I have adapted my playstyle as well. Somewhat. I have raided. And after a while chose to leave that route behind. Knowing I would have lesser gear. (I stepped off the uberguild radar at the middle of Velious with a Level 60 thief That I was playing at the time.) But when I made that choice the differance between a master uberguilder and a regular good player was maybe 3-400 hps tops. <br />
<br />
Since then it has spiraled completly out of control Especially when the whole Serverside filtering started and people could bring 60+ folks to a fight without mass linkdeaths.<br />
<br />
My question to you is. You are a raider correct. And you have gotten some of if not the best loots in the game. Then why are you still playing?<br />
<br />
To try out the new content? To get more. To have fun. What is the differance in taking 72 guys and killing something for great loot then doing it again night after night to different targets. And taking 6 guys to get great loot night after night to different targets. <br />
<br />
The whole premise behind my idea is that when you segregate the community into two factions. Raiders. and non raiders. All you do is hurt the game. By catering to the raiders with a singleminded vision is as stupid as only haveing single group goals. <br />
<br />
The whole time Iw as coming up in EQ there was always things I could do with my friends and guildys. Things that were just out of reach. Maybe with the retuning GoD will allow us to play some more. But when something is balanced for a 11K hp Monster time geared tank. there is no god damned way My 6K SK tank is going to be able to handle it. And the Loot progression he is faced with now is very scarce. And 99% of it is raid or quit oriented. and it isnt even smaller raids, it is the 42+ people raids of Luclin and PoP that are the wall in front of me. <br />
<br />
People say things can be single grouped now all over the place. But the people single grouping them are the FT 15 clerics with the 6 K mana pools and the 11K warriors with Anger3 Auged BoW's in otherwords the people who either have already done the content and are slumming, or skipped the content with Powerleveling/carrying by thier larger more powerful guilds.<br />
<br />
As for pickup raids. Yeah I could go on them. But please sir remember That I activly dislike raiding. It doesnt matter if I am leading the raids (Which I have done) Or am shaman number 3  with a 1 in 120 chance at a shot of loot. The act of taking a gun to a knife fight just aint intresting to me. <br />
<br />
I know I am pissing in the wind with these suggestions. And I am really not angry about the games path it has taken. I am however saddened that at the end of the day I am not logging into Norrath or giving SoE my money, because I really loved EQ before mismanagment and Greed and Ego's ruined a great hobby. <br />
<br />
But unlike some people I did not sell my account or delete my charecters. I hope to come back to Norrath one day, but only if the norrath I come back to is worth the time and effort.<br />
<br />
For me, right now, It isnt.<br />
<br />
And of course City of heroes is a blast to play. While they might not have the depth of gameplay that EQ has. EQ didnt have it with the old world either. And City of Heroes can always add content. EQ has to add the soul back, and rebuild trust with its patrons.<br />

There is no comparison since these are 2 VERY different things. Going to a resturant and ordering a steak is like going to Merchant_01 and buying rations. Killing Uber_Mob_01 requires a number of things, first and foremost a person who can manage people and understand all the different skills that need to be brought together to make something like this happen. <br />
<br />
A better comparison of what I hear you wanting is Alexander the Great hopping on his horse and riding from Greece to India, oh yeah he conquered everything on the way during the ride. Wake up and smell the Coffee! <br />
<br />
1. EQ is Not diablo 1 or 2 where you can solo everything, and dupe any gear you have seen. <br />
2. EQ is Not a first person shooter where you can get more weapons by typing in a cheat code.<br />
<br />
EQ is as much a social event as a game. <br />
EQ is a game of skill in the tradion of D&amp;D, AD&amp;D, and a hundred other RPGs that came before it. It does take skill to play a class well, even if in the case of some classes the skill is to do what you are told, when told by the raid leader.<br />
EQ is more forgiving than alot of previous RPGs in that rezzes are common, and if you can stand here and not hit attack till told you can make it to high end content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i haven't played as long as most.  my original character geshtar's dob is like late fall 2001, so i started just before luclin came out.  i was in a family type guild for the first 2 or so years that i played, which fit well, until i took a break upon PoP's release for about 3 months, and then returned to find my guild in shambles mostly and i applied to a raiding guild (they had just started farming fennin, at the time).  the last 15 months or so i had been playing the shm with then, had farmed time for about a year, etc.  GoD + guild numbers had made me want to retire shaman for awhile, for all sorts of reasons but mainly the ones listed on murtak's post awhile back.  so i play the sk now.  sorry for late post they just made me tank tier1 of time and i got promptly tooled heh.  <br />
<br />
i play because of the friendships i've made in game, and most of my best memories are solo kills (first ww dragons, first zland, etc.), and of some older content raid kills (aow w/ 10, first trak duo with sk and my sk mentor type friend, etc.).  also some time raids were fun, our wipe of quarm at 0% when we were trying to kill him our first time was classic. <br />
now i play for a number of reasons, working on tradeskills, aa for the new character, flags keys gear, almost done w/ the vt key tho i doubt the sk will ever go there, that type of thing.  i'm not sure why i play, i just still enjoy the game and the people i play it with so i keep playing.  new content is cool as well, but i want to do it with friends, it's more important than most things.   my guild lost a lot of people when GoD came out, especially our hardcore raiders, so at the moment we are working to reequip new people and move to GoD.  <br />
<br />
i agree splitting the population into raiders and non raiders is dangerous and devisive, and causes more problems than it should.  that being said, at the same time, with all the prior expansions, the game simply isn't designed or ready for the full on type of innovations you're talking about.  i think upgrading ldon type attainable gear, ie the gear you can get with 1 grp, and the current amount of augments u can stick into gear for focus effects is a decent replacement for raid gear.  like i've said many times, GoD has unbalanced it again, but i don't think its currently as bad as ya'll say it is.  i have some friends that are in small guilds or don't raid at all, and with ldon and the skill that they have with their class they do just fine.  i won't say NOPE not gonna invite him to grp with me b/c he isn't in a raiding guild, with the very few exceptions of needing time equipped people for certain things.  obviously there needs to be a balance between raid and single grp (wru small raids like ldon but not so horribly boring).  finding that balance, however, is both incredibly difficult, and incredibly subjective.  i've been in smaller family guilds and i've been in raiding guilds, and my play styles aside, i prefer to raid.  perhaps this is just because the system of eq has so much focus on raiding, but i'd almost rather raid anything than not.  <br />
<br />
but seriously, look at the ezboard link for that group of pickup raiders on my server.  it's quite an interesting situation, and many of the high end raiding guilds have not been happy with the elemental planes basically being opened up.  <br />
<br />
If you want the very best gear in game then you have to raid. By the same token though you can have a very powerful character and be Bazaar equiped, it just takes more time, plat, and grinding AA xp.

My point is there are many different ways to measure a characters power, gear is just one of them.<br />
<br />
very often this is true, altho often the cleric/ench/tank triumvirate are measured by their gear.  BUT, i've seen people in bazaar gear who can own time flagged people no problem, simply because they are good.  an sk friend of mine in another guild on my server was in bazaar gear and almost killed me on the shaman dueling straight up.  the only reason i won is because i could land turgur on him easily heh.  very often good players are all over the place, including casuals, raiders, non raiders, and even ppl who aren't level 65.  the sad thing really is that the game is so much based on time invested.  as a college student i have a schedule that works with a raiding guild, but people who are hardcore about the game shouldn't not be able to play it well just b/c they have lives.  <br />
have to go now pulling tier2 &gt;&lt;, wtb faster casting death peace pst!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Only Fennin of the EP gods is worth farming.  This is primarilly due to his location, loot factor (Ring usually drops 2 loots for us, sometimes less, sometimes more) and he is easy to spawn so people can drift in after being spawned with low numbers.  Rathe is just.. retarded.  Anyone who would farm Rathe would hit massive burnout quickly, it's just not worth it.  Same with Xegony, no CoH makes it retardation.  Having to take two hours to just setup is insane.  Cor could probably be farmed fairly easyily before collision changed, and I think some people did.  Water is a pain though, and not really that much fun.  People farm easy and fun events.  Anything else just leads to massive burnout as they events are just for testing skill for flagging process.  Saryrn, Mith Marr and Bert are good examples of this in lower PoP.  Once you hit the loot farm of Time, it's hard to justify the same amount of time on one event for four loots tops.  Fennin is the only one excluded for the reasons mentioned above.<br />
<br />
  The game itself has been built up on battle lines being drawn between ubers and casuals.  It is stupid, but they can't really change it now.  Hell, one spell has basically dicated content for 4 years.  They've backed themselves into a corner, painted into it, built a little castle and set up turrets.  To redesign it at this point would essentially be a revamp of the entire system of progress in game mechanics starting at Velious and working up to late GoD.  Somehow, I don't see them doing that.  Small fixes such as adding in the ability to earn Time level items in one group would cause no one to want to raid, and systematically cause all those who enjoyed raiding to leave en masse.  It's not worth it to Sony to put so much work into it for really no increase in revenue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">&quot;Disregarding the enormous effort that went into reaching the zones the raiding guilds play in cheapens your argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, veeshanmurtak, you've cheapened your own argument by not making one.  You've merely reinstated what is already known instead of making a new point or even bothering to address what you purport to be responding to.  And yes, you have indeed gotten into the argument with your post.<br />
<br />
I never said no raiders and nobody in a guild ever worked.  I think the argument that some people have, that guild members or raiders in general have put in prodigious amounts of work, generally done with devotion and a high level of skill, and sometimes lots of ingenuity to boot, is the standing argument at this time when people talk about raiders getting huge rewards compared to non-raiders.  This is indeed why they say that level of reward is deserved.  <br />
<br />
I was pointing out other sides too because THAT SIDE is ALREADY emphasized and reiterated so much it's taken as though it were common sense and not merely just an idea on very shaky ground.  It's well-defended and understood, and what I was saying is that it is highly exaggerated more often than not.  Your calling me to task for it is ridiculous.  The obvious needs no belaboring; my post was made in part because of the relentless belaboring the obvious already gets, and how much it is celebrated and pointed to, to the virtual exclusion of what is probably the reality for most people's experience in the game.<br />
<br />
It's more than safe to say most people in a guild did not figure out how to do every encounter themselves.  It's more than safe to say that it can be incredibly easy to scoop up great gear when you join a raid gear even off encounters you've never heard of before, much less mastered your part in, much less developed the strategies to beat.<br />
<br />
The endless patting on the back that raiders give themselves is very undeserved in most cases.  I say this as someone who has been a raider for most of his EQ career, going back five years.  <br />
<br />
Really, being Rogue_07 or Shaman_05 or Cleric_18 doesn't make anyone a dynamic adventurer, skilled player, or anything else.<br />
<br />
And though many of us would likely hate to acknowledge it, most of us are NOT the exception.<br />
<br />
And many raids succeed not because of great playing and high skill levels -- but despite poor playing, numerous AFK's rolling through the classes, strategic and tactical bungling...just because it can sometimes be almost as easy to succeed as fail.<br />
<br />
The flipside to this is that quite a few casual players are indeed highly skilled.  And their frequent tendency to NOT just try to get through and pretty much ignore virtually the entire game in their race to become high-level raiders often means they've put in vastly more adventuring, exploring, and figuring out ways to tackle mobs and situations than a great many raiders have.  <br />
<br />
The equation of raider = better player is just not a one that should be taken at face value as glibly and fervently as it always is.  Of course, who doesn't like to flatter themselves?  Flatter the living heck out of themselves?   So raiders will usually pump up the volume big time on how special they are.<br />
<br />
They're not.  They're regular players, just like anyone else.  <br />
<br />
And getting their goodies is not at all a sign of how hard they worked or anything else positive.  Get in the right guild and stuff can be pretty much handed to you, from flags to loot to tradeskill materials.  <br />
<br />
The guy running around in elemental gear or time gear or whatever is not necessarily any better or harder working a player than anyone else.  Quite the contrary, quite often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I don't see what problem the solo/casual players have with raiding. Join a non hardcore raiding guild.<br />
<br />
I myself are in a semi casual guild that has 3 official raids per week without compulsory raiding attendance at all. Yet we made it to the elementals. We even skiped the whole SSra/VT content becouse majority of membery did not have the time for long lasting raids/farming sessions. We have some very casual players playing only once or twice per week for a few hour and yet they managed to get elemental flagged. They had flagging partners but hey they made it.<br />
<br />
Raiding is a part of the game why do ppl think that you have to go hardcore to see EPs/time ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">That as more people get AA and The gear level in general rises from scraps of the new expansions the raiding in PoP will get easier and require less numbers. <br />
<br />
So people are right that some 2 years after Pop is released You might be able to handle some of the smaller god encounters with many less people than before. Some of the time. <br />
<br />
I would expect if my guild and I waited and did the long grind to 70 and 500 AA and picked and chose the scraps at the table we might be able to get to a couple more zones in PoP and even break partly into GoD. But grinding for xp with no heart is rather boring. Always looking to the future with no enjoyment of the present is not a whole lot of fun. <br />
<br />
In a way I am very jelous of the raiders. Because when the new content comes out they can explore it first. It used to be in Kunark and Velious and Parts of luclin I was right there with them. Not doing the raid encounters but flitting about in the wings, finding out all the neat little things that went along with the zones. <br />
<br />
That doesnt happen as much anymore because what is challenging to the Raid shaman pretty much would kill my 3600 Hp ass. Many times in 3 swings now. The gap has gotten too great. and the only way to narrow the gap is to either nerf the power of the ubers. Or raise the power of the casuals up And I do not like calling for the nerfs. <br />
<br />
Raiders should have the best gear. But that &quot;Best&quot; tag should have no impact on actual gameplay mechanics. It should be the Best looking. Or have the best amount of convience attached. But when it comes to the raw numbers The gap should be about 5% of the bazzar equipped charecters. That way they would only have to design for one paradigm, and Joe Blow shaman _06 would be able to play with Uberwarrior_09 and be effective depending on his personal skill level. Remember when Velious armour looked so damn cool. But skyshrine was slightly better in some areas but not quite as good in others. (I belive Kael had more Raw HPS. And skyshrine had better resists. but I might be wrong) The look and the wow factor went hand in hand. But someone in Skyshrine armour Vrs someone in Thurgadin armour could still play in the same sandbox. <br />
<br />
Think about it folks. The gap is killing EQ at the moment, because it is so wide the developers can't even span it properly. Sow hat would the raiders want really. A raise in casual power Or a lessening in raider power.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Snow your not comparing accurately.  kael armor (and your right it had slightly more hps, and skyshrine had better resists) was not the best armor in velious.  NTOV dragon armor was the best and it was head and shoulders better.  heck they had to nerf Vulak'Aerr and turn him into some incredably hard (at the time) ring event, becuase the loot he dropped was still superior then anything in luclin, except VT gear and they hadnt finished that zone yet!<br />
<br />
the gap between people in Dragon NTOV armor the normal questable armor was just as big as the gap between ornate and time gear.  heck even in luclin, the difference between Ssra gear and VT gear was huge.  its been that way in every expansion.  it gives the hard core players something to aim for and moves them out of the lower end content.  <br />
<br />
the trouble is that during evey expansion the casual player sees the new top end stuff and suddenly the older top end stuff is no longer appealing.  who wants time gear that has 180hps and one or maybe two effects, when you can have GoD gear with 200 plus hps and effects and better spell resist modifiers (or direct atk modifiers).<br />
<br />
the older top end gear, elemental and time, are becoming easier to get because the competition from the top end guilds arent there, but thats not good enough anymore.  the casual gamer wants to skip that content and be able to play in GoD for the latest gear NOW!<br />
<br />
it aint gonna happen.  heck the shoulders from the emperor in Ssra are better then most in the planes outside time, as an example.   but you so called casual gamers dont want that, its not good enough anymore.</div></div><hr />

No, the casual gamer doesn't necessarily want to do the same content the same raid way that you did it.  They just want an alternate path to the same reward.  WHere's the issue with that?<br />
<br />
What's wrong with people being rewarded with the same stuff for putting in equal amounts of effort in different ways?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I have to disagree here.  Why raid with 50 people if you can get the same stuff with 6?  Since quality can be found in both casual and hardcore gamers, the two will just intermix.  Though both can be risky, raiding takes a lot more coordination and patience than a 1 group encounter.  Taking down a god or like being (which should require a raid) should yield higher quality rewards.  A raid may only get two drops for 50 people, so why should 1-2 drops happen for only 6 people?  This further enhances my first question of the paragraph.  And SOE just isn't going to have 20 items drop off one major encounter for a raid.      <br />
<br />
Take a high-school football program and a top end college program.  A high-school football team just isn't going to have the same funding, media exposure, and physical build as a college one.  It's just how it is.  It's a whole new level.<br />
<br />
Having that said, it doesn't mean casual gamers should be stuck with subpar crap either.  Rewards (stat wise) should be good, just not as good as raid quality).  I think LDoN hard adventures and merchant camp gear, have scraped the surface, but stopped there.  There are some good stuff, however, it only goes so far.  There could be a lot more variety of itemization and instanced zones, with new challenges and scenarios.  For some reason, SOE hasn't expanded the LDoN system (hopefully without $).</div></div><hr />

You seem to be stuck in this mindset that being a clueless little cog in the wheel of a raid machine is inherently more challenging that being in a group of six people.<br />
<br />
It isn't the number of people it takes to win an encounter that makes an event challenging.  It is the complexity of the design.  Numbers are meaningless.  Raiding in EQ is no more or less challenging than doing some challenging one-group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">in theory the degree to the strength of a group and the ease to which a person finds a group should not be affected by raiding. They are 2 different games. Ideally perhaps a raid advancement idea could be added to provide unique abiltiies to raiding to which killing raid mobs could provide. If Soe could label mobs their end as to what are raid mobs, then it would not affect group content perhaps. It is also my view, that raiding should only provide equipment for certain parts. Jewellery should have stayed within the vicinity of jewellery, and perhaps special quests to upgrade. Variety and multiple gameplay styles should be eq's emphasis, not just one.</div></div><hr />

Is there some reason raids can't be challenging?  That there should be no epic scale battles allowed in this game that thousands of people play?  <br />
<br />
Let's look at the opposite spectrum.  What if EQ's encounters were always only one groupable?  I could ask why such a low limit?  I would like to gather a bunch of people/friends (hence a guild) and tackle a larger and more challenging event involving multiple groups, and for being victorious, gaining items of greater power.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Whats wrong with the raider getting better gear?  Simple, its the big flaw in EQ.<br />
<br />
Progression in EQ post 65 has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with how much time the player is willing to play.<br />
<br />
Progression in EQ has nothing to do with how well the player can play his class.<br />
<br />
Progression in EQ is about one thing and one thing only once you get to a certain level of AA and gear, and that is raiding.<br />
<br />
If you are not willing to raid, or seldom raid, or find raiding boring, then you will never progress past a certain point in EQ.<br />
<br />
All other rewards in the game are sub-par to the gear that drops off of raid level mobs.  There is not one item in the game, that can be acquired/quested for that is superior to a raid drop item.  <br />
<br />
In other words, the 'Quest' in EverQuest is a waste of time...it really should be renamed 'EverRaid' or 'EverFlag', because without raiding and getting flagged, you are forever shut out from acquiring the higher tier items that allow your character to progress.<br />
<br />
Yes, a casual player can do LDoN and single group encounters and eventually get fairly close to Elemental equivalent gear, but they will never, ever approach time-level gear as its just not available if you don't have the flags and dont raid.<br />
<br />
I too, am hoping the WoW, is better balanced, and not aimed strictly at those players willing to spend all of their time raiding.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I generally find raiding mind-numbingly boring, its a tedious battle of getting everyone assembled and buffed...then chewing thru the boring stuff, and then being useless on the named mobs because of slow immunity/mitigation, our subpar healing and our tragically useless DD/DoTs.  <br />
<br />
We either wipe or succeed, generally on the talents of the other classes in these situations.  The only thing we contribute on a named mob generally is the unresistable debuffs.<br />

<br />
We can't use the expansions either. And if a good 60% of the game can't really expect to use the expansions then guess what they stop buying and the raid game goes bye bye. Cause it will be the end of EQ.<br />
<br />
If single grouping  and 12 man runs and 18 man runs and 24 and 36 were all viable then EQ would be a better game. The power level of the rewards should be the same. The man hours should be the same. The only things that should be different is the stories and the Non game impacting part of the rewards should be different bigger and or better. <br />
<br />
My idea of what could fix EQ anyways. Take away the Uberloot for one segment of the population. Level the playing feild and start rewarding Raiders and Groupers alike, With the challanges and rewards based around the content. Not the Amount of warm bodies you can teach to goosestep in one direction. Or the Number of clerics you can hot box in C heal rotations. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">&quot;Why raid?&quot; is the refrain I always hear from raiders.  Why raid if you can't get anywhere from much, much better to exponentially better gear than non-raiders.<br />
<br />
The question itself seems to be a cross between sad and an outright admission of how the game has lost its course.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could just do it because you like to raid?  There's a thought.<br />
<br />
Doing something because you want to.  In a game.  For, like -- fun.<br />
<br />
The one thing I hear most often from raiders is that they on the one hand want to be raiders and on the other hand have to be bribed to the skies to do it.  And these are the guys who supposedly LIKE raiding!<br />
<br />
It's a game, after all.  If you don't want to raid, don't do it.  Raiding, like other styles of play, should have something of its own reward in it.  If it's no fun unless the rewards are enormous compared to any other style of gameplay, then it's not really that fun after all, is it?  By design and by your own admission?<br />
<br />
If it IS fun by design, then the ramping up in gear you get by raiding doesn't have to be so extreme to convince people to raid -- that is, to do something so many of raiding's most hard core defenders sound like they're claiming they can't understand the point of doing.<br />
<br />
Raiders I think should have great gear, and maybe a bit better than the hardest working non-raiders.  But when you get a 3600 point shaman and a 7000 point shaman, a 7k warrior and a 12k warrior, things have gone a little awry.<br />
<br />
It's the &quot;more is better&quot; philosophy that EQ has had toward expansions and itemization and monsters.  Upgrades used to be much more incremental, but now they are enormous.  Very flashy.  Elemental gear having 100hp per piece more than ornate AND having better focuses to boot is a clear example.<br />
<br />
You need better gear to fight the mobs that drop elemental armor?  Well, you at first killed those mobs without it, so that's not quite true.  But, you would like upgrades, right?  That make the zones/mobs easier to handle, so you can progress.<br />
<br />
Fine.  But if you don't design the armor to be so titanically superior, you don't have to make the monsters nearly as hard to kill to keep them from becoming trivial, and vice-versa.  You tame a vicious cycle instead of exaggerating one in ways that will become even more exaggerated in every further expansion.  I remember being quite happy with much smaller upgrades in HoT in Velious; everybody was.  And I think a lot of people would agree that the game was better back then.<br />
<br />
Once you go for the flash by making armor upgrades hugely better, you may get everyone excited and get people to buy your expansion, but you're going down a slow road to ruin for the game.  You necessarily separate people out by their gear so one guy is not just better equipped than the other guy, but can quickly get better equipped to such an extent that you're tearing your customer base in half, and either have to design twice as much content or leave one or the other part of your customer base hanging, perhaps forever.  Leaving you to lose a lot of customers either sooner or later, take your pick.<br />
<br />
There should be armor upgrades, but human psychology and the way games work too is merely that we need rewards, not to hit the lottery.  Smaller rewards are fine, and well in keeping with the spirit of the game and of challenge, that is -- you accomplish more, you get more.  Not, you become a raider or you join a guild and within a few weeks you have 1500 more hitpoints and maybe a weapon that makes a critical difference.  (BoW, anyone?) <br />
<br />
Evening out the power curve in armor and the bosses and yard trash you kill to get it would not only make the game more coherent and sustainable, it would be to the great benefit of raiders too.<br />
<br />
It would keep them from saying &quot;Why raid?&quot;  Because the obvious answer would be, &quot;What do you mean, why?  Why do you like chocolate ice cream?  I raid because I like raiding.  It's fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of an answer that speaks more of being bribed and obedient than of doing something you like doing:  &quot;Because if I want to progress, I HAVE TO.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, it would take Sony really rethinking their game and also spending a good amount of development time on it to let non-raiders have more avenues to catch up, since you don't want to nerf the raiders.   That all sounds like really paying attention and even worse, spending money, one of which EQ developers has not shown a knack for and the other being completely off the table if you really have no vision for the game's present sustainability or how it's going to hold up in the potentially much broader marketplace of the incredibly near future -- as per Sony's track record.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">roflrofl, diablo2 as a model for success?  eq has lasted 5 years on the raiding focused system that it has now, and you imply that following diablo2's example for eq would be better?  not sure about you, but diablo2 lasted about 6 months and didn't make crap vs. the money that eq is/has been making.  obviously everquest and its expansions is a superior game in a whole number of different ways.<br />
<br />
Sorry, can't pass this up.  D2 annihilated existing PC game sales records.  Has EQ ever done this?  In another thread I broke down very optimistic sales estimates for EQ (because they won't publish the number of subscribers they have any longer) and despite having no recurring revenue D2 did exceedingly well.  And it's flat out fun, which is not something I can say about EQ any longer.<br />
<br />
In addition, I just logged onto Battle.Net just now and there are 74K people playing D2 as I type.  4 years later, only 1 expansion- and they still have that many people playing.  No one knows how many EQ has- the 400k figure is at least a year old and I'd hardly consider that reliable.<br />
<br />
But, here's a cut/paste from my earlier thread.  If I can find a good source of relatively up to date sales figures I'll edit the post to be more accurate as the Blizzard sales data below is nearly 4 years old.<br />
<br />
I ran the numbers out of curiosity.  Some assumptions:<br />
- average of 400k players throughout EQ's history (probably less than this)<br />
- all players pay for EQ monthly (for maximum revenue)<br />
- each EQ expansion averages $30 as they keep releasing bundled packs which lower the aggregate cost for new players<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard:<br />
Diablo 2: 4 million X $50 ea. = $200,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 expansion: 2.5 million X $30 = $75,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 revenue: $275M<br />
<br />
SOE/Verant:<br />
Monthly subscription revenue<br />
400k subscribers X $13 X 60 months = $312,000,000<br />
<br />
Expansions revenue<br />
400k subscribers X 8 expansions X $30 = $96,000,000<br />
EQ revenue: $408M<br />
<br />
Clearly SOE/Verant have destroyed Blizzard in sales and revenue, despite the fact that Blizzard holds back to back to back sales records on the launches of their titles.<br />
<br />
But then again, perhaps you've heard of the Warcraft/Starcraft series? I think they may have moved a few units as well...<br />
<br />
Bottom line: SOE has nothing to worry about from such an inexperienced game developer.</div></div><hr />

He's right in a way though - you don't need all your spells to do the job, they're just nice to have. I bet there's only a handful of shamans across all servers who have all their spells.

<br />
Sorry it's taking me so long to respond, been busy over a relaxing holiday weekend.  Progression is no different for a casual player than it is for a raider, just on a smaller scale.  You want to experience new content, try new challenges and improve your character which in EQ translates to better gear.  My stubborness to refuse to change my lifestyle to accommodate my entertainment is simply the exercise of free will over discretionary income as a consumer.  I look at it this way: I used to be able to group with my friends no matter what guild they were in and we'd all have fun.  That is no longer the case.  The game changed, not us.<br />

I find it amusing and ironic that the very person who does not endorse Gates in other threads advocates it here for the casual player.  I didn't purchase the expansion so I don't care- you did and by your own admission, think it sucks.  Who's full of spite again?  Sounds more like misery needs company.  Here's one of your quotes in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21636&amp;highlight=hate+gates&amp;pagenumber=1):<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, Gates, sure. It sucks. Its tuned to level 70, unless EVERY SINGLE ONE of your members is FULLY Time geared, you arent going far.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a casual players' paradise, eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
 Big items dropping of mobs easily killable by 1-group bazaar geared people. But wait, forgot, you want Time stuff off Fire Beetles.<br />
I asked you before to link or quote me where I said this.  This is another transparent attempt to label casuals who want the same opportunities as &quot;whiners&quot; and is basically raising the white flag for your case unless and until you can provide proof.  &quot;I can't defeat the logic, so I'll attack the speaker&quot;.  If you're not able to debate, that's fine, just bow out and let others continue.<br />

 Your playing the right game Iz. Have fun for your 10 minutes of it, it NEVER gets boring killing Mephisto over and over and over. Oh, when you have played Diablo 2 anywhere NEARLY as long as you did EQ, let me know. <br />
<br />
To put this in perspective, my friends and I played Diablo 1 for two straight years.  We then played EQ for three years before we hit the glass ceiling and quit.  Not everyone devours content at the rate that raiders do.  I have not the slightest doubt that Diablo 2 will keep us occupied until WoW's release so you needn't worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Ok, going to try to put some things into perspective.  <br />
<br />
To Iz: <br />
<br />
1. Diablo 2<br />
<br />
     Your numbers on D2 are a bit skewed, and here is why.  Blizzard has a strong player base in Korea and parts of Asia (very strong).  I lived in Korea for three years, and from what I saw the population played online computer games to a greater level than your common American- and my guess European/Australian community.  Korea's obsession with Blizzard and similar games that they dedicate television channels to gaming strategies and tournaments (not shows- channels).  This is also a country with limited/non-existent copyright laws.  For every purchased copy of D2/Warcraft/Starcraft there is countless hundreds of pirated copies.  The key codes are pirated as well, so that the only people that are making a profit is the piraters selling for much lower than the going rate of the game purchase.  While you may see 75k people online- my guess is about 1/3-1/2 of those players are playing pirated copies.  <br />
    Blizzard also makes what I call &quot;burnout games&quot;.  Games are fast-paced and progression is limited compared to other competitors. (EQ)<br />
The games, by themselves, burn out quickly, but provide a great diversion to players of long-term games when they are &quot;burned-out&quot;.  Many players who were avid EQ players will bounce back and forth between EQ and Blizzard to &quot;avoid total burn-out&quot;, and that is where the &quot;re-playability&quot; comes into play. <br />
<br />
2. GoD casual/raider<br />
<br />
    GoD sucks for progression....for the raider.  The gear lines up through Uqua are nice, but the risk is also tremendously high.  Many raid level mobs have lousy loot tables on top of this (1-4 class specific drops), and will commonly drop with placeholder loot (lots of berserker tomes dropping in GoD.)  For many guilds, especially with so many retirees, PoTime generates faster upgrades.  So, in general, GoD content is horrible for the PoTime raider.  For the casual, GoD can be quite the opposite.  Many of the trials have common drops that are Elemental/lower Time quality, and there are enough items to where a casual can completely re-outfit himself with just GoD loot.  On top of this, trials leading up to Ikkinz revolve around the tanks hitpoints vs. healing power.  DPS for the most part is the same in all the trials (charmed pet), and is therefore a constant for the casual/raider.  As long as a group can keep the tank alive and the chanter pet under control, then the rewards are equal for the raider/casual.  The rewards are bigger for the casual, though, in that they receive a large jump in stats/focus effects, where the raider may pass on most of the loot because they have slightly better.  Therefore, the risk vs. reward is higher for the casual than for the raider.  The current group I run with has 1 member that is guilded, with the rest of us running with lower raid (BoT, Velious)/LDoN/ornate gear, and we are very successful.<br />
<br />
To Blargx:  <br />
<br />
1. Raid mentality:  <br />
<br />
     Raids are only interesting until they are beaten to the point of triviality- then they become business as usual.  While I am sure many raiders do truly enjoy raiding- many get just as burned out as the casual &quot;grouping in LDoN&quot;.  Raiding also is faster where the goal is equipment than Grouping where the goal is xp, hence burnout is quicker.<br />
The concept is identical between the casual quitting over &quot;not progressing&quot; and the raider quitting over &quot;not progressing&quot;.  If equipment lines are equal between grouping/raiding the grouping does have the advantage with giving upgrades/xp than raiding that would give equipment.  This leads into my second argument.<br />
<br />
2. Gear Progression:<br />
<br />
     First, we have to take into account that SOE will purposely bottleneck content so that there is enough things to do that it will take enough time for them to develop and release new content.  This is from a business standpoint where a producer wants to make sure that he can continue to generate money from a consuming society.  The easiest way to achieve this without massive beta-testing on class balance is with gear.  Now I am going to give an example of minimal gear progression:<br />
<br />
Verant/SOE has released the following &quot;high-end&quot; expansions:<br />
<br />
Original<br />
Kunark<br />
Velious<br />
Luclin<br />
PoP<br />
GoD<br />
<br />
Now lets say they went back and scaled the hitpoint/mob dps back some to where mobs gains 50 damage per hit per expansion and gear gains 10 hitpoints per piece for end-game content.  We will say that the avg high end player has 1000 hitpoints at the beginning of the first expansions game.<br />
<br />
               Mob hit        Total PC hitpoint<br />
Original       100              1000<br />
Kunark        150              1200  (20 gear slots) 20x10=200<br />
Velious        200              1400<br />
Luclin          250              1600<br />
PoP            300               1800<br />
GoD            350               2000<br />
<br />
What you may begin to notice is that Mob dps and a player's gear are running off of different ratios.  Where the original content may have a mob that can quad for 100's for a total dmg of 400- you see at GoD a mob could theoretically quad for 350's with a total dmg of 1400.<br />
<br />
Mob vs PC (original)  400/1000= 2/5<br />
Mob vs PC (GoD)     1400/2000=7/10<br />
<br />
The answer would be to lower the mob's dps to preserve the &quot;slow gear upgrade progress&quot;, and here is where we run into two conflicting problems:  healer/dps raid ratio, and content bottlenecking.  The developers need to keep the raiders occupied.  <br />
<br />
Healing:  Lowering mob dps further doesn't solve the issue and here is why.  If it takes 8 healers to keep a 1000 tank up vs. (original mob) then it is very likely that it may take only 10-12 healers to keep a tank up vs. (Kunark) mob because mob dps is only scales slightly from expansion to expansion.  This will create the second problem.<br />
<br />
Bottlenecking:  To be consumer friendly when &quot;bottlenecking&quot; content the easiest answer is gear farming because it, in itself, is progression.  We already know that long quests/rare drops/rare spawns make the consumers annoyed.  A high-end guild's ultimate goal is to &quot;farm&quot; the high-end content, so if they can zip by &quot;middle-content&quot; with 10-12 healers and save 2-3 months then it is very likely that they will.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is a simplified breakdown of gear vs. mob.  You will also have to factor in raid dps vs. healing, raid make-up, and raid target scripts.  Many of those, though, can be modified to work to the raider's advantage with a preference for healers/ heavy dps classes/ cc'ers. (Sound familiar? Check high-end guild class preferences)<br />
<br />
SOE's current solution is higher hitpoints per piece of gear to create the &quot;bottleneck&quot; that we see in today's raid content.<br />
<br />
(Ex: How many Vex Thal guilds actively farmed lower PoP in their progression to Elementals? Very few as much of the drops were near in stats to what they were currently equipped with.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Blizzard makes burn-out games?<br />
<br />
Both Warcraft and Starcraft have years long enormous popularity. <br />
<br />
As far as raiding/grouping gear being identical, that's not something I was arguing for.  I was arguing that the idea that the difference should be astronomical is damaging to the game and has damaged the game. <br />
<br />
And I also pointed out that risk/reward can be extremely skewed toward raiders, despite their frequently saying they have all the skills and hardshiops, because frankly quite often raiders stumble into their extremely high quality gear with an awful lot less work than casual players do in order to get gear that is in comparison unquestionably completely and often very dramatically inferior.<br />
<br />
As to whether raider burn-out should be any more catered to than anyone else's -- your guess, or subscription dollar, is as good as mine.  Burn-out is burn-out.  I'd hate to compare the burn-out rate of raiders to that of casual players or even less hard core guilds at the beginning of PoP who leveled to 65 only to find they had turned almost every zone green except almost every zone they couldn't get to anyway.  The raiders would come out far, far ahead.<br />
<br />
As they ALWAYS do.<br />
<br />
Not that they shouldn't have fun.  But...there's no sense designing the game so that you have to be a bastard stepchild or a raider, with nothing in between.<br />
<br />
That's just bad design.  It has doubtlessly cost Sony an enormous number of lost accounts, which is a very big mistake, because all money is good money.  When you have an audience with no alternatives, you can be a lousy businessman.  When alternatives start knocking at your door and are possibly soon to be stealing your lunch, a poor business plan can suddenly become much more apparent.  It's okay to be thick-headed bumblers in a world that never changes.  The problem is, the world does.<br />
<br />
I think Sony shouldn't have gotten themselves into this mess in the first place.  But now that it has, maybe the game will improve a bit?  That would go against precedent though, so I doubt it.  I think EQ is well on its way toward becoming a permanent niche game.  It will be around for a long time, but the cumulative effect of such poor design decisions will render it uncompetitive in the marketplace for the kind of players and profits it could have kept a hold of virtually forever if they had just been a little less smug and oblivious and a little smarter.<br />
<br />
You spoke a lot about bottlenecking, Predicus.  Bottlenecking is what you can do when you cater to very few types of players.  It's what makes a game eventually turn into a niche game for a niche market.<br />
<br />
Sony had the world in the palm of their hands for many, many years.  If EQ's world were fully developed and lively, it could have been literally an experience that people passed on to their kids and paid decades worth of money for.  It could have been worth untold billions to the company.<br />
<br />
But you can't bottom-line that kind of thing and get that kind of reward.  You have to spend money to make money, as they say.  Fleshing out the world would have let people of every type and every level of ability and intelligence to commit time play around in the world forever and a day, or even come back to it years later.  They forgot that what they're peddling to the public is an immersive world and a chatbox with graphics -- a social experiment in an enjoyable environment, not a min-max raid-or-die get the money and get the heck outta here as fast as possible before the whole thing comes crashing down on us diversion.<br />
<br />
They truly had the ball as completely in their court as anyone ever could.  And they decided that instead of giving everyone real content, they would cheap out on the development costs and just create bottlenecks.  You don't like bottlenecks?  Get lost.  They decided that the game would turn more and more narrow until now it is about as narrow as a game like this conceivably could be.  Almost anyone could write you out a chart in a minute saying EXACTLY how you're supposed to play -- exactly the zones you visit and how long you spend in them, exactly the tactics you use, exactly when you get your AA, which ones and where at what level, what gear you get, and how you get into raiding as quickly as possible and rocket through EQ quicker than a vaselined bar of Exlax through Richard Simmons' colon.  The game has gone from being an open world with enormous potential to a rigid paint-by-numbers schematic for one type of customer and one type only, and the rest be damned.<br />
<br />
They cheaped themselves out for the quick buck like you might with anything you have no confidence in and that you think has a very limited future.  In not understanding their own product, they have lost countless millions of subscription dollars as people who the game wasn't designed around(read -- everyone but raiders) drifted away day by day, year by year.  And they have, to use I think Blazz's phrase, painted themselves into a corner with their cheapness, where they can now expect not increasing profits but declining profits by virtue of years of their own bungling, as EQ slowly contracts and becomes the kind of game you get when you don't bother really fully committing resources to your business -- a niche game for cash that eventually becomes more and more trivial.<br />
<br />
Some people have commented that EQ is now in the stage of the business lifecycle of being &quot;milked,&quot; not grown.  That's true if you assume it's a product with a very limited lifespan that can't really grow and won't benefit by growing anyway.  But, as great as EQ can be as a game, it was from the beginning much more, and had vastly more potential.<br />
<br />
It was Sony's singular short-sightedness and lack of vision that let it never come anywhere near that potential and closed out its incredibly open-ended future into relative irrelevancy.<br />
<br />
Way to make a quick buck, guys.<br />
<br />
That's what happens when you have the suits designing games instead of gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Some very good points, but going to point some items out.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes burn-out games?<br />
<br />
Both Warcraft and Starcraft have years long enormous popularity.<br />
<br />
     There is one major difference between EQ and Starcraft/Warcraft, and that is EQ is PvE and Starcraft/Warcraft PvP.  The PvE content of Blizzard's games burn-out way early, but because of their PvP element they have a strong staying power.  PvP will always be superior &quot;strategy-wise&quot; than any programmed computer AI because their is an actual human being that you are reacting to.  Game Developers only have to create a relatively balanced game, and then let the PvP'ers run amuck to keep a game going.  The players are doing the work and in a sense &quot;creating&quot; the content.  <br />
<br />
     Aside from that, I think we are seeing an evolution of the &quot;middle class&quot; of EQ.  There are a few factors that went into this concept:<br />
<br />
1.  Game reaching the 5th year mark (aka: lots of un-used content)<br />
<br />
2.  Players generally disgruntled with 72 man raids.<br />
<br />
3. LDoN/GoD content and EBay creating a stronger awareness on individual and other players skills.<br />
<br />
4. EQ's aging community combined with less available time to play.<br />
<br />
    All of this combined is creating what I call the &quot;casual raider&quot;.  Guilds seem to be moving more towards a &quot;skill/personality&quot; form of recruitment, and are moving towards a &quot;quality over quantity&quot; approach to raid tactics.  Even the non-guilded seem to be moving towards this concept.  Pick-up raids are stronger than ever on most servers, and instead of 50 mindless players wiping over an event- we are seeing more knowledgable raid leaders and stronger group tactics.  Older content while &quot;trivial&quot; in gear rewards to today's uber items are still worthy as upgrades, and are being hit by smaller groups.  On Brell, there are pick-up raiders already farming the Elementals.  There are also semi-open raids on Velious/Luclin content ran by groups of friends as opposed to zerg guilds.  <br />
     This system seems to be working for Brell.  Top-end content is left open for the large guilds with longer playtimes, and the lower content is eaten up by smaller guilds/raiders/friends.  The casual raider still controls how much raiding vs grouping that they want- some raid 3-4 days a week, and others maybe once a week.  The smaller numbers lead to better distribution of gear, and a better sense of accomplishment for the event that was completed.  As more expansions come out, I expect that this &quot;middle class&quot; will become stronger.  The individual players have always been good at evolving with good/bad content, and while I don't think SOE had this in mind- the players are finding a solution to the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Hasn't it always been that way? At least from a melee perspective.<br />
<br />
Least since Velious when I started to care and notice that sort of thing. I could have a Fungi, TStaff, CoF and generally &quot;uber&quot; buyable gear. I still sucked compared to someone that went to NToV. I wasn't going to be owning Juggs or duo Arena or clearing WW. I just didn't have access to that content. Without joining a raid guild I would never have it.<br />
<br />
As much as you'd like to believe that melee get a free ride when it comes to added levels, it's not true. A level 65 Monk is exactly the same as a level 60 Monk except for the 100hp difference. No new or enhanced abilities. No extra skills. Nothing but the 100hp and an extra +5 to the level check when it comes to resists. With PoP, casters got that too.<br />
<br />
In a sense, it's equality... just not the kind you'd like. Spells are part of your gear. You really don't need them as much as you think you've GOT to have them. Alternate methods of getting them are very much there too. The same as a Warrior would have to may 100k to buy his ornate BP and do a better job at tanking, you have to pay out to buy Q and do a better job at healing. I'm pretty sure with maxed out LDoN/Bazaar gear you could complete GoD trials and get access to all your spells... except maybe the ancient, but then no one could get Luclin Ancients either without a guild.<br />
<br />
It's always been that way. How many people went to VP when it was cool without a &quot;raiding&quot; guild? Or managed to kill the outdoor dragons? How many of you took the single group route to Naggy/Vox loot? There has ALWAYS been content you couldn't access, now there's just more of it... but there's also a LOT more people trying to get access to it.<br />
<br />
It's only about &quot;keeping up with the Jones's&quot; if you make it. You don't need the access to the gear/spells you don't have until you're at the content that provides them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Good arguements coming from both sides of the table this time. I applaud you all. Look for your rep hits, guys, you all earned them, whether I agree with your take or not. <br />
<br />
Couple things I am gonna address, but I am a bit tired and don't feel like a quoting a bunch of posts, but I will try to address individual posters and their takes.<br />
<br />
First Iz. My man. My main casual man. My bud.<br />
You took my quotes out of context a bit, but the fact of the matter is, I DO think that Gates is currently BETTER for the casual player than the raider, and here is why. The upgrades available to the casual player willing to put in some research, exploration, and running from zone to zone are MASSIVE compared to whats currently available to them. I mean, 200 hp BPs, 100 hp/mana items is TONS of slots. All one-groupable. Heck the named turtle that paths by the 20 hp Aug camp drops 75/75 caster shoulders, and he barely blue to me. Now, on the flipside, the Raider, in order to get even some minor upgrades, must muscle through the most difficult, time consuming, stupid content in the expansion so far. The raiders are the ones hitting the lvl 70 content, not the casual players. The raiders have little need for most of the gear dropping for the casuals, but as it has been stated many times before, one mans &quot;bagged armor&quot; is another mans dream item. I didnt design it that way, so don't take it out on me, I just follow the path, bro, the one that leads to better stuff for my guy. After all, isnt that why you play Diablo? To find better stuff? It certainly isnt to kill Mephisto another 100 times or do 50 to 75 Baal runs in a week, thats for sure. <br />
<br />
BlargX next.<br />
Damn solid posts, as usual. However, please stop constantly refferring to the laziness/ease/stumbling/skillless etc lines about raiders. Were you a lazy raider? Did you sit there for hours with /follow on and watch TV? People like that are the exception, not the rule. Raids require coordination. Yeah, we need to bring 70 because odds are 5% arent paying enough attention to help effectively, but thats the breaks. BTW Raiders also do single group content, you know. Lots of it, usually. I have a shawl. I am 3/4 done with Aid Grimel. Neither of those quests really requires a &quot;raid&quot; (other than to get the flags needed for the Assling Demon Aid Grimel, gonna shove that hobbit RIGHT down the elevator shaft when I am done).<br />
<br />
Once again, I will go through this. NOT ALL RAIDERS ARE MEGA-HARDCORE POWERGAMERS My guild has no raid requirements. We have 300+ members who have logged in once or twice in the past 90 days (our &quot;limit&quot; for remaining on the active roster, and eligible to bid on loot). Thats 300 husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, college and high-school kids, average players just hangin with friends, having a blast killing big stuff. We are 1 kill from Time. We did Ssra and VT after PoP came out. Why? Because we arent hard-core, thats why. We aren't cutting edge. We will likely be the 6th guild on my server in Time. Personally, I play an average of 10 hours a week, broke down as follows: 2.5 hours raiding. 2.5 hours soloing for cash/tradeskill/quest items. 2.5 hours single grouping/LDoN. And 2.5 hours doing tradeskills, merchanting to get the stuff, make some pp to buy the things I need etc etc. Please, show me the &quot;hardcore elitiest&quot; in that list. And I am an AVERAGE type guy in my guild, and probably in every guild from Number 4 to Number 15 (note, we have 13 EP enabled guilds on Bert, 5 in Time, 2 others not EP but hitting Ssra and VT when they can). <br />
<br />
What I am saying is that there are LOTs of raiders who are just average players too. Casual, even, is a word I would use. I am a casual player, man. I got nice gear because THERE IS A PATH, and I FOLLOWED IT.<br />
<br />
And finally, in response to Blargs &quot;Why Raid&quot; rant, which has very solid points, BTW, I have only this to say. If raiding wasnt required to get the gear, folks wouldnt be as orginized as they are, and therefore, there would be lots less raids. I enjoy raiding. I despise farming. I loved getting wrecked by the Spiders in Air a couple times. What a blast. Coir is a riot to learn. Water is such a good PITA factor for people, adjustments are needed for every class. But once you put encounters on &quot;Farm&quot; status, which you HAVE to do, since the events only yeild 2 items for 70+ people, thats when it gets tedious and boring. Thats the &quot;raiding&quot; people wouldnt do. <br />
<br />
Oh, one other.<br />
<br />
Beeg<br />
The main complaint I see from non-raiders isnt the fact that there is SOME content that they cannot access, its the fact that with each expansion, there tends to be more and more &quot;Raiders only&quot; designed zones, thereby limiting what the casual player has access to. Original EQ had the 2 Dragons, and the 2 Planes, Fear and Hate. <br />
<br />
Then Kunark had a bunch of dragons, but only 1 &quot;real&quot; pure-raid Zone, VP. <br />
<br />
Velious added some more &quot;Raid Only&quot; areas, ST, ToV, even Kael to some degree. However, Velious also gave the game a TON of single group content, and wonderful progressive quests like Shawl, Coldain Ring, etc, where people could work towards a goal, and even if they didnt have a raid for that 8th Ring War, they had a dang nice item in the 7th ring. <br />
<br />
Luclin is where it began to get REALLY seperated. Massive timesinks for keying into the &quot;raid zones&quot;. Ssra and VT specifically designed for Raids. Single group content/quests in Luclin basically blew frogs, for the most part. Oh, and Luclin gave us the mother of all PL zones, PC. But still, 90% of the content WAS accessible by everyone.<br />
<br />
PoP changed all that. MOST of the content was inaccessible, and even now, 2 years later, a TON of it STILL is. Even if you went on some pick-ups and got some flags, you were still likely shut out of the HUGE XP and outstanding 1-group loot in the EPs. Lets ignore TIme. I think people could accept Time if the EPs were more accessible. After all, Time is just sorta the &quot;VP, NTOV, VT&quot; of PoP. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I think if the gap were a bit closer, there would be no bitching about the disparity. But its so huge. Just between the basic PoP stuff (ornate) and the next level, EP, there is a 3x jump in power. Thats too much, it really is. Especially with the MUDflated numbers we have in the game now, that the game NEEDS because of its age and progression. Heck, I think if they had just made the items a BIT closer, lets say: 50 hp/mana a slot for NToV, 75 for Ornate, 100 for VT, 130 for EP, 160 for Time, I doubt we would see as much of a stink being raised. <br />
<br />
They screwed up. There are a lot of things they could do to help out the casual players, not tricky difficult things either. Fabled mobs were great. Why remove them? Revamping old zones is another great idea, but not if they dont itemize them with things the casual player wants, and not if the zones they pick are a total PITA (Droga, Chardok B, totally unacceptable casual zones, IMHO). <br />
<br />
I dunno. Everyone has good points. There is no right or wrong. But the bottom line remains the same. There is a way to get the top loot. The game is designed that way. Play it that way, or don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">There is no right or wrong. But the bottom line remains the same. There is a way to get the top loot. The game is designed that way. Play it that way, or don't.<br />
The issue isn't just what the game is now, but that it morphed into this post-PoP.  The game PoP+ is designed solely for the raider, no argument there.  But prior to that a non-raider could still access the majority of the content and play with their raider friends when they're not raiding w/o the raider having to &quot;slum it&quot; in open zones.<br />
<br />
For me at least, flagging remains a much bigger problem than the gear gap.  Flagging means separation of the playerbase such that I can no longer group with my raid friends- how does this make sense from either a roleplaying or financial standpoint?<br />
<br />
I know you've continually said that SOE will open Sol Ro and possibly the EP's but I think they agree with you 100%- play as a raider or don't, we don't care one bit.  So therefore it will never happen because casuals leaving mean nothing- which makes perfect sense if raiders are the vast majority of players.</div></div><hr />

The bottom line is that *everyone* wants to be challenged.<br />
<br />
Sure, EQ/Sony/Verant et al have created a monster by making the rift between casual players and raiding players immense.  But, casual and raid are simply putting names on it.<br />
<br />
Lets say a &quot;casual&quot; player levels himself to 65.  Has &quot;most&quot; of his spells, and a mix of LDoN and bazaar equipment.  Does that player want to continue to do LDoN normals?  No, those are no longer challenging.<br />

You see, there is the problem.  There is no content for a post 65 casual player to be challenged without being overwhelmed.  It is either &quot;raid&quot; content, which requires a large number of players to simply handle the *(&amp;# coming down, or trivial.<br />

Where does a casual &quot;post 65&quot; player go to be challenged without being overwhelmed? Once LDON normals were trivial for me, I started doing LDON hards a bit more regularly.

<br />
The answer is LDoN-Hard and Gates. However, sites like this, filled with TONS or detrimental threads about Gates, especially from a &quot;Moderate Raider&quot; point of view (honestly, this is the WORST category to be in for Gates. The casual level stuff isnt enough of an upgrade for the most part, and the higher end stuff is WAY hard to get too without full Time gear) are chasing people away from Gates. Fact is there are 4 or 5 zones with decent gear, fair XP, and a ton of 1-groupable nameds to find and farm. Some roam. Some are static. Even the trials like Vexd and Tipt are doable by Bazaar level groups, even though you need the full Holy Trinity for it. Doable though, and the named in there drop stuff better than EPs. One group. <br />
<br />
No, a lot of the problem is that PoP truly spoiled people. I dont go to Gates. Why? Its a long way. And I probably play &quot;more than average&quot;. I am content to use the PoK system and be a Stones Throw away from where I want to go. Using 2 Magus's then running 3 zones to get to Ferubi and camp nameds is a HAUL for anyone, and completely impractical for more casual players, unless they made plans in advance with friends and camped there, or something. <br />
<br />
Gates is SOEs attempt to merge Raid content and Single Group content, I think. Kill the Smith (raid) OR do a bunch of Trials. Etc. Loot is nice. Even light blues in Natimbi drop damn nice gear. FT1 neck, 20 hp augs, 75/75 caster shoulders, all available in one of the FIRST Gates zones. But, everyone reads message boards, and hears how horrible it all is, and dont go. <br />
<br />
/shrug. If you are a player, and you dont know where to &quot;go&quot; from where you are, then maybe your time is up in this game, and its time to move on. If you want to advance, and find new things and places and gears, then do some homework, look stuff up, find the spawns, have some fun exploring new zones. Yeah, guess what, you might get killed a couple time. Happens. But geez, stop telling me that BoT and LDoN Normal blow and you cant find anything else to do. Its there.

<br />
The problem I have is with spells being handed out in the same way.  <br />
<br />
If it took 70 people to kill something in PoP when they were trying to move up to the PoP progression ladder, fine.  They got the gear first, got to Time, now are in GoD or whatever and can go to WoW now.  I have no problem with that.  The problem I has is that for people that aren't in 70 people guilds, we are stuck without some new tools.<br />
<br />
These tools are the 65-70 spells.  <br />
<br />
So now I can get my spells, get some levels and now we can move up the PoP progression ladder with 20-30 people or sometihng.  I couldn't care less if Time people bitch and whine that we can do it with 20-30 people at level 70 and they had to have 70 at 65.  They already got the cookie, yeah, you are first.  Move on to GoD or whatever.  <br />
<br />
To make the spells unreachable for the non-raider, will make the majority of the players in EQ leave in packs.  I mean packs.  I have a full  65 spellbook.  Can I do things that a Time geared Shaman with the same spellbook has? No, of course not.  I don't expect to.  However, with that spellbook, I have the minimum tools needed to do what I need to do to group with other level 65's.</div></div><hr />

to an extent i agree.  that being said, spells have been one of the things that seperate players all the way back to kunark.  i sold virtually everything i owned to get torpor back in the day, and even tho i wasn't in a high end raiding guild i got it, nevertheless.  while i agree that the vast majority of normal type spells should be available to everyone, especially if they're class defining, making all the spells drop too easily would be no fun or no challenge, either.  there has to be some sort of balance, etc.  <br />

Can I do things that a Time geared Shaman with the same spellbook has? No, of course not. I don't expect to. However, with that spellbook, I have the minimum tools needed to do what I need to do to group with other level 65's.<br />
<br />
have no arguments with this.  in my opinion its reasonable for every character to want their spells.  do they have some right just by buying the expansion to be given these spells?  no.  if they work to farm the cash to purchase them, hunt the spells down, etc., more power to them.  GoD spells were done really poorly, as there are shaman in the qvic+ guild on our server who don't even have daluda's mending, and my alt/retired shaman has had it forever.  PoP spells in my opinion were done about the best that they can be done, droppable scrolls really are one of the better ways.  somehow i doubt that sony is stupid enough to make an entire 5 levels worth of spells from OoW done like GoD, so hopefully this shouldn't be an issue.  <br />
<br />
i've always said, also, that spells are an entirely different issue with regards to melees, as well.  melee characters don't even have to worry about it, with very few exceptions, which is pretty badly thought out.  spells are what define the classes mostly, and making class defining spells like malo/torpor so difficult to get was a bad idea imo.  sure there should be some reward spells for the raider (ie ancients), but seriously no one shoudn't feel like a (shm, ench, nec, clr, etc.) if you're missing some class defining spells.  there were days when i was 60 in ToV where i was literally frowned upon for not having malo.  when my guild asked me why i didn't have it i replied sorry i paid everything i have for torpor, no money left for malo.  to this day there's still a spot in my spellbook for it heh.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">First, early on someone stated that GoD spells are only available to the raider.  I'm a  raider, and the GoD spells don't come easy to the raider. Like everyone else we have to farm the trials and pray.  And most raiders have little time to do that for hours on end, my time at least is usually spend on raids (where no spells drop).<br />
In regards to the old casual/raider argument.  One point most casuals like to forget that they still have lots of challenging content ahead.  There is plenty of stuff to do that will give you upgrades that is obsolete for the top end player.  And yes, you don't have to buy every expansion right when it comes out, you can wait half a year and pick it up at half price.  Unless naturally you want the &quot;special benefit&quot; (like new levels or AAs) that come with the expansion, and which will trivialize more content.  Then accept you're buying the expansion for that, and not for content fow which you're not ready yet.<br />
Every game has some form of levels that you have to pass through to reach the top, in EQ that usually means big mobs and their loot.  You can either find 50 friends and take them out now, or wait 2 years and take them out with a single group.<br />
There might be a few &quot;top end casuals&quot; who have finished all non-raid content.  This would be people that routinetly clear hard LDoN in an hour, and have all augments from KodTaz, Ferubi and the trials.  Those are truely screwed since they are excluded from Uqua and beyond.  For those I feel sorry.<br />
To all the others, there is plenty of ways out there to keep busy.  You want EP access via back doors? Ok, put in a quest that takes the same time it took the raiders to get into there, lets say 10 days played, with even experience between dying a lot and not much in the way of raid experience.  Or give &quot;flag&quot; points for hard LDoN wins, after 250 wins you can get into EP. Fine with me.  Just don't expect to get the &quot;reward&quot; without some form of grind, and showing you can play your toon the the max. EQ is a timesink, but that's what most players love about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">I don't mind raiders having better gear, what I mind is the massive gap in HOW much better the gear is. An LDON item with 80-100 hps on it takes forever to get and yet is nothing compared to a high level raid item with 240hps.<br />
<br />
It's not the fact that raid gear is better that is the problem, casuals can accept that, it's the size of the gap and how it is growing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">I can even live with the big gap in gear.  You CAN get by with lesser gear, it might just take some real playing skill.  However, if you are missing key spells, are you just plain SOL.  Take out Malo/Malos and try getting your job done.  How about Q/Torpor.  <br />
<br />
My MAIN and only beef is that these spells are nodrop.  I don't care if I have to farm PP until the end of time to afford the spells, they will eventually come down in price.  If they are nodrop from content that I will never see unless I raid, that I have a problem with.  <br />
<br />
Make the spells drop so once the raiders all have them, they will start to filter down to the non-raiders.  Raiders make some $$$ for their 'work' they have done and non-raiders get a chance at the spells.  Heck, you might even get lucky and a friendly raider might give you one of them.  <br />
<br />
The way it is now, I will never see a GoD spell.  Not one that I can forsee.  <br />
<br />
Let raiders have them first, but make a way for non-raiders to eventually get them.  Gear, that I can work my way towards once I have my new spells...see how this all balances out...raiders get it first and always have the best gear, non-raiders can eventually get it and then can work on bettering their gear.  It is all about the spells I think, gear, it will come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is also one point that top-end raiders tend to forget and that is that they sure arent doing raids when they feel like it - they do them as soon as humanly possible to be the first and sometimes even to prevent others from doing the same content.<br />
<br />
What on earth makes you think that just because casual players dont have any other choice than waiting a year or two to do some of the content you did when it was fresh and new that they should also pay the same penalties?<br />
<br />
But if some of the older highend stuff was made more easily accessible we all know that what would happen - twinks and twinks twinks from uberguilds would be duoing it just because they can.This might a great design in your perfect online game but it sure isnt in mine.</div></div><hr />

I don't know who this guy is, but it wasn't Brenlo (Alan Crosby).<br />
<br />
He's right in a way though - you don't need all your spells to do the job, they're just nice to have. I bet there's only a handful of shamans across all servers who have all their spells. I don't have any Ancient spells, I levelled up without the extra Luclin and LDoN spells, there are some spells I never even mem, and others which are a nice upgrade but the lesser version would still work if I didn't have the better one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">I don't think there isn't anyone who does not want to raid if they can.  Casual gamers may not be able to attend long flagging raids like saryrn or bert, and that could be the bottleneck.  Sometimes it is not the length of the raid, but rather the timing of it all.<br />
<br />
Not everyone can wait around and wait for a raid to start.  We all live in different timezones, have RL things to attend to, and our lives do not evolve around EQ.  For example, if Ican only play for 3 hours a night, starting at 10pm pst, then I might have already missed all the raids that started at 8pm est (or 5pm pst).<br />
<br />
Do I want to raid?  Yes.  Can I raid? No.  Do I want better gear or progression?  Yes.  What I am I stuck with? LDoN.  Am I in the wrong guild?  Maybe.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it looks like for me to progress, I need to revolve my life around EQ, even if it was just for the flagging.<br />
<br />
Do I think it's fair that I don't get my high end spells because of my play time?  Hell yes, especially when you discover that someone's BOT has a full spell book, and I don't.  So don't tell me that I can't get my spells because I'm not skilled enough, or don't spend enough time playing when bots and gimps are able to get stuff that are out of my reach.<br />

I guess you can go back and tell SOE that the current expansions will work just fine so they don't need to release any new ones.  I mean really, we should be happy with current content/spells and not spend any more $$$ on new expansions.  I mean why would I spend $$$ on stuff I can't get/don't need.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the only spells people don't have these days pre-GoD are the ancient ones.  Those are minor upgrades over other spells. If you(SOE) make spells that are large upgrades, or are completely new, impossible to get for a majority of your customer base, you aren't listening.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep business, make the spells droppable.  If you make them like the GoD spells that rarely drop and are no-drop, you WILL lose a large number of your customers.</div></div><hr />

I have read most of the thread.  I'd love to debate this idea with you, but I don't have time right now.<br />
<br />
I agree with you on points and disagree on others.  I'll give you a sort of bullet list of my opinions (mine, mind you, not always company policy)<br />
<br />
No, people should not be able to attain the same gear through easier paths (like it or not, group content is easier than raid content, you've given many reasons why it is easier when you state why you don't like it).<br />
<br />
Yes, there should be content for people to do that isn't raiding.  Luckily, we have a lot of that.<br />
<br />
If you don't like raiding but you do enjoy playing the game, then there is a lot of content to do with single groups.  If you've actually done all of that consider a new character.  I've enjoyed starting several characters, different viewpoints are nice.<br />
<br />
Some folks have said things like - people should be able to get similar gear (just make the graphics nicer for the raid people) without raiding.  I disagree in principle, as I've said before.  I also disagree that this would satisfy those people.  The day after such content was added they would be wondering why they don't also get the cool graphics.<br />
<br />
Any game system with progression will have an amount of have's and have-nots.  At just about any time in your progression you will be looking at people that have things that you can not attain at that time.  That changes as you progress and as the game matures.  Note that now players can take major Kunark dragons with a group.  That wasn't so when that expansion was put out.<br />
<br />
Stuff that was &quot;raid only&quot; becomes &quot;two groups&quot; and then becomes &quot;single group&quot; content.  That's what happens when you have progression.<br />
<br />
I'm just not going to debate the &quot;casual&quot; vs. &quot;uber&quot; thing here.  I do want to repeat that if you are a casual player and you spend so much of your time yearning for items or abilities that are out of your reach that you don't enjoy playing, then you're not a casual player.  A casual player plays in their free time to have some fun.<br />
<br />
Snoww, you have to understand that we do hear you.  We hear a lot of opinions, we read a lot of threads.  It's just not possible to build one game that everyone can play the way they want to.  We'd need a designer, a coder and an artist for every player.  We do our best to make a game that people like to play.  We do appreciate your feedback and we do read it.  But at some point we have to make decision about how things will work.  We want to make you happy just as much as we want to make everyone else happy.<br />
<br />
I have no snappy ending for this.  I certainly wrote more than I had planned - so I guess I'm staying late to get some work done :).  I just wanted you to know that we do understand your point.  On the team we'll have as many differing opinions about your ideas as were posted in this thread.<br />

Hello there,<br />
<br />
While Absor has his views of the game and spells, they are not the &quot;Vision&quot; of SOE and should not be taken as the direction of the development team.  I know Absor and I assure you that he was being sarcastic (his trade skill of choice).  As we all know, sarcasm does not always carry well in text.  <br />
<br />
While it may be true that you do not have to acquire every spell to play the game, we do understand that it is nice to have them.  For many players it is a goal to acquire them all.  I think you will see some changes to allow for easier acquisition of some spells in the very near future.<br />

Straight talk that verifies what I've been saying about this game for quite some time now. SOE has focused on EQ as a niche game for the raid player.  If you don't raid, forget about progression.  There is nothing for casuals any longer and there will be no new content for the casual player that even remotely approaches that of the raider.  I give Absor huge props for being honest and straightforward about SOE's mindset.<br />
<br />
Hey Absor, care to do a little research and give us at least a ballpark figure on what percentage of accounts serverwide are flagged for at least one elemental plane?  Enquiring minds want to know.<br />
<br />
Edit: Didn't see Absor's 2nd post after his first one, which even more proves my point.  I'm very happy that at least one person from SOE put in writing what we've known all along so there's no more confusion.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo,<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying to my post here.<br />
<br />
Frankly, given Alan's post on GU, and his further clarifying posts here, I simply don’t see any progression left to me. My shaman is 65 with all his level 65 spells. I have no chance of further upgrades without a good high level raiding guild. As I don’t desire to be in a guild, or to raid what is left to me in EQ?<br />
<br />
Alan's suggestion of starting an alt was... curious. I have done this, many times. I have 12 alts as a matter of fact, most in the 50's and 60's. They will have no progression left when they reach 65 either.<br />
<br />
As I have stated, I don’t want to leave EQ, I have greatly enjoyed the game from 1-65 and now it appears I'm done at that point. There are no other games I want to play on the market.<br />
<br />
Once I have completed my personal obligations to friends I have met in EQ, I will be ending my billing. I see no other option left to me. This saddens me greatly.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Fair enough Absor. In that staying late you have give people concrete awnsers to some things that we have been argueing about for a good three years now. I certainly do appreciate it. I hope others will as well. <br />
<br />
Of course it doesnt change my mind (Grins) And if you want to discuss at your leisure (Which it always will be) Drop me an e mail Or I can drop you one and we could argue some of the finer points of it with a virtual beer. <br />
<br />
Couple pointed questions for you though. <br />
<br />
Can you give any of us an idea of The EQ teams thoughts or feelings on the seperation that raider gear and smaller group gear has done to the game in general. And where is new content balanced at useing player power as a benchmark?<br />
<br />
Are classes that can cast spells Balanced on the assumption that they have thier spells in a reasonable time frame? And is content based against a level 65 shaman having quesiance? and torpor? How about when determining spell resistances on new spells do you take into account malos? <br />
<br />
In Kunark and velious I had attempted guardian wyrms some 168 times and never got Torpor Malo or to be honest any single spell drop useable by shaman. I borrowed the plat from a friend and bought my spell. I also at that time went to Traks lair and killed jumpy and so much more than I should have ever needed to do. <br />
<br />
Now on to the painful part of the post. Sorry. I am not normally a cut and paste kinda person. But this is a special occasion. So here goes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quote Absor-- If you don't like raiding but you do enjoy playing the game, then there is a lot of content to do with single groups. If you've actually done all of that consider a new character. I've enjoyed starting several characters, different viewpoints are nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have a level 65 shaman with 378ish AA Level 65 Enchanter with 140ish AA Level 65 shadowknight with 78ish aa and a level 60 thief with 1 aa and more other charecters that I could shake a dozen sticks at. And I have been through Over 5 years of this game at Every level of play. Lead guilds and sadly help disband a few as well. I have been a loyal customer for years. And now I am playing another companys game but spending more time arguing over your companys game because I still love what it was. But hate what it has become. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quote Absor--Any game system with progression will have an amount of have's and have-nots. At just about any time in your progression you will be looking at people that have things that you can not attain at that time. That changes as you progress and as the game matures. Note that now players can take major Kunark dragons with a group. That wasn't so when that expansion was put out.<br />
<br />
Stuff that was &quot;raid only&quot; becomes &quot;two groups&quot; and then becomes &quot;single group&quot; content. That's what happens when you have progression.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is progression through much larger increments of time than the lifespan of most games. And also through the purchase of additional expansions to enjoy content that is from previous expansions.  Yes that is the way it is. We both know this but you might certainly want to rethink that, because at the end of the day it is a carrot on an ever lengthing peice of stick. And people who start to see the treadmill is closer than the carrot tend to burn out rapidly. My opinion of course. When the Haves are so far beyond the have nots like this the have nots tend to become will nots. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Quote Absor--Some folks have said things like - people should be able to get similar gear (just make the graphics nicer for the raid people) without raiding. I disagree in principle, as I've said before. I also disagree that this would satisfy those people. The day after such content was added they would be wondering why they don't also get the cool graphics<br />
<br />
On this. Well my whole idea is that we seem to have to deal with no item at all, with no corrasponding power or content increases as it is. If it was simply a differance in cool graphics and aquisition of those larger scale Epic battles Then you would not have the vastly different power scales that EQ is currently sporting.  Telling someone you don't get the cool graphic because that is one of the rewards of raiding but after doing the small scale battles you can get the power equivilent without the really cool graphics would certainly be a bit more palatible than,  &quot;You don't raid. You can't get anything. Enjoy old content from 2 expansions ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
I am very sorry if I come off as angry. Sadly I am a little angry, much like when I get angry at the boneheaded things The Redskins do with Player choices and such. It is something I care about so I am a bit passionate about it. I don't personally blame you for what I percieve as faults in a game I loved Absor, but as the only point of feedback I can see that has any chance of actually being paid attention to I am kind of lumping this on your shoulders. <br />
<br />
You are not perfect and can't solve EQ's problems on your own. But you are an inside man, and you sure have more of a chance than any of us poor shmoes that play the game for entertainment. Do what you feel is needed to make the game great again. It is all I can ask. And if you succeed I will play again, and start telling people once again how much fun EQ can be. But as it is right now with the single minded focus on haves and have nots. And all the other arguements EQ is not worth the money to me. But still somehow commands a couple hours a day in thoughts and arguements somedays.<br />
<br />
I wish I could say keep up the good work, or you are doing a great job, but I don't know the details of your actual work schedule or what your job entails, but I for one am a dissatisfied customer of the direction EQ has gone since Velious, and while I own every expansion for two seperate accounts I have stopped playing a game I used to love out of disgust for where it is right now. Change it please. And if your being here is a change that stays and the discussions keep coming then there is certainly hope. Talk is always good. Even when people are at different sides of the argument.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Well, Blazz, I'm not constantly referring to raiders being all lazy -- I am pointing out how the constant glory I hear raiders giving themselves is often pretty far-fetched.  Since that outlook is said maybe 0.02% of the time whenever people talk about raiders versus casuals, and the opposite is said basically universally, it bears mentioning.  When raiders stop making blanket statements about how hard raiding is or how skilled you have to be, and especially using that as the basis to assert that raiders should not get just better gear than casuals but gear with 3x, 4x, 5x and more the hitpoints etc -- then I call bull---er, baloney sometimes.  Somebody has to.<br />
<br />
Like I already did reply to someone else, the opposite understanding is the one that's taken for granted as though it were received religion from the mouth of god himself.  It's hardly necessary for me to reiterate raider's praises for themselves when they've already put in years worth of effort on it, and the understanding that raiders are great, skillfull, hard-working players is pretty much the common one and taken completely for granted as it is.<br />
<br />
By the way, I've never had a &quot;Why raid&quot; rant, though I know you're referring to the post where I asked why people who are supposed to like raiding always have to ask why they're supposed to do what they are busy saying they LIKE doing.  My rants are more, &quot;Why ONLY raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
And I think it's poor game design when the answer remains, &quot;Because it's the only way to progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, also, Blazz, I've been in a pick-up raid organization for well over a year, and it's completely open.  We started from the bottom with people who didn't even have any ornate, and now are trying PoP gods -- we got Fennin twice, missed on Xegony.  There are indeed solutions that don't require being in a guild or raid organization that compels you to spend X hours per week.  But...we can't forget that those are still not the norm on all the servers.  Most guilds are very competitive, not cooperative, and most guilds and raiding organizations attempting much in the way of raiding at all absolutely require a certain number of hours per week, or that if you're online, you're raiding.  Your guild is an exception among raiding guilds; mine is not.  If you're going to get gear, it started out first as mere randoms, then added in merit sometimes or gear going toward the classes it was best for and now has moved on to DKP.  In all cases but randoming gear, which is pretty silly at an advanced level, if you want your crack at the loot, you had better show up, and show up plenty.<br />
<br />
There are theoretically alternatives, but not everyone has access to them.  So we can't fairly speak about people having access to your type of guild or my type of organization as if they did -- we don't know whether they do or don't.<br />
<br />
Most don't.<br />
<br />
And because of that, the issues most of those people address remain valid -- without really being a committed raider, they don't have substantial avenues for significant improvement, and the number of useful zones they ever get in many of the expansions they pay for is minimal, and has grown extremely slowly.  The expansions still remain geared toward other than the level 65 casual player to a very unbalanced extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">I have to admit I'm not fond of no-drop spells.  But I'm not very sympathetic to people who don't buy their spells either.  That's what I did for almost all my spells.  I wasn't lucky enough to have many drop, or wasn't in the position(or flagged right) to get most of my spells as drops.<br />
<br />
I earned them the other way you can earn them.  I tradeskilled from virtually no plat at all, slowly but surely, through baking and brewing and then pottery and then smithing, with some SoW potions thrown in, to slowly build up a plat base.  I camped stuff by myself, with a friend or two, and built up organized &quot;camping associations&quot; with an bunch of people where whoever was on that day of the missing classes would meet regularly and camp stuff, then all split the money from the stuff we all sold.  Worked like gangbusters because EVERYONE got paid, not just one guy who did no more work than anybody else getting rich while all the others got jack for all their hours of work.  It's a model that requires trust, but it's sooo much better than rolling and leaving most people feel used and broke while others hit the lottery.  You knew you were going to get PAID.<br />
<br />
I did this from Kunark through PoP, over and over again, starting from zero over and over again too.<br />
<br />
I also took time whenever I could, when a new expansion came out, to try to find out where the phat lewt zones were before they got nerfed.  I was striking out in Gates, but then recently spent some time in the arena in Gates and made 600k in a week.<br />
<br />
That spells should be difficult to get, I'm not in agreement with, unless they make melee disciplines first just as important and secondly make them droppable on the same loot tables as caster spells.  And I still think it's not a good idea.  <br />
<br />
That people at level 65 in this game can't scrape together 30 or 40k -- I understand the misery of accumulating plat, but really, I've been so broke in this game and come back from zero with no connections to help out so many times, from lower levels even, that my sympathy is very limited.  Heck, you can make $1,500 an hour in the twilight sea, and $1k an hour just hunting spider silks in East Karana.  And that's not really farming tough stuff; that's killing trivial stuff.  You can go camp the piggy in tactics for drops that can still sell, sometimes for 5k or twice that on my server.  You can very often buy hides and spiderling silk in the bazaar, simply combine them(very low tailoring skill), and then auction off the leather padding or just put it on a bazaar mule -- or ask to put it on a friend's bazaar mule and have him sell it for you.  <br />
<br />
Money can be annoying to get, sometimes risky to get, often boring to get, often time consuming to get, but it is not out of reach for a level 65 character, especially one who can solo greenies and light blues as easily as we can.<br />
<br />
So as long as we're talking about spells, I'm all for having them not be such a pain to get; but with the existing system of them being droppable, you can get all the important ones indirectly, just by making some plat.  It isn't all that hard to do at 65; it's pretty darn easy really.  And those spells are cheaper than ever.  I bought almost all mine when they were at top dollar, every time.  Sometimes you have to do what it takes to get what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">&quot;Yes, there should be content for people to do that isn't raiding. Luckily, we have a lot of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like what, LDON?  Get real.  You owe it to yourself even more than you do to us, Alan.  And to the game and its future.<br />
<br />
I'm interested who on earth you think would swallow that claptrap.  You sure seem to have a low opinion of the intelligence of your customers.  <br />
<br />
It's nice to see straight from the horse's mouth, though.  I'd say without question your attitude and level of understanding represent where the company is and is going.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just not possible to build one game that everyone can play the way they want to. We'd need a designer, a coder and an artist for every player.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, and that's a ridiculous assertion.  You just need designers for more than ONE type of game and game progression -- the raid or die game.  Right now even your raid designers aren't doing very well, and there is little else in the game.  So whadda ya got?  It has become a pure raiding game.  But EQ did not start out that way.  The past wasn't prelude before -- quite the opposite, this did NOT start out as a raid-or-die game.  It doesn't have to be one now or in the future either.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Start over if you don't like it,&quot; to paraphrase, has got to be one of the more glib and silly answers I've ever seen.  If you don't like it, why would you do it twice?  <br />
<br />
How about you just accept the responsibility of making it a more complete experience the FIRST time around instead of pushing the blame off on your customers?<br />
<br />
You want to have your cake and eat it too -- make a game that's a pure raiding game and at the same time rattle off some glib claptrap to everyone else that you hope they'll continue to swallow so that THEY will continue to pay for a game that basically couldn't care less about them and hasn't for a very long time with the sole exception of LDON, a limited outlet at best.  It's not much of an effort to deal with things as they stand, unless by that you understand that dealing with things as they stand means that losing customers is a good thing, and gaining fewer in the future than you ever have before will be a good thing too, as this game sinks further and further into the irrelevancy of a niche game -- which would partner nicely with the irrelevancy of your responses.  I'm put in mind of Emperor Nero sawing away on his fiddle while Rome burned.<br />
<br />
I already edited it for civilness, Gloriana.  But I very strongly disagree with the man's attitudes, and there's no way to make that perfectly pretty or affirmative.  No curse words were harmed in the composition of this post, but mincing words any further would have just compromised or eliminated their meaning.  And though I think Absor will turn a deaf ear to them in all due haste, it's important that he not feel quite so comfortable or unassailed in his brushing off some of our issues as it seems to me he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">BlargX, that is assuming there are spells being sold. We had a pretty interesting experience on EMarr with Necro rune spells in the early days of POP. The top guilds on the servers refused to sell any necro spells since the necros didn't want any solo competition in CoD. You could have saved up a bazillion plat and been SOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">But eventually you have a chance of getting them.  Even if everyone is waiting in the bazaar for one to come available, you have a chance.  If they put them in content that non-raiders can't get to and they are no-drop, then the casual gamer will be forever SOL.  That is all I ask, make the spells droppable and on difficult/moderately difficult mobs.  That way the raiders can make out by being able to kill these mobs and get the spells and later get profit and the non-raiders can get the spells when the trickle down.  <br />
<br />
Or...SOE could use their heads a little and make the spells available in a variety of ways.  Maybe make them 50k per at a vendor somewhere.  So people that want to farm..farm.  Make them (maybe 66-68) come from rune turn-ins.  The Glyphed only covers 65 now.  You could easily make a 2-3 level spread that these runes can be used for.  And also have the spells drop directly.  That way you give chances for a wide variety of folks.<br />
<br />
The gear, whatever they want, that is something I want to work towards with my new spells/levels.  <br />
<br />
I don't imagine anyone saying..oh, you only have the LDON chain not Time chain gear, no group for you.  However, I can see them saying 'oh, you don't have xxxx, class defining spell, no group for you'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Absor, people understand your point.<br />
<br />
What seems to be eluding you is the degree of separation - a gulf that widens too much.<br />
<br />
There is a primal scream of frustration from people who feel they are overly limited on progression - and it doesn't have to be that way.  <br />
<br />
They are right, and you should do a better job getting that message.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">You don't need all your spells to be effective in groups or on raids.  When I started raiding with my current guild, I was the only shaman without Focus of the Seventh.  I did just fine and I was eventually given the spells by my guild.  All PoP spells can be purchased in bazaar now and rune MQs go for under 10k now on my server.  You can make enough money through ldon drops to buy anything you need if you keep at it.  RGC from takish for 800 points nets 40k easily on my server.<br />
<br />
The 2 really worthwhile GoD spells are easily obtainable by a decent group in the sewers.  Breath of Trushar is nice, but it's not a huge game-breaking upgrade.  Chaotic Pain is a nice upgrade, but it's not as essential as you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">Glori, I didn't get all my spells right away either.  And I'm not saying that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
But...I did get them eventually.<br />
<br />
It was much harder back when torpor and malo were godly.  I spent six months auctioning every day trying to buy torpor for ever-increasing amounts of money.  Finally I paid 50k and a fungi tunic for it.  And that's money I made camping velious junk and spider silks and such.  That money took a LONG time to make.<br />
<br />
The PoP spells were bad too, but once torpor was out of the bag, guilds didn't horde quiessence as much as they horded torpor, and eventually it worked its way out into the marketplace.  Most spells eventually have become fairly available if you really look for them regularly.<br />
<br />
I'm not endorsing having to pay a lot of money for spells, just saying that money is attainable, if you have to pay.  I constantly bump into newer players of the game who complain that they're broke, and it makes me think, well, why don't you go get some money?  Not because I'm a glib smart aleck putz, but because that's exactly what I do in the game.  But they'd rather go get some AA instead, or start another twink or something.  Which is all fine, but really, nobody's just going to throw bags of gold in your face for you.  I have no idea how so many EQ players I bump into can complain all the time how broke they are when they never spend any time even trying to earn money.  When I want plat, I don't just wish for it -- I go out and work my butt off for it. <br />
<br />
You know where I really hear this a ton? From people in Plane of Water who don't have fishbone earrings.  It's hilarious watching them drown.  Usually they drown before you can even target them and get a heal off, but there's little temptation to get a heal off anyway.  &quot;But fishbone earrings cost 4k!&quot;, they say.  Yeesh!  Unbelievable that a level 65, elemental-flagged, can come to 10 POW raids in a row without a fishbone earring because in all that time he couldn't (he WOULDN'T!) make a lousy 4k.  Or camp the damn thing himself.  Or go to The Grey and get the free EB neck.  Unbelievable.  I say, let 'em drown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Any game system with progression will have an amount of have's and have-nots.  At just about any time in your progression you will be looking at people that have things that you can not attain at that time.  <br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />
I have no problem with different progressions for different people.  When I get to the point where I've done the single-group content I want to see, I'll join a raiding guild.  I'll most likely do so beforehand.<br />
<br />
I also have no problem with itemization progression.  There are two fairly distinct progressions of items in the game: the &quot;casual&quot; progression and the &quot;raider&quot; progression.  The two paths are divergent and seem to be so out of necessity.  The high-end raiding toons need vastly superior gear to handle the vastly more difficult content.  The casual toons don't hit content of that magnitude and so don't need that gear.  As EQ as a game has progressed, that divergence has become more pronounced, but it has always been there.  I don't have a big problem with it because rarely am I in a situation where my gear is vastly inferior to what I need, as is the case for most players not engaged in high-end content.<br />
<br />
My problem, as I said before, is spells.  The concept introduced in Kunark and tweaked in PoP was to make some spells available only through encounters.  Here's the issue:<br />
<br />
Virtually all Kunark content is generally available to anyone, even what was at the time, high-end content (VS, Trakanon, etc.)  As a result, the casual player has had the spells that drop from those areas become available to him because of the gradual increase in power of all gear.  Velious and Luclin are generally the same, each had it's high-end keyed dungeon, but most other content was available to everyone, including mobs that dropped high-end spells (barring some Ancient stuff).<br />
<br />
Enter PoP.  No longer is it a keyed dungeon, it's an entirely keyed expansion.  Further, the stuff hiding behind those keyed doors is several orders of magnitude harder than comparable encounters in previous expansions.  As I said before, that is the result of the divergence in progressions between casual and raider play-styles.  <br />
<br />
But now, standard spell progression is thrown for a loop.  For the first time, high-level (not high-end) spells are tied to generally inaccessible content.  What about Fo7 warrants it only dropping runes in Tier 4+ (or Tier 3 named) when FoSoul can be gotten in Tier 1 from random spawns?  Nothing about Fo7 (or BoS or Quiessence or Malos for that matter) warrants it being tied to extreme high-end content.  By extreme, I mean content that will not likely ever be on the casual player's progression.  The mobs that drop runes are not the kind of mobs that will be 2-3 group content like Trakanon is (for casuals, 1 groupable for EP+).  It took several expansions to get casual players to where they are relative to Trakanon or Halls of Testing.  PoP content is many orders of magnitude beyond that.<br />
<br />
I agree that one doesn't NEED all of their respective classes spells.  But at the same time, there is nothing about level 65 spells that warrants the effort required to get them.  These spells are not of the same caliber as Time's Antithesis or Shinai of the Ancients or Raex Chestplate of Destruction.  They don't even stack up to a Windblade, but many cost just as much:<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh -- essentially a convenience spell.  it adds nothing to Focus of Soul other than a group cast.  about 50k on Prexus.<br />
Blood of Saryrn -- shamans have been (justifiably) complaining plenty about the uselessness of Poison DoTs.  30-50k on Prexus<br />
Malos -- -10 more to resists over Malo.  a straight-line upgrade, and relatively minor at that.  15-20k on Prexus<br />
Quiessence -- The only one of the bunch that I really would like, but still not so much better than Torpor that it warrants being a raider exclusive.  Anywhere from 40-80k on Prexus<br />
Ferine Avatar -- Really the only one that seems more appropriate for the raiding crew, despite its useless stat increases (except atk) for that group of folks.  No idea on the price; I've never looked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Yes, there should be content for people to do that isn't raiding.  Luckily, we have a lot of that.<br />
<br />
This ranks right up there with the now legendary &quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot; quote.  Care to list what zones a L65 player has available that doesn't raid and wants to progress?<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that now players can take major Kunark dragons with a group.  <br />
<br />
How many Kunark dragons hide behind flagged content requiring a raid force to unlock?<br />
<br />
Stuff that was &quot;raid only&quot; becomes &quot;two groups&quot; and then becomes &quot;single group&quot; content.  That's what happens when you have progression.<br />
<br />
Let me know when a non-raid player can get into Sol Ro to go after ornate by working their way there with single group encounters with their friends.  And that's not even tier 4...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just not going to debate the &quot;casual&quot; vs. &quot;uber&quot; thing here.<br />
You posted the original quote, like it or not you started the debate in this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I do want to repeat that if you are a casual player and you spend so much of your time yearning for items or abilities that are out of your reach that you don't enjoy playing, then you're not a casual player.  A casual player plays in their free time to have some fun.<br />
Why does wanting to progress and improve your character mean you're not casual?  If you don't like the definition of casual, substitude &quot;non-raider&quot;.  A non-raider plays to have fun but that doesn't mean they don't want to improve their character, see new zones and progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just not possible to build one game that everyone can play the way they want to.  We'd need a designer, a coder and an artist for every player.<br />
Yet up until PoP you had already created this game before abandoning it for EverRaid or FlagQuest.  It's only post-PoP that this issue has come to a head.  Flagged content was an insanely bad decision- artificial segregation of the playerbase in a social multiplayer game has to be one of the worst design decisions in MMORPG history.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I'll again thank you for taking the time to post here and clarify your position so there's no illusion for those of us unable or unwilling to make raiding our sole playstyle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly.  the original point of this post was not a petty battle between those who like to raid and those who don't, but a discussion about spells and their availability to the average person.  while many who don't want to raid are bitter that they don't have the gear/progression available to raiders, there are plenty of other ways to go about progression.  getting flagged thru pickup raids is not very difficult on most servers, and then, much like a key quest, you're done and you don't ever have to do it again.  no one likes the flagging/reflagging process, just like not a lot of people liked doing the veeshan's peak key (damn you pained soul, 15 hours).  but we did them, moved on, and were rewarded.  <br />
<br />
while there are certain situations where u do need incredibly well geared people, most of them are at the high end of raiding expansions.  most normal people in the game don't discriminate based on gear.  zone access does it for them.  i haven't grouped outside of the elemental planes or better in months, is it because i have hate or discrimination for the casual person that exps in BoT?  no, it's because i exp in the zones that provide the best exp/rewards.  as for the raid arguments, honestly, if it pains you so much to raid, just do pickups, get it done, and move on, the flags ARE out there for you to get, without a raiding guild even.  i won't refer you to my server's pickup raid a third time, but i'm just saying its out there.  <br />
<br />
i'm all for droppable spells that everyone can acquire.  i hated how tough torpor/malo were to find, and that it seperated people out.  but that only made it that much better when i finally got them.  by spells at least being droppable, especially the class defining ones, it does level the playing field at least to that extent, and i largely agree with the vast majority of what m970456 has posted.  never liked the way GoD spells were done, and i really don't think many others did either heh.  as for the uber v. casual battle, i think absor made a great point with:<br />

<br />
playing many hours a week and not raiding doesn't make you casual heh.  we can make all the comparisons we want about the equality of raiders vs. non raiders, but the bottom line is no one is casual about this game if you want the best stuff.  if you're willing to put in the hours and want equivilent stuff to raid gear you're definately not a casual player.  i would agree with absor's point above wholeheartedly.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">I think one of the problems here is the use of the terms casual and raider. I see it more of a raider vs. non-raider problem. I am willing to put the time into a game to get some place, BUT I cant or wont do it raiding. There are just to many problems with it for me.<br />
<br />
As I read this post I think many of the &quot;casual&quot; people are not saying that they want an easy road, they just want a road. And for the many that say there is a path we are just not chosing to take it. There are MANY of us that choose not to take it, with out us, i.e. if everyone accepted that raiding was the only path and went that way, can you immagine the back log of people waiting to hit raid targets. With us gone and only raiders left things would not be so hot for raiders either. We all just need to realise that there is merit in each path.<br />
<br />
In my perfect game, I could log on for an hour and acheive something. I could work towards items that are considerd good,by anyone,an hour or two at a time. In the end I dont mind playin a game alot to get what I want, but I want to see that I am progressing there. LDON answered  alot of this for me, But as it stands now it appears to be being fazed out. Look at bloodlink, apparantly drops like candy but dwarfs anything available to a non-raider.<br />
<br />
-added this: I would love it if many of the games spells and focuses were also available as aa's- I could always be workin to what I want then-just countin on gettin aa's a little faster in Oow though- as a newer player this game is freaky daunting as it is. : )<br />
<br />
In the end to me eq. is a niche game IF you like raiding THIS is the game for you. I am just waiting for the game now that is half as good as this that reads, IF you like small group progression THIS is the game for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">As most have figured out, these are two distince debates.<br />
<br />
Spells and Gear.  <br />
<br />
I think ALL people should have access to the spells, given enough time (ldon), PP (farming) or Raiding (dropped).<br />
<br />
Gear, the elementals can have better gear until I get to the elementals in my own time.  You can overcome lack of gear with playing skill with most classes. You can't overcome a spell that isn't in your spellbook and the content is tailored with the assumption that you DO have it.  <br />

If they don't make spells droppable, then the people that aren't flagged now will not be flagged next month, or the month after that.  With no new tools, and without joining a raiding guild, people will have no better chance to get flagged and get better gear tomorrow than they have today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While Absor has his views of the game and spells, they are not the &quot;Vision&quot; of SOE and should not be taken as the direction of the development team.  I know Absor and I assure you that he was being sarcastic (his trade skill of choice).  As we all know, sarcasm does not always carry well in text.  <br />
<br />
While it may be true that you do not have to acquire every spell to play the game, we do understand that it is nice to have them.  For many players it is a goal to acquire them all.  I think you will see some changes to allow for easier acquisition of some spells in the very near future.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">OK this may sound offensive to some,  but for what purpose do casual players want raid uberloot if they don't raid ? Raid loot gets better and better becouse raids face content they can't do without that kind of gear. Someone casual who only plays for fun surely doesnt need EP/Time/GoD raidloot for below EP 1 group content. <br />
<br />
Eq has been centered around raiding sadly and at this point there really is no need for someone not progressing to get that kind of gear withour raiding.<br />
<br />
That does not mean i don't want to see more 1 group or solo content but sadly at this moment if you don't raid you DON'T NEED that kind of gear, not including class defining spells cush as canni wich should be available trough alternative ways.<br />

Still care to opine that SOE will unlock Sol Ro and the EP's to the casual player based on the responses above?<br />
<br />
If anything Iz, I believe it more firmly now than I ever did. I think he made it PRETTY CLEAR that progression trivializes events, and that its a given that content that USED to require a raid is now doable by 1-2 groups. What content could he be refferring to in PoP? How about Sol Ro Minis. How about General Druav or the Birds in Fire. Heck how about Sol Ro himself. Gonna bet he will be 2-grouped by level 70s fairly easily, myself. In any event, I think that they WILL open these places because they KNOW that &quot;non-raiders&quot;need something to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do wanna point out what I think is one of the most important things he said about SOEs &quot;attitude&quot; here, Iz, and it applies DIRECTLY to you, Snow, Blarg and a few other &quot;casual players&quot; here.<br />
<br />
. . . if you are a casual player and you spend so much of your time yearning for items or abilities that are out of your reach that you don't enjoy playing, then you're not a casual player.  A casual player plays in their free time to have some fun.<br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />
Talk about Nail, Hammer, Head. You keep quoting your numbers to me Iz, like you are some kind of &quot;average casual player&quot;, yet, by your own admission in other threads, you play FAR more than I do, and I am a &quot;raider&quot;. The problem here is the labels we are using to define the player-base. Another problem is that the HARDCORE-NONRAIDERS are GOING to chew up their portion of the content TOO FAST for SOE to keep up, just like the HARDCORE-RAIDER chews up the Raid content. <br />
<br />
Some folks, like me, and like the 250 other people in my guild, and like the 2K other peoiple on my server in guild 5-15 on the &quot;food chain&quot; like to take FULL advantage of EVERY aspect of this game. Non-raiders, however, do not. They have CHOSEN not to play a portion of this game. They have CHOSEN not to raid. I don't get it. You made the choice, but you still want it all?<br />
<br />
Do you think people ENJOY farm-status raiding? Of course not, but its a necessary evil, a price the Raider pays for advancement. Do you hear us bitching because Fennin Ro didnt drop a nice poker for every rogue there, and a nice BP for every monk, and chain legs for every Ranger and Shaman? Took 70 people well over an hour and 2 of them got 1 thing each man. Lets do THIS math, eh? How many man hours will it take to get a guild with 100 active members 1 item apiece off each EP god? The numbers are staggering. <br />
<br />
I truly feel sorry for some of you. You cannot see the forest because the trees are in your way. The grains of sand are invisible, because that beach is TOO big. The fact that you play 20+ hours a week DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO ANYTHING. I keep hearing &quot;no content left for us, whaaaaaa&quot;. Hows Ferubi Iz? Hows Vexd trial spell farming going? <br />

Sorry that in your 20 hours a week of playing for 4+ years you burned out all the content, except the stuff you refuse to buy, of course. Hey guess what, theres a TON of content left. Except its mostly Raid content. Now, I am SURE you feel that SOE ONLY makes Raid content. I mean, LDoN was certainly a Raid Expansion. Gates Trials must take 50 people!! There probably isnt a SINGLE one group mob in ALL of PoP outside of Sol Ro that drops Runes or Ornate (oh, except that time I duoed the Armorer in Tactics and he dropped a Rune, and Ornate Vambs, and a Red Halo thingy, hes much too hard though).<br />
<br />
Bring on the negative bumps, I will be back to one greeen soon enough. I dont F-ING care. EQ is a game, it has almost ALWAYS been the same. You know what I LIKE about the flag system? You dont have ass_tard_03 training a buttload of spiders on you while your trying to set up for Nagafen.</div></div><hr />

You say SOE will open up SolRo+ in your first paragraph then spend the rest of your last post bashing casuals and saying in essence &quot;too bad if you don't want to raid, you will get nothing by your own choice&quot;.  Priceless.<br />

I'm perfectly content to change the labels to raider vs. non-raider if the word casual offends you, as I stated earlier.  And since you insist on putting words in my mouth, care to quote me where I said I play 20 hours a week?  I haven't had that kind of time to devote to a game in years.  Like your insults on &quot;you want Time gear off fire beetles&quot;, you will ignore my request for a quote and continue to use insults in place of rational logic as your argument cannot depend on cogent facts to make its case.<br />
<br />
<br />

Quote me, please, so that I can address this specifically.  I give you that courtesy before I use your words.  Or is it because you can't?  And my EQ playtime now consists of the time it takes to knock out a post here so it's doubtful what relevance it has anyways.  <br />
<br />
The issue isn't the number of hours a player puts in, but the playstyle that determines if those hours will result in any progression.  There is one and only one playstyle that results in the best rewards for equal time spent.<br />
<br />
To take this even further, does it even matter from a financial standpoint how you classify a non-raider?  Does their monthly fee mean less than that of a raider?  Apparently from SOE's standpoint it does.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
OR DON'T<br />
<br />
You're merely restating SOE's position that this is now EverRaid, a niche game catering to those willing and able to commit to one and only one playstyle: raiding.  I have chosen &quot;DON'T&quot; as I feel like a whore subsidizing someone else's enjoyment at my expense.  I would be a total hypocrite at this point if I went out and bought Gates+ after my public stance on flagged content (Gates has 10/20 zones locked out of the box).<br />
<br />
Enjoy Gates and all the great expansions to come.  SOE is doing a very good job at ensuring that the message is getting out that the non-raid player is not wanted now or (by extension) in EQ2.  Their honesty, at least, is refreshing.</div></div><hr />

Wrong Iz, I pointed out that Sol Ro will be consideredtrivial content soon enough, even the GOD himself. This, in and of itself, is one reason I think they will open up the zone. <br />
<br />
I cant find the thread where you mentioned how much you play, but it was DEFINITELY in the a fairly large number, more than my basic 10 hours a week. I will continue to search.<br />
<br />
What I think you are failing to appriciate, here, Iz, is that EQ is a game with a TON of content. Some of it is solo. Some is group. Some is raid. Some is quest. Some is tradeskill. Some is farming/camping. Are you REALLY gonna sit here and tell me you have been playing a game for 4+ years that has NO content for you? This is the part of your arguements that pisses me off the most. Fact is you have BURNED OUT your content, and I am truly sorry for that. You played PoP for 2 years, dindt you? Despite the flag thing? Why in god's name did you play Luclin at ALL? <br />
<br />
You have chosen to only take advantage of HALF of the game, then bitch and moan because there isnt more for you to do. Sorry, I am not buying it, no way no how. Plenty for you to do in this game still Iz. Tons in fact. A whole seperate world of a game for you to do. How you managed to get 4+ years of 10 hours a week (better estimate?) out of the game as a &quot;non-raider&quot; is totally beyond me, to be honest. You should have been gone LONG ago, your chosen path burned up and dead-ended. <br />
<br />
I actually understand your bitterness more. But the forest is there Iz. There is single group content in Gates. A lot of it. You wil be able to get to KT as a single group of friends easily when OoW comes out and the level-limit goes to 70. <br />

And Kinda hard to get to Sol Ro minis to one group them when you have to do every single raid in lower teir pop to get there first. Lets see you one group Arienn Dar with Bazzar/ LDON folks. And Mith Marr. And the Torment hellhole. Go Go Manatek Bhemoth Single group Run!.. Charge.<br />
<br />
Yes we get the fact that raiding is the only way.. Hence My not playing anymore.  But your 10 hour a week raid schedule nets you far more advancement potintal than a 40 hour a week Non raider. And as you gear up if you played more you would ahve an easier time with any of the non raiders content Due to your ten hour a week schedule. <br />
<br />
Raiders are over rewarded. They get Content. Shiney new graphics And the best loot in the game. All because they choose to travel in packs. And have the time to do so. <br />

Imo, I think it is definitely viable equipment can be on par that of nonraider and raiders. Just by labelling equipment that drops on raids with +raid bonuses. Imagine, if the raiding content was dragon based. And that rogues loot a weapon with + to red dragon dmg,  or a +40 atk raid bonus, Along with this could be a raid advancement system. Raid mobs give raid exp. The raid exp fills the raid advancement pool. Then could have special raid abilities.( Shaman could be given a unique raid ability here without overpowering them in group content.)<br />
By going this it would enrich both raid and group progression without altering each other's games, all is needed then is a bit of TLC in each game; group or raid.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it you are the one that has the OPTION of choosing to raid to progress in EQ. I have a job thats not always 9-5 so that alone prevents me from regularily signing up for raids. Good for you that you can plan your life around EQ but I dont have that &quot;luxury&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you think people ENJOY farm-status raiding? Of course not, but its a necessary evil, a price the Raider pays for advancement.

This isnt bitching? You say you are regularily forced to do something you dont enjoy - in a game - that you pay to play nontheless.<br />
<br />
The fact that you play 20+ hours a week DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU TO ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
Gotta agree with you on this. This is definately the way the game is set up at the moment. What some of the arguments on this board is about is whether this is still acceptable or not. If EQ continues to be like this either because SOE refuse to change anything or because it is technically impossible for them them I am very sure that a large portion of customers will leave.<br />
<br />
Its obvious that a lot of SOE's current problems stem from the fact that anyone (raiders and casuals) can make it to 65 in EQ. Some might do it faster than others but everyone can. So you end up with large numbers of max level players but because of the current design of the game only a tiny percentage of them will be able to much else than LDoN to progress from there. And large parts of PoP and GoD are completely off limits to them. Therefore its also obvious that SOE desparately seeking to keep all those stagnated players playing decided to raise the max level to 70 because most people think they will be able to reach that. This is probably not the best solution in the long run but its certainly the one that SOE can &quot;test&quot; and implement the fastest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>GoSpeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">No, people should not be able to attain the same gear through easier paths (like it or not, group content is easier than raid content, you've given many reasons why it is easier when you state why you don't like it).<br />
<br />
Yes, there should be content for people to do that isn't raiding.  Luckily, we have a lot of that.<br />
<br />
If you don't like raiding but you do enjoy playing the game, then there is a lot of content to do with single groups.  If you've actually done all of that consider a new character.  I've enjoyed starting several characters, different viewpoints are nice.<br />
<br />
Some folks have said things like - people should be able to get similar gear (just make the graphics nicer for the raid people) without raiding.  I disagree in principle, as I've said before.  I also disagree that this would satisfy those people.  The day after such content was added they would be wondering why they don't also get the cool graphics.<br />
<br />
Any game system with progression will have an amount of have's and have-nots.  At just about any time in your progression you will be looking at people that have things that you can not attain at that time.  That changes as you progress and as the game matures.  Note that now players can take major Kunark dragons with a group.  That wasn't so when that expansion was put out.<br />
<br />
Stuff that was &quot;raid only&quot; becomes &quot;two groups&quot; and then becomes &quot;single group&quot; content.  That's what happens when you have progression.<br />
<br />
The comparsion with the Kunark dragons won't work. This will not happen with the Ele planes or PoT and some such since you have those flagging crap.<br />
<br />
There should be other paths available to get top gear without joining &quot;uber raid guild 0815&quot;. LDoN was a step in the right direction but is still not good enough and needs some tweaking. <br />
<br />
Of course, If SOE decides that non-uber guild raiders don't deserve nice equipment, as it sounds from Absor, so be it, it's their choice, they'll also have to live with the consequences. We will see if the monthly fee of the uber guild members will pay all their bills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Honestly, I am going to TRY and make this my last post on this topic, because most of the time, I feel as though I am running head-first into a brick wall.<br />
<br />
Its gonna be long though, sorry. Anyway, on to the quotes . . .<br />
The way I see it you are the one that has the OPTION of choosing to raid to progress in EQ. I have a job thats not always 9-5 so that alone prevents me from regularily signing up for raids. Good for you that you can plan your life around EQ but I dont have that &quot;luxury&quot;.<br />
Tough. I feel for you. I am currently disabled, and dont work. However, I have 3 kids, a wife, 3 cats, a dog, 2 fish, a bird, a frog, and a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach that I take care of. Thats my full time job. You rarely see me online between 3 pm and 9 pm, because thats family time. During the day, I spend HUGE amounts of time soloing or camping stuff, so I can take care of my home. I play EQ as a hobby, not a lifestyle. I adjust my EQ schedule into my RL. Why cant you? 9-5 is 8 hours of a day. Lets say you sleep 7. That leaves you 9 hours for your &quot;hobbies&quot;. Kids? Cool, fantastic, I completely respect that you cannot play certain times because of family concerns, but they go to bed, yes? <br />
<br />
Find a guild that raids in the time-slot YOU are available. Or start one. Some people have to actually BE the BALL in order to progress. Other than that, I don't know what you want. Lets see, you cant play as much as hard_core_999 but you want the same rewards? Diablo 2 is your game, not Everquest. <br />
::snip my quote::<br />
This isnt bitching? You say you are regularily forced to do something you dont enjoy - in a game - that you pay to play nontheless.<br />
Yes. Thats life. I make adjustments in order to satisfy the many. My friends like gear too, so I farm. I like to earn points to buy my gear, so I farm. You never did something in a game that you didnt enjoy? Hell, I think I can apply examples to almost every game I have ever played, from Baldurs Gate to Alpha Centuri, there are parts of every game that are tedious and not thoroughly enjoyable. Hopefully, there are other parts that make all that worthwhile. If there wasn't, I would probably not play.<br />
::snip my quote::<br />
Gotta agree with you on this. This is definately the way the game is set up at the moment. What some of the arguments on this board is about is whether this is still acceptable or not.<br />
Acceptable to whom? I hear a lot of people screaming about the lack of single-group content. I hear a lot of people claiming that the &quot;casual&quot; player is the bulk of EQs player-base. I would put it to you, here and now, sir, that the Casual player IS the bulk of their player base, but those AREN'T the people complaining. The people who are complaining are the hardcore non-raiders who simply do not like to raid. They choose NOT to play that portion of the game, yet they play FAR too much &quot;single group&quot; content and therefore burn it out. Sorry. Guess what. The top end of the Raiding crowd tends to burn through Raid content pretty fast too. The number one reason Uber players leave for a while is probably boredom from having &quot;done&quot; everything. Most of the people complaining here are EXACTLY like that, except they are playing the differnt portions of the game. <br />
And large parts of PoP and GoD are completely off limits to them. Therefore its also obvious that SOE desparately seeking to keep all those stagnated players playing decided to raise the max level to 70 because most people think they will be able to reach that. This is probably not the best solution in the long run but its certainly the one that SOE can &quot;test&quot; and implement the fastest.<br />
How far are you in Gates? Granted, its not the best expansion SOE released. They had some serious logistical problems and I think they messed up the way it was all handled, but its what we have at the moment. Farmed any gear or spells? You CAN do Vexd and Tipt. You CAN do Ikky and get flagged for KT. Once there the gear dropping is equal too, and even superior is come cases, to EP gear. And, HERES THE KICKER, its ONE GROUPABLE. Hey guess what though. Its hard. Its difficult. Its a long run. Its not convientient. There are no graveyards. Its a pain to get there. Etc Etc Etc Etc Etc. BUT ITS THERE. And there is NO reason to think that once they actually get OoW on the shelf, and fix the stuff thats broken in both, that the end result will be WORSE for the casual player. Cripes man, I agree that PoP needs to be opened up, so guys like you can go get FT3 belts and 100 hp/mana cloaks and Sharkspines in the EPs, all off one-groupable stuff. If you dont wanna wait for them to open up (or dont think they ever will, like Iz) then play something else. But STOP TRYING TO FIX STUFF THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT THINK IS BROKEN.<br />
<br />
Next guy. <br />
I should not be forced to buy an expansion to enjoy the previous 2 expansions. All that means is the content being delivered is not for me. <br />
<br />
And Kinda hard to get to Sol Ro minis to one group them when you have to do every single raid in lower teir pop to get there first. Lets see you one group Arienn Dar with Bazzar/ LDON folks. And Mith Marr. And the Torment hellhole. Go Go Manatek Bhemoth Single group Run!.. Charge.<br />
<br />
Yes we get the fact that raiding is the only way.. Hence My not playing anymore.  But your 10 hour a week raid schedule nets you far more advancement potintal than a 40 hour a week Non raider. And as you gear up if you played more you would ahve an easier time with any of the non raiders content Due to your ten hour a week schedule. <br />

Snoww Brokenhammer Retired Bashy Bear E marr<br />
Snow, come on. I am refferring to a time in the future that I forsee, a time when Sol Ro and the Eps are opened to back-door quests similar to the Tactics one, a time when people are level 70, a time when Ornate will be the &quot;standard&quot; cheap twink gear because there will be so much of it on the market anyone could afford it . . . a time when the &quot;people who choose not to raid&quot; will HAVE these zones available to them, without raiding. <br />
<br />
Yeah, my 10 hours a week nets more than a casual playing 40. /snicker, you are just making Absors point for him. 40 hours a week is MEGA HARDCORE man. If that person doesnt want to raid, then TOUGH CRAP, he should just WEAR WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE. Man o' Man, I just cannot seem to get this point across. Everquest is a game. In order to advance, there are things you need to do. Now, even these &quot;things&quot; have different levels. You can join the local  Uber guild if you have the time and inclination. You can join some smaller guild that is starting to get interested in Luclin level stuff like Burrower, Ssra, and potentially VT, you can join an EP level guild that doesnt have massive time-played requirements (don't tell me they dont exist, every server has 10+guilds in the EPs now, not every one is &quot;hardcore&quot;). But, the bottom line is the same. Raiding yeilds a different level of gear than non-raiding. <br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, I know people in tiny, compleetly non-raid family guilds, hardcore non-raider people, with GREAT stuff (better than mine, in some cases) in certain slots from 1-grouping Gates. Imagine how well they will be able to function there when they hit level 70. Who cares about spells. Quies is an awesome spell. Malos is an awesome spell. Content is being adjusted and tweaked and modified regularly. This game is a PROCESS, not an event. Stop waiting for the lightning bolt, it ain't coming. <br />
I would like to see next expansion with real group content, I want to see a reemphasis on immersion and environment and Imo, equipment should not be a grind like Ldon has made it.<br />
Imo, I think it is definitely viable equipment can be on par that of nonraider and raiders. <br />
Look, I am not saying the new content is the best expansion we have ever seen. Lots of people didnt like LoY, I did. I agree that the grind sucks, but sheesh, what do you call sitting in BoT for XP and loot all day? This game is about grinds, it HAS to be to some extent, or people wouldnt play for FIVE FROAKIN YEARS!! The key is adjusting your play to a schedule that you can live with. Grind here, tradeskill there, raid when your guild does (once you find the right guild that raids on your availability). <br />
There should be other paths available to get top gear without joining &quot;uber raid guild 0815&quot;. LDoN was a step in the right direction but is still not good enough and needs some tweaking.<br />
WHY!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
SICK of this question.<br />
<br />
WHY!?!?! Please tell me WHY there should be other paths! <br />
<br />
ANYONE? I want a REASON why, not some bull**** application of &quot;more people . . . more money . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Give me reasons WHY the game should be changed to make it easier to obtain the best gear available, because no matter WHAT any of you say, 1-groupable stuff is FAR FAR easier than raids. <br />
<br />
Wait, I know why, because thats how YOU play and the game should be designed around how YOU play and adjusted to YOUR SPECIFIC STYLE of play, right?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">Blazz, you are merely going into pit bull mode because the current game design suits you well.  I understand that point.  You've made it clear.  <br />
<br />
And certainly if everyone adjusted their style to be like you, and managed to get into EP+ raiding guilds that are fine with folks playing 10 hours a week, then you could pat them on the back for being inteprid and virtuous and, coincidentally, just like you.  <br />
<br />
The issue is the game used to be more flexible in design of progression.  It's not now.  Folks who don't raid are very quickly slammed to the end of their progression path.  They get frustrated, whether they are play 40 hours a week or not, because they will not progress at remotely the same pace as someone who puts in LESS time but who gloms onto a raiding guild.   <br />
<br />
It doesn't need to be this way.  This is weak game design.  It can be better and these guys should be called onto the carpet for it.  <br />
<br />
I agree with the concept that those who raid should end up with better stuff.  But those who raid should raid because they like raiding, and that is a form of reward itself.  The degree of reward for raiding is way out of kilter with a sensible game design, in my view, and it's poisoning the game.<br />
<br />
They can do better.  <br />
<br />
Raiders did better progression-wise in Kunark too, and yet the gulf was nothing like it is now.  A smart, intrepid non-raider could keep pace to some extent.  That's not true anymore, by a long long long margin.  And it's going to get a lot worse, in a steep sloping line, if this trend is not significantly addressed.  <br />
<br />
At least, if I were a developer I would be pretty concerned.  <br />

Give me reasons WHY the game should be changed to make it easier to obtain the best gear available, because no matter WHAT any of you say, 1-groupable stuff is FAR FAR easier than raids. <br />

You certainly have your opinion and are entitled to it.  However, we all pay for EQ.  We are all entitled to an opinion of how it should be structured, we are all entitled to an opportunity to attempt to influence the game design.  Just because there are those who disagree with your &quot;vision&quot; does not in any way mean they are not entitled to their own &quot;vision&quot;.

Valid point. I agree, and will try to refrain from being so obstinate in the future about it. <br />

One thing though, I would like to add. I think the &quot;hardcore non-raider&quot; is one of the lowest percentage categories of EQ players, while the &quot;casual raider&quot; is one of the highest. True casual players are actually in very good shape as far as EQ goes. Lets face it, there is YEARS worth of stuff to do, and if you do it slowly, you never get &quot;caught-up&quot;. Heck, I have bags of smithing stuff stored up for my HIE Paladin so I can do some cultural smithing, never get around to it though. <br />

But its not time thats the factor, unless you cant get a 2 hour block to play. In which case, EQ isnt your game really. Hell, its currently not MY game because of my rl time constraints. But acting like you have to play for a 40 hour stretch for months on end to get flagged is just incorrect. <br />

I'm an officer in an elemental guild. We've hit a numbers snag due to Drinal's overall population decline, but we're building up steam again.

But we still progress. there are opportunities to advance without raiding 40 hours a week or mandatory attendance.<br />

I am really impressed that someone with such a bad back is able to spend endless hours sitting in front of a PC and raid. I have a bad back myself so I really know what a pain it is. It might lessen the problems with your back if you would'nt do that imo but of course its your call. <br />
<br />
For now I will try to make my point, maybe SOE is goin to change something for the people that pay their bills, if they don't, no problem, I wont deal with it, I quit.

The only way to make them change the current attitude is not through a message board.  It is through Sony’s end of year profit.  That is what SoE respects and I believe they will drop Absor's vision in a second if it means increased profit.  The only time they have made an effort to change is when people started leaving in droves.  It wasn’t the 500 signatures saying something is broke.  It has been the increase in bad publicity that has made them take note nothing less nothing more.  I still play but will leave when WoW or anything else comes along.

I dont think I shifted one bit man. I do not think this game is perfect, by a LONG shot. In fact, I despise many aspects of the game. The fact that a 2-hour raid mob drops 2 lousy items is one. The innane amount of time needed to accomplish certain other things is another. But thats how it is. Yeah, I can complain, but why bother, for the most part? SOE has a history of ignoring their player base. Only recently does it seem as though they actually WANT to adjust the game to fit the most people possible, without pissing off too many other &quot;factions&quot;. I try to offer suggestions that are reasonable. Maybe its not reasonable for people to form a raiding guild, but hey, guess what, I bet that most &quot;family&quot; guilds have a few people interested in advancing. Those people can get together and try to get invited to a kind of &quot;co-op&quot; situation on flags. An extra couple groups is usually the difference between winning and losing a LOT of PoP events. Its all about bodies, after all (another thing I think sucks, BTW)<br />
<br />
The flag system sucks. I never said it was great. The only advantage it has is that it tends to keep the weenies out of the high-end raid zones. Other than that, it totally blows. But for now, THATS THE GAME. Adjust to it. Play it. Follow the path. <br />
<br />
Or Don't. <br />
Your attitude of &quot;just find a guild that raids when you play&quot; is somewhat offensive to someone who does 9 hours in an office + commute time.<br />
It wasnt meant to be, and if it was I apologize. <br />
<br />
The point is simple though. If you cannot do what the GAME has decided it requires to advance, be it time spent in a guild, time spent in Pick-Up raids, etc etc, then I guess you wont be able to advance. Sorry man. You wanna play Baldurs Gate 2 for 10 hours then whine cause you havent beat it yet? Granted a single player game allows a more flexible schedule to advance in it, but the application of time is similar. Is there no guild on your server that raids during your &quot;prime&quot; play hours? Is there no pick-up coalition on your server doing flag mobs? I would find a negative answer to either of those questions hard to believe.<br />
We had this thread a while back in the 61-65 forum.  The final answer was that, no, most servers don't have open raid organizations.<br />
I HIGHLY doubt there is a single server without SOME form of pick-up raid system happening, even if its just a couple guys running random flag mobs every now and then, I imagine every server has SOME form of pick-up raids happening on a semi-regular basis.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, missed this part the first time, but what the heck, I am in the typing mood this morning so why not.<br />
<br />
My server has 13 guilds EP flagged or higher, and a couple more fairly well along with VT keys and Ssra. Thats 15 raiding guilds. Lets say an average of 150 &quot;people&quot; per guild? With . . . say, . . . 75ish of those having more than 1 account? (note: this includes inactive members who still have live accounts, since the &quot;total accounts&quot; thing probalby has a TON of inactive accounts that are still paying)<br />
<br />
Overall, SOE has 400K subscribers, with 40 servers, thats an average of 10K &quot;accounts&quot; per server. 15 guilds with an average of 225 accounts per guild (150 + 75 extra accounts for dual-boxers, and that might be low) is almost 4K &quot;accounts&quot; that raid. <br />
<br />
Even if my numbers are off, and personally, I think they are low-ball, thats still 30-40% of the servers accounts that raid. <br />
<br />
Shove the 90% garbage please. You think if SOE felt that 90% of EQs customers didnt raid they would continue to have such a large focus on raid content? This is about the last time I am going to respond to you, GoSpeed. Your really out of touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">The people who are complaining are the hardcore non-raiders who simply do not like to raid. They choose NOT to play that portion of the game, yet they play FAR too much &quot;single group&quot; content and therefore burn it out. Sorry.<br />
<br />
I dunno about that. I dont really think I have anything against raiding and I bet I could do it if I had the opportunity. But as mentioned earlier I have a job. On top of that I dont have anyone else to make dinner for me, do the dishes, wash my clothes...blah, blah, blah. I do it all myself. Furthermore I live in Europe and there are no european based uber-guilds on my server as far as I know. You please tell me where it is I go to do high-end content? Other peoples lives will be different but they will also have things that prevent them from making EQ number 1 (or 2 or 3) priority in their life.<br />
<br />
How far are you in Gates? Granted, its not the best expansion SOE released. They had some serious logistical problems and I think they messed up the way it was all handled, but its what we have at the moment. Farmed any gear or spells? You CAN do Vexd and Tipt. You CAN do Ikky and get flagged for KT.<br />
<br />
Only thing I did in GoD so far is max my alchemy. I am not dumb and it is possible for me to realize that it would be a complete and utter waste of my sparetime (time where I want to relax and do things I enjoy - having a job easily enables you to fill out the frustration-account without using a game). And please dont tell me how easy GoD will be for me when you are easily twice the shaman I am stat and AA wise. You have no idea what its like for me like I probably dont know what its like for you. But if you say its challenging and hard then it for sure wont be easier for me.<br />
<br />
So GoD did 2 things for me:<br />
<br />
- maxed my alchemy<br />
- made me stop playing<br />
<br />
I will admit I havent cancelled my account yet (its hard to let go of characters you have spent years building up) but if OoW is released with anywhere near the same amount of artificially blocked off content as GoD then it will happen at that time.</div></div><hr />

i agree with this 100%.  if you are that VERY rare person that plays 40 hours a week but loathes raiding, then, do it once, get flagged, and you're done.  i hated GoD trial content but you don't see me posting flames to sony about them wasting my money and forcing me into a playstyle i didn't want (i prefer to raid) to play.  but i think a lot of you are overreacting to the problem, as i agree w/ blazz in this that the vast majority of people we're discussing as being behind etc. are the &quot;casual raider&quot;.  then again, these are the people that put the least amount of time into the game, hence they have the longest timespan of &quot;stuff to do&quot; before they get bored and move on, so they SHOULD be behind.  to imply that every raider is a talentless wheelcleric_01 and that every non-raider is a hard working and downtrodden individual is nuts and simply wrong.  there are tards in raiding guilds, and there are tards who are guildless and don't like to raid.  <br />

everquest is/has been a raiding game since kunark.  virtually every expansion has had content geared towards the raider and his guild.  why now, all of a sudden, has this become such a ridiculous issue to cry over?  because planes of power has been completed and instead of having 1 high end zone it has 10?  because endgame pop gear is significantly better than endgame gear of the previous expansions?  if you think hitting a road block of content in BoT when you hit 65 is an issue, try having nothing else to do but farm PoTime for the last year+ due to simply a lack of anything else to do.  let's face it, when you put LOTS of time into the game, many of the flaws start to show.  those of us that do, the raider and non-raider alike, will BOTH run out of stuff to do and get bored.  and i agree with blazz, no one here has given me any good reason to make equal rewards for 1grpable content be it gear or zone access.  i would be willing to bet, that the number of high playtime non-raiders with more playtime than the average raider is very, very small.  so we have a very small group whining about why they should get equal rewards for NOT doing equally challenging content (if there were 1grpable it could not be as hard by simple game logistics)?  <br />
<br />
my logic is simply this:  everquest is set up and has been set up for years as a raiding game.  the flags/keys are there, if you want them.  the game requires different playstyles in different situations to accomplish your goals.  sometimes its a timesink (vt shards), sometimes its a raid (fennin/xegony/coirnav/rathe), sometimes its single grp trials (justice trials/GoD trials), but all and all zone access, which is one of the things being most highly debated here, DOES TAKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLAYSTYLES THAN MANY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH.  i absolutely hated doing emp key stuff in ssra with a single grp.  i did it, spent many hours there, got my key done, helped the rest of the grp get theirs, and moved on.  would the game even be a challenge if it catered to the playstyle that everyone preferred?  of course i was never a fan of needing 10+ clerics in a 72 person raid to win encounters, but then again, this was another challenge of the game, and it was very fun killing tallon zek and vallon zek the first time and getting to tier5 first.  <br />
<br />
true casuals are in great shape, if you don't/can't put a lot of time into this game like many of us can/shouldn't do heh, there is all sorts of stuff to do, whether it be exp, aa, quests, etc.  i think you all are exaggerating just how many hardcore non-raiders there are.  and i've said it before i'll say it again, there are plenty of ways to get flagged without a raiding guild.  what is wrong at all with treating flags like keys that have to be done a certain way and then move on?  it was that way in past expansions, and i treated it accordingly, with a &quot;not fun but has to be done&quot; mindset.  seriously, as there are a TON of unguilded/family guild people flagged for the elemental planes as my server, i don't understand how this system has enraged so many.  at the very least there are plenty of people flagged for a number of different zones past tier1.  kunark required a raid to get into VP.  velious required a key from a raid to get into ST.  luclin required a raid to get into VT.  and pop required raids to see the endgame content.  nothing new here, just because there are multiple tiers of zones doesn't mean they are inaccessible to you because you hate raiding, nor does that mean that you should swear off all people that do choose to follow the progression path that's there.  do i think they need to release another ldon type expansion or beef up ldon gear?  yup, i do.  i thought it was balanced decently against time gear, but from what i've seen of GoD gear non-raiding gear needs another boost.  completely changing an expansion and the way it was set up, after many have adapted their playstyle to progress, would be silly.  level 70 will solve a ton of the problems of non-raiders with regards to PoP, it will completely trivialize it.  just like 65 did for luclin.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">Just an observation on how the playerbase has woken up to this issue now that viable competition is looming. Six months ago the non-raider's voice was not nearly as vocal and the chorus of &quot;shut up, n00b, and either deal with it or quit!&quot; from pro-raiders was resounding.  Look at this thread and recent ones this week.  I crosslinked this thread over at the monk boards  (http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=46011.topic)  and there are 77 replies in less than a day, on top of the Casual vs. High End Raiding (http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=45976.topic) thread that was already there.<br />
<br />
Then I go to the sk boards and someone had already crosslinked this thread (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=21570)  as well as an existing thread on a similar subject, somewhat mistitled How bad is the overcrowding (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=21554).<br />
<br />
I haven't looked at any other boards as monk/sk/shaman (primarily shaman) are the only ones I frequent.<br />
<br />
The winds of change are blowing in the playerbase whether SOE realizes it or not.  Of course since they don't publish subscriber numbers anymore they're free to claim that raiders make up the vast majority of the playerbase and continue to design and release expansions accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Only thing I did in GoD so far is max my alchemy. I am not dumb and it is possible for me to realize that it would be a complete and utter waste of my sparetime (time where I want to relax and do things I enjoy - having a job easily enables you to fill out the frustration-account without using a game). And please dont tell me how easy GoD will be for me when you are easily twice the shaman I am stat and AA wise.<br />
<br />
The Restless Soul camp in Natimbi is simple, even for the lowest bazaar geared no-AA shaman. 20 hp augs, nice range and shoulder items from roaming named (gotta kill the phs for those, though) and a chance at the FT1 neck item (fairly rare, but I got one in about 5 hours total camp time there). There are lower level trials that would yeild you SIGNIFICANT upgrades. <br />
<br />
The only dumb part is that you have ASSUMED so much based on what people say on a message board, rather than trying it for youself. OK, you didnt go right away, becaue the &quot;reviews&quot; sucked. You waited for it to come out on DVD. Well its out, go see it. You might enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">I have adjusted to the game. I stopped playing and paying for content and expansions that sadly are not fun, and are not for me.<br />
<br />
That does not change the fact that I love EQ for the fun and memories it holds. And that if given the chance to play and pay for content and fun again I would be willing too. <br />
<br />
But, under the current gameplay style and mindset of raid or die, the game is not worth it to me. <br />
<br />
So who is more of a fan, or consumer. The people who log off and never say a word and quietly tell all thier friends EQ sucks. Or someone who has a viewpoint, and tries to share it with others who may agree or disagree. <br />
<br />
I don't want all content switched to Just single group roles. I want content that allows for a healthy game for raiders and non raiders alike.<br />
<br />
I don't want to kill a firebeetle to get the uber loot. I want the ability to have a fun challenging quest or adventure for items of comparable quality that allow me to advance in the game at a reasonable pace. Raiders have this, Why can't non raiders.  I want to play with my friends in a gameworld that is enjoyable to myself and people like me. That at the end of a long day of work I come home and look forward to hanging out and getting into an adventure or two. <br />
<br />
When the game is split between the godlike and the lesser beings and only the godlike are getting a looksee, then there is something wrong. My ideas and posts are trying to address that in such a manner that would give folks options. You know Choices. Things to do so that they keep playing without feeling obligated to play. And by keeping playing I mean to SOE keep paying and buying new expansions. And talking to people who will buy as well.<br />
<br />
So Blazz Keep on harping about how if you don't like it leave. To people who have already left but care enough to keep tabs on the game and maybe try and offer an idea or two as to what made them leave in the first place.  and once enough people leave then you can move onto the next game and Scream at them Tough! Leave! Change or Die!<br />
<br />
And for the record I didnt play 40 hours a week. At least not all the time. for a while there I played 4 hours a day 4-5 days a week. With weekends either not on at all or sometimes marathon days. Leading my guild that I created. Doing raids on occasion, and new content where we could find it. And Lots and lots of Goofing around in a game world that was fun<br />
<br />
I played EQ until SoE started playing with me. And I don't like the feelings I got from Smedlys hand in my pocket all while seeing what was being done with a world I loved.<br />
<br />
so Blazz. Maybe one day you might realize I am not trying to take fun away from you. I am not trying to impinge on your rights as a raider. All I want is the game I started playing 5 years ago back. The one that had room for many styles of play with advancement and hope for the future. Now it only seems to hold credit card numbers.<br />
<br />
And the occasional Jerk who parrots back Don't like it, Leave!<br />

You may want to do some research before making statements like this.  <br />
<br />
On one end of the spectrum, you have E'Ci public.  Time flagged open raiders.<br />

In the middle, you get Rodcet Nife.  We have NO open flag raiding.  There's no server rules to discourage it, I don't think, it just doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
On the extreme other end, The Rathe has a raiding culture that is so stringent that people running an open raid on their own time can cost their guild its turn in the rotation on several targets.  Guilds are in fact prohibited from even teaming up to do an encounter that neither could do alone.

I disagree COMPLETELY, especially with the news of OoW offering 5 more levels. I don't care what anyone says, 5 levels will GREATLY simplify Gates content, making getting flags through KT very very doable by single groups of &quot;non-raiding&quot; players. Once there, the loot is better than EPs. <br />
<br />
You say all they cater too is raiders. I say they are TRYING to cater to the more casual players as well. LDoN wasnt a raid expansion. LoY wasnt a raid expansion. Even Gates isnt SPECIFICALLY designed for raiding, despite all these threads and posts of people whining about how hard it is. <br />

Snowwy you know I love you man, but I honestly do not think I ever said &quot;if you dont like it, leave&quot;. What I have said, lots and lots of times, is &quot;if you dont like it, adjust, or dont&quot;. But even you have to admit that players like yourself, like Iz, like BlargX, etc are hardly typical. In fact, I would go as far as saying you guys are extremely atypical, a very small sub-set of players that plays a TON but just doesnt want to raid, period. <br />

I have never said the gap shouldnt be smaller. I have never said that things shouldnt open up after a period, like Sol Ro and EPs. I have never said that SOE should focus solely on raid content and ignore the non-raiders.

Amen on the fun part ! I hope to GoD (:-)) you somehow are able to pull it off. I just havent seen any hints yet is going to happen anytime soon.<br />
<br />
You (SOE, Verant, 989 ...) were never afraid of being &quot;inspired&quot; by other simillar games so here a few things from CoH to be &quot;inspired&quot; by:<br />
<br />
- Sidekick system. If you want to I bet you can make something similar and this should enable primarily casual people to try out new classes if they feel stuck with their current class without having to go through weeks or months of boring levelling.<br />
<br />
- Instanced dungeons that scale difficulty for as few as 1 (!) person and stays instanced even if you camp out in the middle of it. Again something that could benefit everyone but mostly casual people in smallish family guilds that might not always have uber-cleric, uber-warrior, uber-chanter and 3 others online to do LDoNs.<br />
<br />
These 2 things would be a huge increase in appeal - but maybe its too good for EQ since I guess something has to be hold back for EQ2.<br />
<br />
Respect on the positive post Absor, this is what we all hope to hear from you :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what exactly this is supposed to mean.  Eventually old hunting grounds get boring and/or you get what you were there for.  Then it's time to look for new stomping grounds, and when you've been playing EQ since the beginning (or the first expansion, in my case), there's nothing but the new stuff.  And, well, GoD isn't an option.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why SoE decides to completely change the format of the game at this late date.  A shaman/mage duo has HAPPILY explored at least half (if not the majority) of every expansion to date, and now we can't even get our feet wet.<br />
<br />
Yes, I suppose Blazz is right in one way.  Our options are to stay and be miserable or cash in our chips and leave.  It's just a shame that a game that's entertained us for all these years changes itself so drastically that we give it all up for good.  Part of me still thinks that SoE would want to know how their decisions have alienated some of us (regardless of how tolerant the messageboard residents may or may not be).  *grin*</div></div><hr />

You say all they cater too is raiders. I say they are TRYING to cater to the more casual players as well. LDoN wasnt a raid expansion. LoY wasnt a raid expansion. Even Gates isnt SPECIFICALLY designed for raiding, despite all these threads and posts of people whining about how hard it is...<br />
<br />
I do agree that the extra 5 levels will simplify all content.  In fact, I agree with earlier threads guessing that GoD and OoW were initially one expansion...I just think they released them in the wrong order  :p .  As it is now, GoD isn't a &quot;raiding&quot; expansion, but you need to have been a  raider in a previous expansion to be effective there (although this has lessened somewhat with the retooling.)<br />
<br />
I also think a lot of the pushback we are seeing is around the game design approach of requiring flags for a majority of new content.  This is an extremely frustrating situation for those of us that are not in guilds capable of completing flagging encounters.  Yes, I can do tons of PU raids and eventually I'll get flagged, but that is incredibly frustrating - much more frustrating then it is for those people in a large raiding guild that can muster a competent force that's worked together on previous raids.  If the current flag system had options for an equal amount of 2 to 3 group raids that would be fine because my guild could get that many 65's together and I know we know what we are doing on a raid.  Unfortunately, that option does not exist.<br />
<br />
The end result of the current flagging system for me is, if I don't want to put up with tons of failed PU raids, I won't be able to see EP+ content for another year or two.  On the one hand that gives me a long term progression path, but on the other hand, I'm not going to buy any more expansions where I can only use a small percentage of the new zones.<br />
<br />
By the way, yes, I could switch guilds, but I really like the people in the guild I'm in.  So, for me, switching guilds is not an option I'll take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">I do agree that the extra 5 levels will simplify all content. <br />
<br />
That's just it.  Evidently under Absor's view, if you don't raid, don't buy the expansions until 1-4 REAL LIFE years later so, like Kunark dragons, you can readily handle them.  <br />
<br />
I really don't think the game progression needs to be that dramatically stretched out.  But that is in fact what is happening.  <br />
<br />
Although I've been on a bit of a break lately, I actually like raiding.  I like getting together in a big group and doing something.  When I log in rarely now, that's what I look for.  Single group exp stuff is mind-numbingly boring.  <br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean I don't see problem with progression design.  I think they really clear.  <br />
<br />
Folks want a sense they are improving and can continue to character build.  If there is an insufficient sense of progression, they will become dissatisfied.  <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with that.  It is as ok to criticize game design as it is quit and simply play another game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">LoL thats a lot os BS but telling us that 40% of the player base are high end raiders is unlbelievable stupid. You really think that all of this 15 guilds own 225 accounts each and that this is so on all 40 Servers? LMAO. It is very unlikely that members of the top guilds only raid 2 - 3 hours a week like you told us about yourself. Its usally WAY more, and I highly doubt that so many people can affort and/or are willing to spend so much time in a game<br />
<br />
Seriously man, do you have some sort of filter on your brain that only lets you read the things you want to, or that converts things you read into statements you thought they were saying?<br />
<br />
Where did I say 40% &quot;high end&quot; raiding? Where did I say the top guilds only raid 2-3 hours a week? Heck, my guild is a &quot;middle of the pack guild&quot; and we raid 6 out of 7 days a week. Me, myself, personally, I CHOOSE only to raid a few hours a week. Me. <br />
<br />
Tell ya what GoSpeed, let me revise my guesstimates. 10 guilds deep, 150 accounts per guild. Multiply that by the number of servers and tell me how many peeople playing EQ RAID, in some way or another. OK? I think even Iz would give me 10 guilds a server 150 accounts per. Right there is 20% of the games active accounts, Einstein. And trust me, that is SERIOUSLY lowball. Highest end guilds have such a huge turnover and burnout rate that I bet half the guilds on my server have 300 accounts in them. I know people with 5, 6 or more. Heck, every time someone in my guild &quot;retires&quot; someone else takes over the account. <br />
<br />
It might not be 40% who raid, but I guarentee you its more than 25%. Guarenteed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot open your Magelo profile from work, so please understand I am writing this without knowledge of your gear/hit points/AA abilities. <br />
<br />
I am an overwhelmingly LDON-geared shaman. Non-LDON gear wise, I have a Cap of Drowned Souls and a Tactician's Bulwark, along with perhaps three bazaar-purchased items. My Magelo is a touch off HP-wise (I have to re-adjust my figurine stats. again.) but I currently stand at 3648 HP unbuffed. I have roughly 130 AA's, and just purchased AHA2. I am not elemental flagged or Time flagged (yet, lol). Hard LDON adventures, while not trivial, are certainly doable to the point where I am very comfortable in them. <br />
<br />
Since purchasing GOD (which I did because my guild friends did, I wanted to be able to hang out with them) I have spent around 30 hours in Natimbi and Vxed combined. This does not count the 20 minutes I spent lost in Abysmal Sea, though. Just last Saturday, I went to Vxed with a group. We spent four hours there fooling around, and got a nice pair of pants to drop (gave them to the Ranger, his pants were awful), and earned some very nice AA experience. The mobs there were pretty easy, they weren't overwhelmingly hard as I expected. <br />
<br />
I would say that if hard LDON adventures are within your reach, Vxed is within your reach. I cannot speak for any other GOD zones in relation to LDON hards, though, I haven't been to them yet.<br />

<br />
You (SOE, Verant, 989 ...) were never afraid of being &quot;inspired&quot; by other simillar games so here a few things from CoH to be &quot;inspired&quot; by:<br />
<br />
- Sidekick system. If you want to I bet you can make something similar and this should enable primarily casual people to try out new classes if they feel stuck with their current class without having to go through weeks or months of boring levelling.<br />
<br />
- Instanced dungeons that scale difficulty for as few as 1 (!) person and stays instanced even if you camp out in the middle of it. Again something that could benefit everyone but mostly casual people in smallish family guilds that might not always have uber-cleric, uber-warrior, uber-chanter and 3 others online to do LDoNs.<br />
<br />
These 2 things would be a huge increase in appeal - but maybe its too good for EQ since I guess something has to be hold back for EQ2.<br />
<br />
Respect on the positive post Absor, this is what we all hope to hear from you :-)<br />
<br />
Spiritblood, have to agree.  I also play CoH and the two features you mentioned are the only reason I still play.  CoH, IMHO, is currently not 1/10th the game EQ is, which I enjoy immensely.  However, since I have high level friends in CoH who have their own Super Group, I can play with them as a sidekick with my low level character.  And when I can't or don't want to group, I can get an instanced mission and beat on the bad guys in private at my own pace.  Brilliant.<br />
<br />
Those two features are worth the price of admission.  If SoE could implement anything close to this, I'd happily pay for another year in advance.  Just don't make we waste an hour of my very limited playing time (3 young kids, you can imagine), looking for an LDoN group or trying to find a spot to solo, with no goal or purpose other than to grind exp.  Give me a mission, or instanced quest I don't have to fight 5 other folks for or need 5 friends to do, and I'd be as happy as a pig in slop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">Thinking about it, the whole ancient spell system is a good idea, just poorly implemented.  Take the basic spell lineup and add a few ancients, with 10-15% more added.   More heal, more nuke, whatever.  The important thing is to not balance the class around them.  They should be purely upgrades for those who put in the time.  A little gloss is good, walling needed spells behind ancients is bad.<br />
Who says there should be only one avenue for spells though?  I see a lot of discussion on the best way to distribute spells.  Shouldn't they be available as a drop, and as a point type purchase, and a turn-in, or whatever?  Just so there is more than one way to attain the spells (not ancients).  This would help to get people their spells in whatever way they are able, time wise.  Perhaps this would perhaps prevent spell blocking/hoarding as well.  Much of what this game is missing is the whole idea of multiple paths/similar result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">I have been playing EQ now for about 4 years.  I started playing back during Kunark, but really didn't get into the game until Velious.  It wasn't until Luclin came out until I had a character over 30.  It wasn't until PoP that I had a character over 55.  I had been 65 for about 2 months before LDoN came out.  Where am I going with this?<br />
<br />
    Everquest is a long-term game, it is one people have enjoyed for years.  You can tell immediately upon logging in- it used to take forever to get back into the game.  For a brand new player it takes quite some time to get to level 65, but we see very few arguments like this one over &quot;Why do I have to be 65 to get cool gear?&quot;  Its a general consensus by casuals and hardcore alike that you level to 65.  Raiders get better gear than non-raiders- this is a fact.  There are some shamans out there that are close to/have broken 7k hitpoints unbuffed.  These same shamans have been in Time for over a year- One zone/one year.  <br />
<br />
     Everquest is a game of time- how much you have, and what you do with it.  The more time you have and the better use of it- the better and faster you will progress.  Everquest HAS always been this way.  There are different aspects to the game- some suck, some suck worse.  If you chose to disregard an aspect of the game, then you lose out on the positives and the negatives that come from it.  It you choose not to level- then you don't, but don't complain that X player did and can now do Y.  If you choose not to raid- then don't, but don't complain that X player did and can now do Y.  <br />
<br />
     If SOE was to come out tomorrow and say &quot;we are putting Time quality gear on LDoN merchants, but the content will be scaled to mirror difficulty of PoTime and you will not be able to complete the gear line without a year's worth of work&quot;- players would baulk at it.  That 7k shaman- whether good, bad, or mediocre has been farming the one zone of &quot;progression&quot; for over a year.  Many still are, because many guilds are having to reflag and regear new players to replace those that left.  SOE puts out more non-raid content zones than they have ever put out raid zones.  Currently PoP has 12 &quot;non-raid zones&quot; with 1 zone that requires a groupable quest to access.  PoP has 7 &quot;raid-only&quot; access zones, and PoP is considered a &quot;damn raid expansion&quot;.  GoD offers Natimbi, Quinimi, Barindu, Ferubi, Riwwi, 4 sewer trials, Vxed, Tipt to the non-raider and Kod'taz/Ikkinz if you are feeling especially freaky.  <br />
<br />
     I am tired of hearing &quot;but I am limited to one zone&quot;.  It happens to everyone eventually, certain zones just yield better rewards than others.  What I like to look for on posts are magelos- because it gives me an idea of where that person is at &quot;content/progression-wise.&quot;  If you are sitting around 4-4.5k unbuffed as a non-raid shaman- then you are done, good luck with wherever you choose to go.  If you are sitting around 2.5-3k unbuffed- you are not, but you do have a choice.  If you feel that Everquest is too much of a time sink- then you are done, good luck with wherever you choose to go.  If you still want to play and progress- then do your research, a non-raid shaman can hit 4-4.5k unbuffed with group content/quests.  <br />
<br />
     The usual retort to all of this is that &quot;at my own pace I can get 65, I can't do the same with zone progression.&quot;  In time everything becomes trivial to the point that when the difficulty gets low enough to the point that you want.  Everquest has never been about equality- if it was we wouldn't have spawn times, rare drops, rare named, etc.  The game has never been tuned this way, and coming in &quot;five years later&quot; and complaining about &quot;equality issues&quot; is pointless.  The people that play more will get more.  The people that follow the path set before them will progress faster.  If I don't want to level to 65 then I don't deserve to cast level 65 spells.  If I don't want to raid, then I don't deserve raid gear.  I don't need raid gear to complete the current group content that I am in, so it's not an issue for me.  <br />
<br />
     For those that say they don't have time to progress, I am really sorry but that is how the game was designed.  In a progression-based game, there is absolutely no way to balance the progression of casual/non-casual players without trivializing someone's accomplishments.  For those that are coming to the realization that EQ is a timesink, where were you the first 64 levels?  Did you think the game was going to change once you dinged 65?  Raiding is part of EQ's design.  It is not required for those than want to progress to 65, it is designed to allow players to continue past 65 with more content.  If you choose not to partake in this content, then do not expect the same rewards.  If you do not have the time to partake in this content, then again I am sorry, but I think you need to find a game that fits better with your schedule. <br />
<br />
     The driving point that has made EQ the game that it is, is that it reflects life and allows enough personality to bleed through the bites of info to keep people coming back.  There are games out there with better graphics, better game design, and better game play.  People come back to see: xxxx the lazy cleric, yyyy the loot whore shaman, zzzz the cool warrior, and qqqq the nice rogue.  It has created boards that debate issues that, on the surface, are game issues, but when you dig deeper represent similar issues that we see everyday in life.  That is why people have played EQ for five years- not the graphics, not the loot, not the difficulty.  EQ in many ways shows both the joy and monotony of life.  <br />
<br />
     Wrapping this up- its getting long, but this issue will honestly never be resolved.  Everyone on this board is using &quot;flawed&quot; logic in proving their side of the point.  Logic relies on an objective individual witnessing a behavior and devising logic/law from it.  No one here is objective to this issue- we each have our own side and are biased to it.  Finally, in response to Absor's post and to those that posted a reply to it.  Absor is one guy, as he pointed in numerous times in his posts.  He is entitled to his opinion whether good or bad.  He also pointed out that his opinion is not shared by SOE, and this was further proven by Brenlo's post to disregard it as SOE's vision.  The final decisions on what SOE's vision is- lies solely on SOE, not Absor.  To denounce an entire game on what one person's opinion (that is not shared by the company) is....stupid.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, missed this part the first time, but what the heck, I am in the typing mood this morning so why not.<br />
<br />
My server has 13 guilds EP flagged or higher, and a couple more fairly well along with VT keys and Ssra. Thats 15 raiding guilds. Lets say an average of 150 &quot;people&quot; per guild? With . . . say, . . . 75ish of those having more than 1 account? (note: this includes inactive members who still have live accounts, since the &quot;total accounts&quot; thing probalby has a TON of inactive accounts that are still paying)<br />
<br />
Overall, SOE has 400K subscribers, with 40 servers, thats an average of 10K &quot;accounts&quot; per server. 15 guilds with an average of 225 accounts per guild (150 + 75 extra accounts for dual-boxers, and that might be low) is almost 4K &quot;accounts&quot; that raid. <br />
<br />
Even if my numbers are off, and personally, I think they are low-ball, thats still 30-40% of the servers accounts that raid. <br />
<br />
That has been your answer to my post that 90+% are not UBER RAIDING guild members. So whats your problem now ? Seriously man, your try to turn things around is absolutely annoying. Whats you prolem with people asking for another path to achieve almost raid like equipment? I don't blame you for raiding either. Do what you enjoy and let us enjoy the game in another way. As I allready said, I dont feel like joining another guild. So why would it hurt you that much if SOE does a bit more for the majority of their customers ?<br />

Man I hate this idea.  I really hate the idea of spells becoming strictly off-limits to the non end-game raider. <br />
<br />
That more than any other thing will cause lots of people who quit who otherwise might not.  <br />

The concept of ancient:spells always blew, and to have a key spell spell like a canni upgrade made ancient to me is a spectacularly bad idea.  To the extent this is true, &quot;A little gloss is good, walling needed spells behind ancients is bad&quot; I agree - but don't wall any spells off.  Absor is wrong about spells.

It just confirms for me at least that this is the &quot;One Path&quot; design philosophy going on behind the scenes at SOE. It is obviously shared by a lot more than just Absor based on their record, even if he is not an official spokesman.

If it's Absor's opinion that's perfectly valid and I'll accept it- just stop saying one thing on your boxes while everyone who plays knows it's another.<br />

<br />
I have no problem to this quote if it is made in reference to Ancient spells (even Ancient Canni).  I think those spells which, with the possible exception of Ancient Canni, are nice upgrades that improve your performance as a shaman, but not to the point where they are a pseudo-requirement.<br />
<br />
Now, if this quote is made in reference to ALL level 65 spells...<br />
<br />
Um, Quiescence, Focus of the Seventh, and Ferine Avatar are spells every shaman should be &quot;within reach&quot; of (unless you wanna purposefully stay out of reach of FA so you don't go nuts refreshin').<br />
<br />
To say that a class's defining spells are only in reach of those who can raid is crazy.<br />
<br />
I personally received 2 of my glyphed rune words on raids, and I raid about once a week... I signed up for EQ beta all those years ago, and fell in love with it BECAUSE I could do anything I wanted to at any time.  Joining a scheduled requirement raid guild totally destroys that for me.  What's the point of having great equipment / spells if you can only play with it yourself on Saturday's and Sundays?  The other 3 glyphed rune words I purchased when I found good deals for them in the good ol' normally inflated Firiona Vie server Bazaar.<br />
<br />
And while I support some aspects of the flagging system, a lot of them I dislike, but that's a digression...<br />
<br />
I was lucky enough to receive a different spell each handin, to a total of all my spells... heck, figured they had stopped them from being random until I asked around, just to be sure...  but I now know a Wizard who has turned in 12 runes and has yet to receive Strike of Solusek.  She has very little time to raid and is having trouble unloading her duplicates in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">You know what.<br />
<br />
It isnt the fact of the time loot. <br />
<br />
It is the fact that they are designing expansions around the idea of the time player is the baseline. They are designing content based on the idea of people who consume all the content beforehand even though there is only a part of the population that has actually the time and inclination to mold themselves into a raider. <br />
<br />
A few things might be thrown out for a Bazzar geared shaman/player. But the primary focus of GoD has been Raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
If a non raider had the ability to come close to the power gearwise of a raider then this focus on simply the power level of the properly geared people would not matter as much. But As it stands something that a time tank can stand up to is vastly different than a bazzar geared tank can. <br />
<br />
As a little what if.     Lets say that for all the new expansions SoE said to the playerbase, Only people who are in guilds that do not raid are allowed any new AA. We have determined that the power curve of both AA and EP+ Gear has impacted the game too much. So if your charecter is flagged for Elemental planes and beyond You may continue to get gear from encounters but all AA is closed off to you. Thank you for being such valued customers. But there are haves and have nots in all things and now you get the other side of the equation. and some things are always out of people reach don't you know.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt that be bull****? Cutting people off from content because of the way they play the game. I do not want to see time. Not the raid centric time that is. What I want is an alternate way to ge to time and free Zeb with appropriate rewards and story so that Raiders have the combat centric way, and groupers can have a way of experianceing what the game has to offer. <br />
<br />
What I want is to feel like a valued customer rather than an afterthought.<br />
<br />
As for Everquest always being designed as a raid based game. Well Vox didnt have loot the first time she was killed. Aradune had to come down and reward the players personally. Yes it is a raid based game now for the most part. So be it. But after the mutation of EQ fromw aht it used to be to what it is now. I do not think for a second I want to hop back on the treadmill of a SoE run product and invest years of blood sweat and tears inot something that is so steadfastly bent on my way or the highway. And worse the highway is a toll road.<br />
<br />
I wish EQ was fun for me again. I miss the folks. And I miss playing Snoww. But since my primary form and means of advancing my charecter now comes with a whole host of Skelatons in the closet (In the form of raid or Falter) I guess the advancement is done. <br />

If it's Absor's opinion that's perfectly valid and I'll accept it- just stop saying one thing on your boxes while everyone who plays knows it's another.<br />
<br />
Put the comments of Absor, Blazz or Predicus (to just pick 3) on ANY future expansion box and let's see how well it sells.  Seriously- I dare you.<br />
<br />
Izmalis, you are one angry man.  It seems no matter what is said in this thread you ignore it/disregard it/outright deny it.  The sad part is that I &quot;knew&quot; you were going to comment on the last paragraph- there was no doubt in my mind.  What is even sadder is that I don't know what it is that you want.  I have read your posts on this thread, and all I can tell is that you hate SOE, raiding, the current casual content, and that you have some love for Diablo 2.  That's about it.  You have switched back and forth between the title casual player and non-raider.  What are you?  Others have posted numbers, percents, thoughts, and corrections on their opinions. <br />
<br />
I see that as constructive criticism, and I applaude those that have given it.   I have not seen that from you.  You have pointed out what you see wrong with the game, but have not given any ideas on corrections.  That is the difference between constructive criticism and whining.  It is ok to have problems with the game- We all do.  Yelling and screaming about the game without offering up solutions is just whining.  Read my post again and you will notice that the point I was trying to make was that &quot;the grass is never greener on the other side&quot;, and that burnout is shared by all players.  <br />
<br />
What I ask you to do now is post something with your thoughts and ideas on corrections and fixes.  We already know you hate EQ, you don't have to repeat it everytime you post.  Come back with some ideas next time, so that I and maybe some others can understand where you are coming from.</div></div><hr />

Izmalis is 100% on the money on this.  EQ is consistently misrepresented in its advertising  before you buy and its communications with customers afterwards as a game with an enormous amount of content for everyone.  Please let's not burden ourselves with endless examples or counter-arguments; the length of this thread and its similarity to others is ample evidence that a very significant number of players find the claims that there is plenty of content for everyone ludicrous.  <br />
<br />
Okay, I'll throw in one small cheat -- how ya all liking that level 50 content in GoD so far?  Sorry, broke down and couldn't help it!<br />
<br />
If EQ started off the way it is now, it would have crashed and burned almost immediately.  How many old-timers joined EQ because they wanted to become hardcore raiders, with all that used to imply and still implies to a certain extent, or even concentrate mainly on raiding?  In a world with few alternatives to raiding anywhere remotely as plentiful or well-designed?  In a world where so much of the content you pay for is off-limits due to flagging/keying and the associated things that go with it?  <br />
<br />
I'd be willing to bet the percentage is absolutely VANISHINGLY small.<br />
<br />
It's no accident that the game was never put together that way in the first place.  Only a fool would have tried to sell a game like that, and only a bigger fool would have financed it.<br />
<br />
There's no way that game would have sold nearly as well or lasted as long, 3D world or not, persistent world or not.  If EQ was honestly marketed today or back then as exactly what it is right now, sales to new customers and sales of expansions both would plummet, and most of us wouldn't be here to see it, because the game would have shriveled to a withered shadow of what it is now long before today.<br />
<br />
Iz is right on this one.  I dare Sony to advertise honestly.  But they know better than that.  No chance in hell that will ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">&quot;Put the comments of Absor, Blazz or Predicus (to just pick 3) on ANY future expansion box and let's see how well it sells. Seriously- I dare you.&quot;<br />

<br />
I will definitely agree with you on this.  EQ expansions have been misrepresented- I think its a combination of &quot;spin-doctoring&quot; by the PR guys and a lost sense of communication by the devs/players.  GoD, as an expansion, was an utter disaster for all players.  Cookie cutter mobs/zones with gear drops that make absolutely no sense on risk vs. reward.  (You do a group trial and get EP level gear; you do a quest event requiring Time peeps and the gear drops are BoT tower quality.)<br />
<br />
The GoD revamp should have been implemented before it went live, and loot tables still need to be looked at.  They should have never released the expansion along with the DX9 patch- the combination killed a lot of active players.  <br />
<br />
As far as content goes, I preferred the all-in-one yearly expansions.  They tend to provide something for everyone, and we have less of the X expansion was made for Y group.  I think the biggest problem we have now is that most of the playerbase is 50+, and burnout comes often for everyone.  Raiding was the answer in the past for those that burned through content, but doesn't work as well now.  Basically, the bottleneck is getting smaller and tighter.  SOE can't fall back on levels anymore to slow down people, and the current answer: flagging/keying isn't making people happy.<br />
<br />
At the very least, we are getting feedback and SOE are starting to make some babysteps to fix long-standing issues.  Its not going to be fixed in a week's time- there is too much, but I will be happy if they at least put forth the effort to make EQ better.</div></div><hr />

I have not seen that from you.   You have pointed out what you see wrong with the game, but have not given any ideas on corrections.<br />
Then you haven't been paying attention.  Here's a quick recap:<br />
1- eliminate the design philosophy that most zones in an expansion must be raid flagged and &quot;unlocked&quot; just to access the content.  This segregates the playerbase in what should be a social game.<br />
2- reduce the gear gap to something even remotely close so that you don't have to design single group encounters around 2 sets of people, the raider and non-raider.  The only way the non-raider will ever beat an encounter tuned for the raider is via mudflation several years and expansions down the road.<br />
3- single group content and lots of it. Think Kunark. Improve LDoN- several good threads on this already.<br />
4- Be up front and honest about your design philosophy for the game.  If it's raid only, state that and be candid so there's no more misunderstanding and resentment based on false advertising.<br />

I'm sorry if my acerbic writing style laced with sarcasm and well-earned cynicism makes it seem like hate, but it's not.  On the whole I still like EQ and am nostalgic for the fun I had in the past, but it saddens me to see the game change its design philosophy such that the non-raider no longer feels capable of progressing.<br />
<br />
I'm making a conscious effort to use non-raider now instead of casual because the term &quot;casual&quot; like &quot;hardcore&quot; is too ambiguous.  I'll even change my sig.</div></div><hr />

Excellent, thank you for clearing things up.  Only going to point two things out....and they are not corrections.<br />
<br />
Replies to:<br />
<br />
1/3- I am all for more group content, but it needs to be varied and at the same time balanced.  It does the Devs no good to release 10 new zones and have one give the best loots/xp.  You just get 9 unused zones and 1 lagged out.  Kunark was great, but pushing 60 I believe only Seb and maybe Howling Stones catered with xp content.<br />
<br />
2- Narrowing the margin can be done, but you have to get the groupers out of PoP and LDoN.  Those zones are very &quot;comfortable&quot; and I see a lot of today's players not wanting to cross a few zones to new content when BoT is &quot;right next door&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Ive said this many times before.<br />
<br />
I dont WANT to raid.<br />
<br />
I dont NEED the best gear.<br />
<br />
The 1 question no non raider seems to answer is...<br />
<br />
Why do you want to have the same sort of stats as a hardcore raider ?.<br />
<br />
My shaman has about 5500 HP buffed thats plenty for what i do.<br />
<br />
Yes if i want to get flagged for some of the higher level planes and hunt there then its going to be tough but i dont WANT to get flagged and henceforth i dont NEED better gear.<br />
<br />
As they say you only get out what you put in.This is true in life as well as EQ dont forget.<br />
<br />
I dont want to play EQ for 40 hours or even 20 hours a week and for some reason im quite happy knowing that i wont get to Time etc.<br />
Yes i would like to see Time but i should imagine once youve done it a couple of times its probably much the same as any other zone in the game.<br />
<br />
One thing i would like to add is the fact that LDoN was a bone thrown to non raiders but SoE just seems to have forgotten about it and the dogs now tossed the bone aside and its sitting rotting.<br />
<br />
Another thing i do not agree with is things like new classes in that you have to own an expansion to play that class.<br />
Why should someone who has no interest in purchasing GoD because he may only get to use 3 or 4 zones in it be unable to play a certain class.<br />
Yes i know its done to get people to buy these expansions but that doesnt mean its right.<br />

Got 58 in Howling Stones - would have gotten it in Sky, but we finished clearing Isle 7 with me *this* close to 58 and nobody had remembered to spawn the Sister from bee isle so we couldn't get Sirran to spawn to get to 8.<br />
<br />
Got 59 in the Hole - down near the undead tower was fantastic grinding.  Could also pick off the basement named who was ALWAYS up and dropped two things a go.  :)  Can't remember his name now, was an erudite.<br />
<br />
Granted, the Hole was opened pre Kunark but it was essentially a Kunark zone.<br />
<br />
Got 60 in Chardok.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of places to get to 60 - in my late 50s I got a lot of XP in Chardok, the second floor of City of Mist, doing the forager cycle...  Deep Karnor's was all blue all the way to 60 and refreshingly clear of trains.   I think I zoned into Sebilis for XP once, maybe twice, any other time was to farm spells from juggs or kill Trak.<br />
<br />
Oooh!  Plane of Hate, that was great XP and you walked out with SO much cash when you did it with one group.  That was my first time treating an old raid zone as an xp zone.  I even finally got the Rune Etched BP that had always eluded me on Hate raids.<br />
<br />
There was a lot of great single group content.  Of course, very few people used half of it - what you wound up with was swarms of people crowded into Sebilis complaining that there wasn't enough to go around - but it was designed so a group with some degree of insanity could go and do crazy things for fun.  I had to buy a few coffins, I'll admit :)<br />
<br />
There's a huge amount of single group stuff available today, and when I go out looking it's almost always unused and my group can take its pick of stuff to do.<br />
<br />
People complaining about LACK of single group stuff to do are, I think, not complaining about the real problem - that is to say, the design in PoP where you take the most challenging single-group content that drops the best toys and gives the best xp and lock it behind a raid encounter.  If Sol Ro and up were designed for raids only, I don't think you'd see half the frustration that PoP has engendered - this would be following the old model of<br />
<br />
&quot;Raid to get into Veeshan's Peak, where you pretty much just raid&quot;<br />
&quot;Raid to get into Sleeper's Tomb, where you pretty much just raid&quot;<br />
&quot;Raid to get into Vex Thal, where you pretty much just raid&quot;<br />
<br />
And not<br />
<br />
&quot;Raid to get into the elemental planes, where you can have lots of fun with five other people when you're not raiding&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's late, just thought I'd add more junk to an already huge thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">I'll preface this by saying that I, personally, am a hardcore raider.  My guild is fairly recently Time flagged.  I have some Time gear.  I'm Kod'Taz flagged, and hope to see Uqua in the near future, as well.  By now, I'm sure several of the readers here have stopped to red-dot me, and won't read any further.<br />
<br />
For those still with me, though ...  I have several RL friends in the game.  Some of them also raid.  Many do not.  I have (obviously) more free time than is healthy, and so I help them out with planning equipment that is available to them, when I can.  Sometimes I take part in the kills - but I'm not so far above the curve that a non-raider shaman couldn't help in the places that I do.<br />
<br />
There is this conception that a non-raider will be in total junk for equipment, and its one that I just don't understand.  Maybe its the same reason I don't understand the &quot;there is only one zone&quot; approach to experience.  Everyone claims how essential Fire (or Earth, depending on who is claiming) is to experience at the high end.  I haven't spent more than two hours in those places, combined (other than raiding) in the last 2 months.  My AA bar moves just fine.  Likewise, there are plenty of drops available to the non-raider.  Often, they are rare, or in out-of-the-way places.  But they are there.  And the fact that they might take some reading to learn about or some time to get makes them worthwhile - because it sets the one-group player who gets them apart from the hordes of barely-trained monkeys who think that Gaukr Sandstorm is the most excitement that one group can have in this game.<br />
<br />
I don't have a one-group goal list set up for a shaman, because I don't have an RL shaman friend in that position.  But I've got one for a ranger, and I'll use that as an example of what is available.  (Almost) nothing on this list is a raid of any sort.  Some of it is challenging to get, don't get me wrong.  Keep in mind when you look at this, that the player this was intended for has been playing for a very long time (almost as long as I have), and this is by no means the first of these gear lists he has used as a goal sheet.  Working your way up is easier than jumping to the top, after all.<br />

* This one is a raid drop, albeit from a small raid.  It was an item that interested the player, and I'll be helping to put the event together.  For the true non-raiding experience, sub in another piece of LDoN 1492 gear here - its almost as good, anyway.<br />
** This one might be a 2-3 group raid for non-raid-geared players, not to mention the trick of finding Dozekar the Cursed actually alive.  I've one-grouped him with very much non-raiding people in the other 5 slots, and I'd argue that a group of people equipped in anything even halfway close to this profile would drop him like a bad habit.  Even so, its on the list mostly because its simply too good of an item for him NOT to try to get.<br />
*** This is clearly a raid item.  Rings 1-9 are soloable/duoable, however, and at least on my server, the population is usually amenable to pickup 10th ring wars.  If your server is not so kind, or you just really want your gear to be raid-free, there are no shortage of solid rings.  A rather nice one drops in Ferubi, and even the LDoN point buy Ring of Mold is reasonably good.<br />
<br />
All told, the raw bonuses from gear are over 400 AC, around 1800 hp, and over 1500 mana.  There are enough saves to put all this ranger's unbuffed saving throws to 120 or higher.  It has 95 points of +ATK gear.  It has 41% haste.  It has FT 6.  It even has a spell range focus and Plainsight.  And this is before adding any augmentations at all.  Is this hard to get?  You're absolutely right it is.  But its done without raiding.  Heck, most of the people this player groups with aren't even people I know.  They are other (many of them non-raiding) people he's met along the way, while farming for LDoN points, or eeking out groups in out of the way zones like Riwwi.<br />
<br />
Every class in the game can look like this - or better - without raiding.  And this ranger profile is frankly better than a lot of VT/early PoP level raiding rangers.  Honestly, I think we have a ranger or two in my Time guild that doesn't match this profile for raw hp or armor class.<br />
<br />
And ... its not like this is the end.  This is just another upgrade chart.  There have been perhaps a dozen before this, and there'll likely be that many after it.  He doesn't always finish one before starting the next.  This one likely will be no different (that Barindu earring is being particularly elusive at the moment), and he's thinking about backing out of doing the quest for the belt and neck.  But you'll see there is no bracer off the Tipt boss on this list, nothing from Kod'Taz, or the one-group Ikkinz trials.  That's next.  I won't argue the difficulty of Tipt, KT, or Ikkinz.  But dressed like this (or thereabouts), he'll be ready to try it.  And because he's played with other people, been personable, and been willing to take the initiative some time, he's got a channel full of friends (about 5-10 on at their peak play times, in general - so I suppose they *could* do a 2-group-ish mini raid if needed) who will be willing to help get there with him, and who have similar goals and aspirations that don't need a 72 man raid to get them, or even a 18 man raid.  They've already been learning how to kill mobs at the Vxed zone in without dying.  I imagine they'll be beating it soon - quite possibly without me even along.<br />
<br />
Sure, they'll never have the Elemental or Time drops that I'm wearing.  But, you know what?  I'd replace my Phase 1 Time mask with the mask that can drop off any mob in Kod'Taz.  And this ranger, and his friends, will see Kod'Taz some day, and be able to loot that mask.  Casual play has rewards, and they are almost as good as the rewards that we raiders enjoy.  Its hard!  Don't get me wrong.  But I don't think its any harder than what a raiding guild member has to deal with - the drama of backflags and login numbers, of recruiting and guildhopping, of the 15% visa limit and Coirnav kills and Time rotations and ....<br />
<br />
Oh ... and as a closing, to make this post germane to the original topic of this thread ... by the time they get to where they are going, this ranger and his friends will have all their spells except the Ancients (their friendly clerics may or may not wind up all having Divine Intervention, not sure yet).  With the changes to GoD spells, that'll happen even faster.<br />
<br />
Casual EQ.  1-group EQ.  Its not dead (check out the amount of GoD stuff on that list!), and its not all doom and gloom.  Its just not handed out free by logging in and grinding XP in BoT and hoping Oreen doesn't get trained to the 4-way (again).<br />

I grow weary of this debate. I am especially enjoying the parts where Iz goes back and picks apart expansions that he PLAYED FULL TIME DURING! Luclin? Early POP?

Pred is right, Iz, your just bitter. New Rope Syndrome. EQ will never be right for you until its as close to Diablo 2 as you can get, you know, the game that you can SOLO the GODS in and they drop the BEST GEAR IN THE GAME, SOLO!<br />

If you are equalling casual EQ with 1-group EQ I have to disagree. While it is commendable that you took time to list all these wonderful things that might be 1-groupable most of them are not realistic for a casual player.<br />

You seem to enjoy the raiding lifestyle and I certainly dont think SOE is dumb enough to remove that from EQ so there is no reason for all the anger. What some of us here are hoping for is that they decide to add some extra incentives for other people than your kind - not taking anything away from you and yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that a person with almost no skill, but lots of time, can get the very very best gear in the game isnt anything new. They may not be as skilled, but they are at LEAST willing to follow the path the game has laid out to the top of the food chain. <br />
<br />
Spirit, I enjoy a wide mix of the game. I like to raid, I like single grouping, I like soloing, I like tradeskilling, I used to be quite a merchant until the plat fiascos, I like helping new people, I like helping small guilds, I like hangin out with the top level gearguys on the server, I like making twinks, I like getting PLed, I like PLing other people. <br />
<br />
I like EQ. I think its a great way to pass my spare time. Its cheap, even if they did rip us all off with the Gates-OoW thing. It may be buggy, but up until this current dx9 fiasco, it was damn stable, 99% up and running when I wanted to play. <br />
<br />
But I play the game. All of it. I do LDoN to improve my character. I raid to improve my character. I solo and grind AAs to improve my character. I PLAY the GAME, they way its laid out. So do LOTS AND LOTS of other people. We like the GAME, the way its laid out.<br />
<br />
Sure, theres things I would like to see changed. I have posts and posts and posts of them, some even on this thread. I am not ignorant to the plight of the non-raider. I agree flagging is lame. I agree the gear gap is too big. But I get over it, and you know why? Cause it just aint fun focusing on all the negatives in anything. <br />
<br />
EQ will never be fixed for guys like Snoww and Iz. Snoww realizes it fully. He knows what kind of game EQ is and has decided its not for him anymore. He did the raid thing, dindt care for it. I am sorry. I hope someday the game modifies and progresses to a point where he can try again and it will be better. Iz just wants to change it COMPLETELY from whats its been the past 5 years into . . . something else. <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I don't have answers. I hope the EPs get opened, but that wouldnt be enough for most of the whiners here. They would want EP molds off 1-groupers next. People like this are never satisfied. The day they open the EPs guys like Iz will be here asking where his Time-level stuff is. They re-tuned Gates down. Bazaar guys are doing Vexd and Tipt. OOPS! NOT ENOUGH! Still some flagged zones!! (never mind that all but the final 3 or 4 zones in the expansion are obtainable by single group flags, doesnt count).<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter anymore, honestly. Hope the door doesnt hit all you folks leaving on the ass on the way out. More bandwidth for me, I guess. Sorry you have decided that you cant design the game around your specific &quot;vision&quot;. Its a LONG way from my &quot;vision&quot;, let me tell ya, but I still play because I enjoy it. Glass is half full for me. And I really feel sory for all you half-empty guys who only see the negative, and dwell on it until it becomes some burning obbsession that blocks out anything positive that ever exsisted. Honestly, thats the attitude I see here, and its truly weak. The arguements you guys throw out are weak. The bitterness is so blatant it makes every word out of your mouths weak. Keep charging that windmill though guys, who knows, maybe the WoW people will read this and make YOUR game for you. Somehow, I doubt it though.</div></div><hr />

It's simple ...no pain no gain. Getting flagged is pain enough no need for every fresh lvl 65 noob to run there and turn EP's into another BoT ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">Is the player summit thing a uberguild and a few others type of thing?<br />
<br />
Or is it a more Balanced invitation list?<br />
<br />
I have heard alot of partial information on this. Is there any way we could get an idea of the invites list so we can see what sort of index of the population is going and argueing thier case?<br />
<br />
I know Gloriana is going and will be a very good representive of shaman issues and possibly the mid teired elemental guild issues.  What I am curious about is will she be drowned out by a huge amount of the way upper guild representives. (Though I am betting she will go in swinging and can hold her own.)<br />
<br />
And Blazz and Predicus and others. Just because the raider game is the way it is doesnt mean it can expand again to encompass both styles of gaming. They are not mutuily exclusive. It is mostly a question of how much time money and love goes into the design. But if it continues down the path of raid or die. then the game will falter. Because with compitition comeing out that will cater to people of a like mindset to me We will leave. And we are the base of EQ. Maybe not the strongest or the most vocal but without the foundation EQ will crumble from it's own weight.<br />
<br />
Word of mouth goes both ways. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">Is the player summit thing a uberguild and a few others type of thing?<br />
<br />
I was wondering the same thing Snoww. I am an officer in a guild on Povar and I don't recall hearing anything about this summit. I am very close friends with my guild leader on Tunare and didn't hear anything about this summit from him either. Both are family guilds and both have been active for a couple years now. Where is our representation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">According to the event coordinator I spoke to on the phone, they are inviting one representative from the top ranked guild on each server (Not every server has a guild rep going). For example, on Erollisi Marr, the only guild invite was Hothgar from Magister (Not sure if he's going). They have also invited community representation. I know that Gemdiver (Graffe's), Woody (GU comics), Sobe (Druid's Grove), Flicka (Safehouse) and the person from Steel Warriors (can't remember name) have also been invited.<br />
<br />
The event coordinator said they expected between 50-70 people to attend. It should be an interesting perspective for me, since although my guild is a Time guild, we aren't on the same tier as the top ranked guilds on each server. I've always said about my guild, we do everything the uber guilds do, it just takes us a year longer (which suits the playtime of the majority of us who work full time and have families).<br />
<br />
I specifically asked for shaman issues to bring with me since I was invited as a representative of the shaman community. I will print the entire &quot;suggestions&quot; thread and take it with me.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I doubt very much the uber vs. casual argument is even going to come up. If it does come up, even after reading this thread, I have no idea what I would say. Even the people who argue for more non raid content don't agree what it should be.<br />
<br />
I will listen to everything and take careful notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Even the people who argue for more non raid content don't agree what it should be.<br />
Would say the same for the other side as well. There are almost as many opinions of how things SHOULD be as there are people posting to this thread. That, in and of itself, is a large part of the difficulty SOE faces. You cannot make everyone happy, and trying too will ultimately lead to disaster. I think the game needs more non-raid content. I like Iz's other thread, and I hope people post positive ideas there, and I hope SOE reads them. <br />
<br />
But in the end, there are some things about EQ that no amount of posting will ever change, and thats the thing I struggle with the MOST from some people here. Fix the game, sure. Modify it in some small ways to help a certain segment of the population, absolutely, but there are some folks with such radical ideas that if they had their way, it would be a COMPLETELY different game. <br />
<br />
Who knows. I do know this though. Absor and Brenlo are reading this thread. Lots of good stuff in here. Maybe, JUST maybe, given SOEs new &quot;maybe we should listen a little harder&quot; attitude it will make a difference.</div></div><hr />

Blazz, a lot of what you post here is thoughtful and logical.  I appreciate that, I really do.  But this is just asinine.  You're falling into the pit of berating people for pointing out the problems with the system.  Some people would rather fight for what they want than settle for a mushed down version of something that used to be a lot of fun.  I can understand that your Pollyanna mentality doesn't allow for reasonable discussion on the matter anymore (see no evil, and all) but I can't figure out if you're trying to convince everyone to don't worry, be happy... or if you're genuinely as pissed off as you sound that they have the audacity to voice their anger/dissatisfaction.<br />
<br />
It IS POSSIBLE that SoE knows something is wrong, and they simply don't have a good idea of how to fix it.  You can make the educated guess from the last 3 expansions, the new class, and the recent spell/AA lists (for shamans at least) that SoE is severely lacking in clues as to the state of EQ.  You could then go out on a limb and suppose that the only reasonable way to GET said clue will be to listen to the playerbase.  If all they hear from us is &quot;man, the game really sucks right now, but I'll keep playing it and not bother to complain&quot; -- do you honestly think that gives them a basis from which to start fixing it?<br />
<br />
We operate under the assumption that there's still hope, because if we didn't love what this game used to be, and we didn't have hope, we'd have already stopped discussing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Loral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">I applaud Absor on his post.  It takes guts to speak plainly on a subject of such a heavy debate.  I would like to address some of his points as only a high elf bureaucrat can:<br />
<br />
<br />
No, people should not be able to attain the same gear through easier paths (like it or not, group content is easier than raid content, you've given many reasons why it is easier when you state why you don't like it).<br />
What defines what is easier or harder?  I've had single groups that took every ounce of my power to save while I've fallen asleep for two hours on a raid and no one noticed.<br />
<br />
If ease or difficulty is based on the time to acquire it, LDON style adventure point systems can help people go through the same difficulty in time as raiders do to acquire similar gear<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, there should be content for people to do that isn't raiding.  Luckily, we have a lot of that.<br />
<br />
For those under 65, yes.  For those at 65, no.  Many people have hit a wall in progression because they have spent a lot of time but do not want to raid.  These people need more content for their style of play.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't like raiding but you do enjoy playing the game, then there is a lot of content to do with single groups.  If you've actually done all of that consider a new character.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to start a new character.  All of my friends know me as Loral.  Others feel the same.  They have time they're willing to spend playing but have little progress they can make without raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some folks have said things like - people should be able to get similar gear (just make the graphics nicer for the raid people) without raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that it shouldn't be easy to get but it shouldn't require a raid.  There is a false premise that raiding = hard, grouping = easy.  If you mean raiding is a pain in the arse, thats true.  I'm not sure I'd consider that a sales point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any game system with progression will have an amount of have's and have-nots.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are the criteria of the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;haves nots&quot;?  Is it the time they spend?  I know lots of people with huge &quot;/played&quot; times but none of the gear the uberguilders have.  Is it skill?  What determines skill, staying awake until 3am for a Quarm raid?  Is it their guild tag?  Why should people have to switch guilds to have new content?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just not going to debate the &quot;casual&quot; vs. &quot;uber&quot; thing here.  I do want to repeat that if you are a casual player and you spend so much of your time yearning for items or abilities that are out of your reach that you don't enjoy playing, then you're not a casual player.  A casual player plays in their free time to have some fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Progress is fun.  Being unable to progress because of one's guild tag is not fun and tears apart players who want to stay with their friends but also progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just not possible to build one game that everyone can play the way they want to.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think we're asking for that.  We're asking for more equipment options for level 65 players who don't want to be in an uberguild and don't want to raid.  Its very simple.<br />
<br />
Again, I thank Absor for coming and speaking plainly about this.  I also thank the friendly Shamen of the Crucible for inviting me in and not putting me in a big pot...yet.  *grabs up his robe and runs off into the night*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">If you are equalling casual EQ with 1-group EQ I have to disagree. While it is commendable that you took time to list all these wonderful things that might be 1-groupable most of them are not realistic for a casual player.<br />
<br />
Casual EQ at 65 might not be dead but it sure isnt exciting either.<br />
<br />
Casual EQ is dead.  Everquest was never designed to fit the casual player.  Everquest has never catered to many market: young players, science fiction fans, shoot 'em up fans, sports fans.  Does this make EQ a poor game? -only to those that wanted those aspects catered to them.  EQ was designed around a D&amp;D concept- a long, in-depth RPG for the teenager/young adult community that had ample free time and a semi-liquid income.  Pointing this out this late in the game is like pointing out &quot;hey, there's woodelfs in the game!&quot;  <br />
<br />
SOE has put in many tools for those leveling from 1-65, but not to cater to the casual player.  It catered to those that were becoming disgruntled with level progression, and to teach people of where to go to group and what to do/not to do.  The one major side-effect that I see to this is that people leveled faster, and we have a lot of 65's who are used to the expedited pace.  I see many 65 level players that: don't know where to go to make pp, don't know where X zone is, don't know how to get to Y zone without a port, don't want to go any farther than 2 zones away from PoK.  <br />
<br />
That is the problem I see with the game today.  PoP trivialized the need to watch your butt and pay attention.  PoP created the &quot;semi-afk&quot; player- there is no longer the thrill of keeping the group alive because if you don't- the group just pops back at the zone-in 15 minutes later.  SOE has revamped many older zones, and they are EMPTY.  I was in PoHate last night soloing, and I think I saw a total of 8 players over a 6 hour period.  I see the same 6-8 players in Droga- I see 1-2 in Nurga.  I see 2-3 in Chardokb, 4-5 in Chardok, and 0 in Siren's Grotto.  The named spawn rate in Droga is ridiculous- I have literally made over 1000k in that zone, but I still go there because people will still pay 10k for a copper hammer of striking.<br />
<br />
Players don't want to leave BoT, Raiders don't want to leave PoTime- that is the problem.  We can sit here a post an itemized list of how to get a non-raid shaman to 5k unbuffed, and get baulked at because it can't be done unless people leave their comfort zone.  There is content out there- stop hanging out by the waterhole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Non-raiding players will typically cap at BoT/HoH/Barindu-sewers.<br />
<br />
For those zones, you require no raiding experience, only 5 friends and level 62-65.<br />
<br />
In those zones, you can get runes (all PoP level 65 spells) as well as Balance of Nihil and Daluda's Mending.<br />
<br />
That makes the only spells UNavailable to the non-raider to be Breath of Trushar and the Ancient spells (2 in high Luclin zones and 1 in high GoD).  Of those 4 spells that you don't have access to one is a nearly useless poison dot, one is a totally worthless &quot;upgrade&quot; to avatar, one is a mediocre upgrade to Quiescence, and the last is a significant upgrade to Can4.<br />
<br />
So, in review, with the exception of the Ancient Canni, what spells, exactly, do you feel like you don't have access to yet need?<br />
<br />
Beyond that, what else do raiders get that non-raiding players don't?  They get better zone access which provides them somewhat better exping grounds, better drops, progression.<br />
<br />
For the non-raiding player who spends their time milking an AA per hour in BoT (not good enough for you?....) you do NOT need 7K hitpoints... you do NOT need the extra 5-10% on your focus effects... you do NOT need the progression...  you just WANT it because you're jealous that other people have it and you do not.<br />
<br />
Newsflash: the people that have it busted their asses for it.  They have the gear, the flags, and the perks because they invested time AND money into doing it.  You stating that you paid for the expansion means nothing till you can say you have put in the effort as well.  You only have completed HALF of the quest... money is 50% of the process, folks... stop thinking that you are OWED something that you haven't earned.<br />
<br />
The non-raiding players have whined so much that Sony had to give in and they openned up zones in PoP and made nice gear available in LDON... but that's not good enough for you... no... you want full access to everything without working for it.  You want SolRo today... and you'll want Elemental/Time tomorrow... and a month after that it won't be good enough till you have Kod'taz or even Uqua access...<br />

<br />
I never said I wanted access to “raid content” solo or with a single group.<br />
I never said I wanted things to be easy, or handed to me. I have worked for everything I have in this game. No eBay or pp purchases.<br />
I never said I wanted access to Time or some such.<br />
<br />
What I have said I want is Progression. <br />
Another good word would be Accomplishment.<br />
<br />
That’s why everyone plays this game, only difference between players is what fulfills those things for us.<br />
<br />
For some it is role-playing. For others it’s exploring. For others still it is the social aspects, making friends and spending time together.<br />
<br />
Do you really think you raid to Raid? If so, you would hit the same targets night after night if there were NO loot drops, NO flags to get. You don’t, in fact you would quit overnight if you got nothing for your efforts.<br />
<br />
I greatly enjoyed EverQuest for the progression I have had. A big thing for me is character development so improving my gear, getting skills, spells, AAs, etc. Well as a non-guild/non-raider I have no progression left. The top of the food chain for me is BoT. Level 65 shaman, 120 AA, all my level 65 spells. Heck it took me several months to save the cash to buy my spells. I did it, and then everything ended for me it seems.<br />
<br />
What is left for me?<br />
<br />
I could work on a full set of Ornate, though I cant single group all the drops. Buying it would be in the 600-800kpp range, or about 8-10 months of farming cash drops for me.<br />
<br />
The other option is LDoN gear. <br />
Approximately 5000 points per fully augmented piece of gear<br />
About 1.5-2 hours per adventure (LFG time, setup time, adventure time)<br />
51 points per adventure<br />
That works out to be 150-200 hours of LDoN per piece of gear<br />
For say 10 pieces of gear that’s up to 2000 hours to get a set<br />
At 20 hours a week, that would be 2 years of playtime.<br />
<br />
Does anyone think that is a reasonable Progression?<br />
<br />
After all that work, what content do I play in? A handful of more zones?<br />
<br />
A thing is worth what you pay for it. I don’t want anything handed to me.<br />
I paid for my level 65 shm, in time and effort, now there is nothing left to work for.<br />
<br />
Again I am grateful to Alan for posting the SOE “vision” for EverQuest. Knowing that things won’t be changing, and that the insight I have come to at level 65 is correct makes it much easier to be ending my billing.<br />
<br />
I also want to thank Brenlo for posting here. While your statement that spells will be easier to acquire is welcome it wont help the over all issues for the non-raider.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">Maybe I'm just dense, and don't understand what some of you want as a &quot;casual player&quot;.  I'm not trying to be patronizing here, honestly.  I'm NOT a casual player ... I play 6 hours a day, on average, 6 days a week.  I know what kind of player I am.<br />
<br />
But then, someone posts here that the items I listed are impossible for a casual gamer to acquire.  And I'm left wondering ... why not?<br />
<br />
I am assuming that a truly casual player plays 2-3 hours per day, 2-4 days per week, but as nevertheless managed to get 65 + the really essential AA.  How do you then progress?  Make friends.  There are always other people on.  Do some crappy pickup groups for a week (I'd suggest LDoN over BoT to make this goal easier), and look for the people that are on regularly in your play window.  Find a few that are competant and make friends.  Set up a channel that you all autojoin.  Plan some grouping.  There are LOTS of great places in the game that are bring-your-own-group.  This is how to get it!<br />
<br />
Some of the items on that list take a lot of time to get.  The random drops in GoD are really rare, and take days of killing.  But they don't have to be all at once.  Heck, I soloed for a Fractured Obsidian Band, 2 hours at a time.  Took me a week or so.  Its way easier with some friends.  The drops from Vxed named?  Yeah, they are nasty, but a chanter charm pet + weaponshield ranger makes one dead real quick - and requires no gear at all (some AA on the chanter is nice, true, but still...).  If you're, say, farming Umbiki (who also drops Nihil, as a nod to the fact that this IS a shaman board), the time from zone-in to dead Umbiki can be as little as 15 minutes if you're lucky with the spawns.  And that's not with an amazing, Time-geared group.  I've done it with 4 people in 30 minutes, and of them I was the only one that had any raid gear on at all.<br />
<br />
The last time I logged in, I went through GFay on my way to an LDoN, and some level 2 wood elf warrior sent me a tell asking if I &quot;had any gear to give.&quot;  I can't help but feel this casual gaming argument is like that wood elf.  There's plenty of stuff out there, and its doable.  But its not free.  If casual gamers - especially ones that post on assorted boards lamenting casual gaming - spent that time looking at possible drops, making some in-game contacts, and taking some risks visiting new places, then they'd be in gear that looks like that list.<br />
<br />
And if that level of equipment doesn't satisfy you, and you STILL don't want to raid ... then, yes, its probably time to find a new game.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">I think there is a great deal of confusion going on here.<br />
<br />
I never said I wanted access to “raid content” solo or with a single group.<br />
I never said I wanted things to be easy, or handed to me. I have worked for everything I have in this game. No eBay or pp purchases.<br />
I never said I wanted access to Time or some such.<br />
<br />
What I have said I want is Progression. <br />
Another good word would be Accomplishment.<br />
<br />
That’s why everyone plays this game, only difference between players is what fulfills those things for us.<br />
<br />
For some it is role-playing. For others it’s exploring. For others still it is the social aspects, making friends and spending time together.<br />
<br />
Do you really think you raid to Raid? If so, you would hit the same targets night after night if there were NO loot drops, NO flags to get. You don’t, in fact you would quit overnight if you got nothing for your efforts.<br />
<br />
I greatly enjoyed EverQuest for the progression I have had. A big thing for me is character development so improving my gear, getting skills, spells, AAs, etc. Well as a non-guild/non-raider I have no progression left. The top of the food chain for me is BoT. Level 65 shaman, 120 AA, all my level 65 spells. Heck it took me several months to save the cash to buy my spells. I did it, and then everything ended for me it seems.<br />
<br />
What is left for me?<br />
<br />
I could work on a full set of Ornate, though I cant single group all the drops. Buying it would be in the 600-800kpp range, or about 8-10 months of farming cash drops for me.<br />
<br />
The other option is LDoN gear. <br />
Approximately 5000 points per fully augmented piece of gear<br />
About 1.5-2 hours per adventure (LFG time, setup time, adventure time)<br />
51 points per adventure<br />
That works out to be 150-200 hours of LDoN per piece of gear<br />
For say 10 pieces of gear that’s up to 2000 hours to get a set<br />
At 20 hours a week, that would be 2 years of playtime.<br />
<br />
Does anyone think that is a reasonable Progression?<br />
<br />
After all that work, what content do I play in? A handful of more zones?<br />
<br />
A thing is worth what you pay for it. I don’t want anything handed to me.<br />
I paid for my level 65 shm, in time and effort, now there is nothing left to work for.<br />
<br />
Again I am grateful to Alan for posting the SOE “vision” for EverQuest. Knowing that things won’t be changing, and that the insight I have come to at level 65 is correct makes it much easier to be ending my billing.<br />
<br />
I also want to thank Brenlo for posting here. While your statement that spells will be easier to acquire is welcome it wont help the over all issues for the non-raider.<br />
<br />

Saar, I definitely agree with what you say- but you stopped at LDoN normal as it was the end of group progression.  When I started doing LDoN normal- it was hard.  People died routinely and there was a 50/50 chance that you would succeed.  Now I enjoy doing LDoN hard, and rarely lose them. (damn low drop rate collects)  The point I am trying to make is that you will get to the point where you can complete LDoN hards in the same amount of time as LDoN normals- thereby cutting your progress rate in half.  On top of this there is GoD content where you can upgrade nearly every piece of gear you own.  These items are superior to LDoN purchased items.<br />
<br />
So the progression for non-raiders is:<br />
<br />
LDoN normal/PoP- get a few pieces of ornate/ldon gear until content is<br />
                         trivial.<br />
<br />
LDoN hard- more points per win = faster progression/ldon hard dropped<br />
                items <br />
<br />
GoD- GoD gear drop items to further hp/mana/focus effect/ft.  Faster<br />
        collection of augments to cut ldon purchase cost.<br />
<br />
A non-raid shaman can and will break 4.5k hitpoints if he follows this progression line.  My guess is that, upon completion of Kod'taz farming, a non-raid shaman could be sitting at around 5.2-5.5k hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u243"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p243">Just a shot in the dark, but here's the &quot;next progression&quot; possibly.  Shortly after the new expansion comes out, we'll see the Elemental planes opened up.  Why?  Well, all the &quot;casual&quot; players will reach level 70 eventually, and a group or two of level 70 players can most likely do well in EP.  By then, most folks (raiding guilds) who can access PoTime will be moving on to GoD and the new expansion.  Same story we've seen in the past.<br />
<br />
BTW, dang nice posts Predicus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">If you still want to play and progress- then do your research, a non-raid shaman can hit 4-4.5k unbuffed with group content/quests.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Off topic, but man, tell me how to do that!  I need some shaman lessons hehe.  I'm at under 3200 unbuffed, i guess i could do oh, about 350 LDON's (17000 (!) pts) to get 40 hp augs (1150 pts a piece) for say, 15 slots... that's only 600 more hp's...  my gear ain't the best, but I have a hard time finding upgrades, let me tell ya.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">For those that say they don't have time to progress, I am really sorry but that is how the game was designed.  In a progression-based game, there is absolutely no way to balance the progression of casual/non-casual players without trivializing someone's accomplishments.  For those that are coming to the realization that EQ is a timesink, where were you the first 64 levels?  Did you think the game was going to change once you dinged 65?  Raiding is part of EQ's design.  It is not required for those than want to progress to 65, it is designed to allow players to continue past 65 with more content.  If you choose not to partake in this content, then do not expect the same rewards.  If you do not have the time to partake in this content, then again I am sorry, but I think you need to find a game that fits better with your schedule. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok sorry, that post was just so long and boring, it's taking me a while to get through it all.  And the few posts after it had their heads up this poster's arse.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows the game is a grind.  No one here is touting instant gratification and the &quot;Time loot off of fire beetles&quot; route.  It's about a choice for people to make.  The whole point in the raider vs. non-raider argument is that it there is exactly one and only one way to achieve anything.  I WANT to grind post-65 and will put in enormous numbers of hours to do it, but it gets me absolutely no where near what a raider can get to.<br />
<br />
And no one is even saying, give a non-raider the exact same gear.  If I hear another argument about Time gear off of fire beetles I'm going to puke.  Jeez, just make it in the same ball park at least.  The gap between 200+ hp stuff and arguably the best non-raid items (~100hp's or so) is just too huge.  <br />
<br />
Give choices and have loot available that is worth the time and effort to get, that's all I ask.<br />

Ignorance and apathy, quite a combination.<br />
<br />
The reason that the gear is markedly different is that raiders couldn't survive many encounters without the extra hitpoints. The fact that they can solo mobs in lesser plains is just a side effect.<br />
<br />
If I hear one more post about open up SolRo Tower I will cry. You lot don't want to be able to grind there because you get better xp in BoT. What you really want is to be able to wake up, rub your eyes, and see a pile of shiny ornate molds at your feet. There are currently three reasons to go to Sol Ro:<br />
<br />
1) Ornate drops<br />
2) Raiding<br />
3) A quiet place to get away from the BoT crowd<br />
<br />
I'd rather see ornate molds priced like water and put on every vendor than give up #3.<br />
<br />
If they choose to open up the elemental planes to the non-raiding, casual, probably-plays-twice-as-much-in-a-week-than-I-do player I am fine with it. All I ask is that SoE give me 200aa on the day they do so. Not that I deserve 200aa (which is what I probably would have ground if I hadn't been raiding to progress and equip my character), but simply because if you guys get something for nothing I want the same.<br />
<br />
Alternatively give a good, honest, unbiased, reason why you should get markedly better equipment without having to face elemental encounters and I'll change my opinion. Hang on, scratch that, I doubt I would.<br />
<br />
Cheerio.</div></div><hr />

Check out the named mobs in the Tipt/Vxed/Sewer trials.  Some quick info, though:<br />
<br />
Tipt: 2 named every trial<br />
<br />
Enraged Cragbeast drops augs: 30hp/30end; 30hp/30mana; ft2/regen 2; regen 2/atk 15?<br />
<br />
The cool thing about the hp augs is that they are slot all/all- really nice to plug them into 3 slot LDoN gear (check out my BP in my magelo)<br />
<br />
Kyv Hunter Bob: drops 4 bracers and some sword- chain bracer has 140hps on it if I remember correctly<br />
<br />
Vxed: a few drops for shamans (long trial folks)<br />
<br />
Kyv Hunter Jim: drops 100hp/100mana chain legs<br />
<br />
Ukun Bloodbeast: drops 90hp ring<br />
<br />
Ikavv Something: drops 80hp belt?<br />
<br />
Beluda angry mom: drops 120hp shield w/ EE4 (end boss-always up)<br />
<br />
Barindu: <br />
<br />
rare drop off common mobs: 100hp/100mana ft2 ring<br />
<br />
noc something: drops 80hp boots?<br />
<br />
Sewers: 80hp cloak, 100 hp belt, 100 hp earring<br />
<br />
Basically, do some research on GoD zones.  There are a lot of one-groupable drops out, and also a lot of augs. (Ferubi consistly yields 35hp/35mana/35end augs) Also, look at the drops from LDoN hards- the gear is out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">I personally played my character for every flag, for every trial, and for every single piece of loot that he wears.  I EARNED my stuff and I don't like you whiney little children complaining that I have it and you don't.  If you want, go and get it... stop asking for it to be GIVEN to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Is the player summit thing a uberguild and a few others type of thing?<br />
<br />
Or is it a more Balanced invitation list?<br />
<br />
I have heard alot of partial information on this. Is there any way we could get an idea of the invites list so we can see what sort of index of the population is going and argueing thier case?<br />
<br />
I know Gloriana is going and will be a very good representive of shaman issues and possibly the mid teired elemental guild issues.  What I am curious about is will she be drowned out by a huge amount of the way upper guild representives. (Though I am betting she will go in swinging and can hold her own.)<br />
<br />
Snoww Brokenhammer retired Bashy Bear  E marr<br />
<br />
I know that I heard that at least the guild leader of like the 3rd or 4th top guild (Xenosis) on Terris is invited.  I'd imagine if *they* are, then a LOT of the other top guilds are as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">[EDIT: Directed at Ug and Karshak, EDITED AGAIN: hehe, sorry, understood guys]  I said nothing about being given anything, opening an zones, or getting something for nothing.  Jeez. Did you read my post?  I don't need to play in your sandbox with your toys.  Man.  Talking about reading in to it.<br />
<br />
All I said provide an alternate choice, with comparable gear, that is a challenge to get.  Revamping loot tables on older zones to be more in line with today's items would be pretty cool I think.<br />
