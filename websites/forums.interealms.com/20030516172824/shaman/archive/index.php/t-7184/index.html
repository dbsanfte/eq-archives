<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Riever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks Im a new shammy to the site. Ingame im Riever Archane a Shaman of the 32nd season, loyal follower of Mithanil Marr. Sullon Zek server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just yesterday a fellow shaman showed me a pair of boots which he said were the shaman epic boots. Call me a noob, but I have only ever heard of an epic weapon. The stats on the boots where decent, and they had an effect of SoW casting time 4seconds. The name of the boots slipped my mind. I was just curious how to get these boots, and if there is any other &quot;epic&quot; gear that I do not know about. Could someone provide me with an explanation, or a link to a site that has all the info?... I would greatly appritiate any help you could give me.<br />
<br />
I would also be happy to assist any of you with any questions you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The shaman epic is fairly unusual in that you get 3 items from it, which are progressively better. They are the shield of falsehood (not very good), black fur boots (pretty nice clicky effect) and of course the spear of fate.<br />
<br />
The sow effect on boots is in fact instant, you can cast it while running, while attacking, while dying - whenever you like. Its great for a dispell junk slot, and great for a quick escape when sow or scale of wolf drops at a bad time. I keep them handy in a bag - some people even use a main inventory slot to have em ready on a hotkey.<br />
<br />
For a walkthrough of the epic see http://www.eqshaman.com/epic/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Riever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is the earliest lvl you suggest starting this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can look up info on the quest at this site:<br />
http://eqshaman.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The boots are called black fur boots, and you can get them, with a group, in your 30's or 40's, depending on the number of people you bring. <br />
<br />
They are the result of the Test of Might, and involve killing Black Dire in Mistmore.<br />
<br />
They're very nice, I keep them in an inventory slot and click them all the time. It's just so useful. Totally instant cast.<br />
<br />
But in order to get your epic weapon, you'll end up with the following things: the epic shield of falsehood (really crappy), the black fur boots, and your epic itself. Only the boots and the epic are worth keeping :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can start in your 20's with the shield of falsehood. I did it with a 27 necro friend. Was real Easy. Just make sure you have EB and Invis VS Animals</div></div><hr />
