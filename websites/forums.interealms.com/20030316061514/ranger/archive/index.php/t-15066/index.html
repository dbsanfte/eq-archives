It takes two people, for one, and half the time the second person is standing there with nothing to do, and for two, It's blasted annoying dealing with all of the crap involved in hanging them down with brackets and the like.</div></div><hr />

Boy, you should tried installing them 15 years ago. Bring at *least* two people and a case of beer and plan to spend the DAY getting it dialed in right.<br />

Gah, I'm turning into a grumpy ol fart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My fiance works for a company that manufactures garage doors and openers. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I feel like a jackass asking a friend of mine to stand around with his thumb up his ass while I hang a Garage door opener where I need his help for ten minutes within a two hour project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I WISH my husband would have found someone to stand around looking stupid while he put up our garage door opener. I was willing to pay Home Depot $40 to come do it but NOOO, he had to do it himself, spend two days on the project, and dent our brand new garage door in three places.<br />

This is what professionals are FOR...</div></div><hr />
