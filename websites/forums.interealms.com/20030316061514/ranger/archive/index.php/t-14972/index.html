<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Puggins_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can 2box me and A 63 Cleric.<br />
<br />
Im a bit twinked (but not all slots covered, dont have a bp, legs or whatnot) but AC buffs cancel that out.  Anyway.<br />
<br />
Where can I PL at?  Since i dont have Slow/DS i am a bit limited in where I can pl at, but lookin for some Suggestions, Here is what I Was thinking.<br />
<br />
9-23 in PC<br />
23-30 in HK Goblins<br />
30-45 in CC<br />
45 on im clueless.   Was thinking LGuk, or Maybe Velks?  Anyone have some Idea's?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a note: 45 plus you can grp. with the cleric for XP, also here is a full guide IMO:<br />
<br />
9-25 Pauldal Caverns (23-25 is only another few hours, worth it to stay)<br />
25-30 HK gobbys? dunno what the XP per is solo on em but it seems like you do<br />
30-35 HK guards, 1st and 2nd floor with the 1st 1-2 on floor 3, about 17 of em at 3% per up to lvl 35ish (maybe higher, I left @ 34 and found some dblues at 39 :) )<br />
35-47 CC, stags -&gt; spiders -&gt; geos<br />
47-50 City of Mist enternace<br />
50-54 hole enterance<br />
54-57 sebs, velks, PoP<br />
57-65 + AA's PoP cannot be beat (so I'm told :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd head over to EW and do Walrus then Rhinos until they go LB.  Walrus' south of the keal ent is some of the best/easiest 40's xp out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Puggins_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the Suggestions.<br />
<br />
I have done PC so far, am 22nd now, Through one day too.<br />
<br />
EW?  I thought Walrus' blue out at 40ish.  I want to take on Even/Yellow's for the most part.  I was thinking of LGuk at 40, or CoM as Erlanthir said.  hopefully Ill have a Mage or Druid helpin by then.  Thanks again for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">? - 25 Paludal<br />
