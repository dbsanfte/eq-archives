<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I understand that the components needed for this awesome ring (AC10 WIS20 HP50) drop in PoJ.  From a post on Allakhazam:<br />
<br />
<br />
glittering ring: prisoners first floor of plane of justice.  Reccommend being 58+ so the guards and rats dont assist the prisoners. If you have your 61 or 62 pet use it, they are lvl 58 and the guards wont assist and agro your pet. Drop rate is about one per 25 prisoners on average. <br />
<br />
white diamond of justice: give an alkaline etched stone and a raw diamond to a shaman with imbue justice spell, 1k mana later he'll hand you a white diamond of justice. <br />
<br />
crystallized cloudy eye: drops only off scarabs, beetles, and locusts in the tunnel behind Priest of Tumagal on the 3rd floor (same floor punishers / enforcers are on) Click wall behind the dwarf priest ghost and it will open passage. <br />
Drop rate is about one in twenty off scarabs / demented locusts... bout one in fifteen off dread scarabs and enervating beetles if you go deeper in tunnel. <br />
<br />
alkaline etched stone: only list this because you need it to make the diamonds. drops off mindless tunnelers, shadow ravegers, eyeless gnawers, and rampaging burrowers. Its possible they can drop off the named mobs in the area but the named are too rare to concern yourself with. These worm type mobs are in the same general area as the beetles and locusts. Drop rate is pretty decent on the entrance worms, and plentiful... Reccommend camping the entrance area with a group till you get enough stones and raw diamonds. <br />
<br />
Raw diamond: used as a component for white diamond of justice... you can get these off the grolloks in the same tunnel behind priest, but punishers and enforcers are a lot easier to kill. Drop rate on raw diamonds is pretty high on the grolloks tho, thats where i get mine. <br />
<br />
Combine: White Diamond of Justice, Crystallized Cloudy Eye, Crystallized Cloudy Eye, Glittering ring -- in Planar Jeweler's Kit. (yes thats 2 cloudy eyes, you'll get dnc message with just one) <br />
<br />
Not trivial at 250 jewelcraft, however while combining with 280 wisdom and 250 dex I have made 6 out of 8 so far. I would recommend getting a focus, avatar, and kei before combine. Or if you are a shaman like myself just use your voice of the berserker spell or rabid bear... or both. <br />
<br />
Good luck with your rings friends. I'd estimate it taking you at least 3 days to get 2 rings if yer lvl 65. If you are below and need a group, it will probably take you a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the questions I have:<br />
<br />
1. What's the faction on the prisoners you have to kill to get the glittering ring?  Will I become KOS to guards and rats in POJ?  Will I have trouble getting to the trials room or walking around in POJ?<br />
<br />
2. Anything I should know about any of these camps?  I would like to do this with myself (59 shaman) and my wife (59 warrior).  Are we going to be able to pull it off or do we need a cleric and/or additional help?  I see a lot of the mobs are low 50's so theoretically it would be OK if adds are not a problem, but these PoP mobs are tough to judge by level alone.<br />
<br />
3. How prevalent are adds in the tunnels and how controllable are the circumstances down there?  What about in the jail cells where the prisoners are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DOH I just discovered that this ring is the Glittering Ring of Judgement, not the gallantry one.  Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still valid questions. I want to get an alkaline stone so I can imbue justice.....<br />
<br />
I just like having a full spellbook. I've got the imbue diamond spell and a raw diamond, but I won't pay 6k for an alkaline stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. prisoners are factionless.  rats or guards might add and might be level based, they dont bother me at 60.<br />
<br />
2. you could kill prisoners solo or duo.  No way you are getting an alkaline stone or cloudy eyes without help.  You will not be able to get in deep enough to even get a chance at a drop and they are very rare drops.<br />
<br />
3. you can not pull the caves you will have through them into the back where the locusts and beetles are.  the walls are paperthin.  your first pull is a 2 pull. then you can get a rock to the left solo or a wurm to the right solo as long as the second worm happened to be one of lower level worms or it would add likely bringing 2 friends for a total of 4.  Even if you get solo your looking at a 3 pull the next time.  after that a few singles then you start with the beetles (going left through the grallok is prolly easier but it much longer trip to get in deep enough for the right mobs).<br />
You will need a good chanter/bard or FD puller.   Also its an outdoor zone so harmony has some use.<br />
<br />
You should defintely fight prisoners in their cells if you can, besides guards/rats lotsa of morons get lost and agro half the zone around while they franticly try to find the zo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 65 you can pull 1 or 2 at a time in the caves at a time, slowed and with torpor they weren't too bad, I highly recommend you take at least one person with you though, just can't kill fast enough to be worth the time solo.  Rooting or snaring highly recommended.<br />
<br />
I was quite successful with a DC chanter, DC rats are good ;) and they can mez adds too.  That being said we got 1 stone in about 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, this is exactly what I needed, thanks.  Sounds like I need a full group with cleric, chanter, me, warrior, and some extra damage dealers  in the last two slots.</div></div><hr />
