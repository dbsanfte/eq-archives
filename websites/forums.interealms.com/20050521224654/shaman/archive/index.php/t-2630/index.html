<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found a guy that will sell it to me for 20k if I can come up with the money by Friday evening.<br />
<br />
Now I just need to come up with about 18k :D<br />
<br />
Any ideas what the absolute fastest way to do this would be? At this point my plan is to do Hill Giants every evening and see what else happens along the way, although this will change if I can think of anything else as I go.<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 56, with JBB/Epic, btw, if that helps with suggestions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks guys :cool:</div></div><hr />

Oh, and really good work looking for your spells in advance. I've seen so many rubes hit 59/60 then have to pay out the wazoo for their spells.</div></div><hr />

edit: I don't really know if I can sell the JBB... 1. it was a gift from my fiance, 2. I use it soooo much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not only is it docking your experience by 5%, it's been shown that JBB-wielding shaman tend to get more resists on slow, especially in high-exp zones. <br />
<br />
It's just not worth the trouble. Ditch the JBB for about 25k (what it goes for on my server) and be done with the wretched thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>moops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">got any monk friends? I dual box my 60 monk &amp; 55 shammy in necrosis in Seb when its open. In a 8 hour camp I average at least 10k &amp; up to 20k if I get really lucky &amp; alot of BD's drop. The 2 of us can hold all the spawns &amp; pull a few from zone out before repop. Of course people always want to join me &amp; that cuts down on the loot quite a bit. <br />
<br />
good luck<br />

Selling JBB might be good...and BD's is a very nice way to earn some cash.<br />
-<br />
<br />
One idea is getting a loan.  Have your guild, or a friend, loan you the money you need, if you dont have enough, and then jus pay him back over time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Torpor &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JBB.   and you can buy it back eventualy anyway.   Maybe you can Pawn shop it to a good friend?  sell at 18K, and promise to buy back in X time at 18.5K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just Farm HHK for cast, park your pet at zone, buff up and pull all Greenie guard to pet, you can kill around 30 guards every 25minute before repop, each guard drop FS sword plus some random cash, that will be about 450-600pp per hour depend on how lazy you are; there are plenty of guard around, more than enough for you to kill;<br />
<br />
you should bind at Rivervale, and gate after 7 full bag of FS weapon, the food seller ourside druid's guide con indifference so can get best price to sell FS weapon<br />
<br />
make it average 500pp per hours, it take 20hrs to get it. those green guard are never camp and hardly farm by other class, plus drop is very constant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">level 56? I would save my coins as I level up and wait until level 58-59 to buy this spell. Unless youre some kind of mad exp machine thats expecting to hit 60 within a week or two.<br />
<br />
Its got more common in the last month, another month down the line and it may be even more common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When you have a chance to get torpor, you take it.<br />
<br />
Sure, it may well come your way when you hit 60.  But you never know, and I knew I didn't want to hit 60 without having it.  <br />
<br />
First spell I memmed when I dinged to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Level 59 now. Was lucky enough to get Malo off the Emp in Seb last week. Getting nervous about Topor though. Haven't see a copy drop or a copy be sold in months.</div></div><hr />

I have never seen Torpor auctioned.  I'm only 53, but I'd swap my JBB for Torpor in a heartbeat - and then immediately start saving up to replace the JBB 8^)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you see Torpor/Malo for sale you buy it, do not hesitate, you will probaly regret it if you do and you might be one of those many 60 Shamans without it.<br />
<br />
I bought all my spells early (Malo at 51 and Torpor 57), a few times I passed up on a couple of spells but only because I really didnt have the money to spend and the seller was not as lenient as yours.  <br />
<br />
I cant tell you how many Shaman wait till they get the said level and then try to purchase the said spell and then relize they miss their opportunity.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I agree with you Seredith, the spell drops have been up it bit BUT they still damn rare.<br />
<br />
Also dont sell your JBB, you will regret that too, instead use the suggestions some gave you and I would make one more suggestion, Strip your none rare gear.  Meaning sell things you can replace easily, its what I did when I purchased my JBB, I had a seller that gave me 8 hours to get the cash so I sold everything on me and eventually got everything back.<br />
<br />
You can do my option and then go farming in the nude to get your easy to replace gear back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/nod Scurg<br />
<br />
Dat all be guud advice.<br />
<br />
Another thing...  I think the seller looks at your level.  If you are not level 60 they know the same thing you know...  you have TIME before you can scribe the spell and are not desperate.  If joo get your spells early you will a) have them *giggle* b) get them cheeper.<br />
<br />
Going /anon || /role does not seam to help much at all.  <br />
<br />
It is very nice to tern 60 and sit down and scribe a bunch of spells :).<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well at this point my plan is to do some hardcore and I mean hardcore farming of cash... if I can't come up with the amount I need by friday night then I will sell my JBB - I should be able to get 20k for it within half an hour on a friday night in the #market channel.<br />
<br />
I will get Torpor no matter how hard; I can certainly recognize the good deal - but I soooo don't want to sell the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Farm cash hard. If it looks like you are gonna be short sell your common gear. Sell the JBB last and only if you absolutely must. Dont sell the JBB because its the easiest way to a big chunk of change. Do it ONLY as a last resort. Sell everything else first. But the bottom line is get that spell. Its easily worth every penny of 20k and if you turn 60 without it you will cry.<br />
<br />
Avatar, Pox, VoB, Focus are nice spells. But no matter what your level, you dont really turn 60 till you scribe Malo and Torpor. These are what make 60 different and amazing. These are what separate what a 59 shaman can do from what a 60 shaman can do.</div></div><hr />
