<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I am a troll.   My current self-generated wisdom is 181.  I just spent 2,000 Platinum to go from 90 to 109 skill.  This seemed reasonalbe to me, but I wanted your opinions.<br />
<br />
Has anyone worked out the success rate &quot;economy&quot; of high wisdom?  For example, the next time I intend to spend 2,000 platinum on alchemy, would I be better served starting with a 100 platinum investment in KEI.  Now with a buffed wisdom of 206, will I find better results with my remaining 1,900 platinum?<br />
<br />
(Yes.  I really should be talking in combine attempts, but I forgot to count how many attempts I made from 90 to 109.)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't perform ANY non-trivial alchemy combines with less than 255 wisdom.<br />
<br />
There is a plethora of wisdom gear available.  Much of it is very inexpensive.  Some of it will cost you a pretty penny, but will also be full-time upgrades since they come with other stats that are nice.  Like the new Glittering Rings of Judgement.  10ac, 20wis, 50hp! :D<br />
<br />
Somehow I've reached 255wisdom (w/ KEI) without even trying too now. :p   I used to have a full bag of wisdom gear I had banked just for tradeskills.  Now I don't need it.<br />
<br />
If you do a search for wisdom gear in these forums, I'm sure you will find multiple threads listing lots of cheap wis gear.<br />
<br />
If you consider 2kpp a LOT of money, you might want to work on gear before spending any more money on alchemy, which is the biggest money pit we have as a class.  (Our spell scroll costs aren't a money pit, as we actually get a nice benefit from them at least, even if they are horribly over-priced.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
