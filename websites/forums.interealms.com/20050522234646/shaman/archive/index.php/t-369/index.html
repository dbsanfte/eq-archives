<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syndre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Back to the EQ scene after almost a year of absence from EQ.  I orginally had a barbarian shaman on brell serilis, but now I am looking at the PvP game.  Barbarian's don't hold that same feeling to me and now I want to go evil, only problem is that i am having a hard time chosing between races.  Yes, I know there are other race threads, but many were lost.<br />
<br />
I hate the new troll look, but is the snare necklace worth it?<br />
<br />
That being said, if not, how much is it going to suck as an Iksar without the JBB?  I really like their look over the ogres, although I think the ogres look pretty decent, but will they be shot to hell, especially with the exp penalty and no jbb?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Syndre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Snare necklace - many will say this is why trolls &gt; all. No idea how useful it would be in PvP where presumably everyone concentrates on resistances. Trolls have regen, exp penalty, can use JBB.<br />
<br />
Ogres - cannot be stunned from the front, very useful. Don't know how useful in PvP, do encouters happen face to face against melee? No regen, exp penalty, can use JBB.<br />
<br />
Iksar - Lots of advantages including high wis, ac, regen and a pretty isolated starting city which presumably means evils rule Kunark, no JBB, exp penalty.<br />
<br />
If exp penalty is a major factor in your choice then any evil shaman is going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
So what it comes down to is how useful are JBB, snare necklace and stun immunity in PvP? Theres a few Zek players around here, I'm sure they'll give you their thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Syndre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It sucks that it seems my choice is based on equipment, but I might go with Iksar for the hell of it anyways.  The exp penalty is no problem, but was wondering if Iksar make up for the lack of free nuke somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Regen, highest starting wis, a city to themselves on Kunark and 40ac bonus is your trade off for no JBB.</div></div><hr />
