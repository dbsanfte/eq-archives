<br />
Traditionally we have filled this role with stat buffs, patch heals and target mob de-buffs.  For reasons why these functions are loosing value, see the numerious other posts.  For 65 levels these skills are balanced and at times over powered.  Then suddenly they become superflous.  The question now becomes how do you increase shaman usefulness in the end game without distroying the mid-game's balance where the shaman is most powerful.  We need some ideas to increase the shaman ability as melee support without affecting their ability (or inability) to solo.<br />
<br />
These are some of the things I would like to see.<br />
<br />
Attack buffs.  Especially +% atack buffs.  These would automatically scale for content.  For lower end groups it would be a nice buff much like CoP from a ranger.  In higher end groups the effects would be significant.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation buffs. Again as a % if possible.  Too long have we relied on slow to mitigate damage.  When mobs can not be slowed fully we need something to fall back on.  These could also take the form of runes, limited invulnerability, or even &quot;take no damage from the next three successful hits.&quot;  If they could also be tied to the mobs behavior we would truly have a useful skill.  ... <br />
Spell: Spirit Rage Shield -- Reduces damage from enraged oponents by xx%.<br />
<br />
Damage generating buffs.  Buffs that would let the melees have a chance of a proc much like a beastlord buff on his pet.  Increase proc rate.  Furious Blades where on a successful double attack from a secondary weapon it gets one extra critical hit.  Overhaste buffs.  Enduance regen buffs especially when also tied to shorting the reuse time of disciplines.  Short duration, long recast buffs that duplicate the effects of warrior deciplines -- these should be some of the lesser used damage increasing disciplines.<br />
<br />
I think with some of these additional spell types along with some minor upgrades in healing we could be back in business as a melee buffer.</div></div><hr />

We disagree right here.  That's an aspect, but to my mind it was never our primary role.  I understand some view that way now.  I think it's a crummy role if that's what you want to pigeonhole this class to.</div></div><hr />

Guess what verant put in slow immunity and mitigation because they didn't want us mitigating the mobs dmg to that extent with slow. They aren't going to give us some new way to reach that amount of mitigation. When mobs aren't slowable we need to be able to fall back on healing. There is no other option really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It would be interesting to see a spell that might reduce the effect of damage spikes.  <br />
<br />
Not speed of hitting, but the spike curve.  <br />
<br />
Cripple ineptly has some of that effect, but the implementation is obviously insufficient.</div></div><hr />
