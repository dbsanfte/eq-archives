<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rustyspear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed the HUGE difference in soloing with my bone-clasped girdle (extended affliction3).  However i havent seen any text indicating that its affecting the epic dot.  Just wondering if focus items were not intended to affect equipment based spells.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this? I've searched the boards on this topic but no luck<br />
<br />
Also, would things like extended enhancement affect items like velious bps and make RH last longer?  See what i'm getting at.  Anyways, just curious.<br />
<br />
Btw for all u interested.  Extended affliction changes game play dramatically.  Especially with can5 and torpor.  I've found a new love for soloing! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd have to agree with extended affliction 3 being nice, I've definitely noticed the difference since I got one (coldain military wristguard).  I'm pretty sure focus items don't affect right click effects of any sort.. I haven't tried timing the epic since, but there is definitely no message (wristguard sparkles) when the dot lands, so I highly doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a minimum damage requirement in the first tic for EA3 to kick in according to the spdat junk I have seen posted.  SoF does not meet the min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think focus effects (either gear or AA related) work on any right click effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll back up Gloriana on this.   Focus items are only to work on spells cast from the book, not items.   Spell Casting Fury and Improved Damage won't work (such as on JBB).</div></div><hr />

(not sure on the casting speed focus, but others do) If the item's right click effect is an effect that is not castable by PCs as a spell, it will not be affected by focus items.<br />
<br />
Jboots will not be affected by a duration increasing focus, but the sow boots will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since a shaman can cast the JBB nuke, does that mean imp. damage will affect it?  What level would be needed?  It clicks at 45, but it's a low level spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Soram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok.. you guys have really perked my curiosity..<br />
<br />
does extended range 3 affect the spear?  i really really gotta know this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was also under the assumption the focus items had zero effect on any right clicks...Ill have to do some research to find out the facts...<br />
<br />
One quick step in this direction would be to ask....do you get the focus item text in conjunction with using your right click effect?<br />
<br />
 I would think if X 'starts to glow' after you've started a right click effect...then your right click -is- in fact working with the focus item....never had a chance to test it myself...so dose anyone have an experienced answer on that?<br />
<br />
Well, I take that back...I know for a fact mana Preservation dose not go into effect with any right clicks...I mean true, why would it, but thats the only fact I know about focus item+right click effects<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I definitely get the focus item message on the supple scale armband (Ext Range III) when clicking JBB at long range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaytan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Consensus on the monk board was that only items players could cast are affected by focus effects whether from an item or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Btw for all u interested. Extended affliction changes game play dramatically.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have the stuff to do the quest for the coldain wristguard, but never figured it was worth it. Usually i duo with a monk, and its enough to spear dot/JBB, without using bane or pox. Also aggro becomes a factor.<br />
<br />
Is the extra couple of hundred damage on the dots really worth it? I would have to ditch my bracelet of sense proabably to wear it. Also, i already lost some stats as i wear a crystalline torque for mana pres III, not that the wisdom loss is that big a deal, but i'm not too keen to lose all my resists etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You know the answer already...  keep it all and switch out as needed.  My exp gear is significantly different then raid gear:  enter fungi tunic, spear of fate, boots of superiority, coldain wristguard, etc.</div></div><hr />

No class in the game has the spell &quot;curse of the spirits&quot; in their book, so no focus effect or AA ability will work on the spear of fate.<br />
<br />
The JBB is casting at level 45, I'm pretty sure, since it can't be activated before then...so any focus item would need to be a III item to take effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can say that the extend enhance works on all my JB gear except the JB BP, so possibly it is limited to spells you personally are able to cast, and not simply spells that can be cast by PCs.  It is about the best reason I have heard for why it would work on all but 1 of our free buffs (of course, Bp is also not targetable, so it is already an exception among the JB)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got extended enhancement II on my totemic breastplate - it works with all the JB Buffs (which is casting level 45) so I would have thought that II items would work with it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Focus items do not work with Splurt type dots, regardless if you can cast it out of spell book, which is what epic is. The rammification for this is, the last tick of Epic would do somewhere in the range of 4500 damage alone, iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Does anyone have a polished mithril mask (or other dmg2 item) to test with JBB?  Seems to me this would be very nice if it worked, more efficient solo etc.  On a mission to equip my lil shamy with as many useful focus items as possible  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As posted above by Drazile: <br />
<br />
I have a Polished Mith Mask w/ Improved Damage 2. When I use JBB it dosnt flicker, and i get no damage increase. However, when I use the Barb Spirtulist Hammer and got it to proc, the mask flickered and it hit in the 280 range. <br />
<br />
I can confirm this as i have a PMM and it doesn't work with JBB. However..<br />
<br />
How often do you proc with rabid bear? If its proc city, would it be worth using the barb spiritists hammer and a Damg2 or 3 item over a higher ratio weappon? Be awhile before i get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As far as I remember, Curse of the Spirits starts off doing 12 damage on the first tick, and does an extra 12 each tick.<br />
<br />
The damage per tick would therefore go: 12, 24, 36, 48 all the way to 168 on the 14th (final) tick. For a total of 1260 damage.<br />
<br />
Allowing the effect to run for an extra 4 ticks would cause it to do 216 on the final tick for a total of 2052.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shaben and Luclin's Arriana -<br />
The JBB will not work until level 45, but it casts a lower level spell.  Winter's Roar is, uh level 39?  too lazy to llok it up, but it - the spell - is in your spell book with a level lower than 44 as a requirement.<br />
so - if the extended range 2 will work with a right click item, it will work with the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Luclin's Arriana <br />

<br />
Not so sure of that on JBB. I have Mask of the Dragonslayer that has Level III and JBB doesn't do additional damage, but if I cast the spell it does.<br />
<br />
I think some people are imagining things. Psychological effects?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think VI specifically set it up so that damage dealing right clicks won't benefit from increased damage focus (focii?). I'm pretty sure the same result can be found from wizard rend robes, etc. Procs are another story, since they can't be cast on demand. I don't know if extended affliction focus items would affect druid right click drones of doom.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the range focus works on JBB, but don't quote me on that. Anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />
