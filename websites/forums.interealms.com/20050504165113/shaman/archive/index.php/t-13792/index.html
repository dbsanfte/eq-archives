<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone else had found that since the 5/19 patch that the boss's in BoT are now near impossible to slow? A week ago today I attempted to slow 2 boss's, on the first one even after malo I burned 2 loads of mana thanks to canny 5 and torpor and never got slow to land. Then on the 2nd one after malo I got resisted 5 times before the partial slow took hold and then the boss didn't even look slowed. I was back in there today with my mage and we took on the sand boss and the enchanter had the same problem after tash and mala.<br />
<br />
Prior to the patch I was able to slow the boss's without much trouble.<br />
<br />
FYI both My shaman and the enchanter today are lvl 65.</div></div><hr />

It was always VERY difficult to stick slow on East/west lvl 65 bosses (dammit, I always forget their stupid names). I could get it on with Malos,Tash and OOS after some resists, but thats it. Nothing has changed. Use Cloud of Grummus next time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can usually slow them after a few tries, as long as tash is in.  I can't do it without tash.  If no chanter is with us, I use cloud of grummus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to dual box them alot with a chanter/shaman combo. With tash and malos on slow would rarely be resisted more then once.</div></div><hr />

Can't agree with that.  Since that patch, the Minibosses are MUCH harder, hitting for quite a bit more.  The Lightening boss is even more of a pain than he used to be too, with nightmare through-the-floor aggro'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remeber having the easiest time ever landing my first slow... then when i went to reslow i couldnt get in for the life of me.  ie took all my mana to reslow.  and i had more debuffs in i think.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I generally ue cloud of grummus on the east/west mini-bosses, and nothing at all on the south mini-boss.  My choice is impacted by the fact that we *never* have an enchanter in the group (we have a regular group that is always together).  The north mini-boss, of course, is immune to changes in attack speed.  For the two that are not easily slowable, I simply backup-heal and nuke instead of wasting time and mana trying to slow.  The mob ends up just as dead.</div></div><hr />

Lvl 65 bosses:<br />
Gaukr Sandstorm has always been a bitch to land slow on for me, but I can do it with tash or if I proc tash on it<br />
Oreen Wavecrasher I can almost land slow on the first try lately<br />
Hreidlar (sp?, west 65 named) is about as hard to slow as Gaukr<br />
Laef Windfall (north) is immune anyway<br />
<br />
Tower bosses:<br />
Brynju Thunderclap - no problem slowing him... seems to me he was immune once though :confused:<br />
Eindriede Icestorm - Slowable, but not from a distance, and his AE mana drain always has me oom before I can land it if I get close... and it never lands from range<br />
Auliffe Chaoswind - Immune I believe<br />
Sand tower boss - slowable, have never landed it though, disease or magic</div></div><hr />
