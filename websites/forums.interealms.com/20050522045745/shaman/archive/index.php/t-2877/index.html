<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently dinged to 29 (finally) with my barb shaman and I'm still wearing mostly banded.  I have rygorr neck and head piece but basically everything else is banded.  Should I use the money i get (i've been in paw lately, trying to get some guildies to go make a rathe run) to buy the gems and do the totemic quests?  Or am i just better off buying Rygorr instead?  What level group do you need to hunt for the armor and where?  Some guildies have been venturing into teh Crystal Caverns lately at the Rygorr fort, does the armor drop there?<br />
<br />
Or is there some other armor that's better to buy at this point?  Thanks for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on how goal oriented you are.  There is a great feeling of satisfaction that comes with questing a full suit of totemic for yourself.  But if you're only concerned about buying, I might go the rygorr route.<br />
<br />
The Rygorr does not drop in CC.  It drops in the fort but the mob name escapes me.  Anyone?<br />
<br />
But let me plug the totemic for you.  So many people miss some of the coolest parts of the game in pursuit of 'things'.  Like I said before, depends on you're own perspective.  But I say go get some questing done.  Tis a satisfying adventure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rygorr bp drops of the cheif in EW at the fort...<br />
<br />
other stuff drops of random mobs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rygorr is more common than Totemic.  All the pieces drop off the orcs at the fort in Eastern Waste, primarily off of elietes, while the BP dropps from the chief.  On most servers its very nicely priced armor for early 30s.<br />
<br />
Totemic requires some serious camping, and no little luck.  The satisfaction of getting yourself a full suit is unmatched though. :)  I got lucky and got my helm at 48th, so it can take a long time.  There are great guides to Totemic around, and a very nice one on this site.  I<br />
<br />
'd recommend at least taking a stab at Totemic armor.  At a minimum it will get you out exploring Norath. ;)  Sadly the two hardest pieces of Totemic to get, due to spawn rareness and competition, are the helm and BP, the most useful ones.  If you see some Rygorr going for cheap, buy it.  It will be nice to get out of banded, just hold on to that banded for when you get some Totemic too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd definitely recomend questing for your Totemic armor!  I quested a full suit of Totemic armor by lvl 30.  I only had 1 piece MQ'd.  The satisfaction of getting it all is great!  Plus, you look so much cooler in Totemic than Ry'gorr!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the totemic helm without much difficulty, and its a lovely piece of armour. However, you'll probably want to wait until level 34, at which point soloing the bear is a doddle.<br />
<br />
The Tae Ew pages are now moved outside CT to Feerrott - I just killed lots of Taw Ew near the bridge until a page spawned. Took quite a few pages to get the chamois though :( A group in high 20s or low 30s might get some decent xp there too.<br />
<br />
The glacier bear is a rare spawn, but is predictable and not too badly camped. The trick is to kill the 2 wandering ice bone skeles which are its PHs. Spawn time is just under 8 hours. I checked the cave, found the PHs were up, killed them, went away to do other stuff for 8 hours, came back and repeated. It took about 4 cycles to get the bear, but most people seem to get it in less. With my pet, envemoned breath and the poison DD (lvl 34 spell) he went down in no time. Conned light blue. As mentioned there are many guides already out there.<br />
<br />
The BP means killing grizzlenot (v rare). As a barbarian who sees treants as allies, I refuse to do this. It'll also make you KoS at druid rings. An alternative is to either loot it if someone else kills grizzlenot(unlikely unless you can get an evil friend to do it), or buy it. There's an ogre ,  Oculys, in RM, who drops totemic too, but he's higher in level, mid 40s I believe.<br />
<br />
I'm currently wearing the helm, one bracer, gloves, boots and arms. <br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Um, one correction.  I always thought that Grizz was the EVIL Treant, so no problem killing him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you aren't into questing, you can buy most of the totemic armor for very cheap - I paid 100 to 200pp for most pieces on Saryrn (helm and chest excluded).  <br />
<br />
I would say mix and match Ry'gorr and Totemic to get the most benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like others here, I quested a full suit of totemic.  Twas a bit of work, but felt good to do it.    You need to be VERY lucky to get the BP due to rareness of Grizz, I spent a TON of time leveling in SK area from lv. 22-35.<br />
<br />
Ry'gorr is nice stuff for a Shaman.  I understand that pp is tight when you are under lv. 50, but  depending on what server you are on, you should also consider buying some Jaundice Bone pieces (even betther AC than Ry'Gorr and totemic).  A few of the JB pieces are pretty darn cheap, even on my server, Torv., which is one of the more expensive servers.  JB arms, gloves, and  boots often sell for around 200-300 pp.  If you can save up the extra pp, I'd try to fill these slots with JB.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the advice.  I've been in Paw with my guild a lot lately so I figured I'd try to get some of the drops from SK.  I was killing elephants to try to get the bull elephant tooth, although I've never seen anything called a &quot;bull elephant&quot; so what exactly do they drop from?  Same with the charger hoof chips.  I've already got the ghoul carrian and bone barbs from unrest and the caldren shell frmo the tidal lord in Dagnor's shouldn't be a problem.  I guess my biggest problem is balancing the time hunting the parts with hunting for the money to buy the gems hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Totemic is great. I still wear the greaves at 51. (Ok ghetto but I have my Epic :)=)<br />
<br />
One word of advice and warning on the darned bear.<br />
<br />
1) Use &quot; sense animals&quot; to see if he is up. You may need to enter the cave system some which leads me to.....<br />
<br />
2) Lich of Miragul and his skelly walk around.  Keep Wolfy Feet up at all times (so if he fears you you can get away to gate).<br />
<br />
Lich will smoke you like a 2 dollar cigar. Avoid him like a shared needle at a Haitian bi-sexual blood donor convention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They really should remove the gem requirement from totemic armor.  Today you can buy the totemic pieces from players cheaper than you can buy the gems from merchants.  I did all the totemic quests, some take a darn long time.  I hate to say it because I love the idea of mid level armor quests and I look upon my questing fondly (mostly); id just go buy the stuff in gfay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dunno about Barberbrains, but on Trolls (old model) Totemic armour looks the biz. Rygorr looks like pyjamas.<br />
<br />
I'm still wearing my totemic legs and hat ... /sigh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you're a questing idealist or a slave to fashion get Totemic, but you can probably buy the stuff for less than the gems cost.  Heck you can get a couple of the JB parts for less than a dufrenite if you are patient.  I makes no sense to do the Totemic quests now, there are plenty of other quests on which to spend your time on the newer continents.  Don't go do it for the sake of someone else's nostalgia.  In the multiple days /played it will take to get a full set, you could have been 15 levels higher.<br />
<br />
Rygorr has superior stats on almost every piece, is plentiful on the trade market, and is as cheap or cheaper than totemic.  It still looks cool if you have old models + velious armors on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I agree, Totemic was a lot of fun to quest for, its one of the few really good Armor quest in the Old World.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would say go for totemic - it looks much better than rygorr on new models, the ac is comparable and it's cheaper than rygorr on most pieces.<br />
<br />
Totemic helm you'll shell out 500-1k for, but the +5wis and the ac is an investment that will last you into your 50s, so go for it.<br />
<br />
Totemic bp is another matter. The stats aren't that awesome, but the bp is very rare (that, or I've had extremely bad luck trying to locate one). I finally bought one today for 1k and a bloodstained tunic in trade. So for bp, get yourself rygorr since it's easier and cheaper to find.<br />
<br />
I agree with most people here - questing totemic isn't a good idea unless you're nostalgic for it, because it's much faster AND much cheaper to just buy the stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I completed most of the Totemic quests (except BP and helm), as a shaman &quot;rites of passage&quot; thing. However, with the benefits of 20/20 hindsight, and with the influx of alternative armors these days, I think that you have to be pragmatic about Totemic. Some pieces are ridiculously easy to get (bracers, gauntlets, boots), some are ridiculously difficult (Breasplate, Helm). At level 29 either Rygoor or Totemic are a major upgrade to Banded, so I suggest that you do the easier pieces of Totemic and fill the gaps with Rygorr. It is definately worth seeking out a high level Shaman or Enchanter to get an uber charisma buff before you buy your dufrenite. <br />
<br />
I will also suggest that you might wish to set up a &quot;free heals&quot; station at the entrance to Karnors Castle, and ask politely for looting rights on Jarsarth Bracers - they are really quite good, drop like candy and usually rot on the corpse. There are, of course, other Jarsarth drops but they are either crappy (helm) or very rare, or drop so far into KC that you are unlikely to get to them alive!<br />
<br />
I would also mention the really quite nice stats on Blackened Alloy armor from Runnyeye. Ok, so its not uber, but some of it is pretty damned nice - the Medallion is something like 6AC 5wis 5int, which is pretty sweet around the neck. The belt has +5stam, etc. Runnyeye has a hefty dungeon exp bonus IIRC as well.</div></div><hr />
