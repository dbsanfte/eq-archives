<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Im still soloing..barely able to squeeze in 5 to 7% nightly and its getting to be a pain in the ass!  Today, just for giggles I went back to ME, yes at 61 the mobs are still mostly DB to me.. I descided to try the scouts, hell, since It will be into the next centuray before i hit 62 I figured I may as well get a shard..WEll, I wasnt sure I could single pull, and I was right, but I used a tried and true technique..Paralyzing earth to park the first one.. Quick root the other two and back way way up..I have the ceramic short sword of war and its a god send for a soloing shaman..  My pet, well, he was buffed to the gills...He had the best I could give him, threw in a healthy dose of Virtue, some summoned pet gear, and armor and he is a killing machine..<br />
     Now that I had all three parked I slowed two of them, re-rooted the third had Scoobie attack one, and I commenced to kicking the monkey poo out of the other..Once both were dead the third was looking pretty nervous..And well he should..Now that I realize I can effectivly take out two at a time maybe my exp will go a little faster and I can finally weasel my way into the BASTION OF THUNDER!!!!!..Good luck all, and take care...also, one quick question, do the mobs in poi see invis..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are feeling particularly brave you can try soloing the LC / RC camps in PoV.<br />
<br />
These camps can, with the exception of one area in RC, be single pulled if you are careful.  I wouldn't go trying to tank these though.  Root/Rot is your friend.</div></div><hr />
