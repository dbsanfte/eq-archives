<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If Gart were King and Emperor of EQ this is what I would do (in no particular order):<br />
<br />
1)  Redesign the graphics engine.<br />
<br />
2)  Redo character graphics/animations.<br />
<br />
3)  Eliminate 3/4 of PoP flagging requirements.  The encounters that no one would do otherwise, like KoS, need to be retooled to find someway to make them appealing either by loot, visuals, or something.  If they suck that much, something is wrong.<br />
<br />
4)  Assign someone to examine itemization.  Too many gaps, too many itemization issues.  The rich v. poor gap is too big atm, and Knightemization is a legitimate issue.  <br />
<br />
5)  Create more legacy drops in the loot table to remove/rotate.  Add some super rare random drop in more spots.  Like on Ssra trash mobs and whatnot.  Similar to the RBG or Sebilisian Berserker Cloak in Sebilis.  <br />
<br />
6)  Eliminate the Berserker class before it starts. <br />
<br />
7)  Hire great artists to go over some older zones, especially Luclin ones that are UGLY, and to work on new zones.  Personal touches, human (not computer generated) art, hidden areas to explore, those things matter.  They help create a sense of coolness that a computer generated zone as you see in ldon do nothing for (except that cool waterfall in Tak).  <br />
<br />
8)  A couple more 60-65 dungeons with nice droppable loots, including runes.<br />
<br />
9)  Nerf snap aggro.  Too many people expect full control over aggro, <br />
either getting it or avoiding it.  <br />
<br />
10)  Nerf lull/pacify.  Taking 3 groups up the BoT towers to a boss without fighting is just stupid.  Maybe this changed recently with that bard change, I'm not sure.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is what I'd start examining.  Some of the ideas may not pan out, who knows.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, I still have fun and enjoy EQ.  That's remarkable after nearly 5 years.</div></div><hr />

This was sent to me but I dont have the original link. Sorry<br />
<br />
Allright. Tunare, (the name of the EQ Engine) Was a DirectX 5 Rendering <br />
engine From EQ Classic To Velious. Sony purchased a Renderman Middleman <br />
renderer ( www.renderman.com ), and Combined it with the existing <br />
Everquest engine to Make Tunare 2.0, a DirectX 8 Rendering engine with <br />
support for more Detailed Models, Textures, and Zones. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there were some drawbacks. Everquest's Models are Vertex <br />
Animated, Meaning that Each polygon is moved indepenently, Which Is <br />
INCREDIBLY Memory-intensive, Hence the 512 Meg Minimum, and incredibly <br />
long Zone times for players on lower-end systems with Luclin models on. <br />
Textures are also uncompressed, which is basically saying that every <br />
time you load a texture, instead of loading like, a 200k JPEG file of a <br />
wall texture, it loads an Uncompressed, 2 MEGABYTE Wall texture! (EQ's <br />
Current Texture compression system if you check it in the options, is <br />
only RGB8A8, also an inneficient system) <br />
Tunare 2.0 is INCREDIBLY inneficient, But was slowly upgraded with every <br />
expansion. (notice LDoN zone times are tiny compared to Luclin zone <br />
times?) <br />
<br />
GoD Fixes all this, and More. <br />
<br />
Tunare 3.0, is, from what i've been able to gather a DirectX 9.0B Engine <br />
Built from the GROUND UP by SoE that Focuses on pure, unadulterated <br />
EFFICIENCY. Textures are now Compressed using DXTC, Reducing Texture <br />
memory usage by almost 40-70% in most cases, while still maintaining <br />
Incredible quality (look at UT2k3, They use DXTC compression for <br />
example, as do many other games these days). Also, The Model animation <br />
system is changed, Switching to a Bone/Inverse Kinematics System, Which <br />
could Allow for Dynamic physics and possibly Ragdoll effects (imagine! <br />
Whack an arrow into a goblin's head, and his head jerk's back and he <br />
stumbles, revealing an Opening for the Warrior's New Reactionary Melee <br />
system!) Further down the road. <br />
<br />
All the Funky DX9 Bells and whistles will be supported (Bump mapping in <br />
Kromrif Belts! Shadowed men looking like Shadowed frinkin men with the <br />
new shaders!), And apparently Character Shadows (!!) Will be added to <br />
All creatures, and a new animated Dynamic lighting system will also be <br />
added, meaning torch light will actually Flicker and waver.. oooh. <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, Tunare 3.0 focuses on efficiency, and quality. with the <br />
reduced memory requirement, Textures will now be More detailed, Higher <br />
resolution, and will most probably have Multitexturing/bump/Environment <br />
mapping applied to them, old world zones will look much better due to <br />
this, and as always, all the advanced shaders will be able to be turned <br />
off, so you can have EQ look like before in old world with High texture <br />
quality with one third the Memory cost. <br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone will get the Engine upgrade on GoD launch day, so be prepared <br />
for a 20-50 Megabyte Patch on the 10th. <br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up? After GoD launch day, Me with the Geforce 2 will be able to <br />
run all of the Advanced models, and High Texture resolution without any <br />
performance hit at all from what I currently use (low texture quality, <br />
only iksar and vah shir on cause they're so damn sexy ) <br />
<br />
You guys with the Stupidly fast computers and your Radeon 9800XTs will <br />
log onto EQ, and simply say.. &quot;Whoa.&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">20-50 meg patch.  I know some people I won't be seeing for a week.  If that stuff is accurate though, should be a big improvement.  Plus you don't have to buy GoD to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep thats the ONLY reason atm im excited about GoD is the new Graphic Engine...sad no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tech talk boggles me, I work construction :)) but I did log into test server and was amazed that zoning took me approx 1-2 seconds as opposed to 10-15, but I had attributed that to a lower population on test, only 30 something in PoK at the time as opposed to 100ish. funny thing was spell effects were not visible on test though, and they are when I run on Povar. Wouldn't the settings from my EQUI file translate to Test, or is that a different file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm dont know Avividad I would guess a different file.  Only reason is once when I logged into test i downloaded files to play on it.  When i went back to production server, it redownloaded the same files but with older dates.<br />
<br />
Maybe a Test player would know more and help you out.</div></div><hr />

I'm moving on Saturday.  I hope that my roommate has a cable modem, since I'm going to have to reinstall and patch everything. &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
