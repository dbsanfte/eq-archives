<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been a huge proponent of giving Druids a rez spell to compete in most if not all single group encounters as a primary healer.<br />
<br />
Ok, keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
Giving Druids the Call of the Wild spell does not make them able to function as primary healers in difficult content, but it does make them a more legitimate choice for the backup healer/utility spot when there is a Beastlord or Enchanter in a group. <br />
<br />
So, Shaman (who are having a difficult enough time getting higher content experience groups) are going to feel the brunt of this rather than Clerics who will retain their monopoly and will actually receive the lion's share of the call to corpse from this new spell.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason I have been in favor of a pumped up Druid class able to function as a primary healer is self serving, since Shaman are a near perfect compliment to Druids with our HOT's.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I toss this out for discussion - not to bitch and moan and call for nerfs, etc.<br />

BS. In an encounter where the only thing keeping the main tank alive is spam healing quick heals, HoT's mean exactly jack and sh*t. While useful, HoT's still do not measure up to anywhere near the healing capacity of a druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basicly, giving druids 'Call of the Wild' makes groups with CLR DRU groups have even LESS of a need for shaman. Yeah, that's exactly what us shaman want</div></div><hr />

As it turns out, CoW is going to shaman and druids.  It summons the person back to their corpse, no XP regained, with the person able to get an XP res later.   Anyone who has had the sole resser die 3 hours into a GoD expedition knows what this ability is aimed at.<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Sorry, I didn't realize that the AA lists ripped from Test weren't posted here already.   You can find them at Graffe's or many other boards, including boards here.    The Lucy information was wrong (a carryover from the previous template).  Druids and Shaman are getting CoW as a summon-to-corpse AA ability.  No other details disclosed yet.<br />
 <br />
I only propagate information on this particular ability because it has become public, and because it is such a potentially divisive issue.   Keep in mind, please, that the information you see is still preliminary, without details, and is very likely to change.  It is a BETA, remember.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, Shaman (who are having a difficult enough time getting higher content experience groups)<br />
I can play main healer in my KT groups when doing xp, on top of being the main slower.<br />
I've had no problems doing xp grinding with just 2 shaman in the group for healing.<br />
We haven't taken on a named, but regardless, I think that hunting in Kod'Taz with a shaman as the main healer will qualify as &quot;higher end content experience groups&quot;.<br />
This was before I got Daluda's as my heal.<br />
I have no problems getting any xp groups ever.<br />
Neither do any other shaman in my guild (we have 5+ active shaman).<br />
<br />
That being said, this AA is a huge *boost* to shamans.<br />
Now, I can actually take a group of people through a Vxed Trial, or a Tipt trial taking only a druid/shaman as the other healer!<br />
Now, you have more people capable of bringing someone back to their corpse when you wipe to be able to recover without having to start over from beginning (this is a big deal for some raids like Uqua).<br />
I can take a group of tank + dps through any xp zone or instanced dungeon and if something bad happens, the group doesn't have to evac out or just quit the whole thing midway.<br />
The option now is to bring that group member back, carry on, and worry about a res in 3 hours, assuming you can't survive without that 7% normal xp or whatever you lose from a death (which you can work back in about 20 mins of xping anyway).<br />
<br />
Anyone thinking this ability isn't good for shaman is daft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Juujuu I agree with your post for the most part although there is rarely need to have 2 shaman in a group, and I also think Shaman are better than the average poster here. But, it makes little difference whether or not we can function well, it is the perception of the other classes that gets us groups, and most groups choose enchanters and beastlords for the slower spot or they don't go with a slower at all. That is the current fact of things and the reason many Shaman are unhappy.<br />
<br />
But regardless, I am very happy Shaman are getting the AA ability also, so my initial post is negated.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS: you must be on a good server or do all guild GoD expeditions because I can't buy one for my life.  On Quellious I rarely (pretty much never) see pickup Vxed and higher groups. I suppose that's because everyone has been burned too much on lousy groups.<br />
<br />
If you do guild expeditions it hardly counts for what my point was - and that is if a neutral bias group wants to add a utility spot in a group that Druids would have had a big boost if they were the only class with the recall to corpse ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Juujuu I agree with your post for the most part although there is rarely need to have 2 shaman in a groupGroups usually want a slower.  That's shaman #1.  Groups usually want a backup healer.  That's shaman #1.  Groups usually want a main healer.  That's shaman #2.  I don't go out of my way forming groups with 2 shaman.  I also don't go out of my way forming groups with 2 clerics, or 2 warriors, or 2 paladins, or whatever.  But when I want to hunt in KT, and some guildy or friend replies to my &quot;anyone lfg?&quot; with &quot;i'll join ya&quot; I'm not that choosy who I'm adding for dps, or if there's limited people online due to the hours in which I xp, I'll take a 2nd shaman into my group to act as main/backup healer over having no backup healer whatsoever.  Given the choice between hunting where I want with a less than ideal group, or sitting at the zone in of KT going &quot;any druids or clerics lfg???&quot; I'll go with xp option.<br />
<br />
But, it makes little difference whether or not we can function well, it is the perception of the other classes that gets us groupsWhen you get to the high end, it's not perception of classes that gets you groups, it's reputation.  Your reputation might come from past play sessions with people.  It might come from friends you talk to.  it might come from being in a high end guild.  It can come from all sorts of places.  But if you don't have a good rep, that's stopping you from getting a group.  It's not your class keeping you from getting into a group.  It's not to say you have a bad rep, but without a good rep, that's your hinderance.  People in the high end know most everyone else, or know the other guilds that are at the high end.  They know that classes can be interchanged in most encounters depending on their role, or they wouldn't be in the high end.  They won't exclude one class from their choices except in extreme situations (like doing single group ikk trials, and then that's dependant on the other group members).  Finding groups at the high end is more about not being a douchebag than playing the &quot;right&quot; class (I'm not accusing you in any way of being this, just making a blanket statement)<br />
<br />
<br />

I see many people that are unflagged in KT.  Doing a vxed trial isn't hard.  If you can do a hard ldon, you can do vxed trial.  Hell, you don't even need a CC class in any way to do vxed.  I act as the primary puller for my vxed groups every time I go.  Kill 30 mobs at zone in, then start clearing up the right side.  The only hairy situation is the final pull, with timing of repops.  The other way to handle it is to just train the entire room to the zone in and have everyone else do the hail, and don't bother killing everything.  Tell your friends to come help you out.  Tell your guildmates to come help you out.  Link the awesome gear that drops that's 1 groupable to them to make them go &quot;OOOOOH!  I gotta get flagged for that zone!&quot;  Send tells to people and form your own group.  Don't wait for a group to be forming up just waiting for you.  Take initiative, and take your flag.<br />
<br />
I'm in a high end guild.  We know that as a guild we needed to be flagged for KT to progress past time, so we made a push to get everyone flagged.  We know that recruits and such need to be flagged and so most of us will go back and help flag our friends.  Also, the xp in Vxed and Tipt is damn nice.  If anyone tells you otherwise, they are retarded, and let them stay in BoT or wherever the hell they are hunting.  You don't want them in your group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
well first of all im going to say juu, you've got to be a pretty good shaman to do what you do in KT.<br />
<br />
but at the risk of bringing logic into your ray of sunshine i'm going to start with an insightful observation and follow it up with a couple of points you probably haven't thought of<br />
<br />
first.  shaman healing sucks.  it's insufficient when we need it most... in the most difficult situations.  this is well documented and widely accepted by shaman, eq players, and soe itself.<br />
<br />
after 5 and a half years in this game Ive seen that when people start to being able to use personal experience to go against basically accepted conventions vis a vis balance it's a sign that players are starting to outgrow content<br />
<br />
simply put, it's been 6 months since OOW's been released.  the new expansion is around the corner.  hell it's even been delayed 2 months and sony expected players to be done with GoD by now.  I dunno about your server but the trash on bert is starting to creep into KT, with GoD almost over KT isn't by any means a high end content zone... in fact it's about 5 levels and 3 months aways from being Bot2 a la KC 3 aka LoIO4.<br />
<br />
your claims are akin to people swaggering in PoP that they could &quot;tank&quot; in bot or that they could be main healer in BoT.  that's great but were people able to do those things when it mattered?  when it was actually a matter of planar progression and not after the content is trivialized?<br />
<br />
your ability to heal for a specific group in (and it's a very specific example you have) doesn't say anything about shaman healing but it does reveal that GoD content on the lower ends is becoming trivialized.  hell my bard can SOLO some of the lowest level trials in god and has been able to do so for some time.  it doesn't really say anything about bard balance<br />
<br />
if you study pattern of traffic congestion, one of the most interested in thing is how congestion travels as a wave.  often you'll be in a huge jam then all of the sudden you get to a spot where the highway just opens up.  you'd expect that point to be where the accident happened, but in most instances it's just open road all of the sudden, no accident, no obstacle, anything.<br />
<br />
the same thing can be said for player conceptions.  with gear and AAs you slowly creep up the the power curve until one day you suddenly hit the open road and feel great.  this doesn't say anthing about the nature of the bottlenecks and problems with the class... although enjoy your rush<br />
<br />
simply it takes a while for player conceptions to catch up with reality the truth may be that KT is now becoming a trivial zone.  there's probably a lot of bottom feeding players who can handle KT now 6 months into god that are in bot because they're afraid...<br />
<br />
as a last observation about the trivializatioin of content.  as everyone know SKs suck.  they're really hurting and even though I myself play a 65 100aa sk i'd rather not group with one if i REALLY need a win.  if you go to sk.org you can hear all manner of bitching about tanking or lack thereof.  but even there you see a lot of posts like &quot;look, I can tank **** like KT trash named but...&quot;<br />
<br />
it's trivial content for high end players</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Amen Juujuu!!! ;) <br />
Preach it brudda man......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">juu you're spot on about vxed and the difficulty of those trials.<br />
<br />
specifically vext and tipt, unless you suck you will ALWAYS get 1 or 2 mobs.  you go to a room with 8 mobs and you can just single pull from that mess, no lull, no pacify, no FD.  it's easy almost to a point of being bugged<br />
<br />
ldon actually are much harder, and  i credit ldon somewhat for teaching newer players a measure of skill in dungeon crawling.  unlike when ldon started you dont get the total poon idiot.<br />
<br />
the thing about vexd and tipt obviously is that it's very low skill but there's still a pretty hard coded around gear.  there's no way to get around the fact that you need a not-****ty tank to get through it.  it's also very class-dependent for marginal groups.  of course if you well geared you can 2 box the named in the trials but if you're of decent talent but ****ty geared (early or pre EP) you NEED a cleric you NEED a chanter and you NEED a warrior.  a ranger really helps in tipt...<br />
<br />
for these 2 trials in addition to the mental obstacles that ****ty players might have.  there are to be honest some good players out there in their weekend bazaar geared warriors and knights that cannot do these trials :(<br />
<br />
luckily there's no such limitations in sewers.  i really cant figure out why motivated but poorly geared players dont spend more time there.  all the god trials are EP-level experience.  i get 9 percent aa for a lvl 66 mob solo in vxed.  whereas they'll sit on their ass for hours waiting for tables in pof when they get almost as good experience for easier faster kills in god'<br />
<br />
again player perception...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can play main healer in my KT groups when doing xp, on top of being the main slower.<br />
I've had no problems doing xp grinding with just 2 shaman in the group for healing.<br />
<br />
The problem is: Your definition of exp'ing is most likely one of much lower expectations than others are used to.<br />
<br />
I can solo for exp, but not anywhere near the rate a real exp group in KT can do.<br />
<br />
Tipt with a druid and Shaman for xp might work, but not if you expect to finish it for flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So basicly, giving druids 'Call of the Wild' makes groups with CLR DRU groups have even LESS of a need for shaman. Yeah, that's exactly what us shaman want<br />
<br />
A group with a CLR DRU combination shouldn't want a SHM and *certainly* they shouldn't *need* a SHM.  This should be the same when you combine say, a DRU SHM or a CLR SHM.  Neither of those should require a CLR or a DRU, respectively.<br />
<br />
Every reason that players supply stating why BST and ENC provide more to a group than we do is reinforced when you expect to get a group that already has a CLR DRU combination.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ahem...*OLD SEBILIS JAIL PRE-VELIOUS*.<br />
<br />
Thank you, drive through.  The holy trinity has existed every expansion, GoD is nothing new.  We *needed* a chanter, warrior, and cleric then.<br />
<br />
luckily there's no such limitations in sewers.  i really cant figure out why motivated but poorly geared players dont spend more time there.  all the god trials are EP-level experience.  i get 9 percent aa for a lvl 66 mob solo in vxed.  whereas they'll sit on their ass for hours waiting for tables in pof when they get almost as good experience for easier faster kills in god'<br />
<br />
again player perception...<br />
<br />
I agree, GoD is underutilized - even the first sewers level gives near elemental rate xp and loot.  Any group that can handle an ldon hard adventure should be able to handle GoD, no problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
first.  shaman healing sucks.  it's insufficient when we need it most... in the most difficult situations.  this is well documented and widely accepted by shaman, eq players, and soe itself.<br />
<br />
While shaman healing might suck extremely high end, don't pretend that it's any of those you mentioned - certainly not widely accepted by shamans and even less, accepted by soe :)<br />
<br />
...it's a sign that players are starting to outgrow content<br />
<br />
Happens every expansion, even more so when the next expansion is given a release date.<br />
<br />
simply put, it's been 6 months since OOW's been released.<br />
<br />
I sure hope you mean GoD :)<br />
<br />
hell it's even been delayed 2 months and sony expected players to be done with GoD by now.<br />
<br />
Sony expected OoW to basically be an expansion on GoD, not that GoD would be finished.<br />
<br />
I dunno about your server but the trash on bert is starting to creep into KT, with GoD almost over KT isn't by any means a high end content zone... in fact it's about 5 levels and 3 months aways from being Bot2 a la KC 3 aka LoIO4.<br />
<br />
OHNOS!!1!1  The evil n3wbs are invading!  Some of them might even be unguilded  *gasps*   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
your claims are akin to people swaggering in PoP that they could &quot;tank&quot; in bot or that they could be main healer in BoT.  that's great but were people able to do those things when it mattered?  when it was actually a matter of planar progression and not after the content is trivialized?<br />
<br />
I was main healing in BoT without Q or any healing aa's.  It was pretty easy actually, and this was shortly after PoP was available.  Is that what you mean by trivial?<br />
<br />
What I consider trivial is *soloing* BoT mobs.  Yes, it happens, frequently.  Why bother mentioning BoT anyway, I thought it was the KC of late?...do you hunt anywhere else?<br />
<br />
Planar progression?  Are you speaking about server firsts?  Pre-nerfs?  As it stands, it doesn't sound like you really know any specifics of what you are referring to other than you are fed up with idiots invading your good'ole BoT stomping grounds.<br />
<br />
your ability to heal for a specific group in (and it's a very specific example you have) doesn't say anything about shaman healing but it does reveal that GoD content on the lower ends is becoming trivialized.<br />

<br />
hell my bard can SOLO some of the lowest level trials in god and has been able to do so for some time.  it doesn't really say anything about bard balance.<br />
<br />
What does it say about SHM balance when GoD named were being solo'ed by SHM a LONG time ago (pre-rune, stone, whatever nerf?  when the nice little fly actually spawned and dropped spells?)<br />
<br />

<br />
OMG!  You're the one that understands traffic :)  Help us oh great lord, for we are teh suck! :)<br />
<br />
...If you study traffic, that must be driven by a hatred for traffic :)  Do tell, teach me the way, for I hate traffic like a million cancelled shaman accounts :)<br />

<br />
<br />
Uhm... I don't know where you have been grouping in KT, but it must be the lesser animal stuff.<br />
<br />
Just today, slow resisted once, and me (65 shm, Daluda's, plus all heal AA's) and a pretty pimped out cleric couldn't keep the MT alive thru one NON named.  Granted, those mobs are rare, but yes, occasionally you get a real mean one.  <br />
<br />
To say the least, the cleric and I were pretty pissed that our combined continual spam of fast heals (about 4 apiece back to back) couldn't overtake the yellow mobs dps.<br />
<br />
Later in the day, we moved to the south camp, and then things were fine.  I'd love to see you try the far west KT camp with 2 shaman and see how long you last:) <br />
<br />
Now, about druids getting the call to corpse type spell.  I really don't see it changing the playing field much.  Both Druids and Shamans will have it, so it sort of cancels out.  However, we are still left in the lame situation where our fast heals are the weakest, enc's can slow just as well, and our dps is poor.<br />
<br />
Really, the core enc, dru, clr will still be better than shm, clr + anything else for GoD content.  Being able to summon a corpse isn't going to effect the main problems shaman have:<br />
<br />
1.  Inadequate fast heal<br />
2.  No additional utility<br />
3.  Poor dps<br />
<br />
1.  SOE just doesn't get it.  We are getting TWO, yep count it, TWO new heal over times (ward and group heal) with Oow, neither of which counter dps spikes, which seems to be our biggest downfall atm.  <br />
<br />
2.  We really don't have much that &quot;saves the day&quot;.  Root is about it for CC.  Druids at least have evac, and the ability to port is nice.  But honestly, with our buffs being worthless, and our AA's adding nothing to a groups survivability, shaman are falling further behind.  If SOE refuses to give us a better fast heal, we not some AA's that give instant live saving ability (instant transfer of canniV amount of life maybe?)?  We are priests for chirstsakes.  <br />
<br />
3.  I really wouldn't ask for anymore dps, IF, IF we could fulfil our duties as priests and buffers.  But since we can't, what else are we going to bring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a healer's ability to keep a tank standing isn't entirely dependent on the shaman's heal abilities, nor is it an indicator all the time of class balance. <br />

take same two healers--65 sham, 65 cleric--send them to GoD with an 8k hp tank who has 1350 ac or so. tank gets eaten alive.<br />
<br />
same two healers, same hp total, but 1700 ac. woa...average hit dmg reduced enough that they are able to keep him standing now. mob hits for max dmg far fewer times, etc. <br />

just something to add to consideration</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There's a difference between insufficient and inadequate.<br />
Our heals are enough that we can get by.<br />
Our heals are not enough that we can get by in enough harder situations (ie slow bounces or unslowed adds).<br />
Slow + heals is enough for a shaman to be a main healer in 99% of the game.<br />
<br />
well first of all im going to say juu, you've got to be a pretty good shaman to do what you do in KT.<br />
I like to think I'm a good shaman.  When I go hunt in KT with group members, if we have a bard, he's pulling.  I malos the mob on the incoming, and nihil it asap after.  The mob is usually slowed the moment it hits camp.  I might take a punch or two, but the tank taunts it off me, and throw heals and bot and carry on.  If we don't have a bard pulling, then I'm the main puller.  I lead with malos, run back, slow it before it hits camp.  If the main tank gets aggro before it hits me great.  Usually I'll start casting bot on myself expecting the inital quad hit, and continue on healing whoever's hurt.<br />
<br />
but at the risk of bringing logic into your ray of sunshine i'm going to start with an insightful observation and follow it up with a couple of points you probably haven't thought ofOk.  What insight do you have that I haven't thought of yet....<br />
<br />
first.  shaman healing sucks.  it's insufficient when we need it most... in the most difficult situations.  this is well documented and widely accepted by shaman, eq players, and soe itself.Ya.  I knew that.  I can't heal a main tank through a named mob on my own in KT.  I can't be the main healer for an Ikkinz trial.  But shaman healing *is* sufficient to act as a main healer when you have your own backup healer.  When I have a druid in my group, I'll usually do the main healing, and have the druid play backup healer, just because the druid can do much better dps than I can by nuking.<br />
<br />
after 5 and a half years in this game Ive seen that when people start to being able to use personal experience to go against basically accepted conventions vis a vis balance it's a sign that players are starting to outgrow content<br />
Outgrowing Kod'Taz is kind of an oxymoron isn't it?  Mobs hit for at least 1k, with occasional rampages, flurries, DD procs, spell reflections, spell mitigation, and other annoying effects.  Even with 10k hps, a tank will still die in about 5-10 seconds vs an unslowed mob.  Being able to survive in an environment like that isn't outgrowing content; it's adapting to it.<br />
<br />
simply put, it's been 6 months since OOW's been released.  the new expansion is around the corner.  hell it's even been delayed 2 months and sony expected players to be done with GoD by now.<br />
No they didn't.  They just wanted more money from expan$ions.  When they realized that people weren't going to be buying it, and were complaining very very loudly, did they realize that they were ****ing up badly, and put on the breaks for an expansion that people just weren't going to go for.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno about your server but the trash on bert is starting to creep into KT, with GoD almost over KT isn't by any means a high end content zone... in fact it's about 5 levels and 3 months aways from being Bot2 a la KC 3 aka LoIO4.<br />
Ok then.  What do you qualify as a high end zone?  *boggle*  Let's count the zones in the entire game that are harder than Kod'Taz/Yxtta that can be done by single groups for xp:<br />
Ikkinz 1, 2, 3 (it's all the same zone.  don't kid yourself that it's 3 zones) is not actually any harder than KT for just doing xp.  Same mobs.  Same levels.  Same trash.  Different location.<br />
Qvic<br />
(Are the other 3 zones past Qvic even xp zones in any way?)<br />
Uh.....<br />
That's it.<br />
There aren't any harder zones in the game.<br />
LDoN hards are much easier than hunting in KT or Yx.<br />
There's nothing else.<br />
You can't say KT isn't a high end zone when there aren't harder zones around to hunt in.<br />
It's like saying that just before Velious came out that Sebilis wasn't a high end zone anymore because there were so many people hunting there.<br />
<br />
your claims are akin to people swaggering in PoP that they could &quot;tank&quot; in bot or that they could be main healer in BoT.  that's great but were people able to do those things when it mattered?  when it was actually a matter of planar progression and not after the content is trivialized?<br />
I was *routinely* my groups main and *only* healer plus slower in my BoT groups before people could get gimped into the zone due to level.  This was when I still used Torpor as my only heal over time because the idea of getting rune spells was brand new.  This didn't mean I could do the named mobs, or could handle really bad pulls of say 3 mobs at once, but I *was* able to be the main healer for my groups.<br />
<br />
your ability to heal for a specific group in (and it's a very specific example you have) doesn't say anything about shaman healing but it does reveal that GoD content on the lower ends is becoming trivialized.  hell my bard can SOLO some of the lowest level trials in god and has been able to do so for some time.  it doesn't really say anything about bard balance[quote]<br />
Specific group?  I had the broadest of general groups you can really have and still be able to hunt in KT.  My pickup groups involve:<br />
a)  me playing healer + slower<br />
b)  any tank<br />
c)  any backup healer<br />
d e f)  anyone<br />
How much more freaking general do you want?  If I can get a druid or cleric, I will.  There's way too many times where another dru/cle just isn't online.  I refuse to sit around doing nothing until one shows up.  So in that case, I take a 2nd shaman as the backup healer, and take whoever else will show up.  I'd take a group made up of 2 shaman and 4 shadowknights if everyone was lfg and no better mix was available.  Where did I give a specific example?<br />
<br />
[quote]the same thing can be said for player conceptions.  with gear and AAs you slowly creep up the the power curve until one day you suddenly hit the open road and feel great.  this doesn't say anthing about the nature of the bottlenecks and problems with the class... although enjoy your rush<br />
Ya.  There's this player conception out there.  It's that shaman are completely 100% ineffectual at even the high end game because so many people whine that we can't do anything.  So many people read this over and over that they just don't even try anymore.  While you guys are off pretending you can't heal in any meaningful way whatsoever, I'll keep forming up my own KT groups and raking in the AAs nodding in agreeance that we suck soooo badly I might as well delete.  *nods*.  I'm the type of person that likes to drive on the bypass, and avoid the conjested highway traffic.<br />
<br />
simply it takes a while for player conceptions to catch up with reality the truth may be that KT is now becoming a trivial zone.  there's probably a lot of bottom feeding players who can handle KT now 6 months into god that are in bot because they're afraid...<br />
Exactly.  If the shaman that live in there weren't too scared of actually believing in themselves that they might not actually suck as much as everyone tells them they do, they might realize they can do bigger and better stuff.<br />
<br />
as a last observation about the trivializatioin of content.  as everyone know SKs suck.  they're really hurting and even though I myself play a 65 100aa sk i'd rather not group with one if i REALLY need a win.  if you go to sk.org you can hear all manner of bitching about tanking or lack thereof.  but even there you see a lot of posts like &quot;look, I can tank **** like KT trash named but...&quot;<br />
One of my best friends I have has a 8.5k/1500ac raid buffed shadowknight.  She main tanks for me in KT whenever I hunt there.  She was the main tank I was referring to above when I mentioned I can primarly heal with a shaman backup.  Shadowknights need some loving like shaman do.  They can function, but they need some upgrades.  Though once well equiped with high end gear, shadowknights do not have problems.  Our guild's best equiped shadowknight is sitting around 2900AC on raids.  She can tank just about anything without batting an eyelash.  I've seen what is currently the best build for picking armor and augments for a shadowknight, and that build is going for maximum AC and shielding mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The problem is: Your definition of exp'ing is most likely one of much lower expectations than others are used to.<br />
<br />
I can solo for exp, but not anywhere near the rate a real exp group in KT can do.<br />
Is non stop pulling with no downtime ok xp?<br />
With me and *any* of the other 3 healing classes doing backup or main healing for a group, we have zero downtime.  We have the 2 healers, the tank, and 3 more classes for doing dps.  If we actually get 3 real dps classes, like wizard/necro/mage/rogue/monk to be the 3 more classes to added to the group, then I have *no* functional difference in xp gain.<br />
<br />
Of course I'll take the ideal type of group for hunting in KT if I can find a bard, cleric, warrior, wizard, and wizard to join me.  You can't get ideal groups every time, so I'll form my own substandard group and still get nice xp, rather than sit around doing nothing, just the same as I'll go out and solo rather than sit around.<br />
<br />
Tipt with a druid and Shaman for xp might work, but not if you expect to finish it for flags.<br />
And why the hell wouldn't I want to finish it for flags?  The last 2 times I've gone through tipt, our group has had 1 death total on each run through.  That 1 death was my own death, since I'm the puller and repops that happen while pulling suck, and getting aneuk grasped while pulling 2 mobs can suck bad as well.  Druids heal just fine when you are doing tipt for flags.  What makes you think a druid can't heal through tipt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Uhm... I don't know where you have been grouping in KT, but it must be the lesser animal stuff.<br />
Cragbeasts, hynids, kyv, golems, ratuks, ixt, whatever is around that hasn't been pulled yet.  All of those mobs range in con from blue to red.<br />
<br />
Just today, slow resisted once, and me (65 shm, Daluda's, plus all heal AA's) and a pretty pimped out cleric couldn't keep the MT alive thru one NON named.  Granted, those mobs are rare, but yes, occasionally you get a real mean one.  <br />
Yup.  Rarely a bad situation happens.  You could have a shaman, 4 clerics, and a defensive warrior, and still somehow you can screw up a pull and end up dying.  Bad stuff happens from time to time.<br />
<br />
Might I suggest you try preslowing mobs before they get to camp?  Who's your puller?  Get out there and pull yourself.  Lead with malos, land a slow on the inc, laugh at the mob's dps.  If this happens a lot to you, then it sounds like a problem of tactics to me.  That, or a crappy tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman need some bumpage, but the sky most certainly is NOT falling. The new aa HoT looks MGBable. There are additional % increases in AA for both DPS and Healing. And the new &quot;Rez the Cleric&quot; spell will definitely provide some utility. <br />
<br />
I understand SOEs hesitation to give us much more, honestly. They dont want to create another &quot;Goddly&quot; class if they can possibly help it. They have constantly adjusted encounters to try to &quot;fit&quot; more classes in and effectively minimize the need for the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;. Vxed is a cinch, heck kill 50 at the first platform, get SoE and RUN for it. When I got my flag, we had to go, I said &quot;I am going for it anyway&quot; and off I went. Targeted the NPC on the way past him, looped back, and Hailed him on the way down. Almost made it back to the zone without dying, too. <br />
<br />
Groups can do Tipt with the Shaman-Druid combo too. You just have to play it smarter. Drop Quies on the tank BEFORE the mob arrives. Get Malos on AS its coming in. Limit the amount of un-slowed damage as much as you can. Tricky? Sure. Bout time. Getting kinda sick of &quot;/yawn 5 incoming&quot; or &quot;clerics AFK, but I am pulling this red Giant anyway, cause we got a shaman&quot;. EQ NEEDS this kind of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*EDIT: Inserted*<br />
<br />
Pulling with zero downtime... that doesn't tell me much. You *always* have at least one mob in camp, you are the main healer, with the druid as backup healer (ie nuking etc) and you are able to maintain your mana using Tnargs/Daludas and Q/BoT?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I find that a little hard to believe. I don't see you being able to pull for an extended length of time with that.<br />
<br />
You'd have a better chance of that being the case if you were the backup healer. <br />
<br />
*End Edit*<br />
<br />
Maybe I have Vxed confused with Tipt. It's been so long since I have done those...<br />
<br />
You can't tell me that a druid and a shaman can keep the MT up against that named Kyv.<br />
<br />
I'd guess:<br />
<br />
1. You found a way around it, so you don't have to kill the named Kyv.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. They nerfed the heck out of Tipt and/or Vxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If I'm acting as main healer and main slower, then no, I'm probably not chain pulling.  It depends how far away the mobs are from camp.  We tend to clear out the cragbeast corner with chain pulls.  When the pulls have to start coming from path, then the pulls slow down a touch, so I'll usually make the other healer the main healer while I'm pulling those.<br />
If I'm acting as main slower and puller and backup healer, then ya, I'm chain pulling mobs.<br />
And Tipt is not any harder to clear now with a weaponshielding ranger or riposting warrior as it was 3-6 months ago when you got Pooka powah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lol, Juujuu you are saying that you can under perfect circumstances do all the amazing things you claim above.  Try some of those groups without your good bard or beefy tank and see how things go.<br />
<br />
I have been the only healer and slower in hard LDON's with no CC with success.  But do I want to do it on a regular basis? No way, nor does the group because it is risky.<br />
<br />
But anyway this thread is way off topic.  Thank goodness Sony gave the summon to corpse spell to Shaman as well, my post was written when we all thought that Druids were the only class receiving it.<br />
<br />
I can't really say now that I agree with very much of your posts since they are with unrealistic situational groups instead of bread and butter groups.  And it is about peoples perception in this game for the most part.  You can be the best liked and admired Shaman on the Server and if peeps think that another class can provide more impact they will go that direction if they are worried about succeeding.  The flow of information just isnt that great in EQ - no one knows who the super duper amazing Shaman are except perhaps your guildies and a few friends you group with regularly.<br />
<br />
Class balance is based on averaged gameplay Juujuu, not skewed data.  If changes to Shaman enable the very talanted Shaman to exceed the norm that's fine, look at Bard's.  Bard playing ability and the resulting power varies all over the map, and they are not balanced against the best Bard on the server, they are balanced on an average Bard skill level.<br />

Ok, we &quot;know&quot; it is a NO-XP type of rez. It is an AA ability. I may have missed it, so will ask - what is the 'recast/resuse' time on it?<br />
<br />
Considering it is a NO-XP, the rezzed will come back full health and mana, right?<br />
<br />
Speculating here, but I can see the new role for those additional shaman who wanted to join raids but were told there were enough shaman already:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, stand in this corner. If the MT dies or a cleric dies, use your CotW to get them back asap!&quot;<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Juu - you need to edit all you have said here to fit the main point you mentioned in your first post to this thread:<br />
<br />
 We haven't taken on a named, but regardless, I think that hunting in Kod'Taz with a shaman as the main healer will qualify as &quot;higher end content experience groups&quot;. <br />
<br />
Add in all the rest of the &quot;oh-by-the-ways&quot; (druid backup healer, SK with 6million AC, constant pulls ... er wait, sorta, almost, sometimes constant pulls ... yada, yada) and I have to pull the **BS** switch.<br />
<br />
I am not saying it can't be done. Personally I know a shaman is more of a contributor to these groups than popular opinion believes. But, realistically it doesn't come with a red cape and a big &quot;S&quot; emblazoned on our chest! <br />
<br />
There have been too many random 'big talking shaman' popping up here to talk about their unique god-like abilities that lead an awe-struck group through the impossible. Your's follows this trend. Then additional posts start filling in the gaps of incredulity with details (as your's do.) The details tone the original claim down to something credible and ... heh, yep the reality is shaman are not where they should be, but rather, at the extreme positive range of their talents and player skill, they are finding a spot to contribute minimally - or at best marginally in comparison to what the class has a history of being able to do.<br />
<br />
My bet is you have done xp groups, succeeded at being a viable group member and are speculating (based on current experience) on the potential extra contributions you could make in ideal circumstances in a controlled situation. Fancy for - as long as the level of difficulty stays trivial for the group, shaman will shine. Kinda still falls under the category of pathetic, don't you think?<br />
<br />
The point of being a shaman is to make the impossible trivial ... not the trivial possible. Er, sorry. The point of being a shaman used to be ...<br />
<br />
That said, for xp, I can solo Vxed and make all the wonderful xp I want/need ... in my sleep. So I guess, by definition, the root spell has trivialized content for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Right on Juujuu, you explain it much better than me. I've been trying to tell people that they can do much more than they think they can for a long time, its good to see that I'm not the only one out there who thinks that way :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">That's bull****.. I can main heal as only slower / healer in a KT group and I have taken out nameds in KT as main healer / slower.. hmm shaman must be either really amazing / broken OR I had an amazing 12k tank who gladly took over mt'ing with furious for the most part right after the monks disc ran out.. I had to keep him up with a few crits before mob died... means nothing.. <br />
<br />
take a 9.5k tank to KT, be main healer.. won't last long. KT is not meant to be time geared+..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Honestly I don't know what some people are bitching about. I've been in more than a few Kod'Taz groups where I was not only the main slower and main healer I was the ONLY healer.<br />
<br />
We are not talking about any specific group make up here either. I've done groups with a Warrior as MT, a Paladin as MT and a Shadowknight as MT. In all cases I was the Main healer with no back-up healer (Excpet the Paladin in that case)<br />
<br />
I have found that as long as the tank is good (Read 9k+ Hp's and 1500+ AC and there is some form of mana regeneration be it a Bard or a Enchanter, the rest of the group matters not as long as it has decent DPS.<br />
<br />
We were not constantly chain pulling mobs by any means but we were not sitting on our asses all the time either. We were killing at a rate of pull one kill it, pull another kill it rinse repeat. About ever 20 minutes or so we'd have some downtime for me to med up from low mana (MAYBE 5 minutes max) But even at this rate it was still good enough for an AA every 40 minutes or so which is pretty damd good.<br />
<br />
I have fought in groups like this at camps all over Kod'Taz. North Temple, South Temple, West Temple and even pulling Animals at the Hynid Howler camp. Yes we couldn't kill the Hynid Howler with a Shammy as Main Healer. The group I had with the Paladin tried, we whiped 3 times and on our best attempt we got him to 70ish percent life. So KT named are definately not doable with a Shammy as Main Healer. But really who cares? I'm after the XP myself becuase I need AA's. Items are a bonus(A nice bonus I could use I'll admit) and at worse if a named pops we can possilbly call in some friends help with it. Hopefully before another group kills it or sometimes not. /shrug it's not really that big a deal. Kod'Taz rarely has more than 2-3 groups going at a time on the Nameless.<br />
<br />
On top of all of this I am not uberly geared. Look at my magelo! I am NOT EP flagged, I have ZERO pieces of EP equipment, ZERO pieces of Time Gear, and the only GoD Gear I have are pieces you can get in trials 1-6 and in Kod'Taz itself. Most of my gear is of the Ldon variety, be it purchased stuff or items dropped from Hard Ldons (Which under the same circumstances I think a Shammy could also be a viable Main healer! I haven't tested it yet though)<br />
<br />
I'll be quite honest, I didn't think a shaman could main heal in Kod'taz until I tried it one day when we couldn't find anyone else and some friends of mine asked me to try it out and things went really well (Read: 3 hours of killing and no one died)<br />
<br />
Is it dangerous? Hell yes it's dangerous! One mistake can kill you all, resulting in a nice corpse run and the possibly of an unrezzed death. Is it something that most players are comfortable with? Hell no! Most players will fight tooth and nail against any group without a rezzer of some kind. People love thier nice easy no risk XP groups where even if you whipe recovering is easy and the XP loss is minimal. I personally love unorthadox groups becuase they keep you on your toes and keep you interested. I LOVE Ghetto groups (Anyone remeber Ghetto AE groups?) I prefer to xp in a challenging enviroment. The average normal boring well balanced xp group tends to put me to sleep unless we happen to be doing something challenging.<br />
<br />
Risk = Reward baby~<br />
<br />
Is it skill dependant? Hell yes it is. This is not the type of group for the unskilled player. Your average n00b will probably manage to get the whole group killed within 5 minutes. The groups I have been a part of have only included people I knew personally and could be assured that they knew thier stuff. Is it spell/gear dependant. Hmm yes and no to this one. Obviously the better the gear the more margin for error you have. Spellwise I've done it both using Malos/Turgur's and with just using Balance. I'll tell ya stright up, it's a hell of alot easier with balance of the nihil but it IS still doable with malos/turgurs.<br />
<br />
Why did I ramble on so much you ask? Simply because it pisses me off to see people saying something CANNOT be done. I mean come on have any of you naysayers actualy TRIED what you say cannot be done? I mean surely if I can do this some of you UBER Time/Uqua/Qvic/Texevu/Tacvi geared foks can do it AND do it better than I can.<br />
<br />
Please, also do not fool yourselves. Kod'taz is a Top Tier Xp zone. The ONLY zone that I can think of that is harder than Kod'taz (With my NON EP experience) and could still be considered a single group XP zone is Qvic. I have xp'd in Qvic and although I have never tried being the Main Healer there I seriously doubt that a shaman could do it. But I will not say it CANNOT be done because I &quot;haven't&quot; tried it myself. (Plus every MoB pretty much runs are Bard Speed and that brings a whole new set of problems to the table)<br />
<br />
A well played Shaman can do a whole ton of stuff you would think is not possilbe. I well played AND well geared Shaman can do even more. <br />
<br />
Personally from me to those who think the sky is falling, that our class is seriously broken, that it's time to retire because no one wants a Shaman, that our class sucks, etc, etc whine, whine, on and on.......<br />
<br />
I say get up out of your chair, quit whining and start DOING, get out there and TRY dammit. You people whining and bitching and moaning are only helping to contribute to the overall perception in the EQ community that Shaman suck and that no one should group with us because other classes can do everything we can do better.. Cut it the F#%K out.<br />
<br />
Yes we are not as powerful as we were in the Kunak / SoV era. Yes beastlords cut into our ability to get groups. Yes there are problems with our class. BE WE FAR FROM SUCK! Get out there and show them how useful a Shaman can be. Help contribute to a new rising demand for Shaman!<br />
<br />
Do I think there are problems with the Shaman class? Yes I do. Do I think we are a Broken class? No I don't. Do I think SoE gives a rats ass about us? I think they don't, but that's just me.<br />
<br />
My Top three concerns about the shammy class are:<br />
<br />
1)The lack of healing (Yes even being able to do the above I still think we need a bigger Blast heal)<br />
<br />
2)The uselessness of our Buffs in the post EP world (We are uber masters of the buffs no one wants becasue they do NOTHING USEFUL) Buffs are suppsoed to be a large part of what we bring to the table as Shaman.<br />

3)Lastly the sheer retardedness of the short duration of Ferine Avatar. Rangers can buff attack almost as well (and add Hit points) with 2 buffs that both have a LONG duration and that are both GROUP buffs. I mean for crying out loud FIX Ferine Avatar. Haven't we been punished enough by this damd spell already?<br />
<br />
I have other cocnerns but they pale in comparison to the above 3.<br />
<br />
Sorry I rambled a bit about other things people have posted in this Thread. Anyways onto the topic Call of the Wild.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it changes nothing in the overall balance of things. Sure it's a usefull ability, and it will help out alot in some situations but it is not game breaking. It will help avoiding CR's when the cleric is killed but some of the group survives, and can also be usefull on partial whipe outs on raids. But beyond that........ not much.<br />
<br />
I really cannot see it changing the balance of a group wanting a Shaman or a Druid (beyond the stated Druid/Shaman differences) even IF only Druids got the ability. If it gave back some amount of experience that however would be a different story.<br />
<br />
There seems to be more than a few decent AA's in OoW in addition to Call of the Wild, enough to make the expansion worth buying IMOHO.<br />
<br />
For Example: <br />
<br />
Expansive Mind (raises the FT Cap) is very useful (More mana to be Main healer!) The secondary bind option made possible by Origin. The Extra Spell Slot via Mnenomic Retention (Can't wait to get that one as I do not own very many clicky items and I REALLY need another spell slot) Extra Buff slots via Mystical Attuning and Critical ticks to Heal over Time Spells via Healing Boon (Yet more Healing)<br />
<br />
The 2 of the 3 new Shaman specific AA's looks pretty good. The ability to channel Spells using health instead of mana via Spiritual Channelling (More mana to be Main Healer!) looks very useful and the Group MGBable AA Heal over time via Ancestral Aid also looks quite useful. Boon of the Ancients however looks like a total bomb. Ahh well 2 out of 3 isn't bad, especially for SoE.<br />
<br />
All this in addition to extension of many very usefull AA lines. Reflexive Mastery (Lightning Reflexes extension) Defensive Instincts (Innate Defense Extension) Healing Adept Mastery, Healing Gift Mastery (More healing!) Improved Critcal Affliction, Resplendent Cure (Radiant Group Cure Extension), Sleight of Hand (Spell Casting Sublety Extension) and Destructive Fury (Spell Casting Fury Extension). All of the above are AA's worth getting.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the raising of the level cap to 70 and new spells.<br />
<br />
The downside is some of them are game fixes that we should not have to pay cash for like the extra spell slot and the extra buff slots as well as adding direct combat effects to out level 60 + buff spells. Those are things that should have been patched in.<br />
<br />
The really big downside is grinding out the experience to get to level 70 and to get all the AA's for the above. If GoD is any guide AA's are becoming alot more expensive due to the ease of aquiring XP at the higher end of the game. I personally think that the GoD AA's were overpriced BUT the cost of the SoL AA's and to a lesser extent the PoP AA's are definately underpriced in todays EQ world. Hopefully SoE will price them out a bit more balanced this time.<br />
<br />
Anyways I'm done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">FINALLY! I remember making a thread about this. These days most players are the dumbass watching tv while they play pussies who don't pay attention and aren't motivated. Back about a month ago when I still played I could easily main heal in KT and slow. I had Daludas but didn't have BoT.<br />
<br />
Every time I see people bitch about **** on this board I have been letting it go cause I kinda thought there wasn't really anything that I could say to change their dumbass opinions. Well, let me just add a 5th or 6th backup to Juujuu's posts.<br />
<br />
The fact that there are a lot of pussies who don't really know how to play doesn't mean we suck. Some tuning would be nice (ON THE RAIDING END. NOT GROUPING YOU RETARDS) but we are in o.k. shape, I would say about 7-10th place for balance, and guess what, someone is at 15th place and bitching less.<br />
<br />
Also, you can't get groups? Quit whining, that is probably because you don't impress people when grouping with them. When I had just first gotten KT flagged I think the second group I had gotten there I offered to pull so the monk could do dps and I could keep mobs coming in and make things more seemless seeing as I wasn't big dps. So I started doing that and some people took note, and a week later they were willing to try to do a KT group with me as the main healer.<br />
<br />
I really hate the mentality of the majority of the posters here, but this thread just made me grin really wide. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
PS: Look at my gear! Nothing better than elemential save for a KT item. And I did this before I had this &quot;ok&quot; gear. Back at 3k hp I did this. Try getting a pally, pull with malos as soon as mobs turn, make sure pally is a good-attention paying player, slow (I only have turgurs, never resisted after malos) on inc, 1 stun and hes on pally and you are sitting behind throwing on a bane or a rain and heading out to get the next pull. But I'm rambling... point is you dont need to be uber, but you should have a good amount of AA, AA means so much more than gear, and 65 has been around for 2 full expansions. If you are JUST 65 then you aren't high enough level to play in KT IMO, yes balance should be done by AA, you should have 100, and after a couple weeks in KT that will double O_o.<br />
<br />
PPS: No longer play on account of going to college and don't wanna be bothered by EQ, not because of the state of the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Might I suggest you try preslowing mobs before they get to camp? Who's your puller? Get out there and pull yourself. Lead with malos, land a slow on the inc, laugh at the mob's dps. If this happens a lot to you, then it sounds like a problem of tactics to me. That, or a crappy tank.<br />
<br />
Tank was about 9k hp (buffed) and 1400ac.  Which seems about typical for me in groups.l<br />
<br />
Mobs are always slowed the second they touch the tank. All I'm saying is, the average shaman (heal AA's, perhaps daluda, maybe a 15% heal focus also) doesn't have an adequate heal when slow resists.  <br />
<br />
I agree with you, that when mobs are slowed, shaman can perform well as backup healers.  And if doing something like the south camp, I too (with no heal focus items, but heal AA's and daluda) could have probably main healed.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, we have nothing to add when the crap hits the fan.  Shaman function ok, just ok, when things are continually under control.  But if you group for a few hours, you are ALWAYS going to have a bad pulls or something happen.   <br />
<br />
Its in those situations, that a druid could have kept up with the dps, or evac'd, or an enc could have mezzed, etc..  When the going gets tough, shaman lack.    <br />
<br />
Really, all we need is one AA or spell that helps in emergencies.  If I could have tranferred 3k of my life with an AA to that tank instantly, (say once every 10min or so), the group would have lived.  As it was, without evac or mezz, we all wiped.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, shaman don't do anything better right now.  The problem is, the shaman can't replace (well) any slot in the core druid/cleric/enc team.  Sure, remove the enc and the druid, and we can perform ok in controlled situations, but why risk it?  The group is much more stable with druid cleric enc.  Putting the shaman in place of the druid weakens the group, it doesn't strengthen it at all.  <br />
<br />
I don't know, maybe I'm just being pessimistic.  Perhaps the group heal AA would have saved the day.  400 per tick + Daluda's might have been enough. Guess I'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, other than a couple of EC Hard drops and about another dozen 40 HP Augs, I've about gone as far as I can with LDoN (okay, charm not quite maxxed out yet, but over 15K AP earned).<br />

With about 240 AAs and pre-elemental gear, I'll be jumping into &quot;less trivial content&quot; with both feet shortly.<br />

<br />
With the FD ring Call of the Wild will be useful for CR's. Throw in a DA item and even more so.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">&quot;but nothing that will improve us all that much group wise.&quot;<br />
<br />
1.  A fast heal on par with druids.<br />
---Slow is far less useful, but snare, ports, evac, mana regen+higher hp buffs, tracking, harm pulling, are still really useful.  No reason why giving us a fast heal on par with druids is such a big deal imo.<br />
<br />
2.  An emergency live saving AA.  <br />
----I don't care what form it takes, but we need one.  Druids have wood, bst have paragon, clerics have a zillion of them.  We are priests, and we need something to handle dps spikes and rough situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
If our new AA HoT has a decent re-use time, we'll be one step closer to balance I think.  But the fast heal situation is still wacked.  Our heal over times aren't better than clerics, so we don't add anything in that department.  Plain and simple, we need a fast heal on par with druids.<br />
<br />
And Aruman, I don't really consider a shaman with ~8k hp unbuffed and close to 2k ac &quot;average&quot; lol. Of course people with that type of gear are going to feel a lot more comfortable main healing and handling bad pulls.  There are still far more of us in the 5k hp range, that don't have a TA, that when slow resists, we have that agonizing period of slow refreshing.  That our heals aren't maxed with every focus under the sun, and watch ok tanks drop because we can't keep up with mob dps.<br />
<br />
These are the shamans crying out for better healing.  There are many that can't enjoy the new content they paid for, because the average shaman can't handle it, and when we get a group that can handle it, we feel more like a third wheel than a contributor to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Heh... It just won't end.<br />
<br />
Sorry people... Groups I am used to pull 2-3 mobs at a time, not singles.<br />
<br />
That's with no downtime also.<br />
<br />
What does it matter if you pull 2-3 mobs at a time or not? With groups I would main heal for, the only limiting factor on the exp is the group's DPS. With a good puller a mob is coming in each time a mob starts running, sometimes a tiny bit early, that means the tank starts hitting the new mob and gaining agro while the group finishes off the mob that was in camp.<br />
<br />
If I am main healing, I can't pull also. But with a shm/dru/clr healing and me on backup (yes, a shaman can main heal with me backing up) I can pull in KT such that the DPS classes always have something, except for the rare times when there really aren't any mobs at all... AT ALL... AT ALL in the pull range. <br />
<br />
How does having 3 mobs in the camp at all times make your group better than mine? It is probably faster because you have uber geared dps in your group that just do more damage, but it has nothing to do with the class structure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">And Aruman, I don't really consider a shaman with ~8k hp unbuffed and close to 2k ac &quot;average&quot; lol.

<br />
I never claimed to be. I was just questioning the claims of some people saying they could be main healer in KT.<br />
<br />
I just remember what KT was like early on. Maybe they eased up some on how hard the mobs hit and such.<br />
<br />
I want a better direct heal myself... I feel like a third wheel everywhere, even on raids where I happen to be the solo shaman. I do what I need to do and all, but I still feel like a buff-bot most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well, on this I kinda agree with Aruman. Our raiding power really is pretty bad IMO.<br />
<br />
In a group, a well played shaman can really show his worth, because the nature of a group is asking you to use each class to it's fullest.<br />
<br />
However in raids... you are stocked with healing for the boss coming up, so the trash are trivial regardless of slow. You are stocked with DPS classes so shaman doesn't really add much there. Your buffs don't really mean very much...<br />
<br />
So the life of a raiding shaman... nuke mobs and do bad dps compared to most other classes, patch heal but the clerics really have this covered, and on the boss its not like spamming the MT with heals does all that much unless you get really lucky with timing. In velious era you could keep the group healed from ae's... but these days there are about 20ish people on the raid who can do a massive AE heal and that usually covers people during fights...<br />
<br />
Shaman can shine on the odd fight that has multiple adds/offtank mobs... but... the raiding situation is just bad any way you look at it... So lets try to keep up FA on 10 people O_o.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Aruman, oops, I misread your message.  Thought you were saying that you handle 2-3 KT pulls without trouble in KT.    You were saying that none of the new stuff is going to change our desirability much (I thinK:), which I agree with.  Depending on the HoT, its recast time, and whether it can be mgb'd of course.   The HoT alone would make us more desirable for raids.  Whether that would allow us to be better secondary healers in places like KT is another matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Relating this &quot;shaman can't heal at all bull****&quot; to ressing...<br />
Shaman can heal.  We can't heal very well, but we can.  You can chose to disbelieve this, but it doesn't change the fact that I, and many others that have posted here, can heal in hard places like KT.  The main reason I bring clerics into certain types of groups isn't because they are the very best of best healers.  I bring them because I need to get people back to their body when something goes bad.  I can get a res later, or just say screw it to the res due to the xp loss being so inconsequential.  But when you are, say, doing a Sewer trial for BiC drops, or Tipt, or whatever, you *have* to have some ressing available for the occasional screwup or you have to start over from scratch every time someone dies from something.  I don't care if I can't give xp back.  I just don't want to start over from scratch because I didn't bring a cleric as healer, paladin as tank, or necro as dps.  It's lame, and promotes people hugging zones lines when hunting for xp, and limits choices for forming groups.  Res will be the very very first AA I get from OOW, no matter how many points it costs, just because of how incredibly useful it is for the shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is Sedorra (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=838373).  She's the person that's usually the main tank in our xp groups.  If I'm the *only* healer for our groups in KT, then I can keep her up, but we need a bit of downtime between pulls for me to wince, but that's partially because I also tend to pull so mobs are preslowed, and so I'm never on a horse, and missing out on about 25 mana per tick, and have no chance to c4.  When I have a cleric in the group, he's usually meleeing with healspam hammer, throwing the occasional fast heal, and I'm throwing the other 1/2 of the heals and meleeing myself.  When we were in KT with 2 shaman doing heals, it was constant pulling.  The other shaman was the main healer since he had Daluda's already, though I don't think he had any Time gear yet.  I was backup healer and puller.  The only times there weren't mobs in camp was when I had to run for 10 seconds solid in order to get into spell range of a mob to pull.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd love nothing more than for all you skeptics to keep hunting the zone in of Plane of Earth, or farming BoT for xp cuz it's &quot;leet xp&quot;.  The longer you stay there, the longer I get to hunt in KT without having to compete for my favorite xp spots.<br />
<br />
Shaman definately need some increases in power, but we crippled.  We need some slightly better healing than what we have.  We need faster dots to keep up with the pace of the game (4 tick dots).  We need a LOT less aggro from our dots (50% less aggro at least).  We need nukes about 50% larger than current.  We need our nukes and dots to cast in about 3/4 of their current cast times.  We need Ancient Canni to be storebought.  That would fix us.<br />
<br />
Slow combined with our heals should provide the same effective use to a group as a cleric or druid purely healing.  Slow is damage prevention pure and simple.  400 mana spent on damage prevention is the same as 400 mana spent healing, if you prevent the same amount as you would have healed.  Right now, we can prevent a lot of damage, and heal a bit.  This doesn't compare enough to the amount of health that can be healed with just a pure healer.  The problem especially becomes evident when mobs are unslowable, or highly resistant to magic/disease.  Our damage prevention becomes negated, thus crippling our usefulness.  You don't see mobs that do more damage if clerics cast certain healing spells, yet you see mobs that are unslowable.  ***.</div></div><hr />

So your main tank has less than 6k hps when in this group set up.  No druid for nines, no cleric for kazaad or virtue, no Paladin for BSS, and a shaman keeping him or her up with only &quot;a bit of down time.&quot;  I know most people still have raid buffs on them but your talking about making this group your self and most of the time they will fade with in the hour.  Then on top of that you are pulling also.  Could you post a magleo for your self and a log of more than an hour of this.  I could be wrong and thats fine but this seems to me to be way too much.  Maybe you have 40% healing enhancement and max healing AA's but nonetheless hard to believe.  Its easy to say your doing it but please show us.  If you have a 10k tank plus I can see some of this but some of the Kvy when hasted are DPS machines.  I get a resisted slow about every 5 to 8 mobs. That would be the end of just about any tank with only a shaman healing.  Maybe I'm horrible off and if so my bad.</div></div><hr />

I just choose not to cause I don't have to.  If I wanted to be the main healer in any of those places, I could do it if desired.

Of course we have CC. What I am telling you if you could learn to read is: I can't be main healer in the exp groups I am used to.<br />

Does this mean I can't heal? No... I haven't bothered trying since getting raped in KT when GoD was new. <br />
<br />
Does it mean I can get better exp with real healers in a group: YES!<br />
<br />
And yes, it does speed up exp with multiples in the camp. Or is the reason why beyond your comprehension?<br />
<br />
I have to go by what other people say, but based on my experiences, I don't see a Shaman being main healer in KT. Hasted 1k hitters will waste the group while you futily spam Daluda's or Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between insufficient and inadequate.<br />
Our heals are enough that we can get by.<br />
Our heals are not enough that we can get by in enough harder situations (ie slow bounces or unslowed adds).<br />
Slow + heals is enough for a shaman to be a main healer in 99% of the game.<br />
<br />
Herein lies the problem facing shamans.  Shamans are balanced with &quot;Slow + Heals&quot; in mind against other healing classes who don't have slow to be balanced against themselves, but still benefit from its effect more often than not via one of the other slowing classes.  Other slowing classes have also become more numerous - Bard slows have become meaningful and beastlords have entered the picture.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, mobs are tuned with slows in mind.  As such, shamans' slows are checked twice in the balance picture: once in shaman vs. cleric/druid balance, and once in player vs. content balance.  <br />
<br />
This leaves shamans with subpar heals + slows vs. clerics' and druids' full strength heals + slows coming from an outside source (which, incidentally, is preferable anyway, as you can't cast heals and slows at the same time as a shaman).  <br />
<br />
This makes shamans great against more or less trivial content, where weakened shaman healing is sufficient, because they can effectively fill both roles simultaneously, saving the group a slot for another DPS class.  Sure, another healing class + another slowing class might be more powerful in the strict sense, but against content where you don't need that extra power, shamans are great in that they fill both at once.  <br />
<br />
The problem is, that advantage doesn't carry over to more challenging content.  It doesn't matter if you can contribute both healing and slowing when two other classes could fill the role more effectively.  Against the content that matters, the increased power is needed and thus well worth the extra group slot, leaving shamans nothing to show for their versitility except an overused LFG tag.  <br />
<br />
That the other slowing classes are desirable for other roles in addition to slowing doesn't help the matter.  Enchanters' charmed pets are a force to be reckoned with (where applicable) and they are the best choice for CC.  Beastlords contribute unique buffs and respectable DPS.  Bards are EQ's Swiss Army Knife.  When you've already got sufficient healing, Shamans aren't wanted as healers, thus one of the other slowers is preferable because their other contributions are rendered more important.  <br />
<br />
The way the game has developed has further damaged shamans' postition.  Their highly effecient HoT spells have been rendered virtually useless against current non-trivial content - the modern game is all about spam heals, and it is in this area that shamans are most inept.  <br />
<br />
The obvious solution is to quit balancing shaman's heals with slow in mind - to bring shaman healing to the point of relative equivilance with druid healing.  This also means focusing more heavily on shamans' fast heals and putting less emphasis on the HoT line; shamans' HoT spells are useful only against content where they are well off, thus improvements in this area are not warrented.  <br />
1) Shamans' fast-heal capabilities should be increased to be roughly on par with that of druids.  <br />
2) Druids should recieve a line of HoT's for use against trivial content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course we have CC. What I am telling you if you could learn to read is: I can't be main healer in the exp groups I am used to.<br />
<br />
Does this mean I can't heal? No... I haven't bothered trying since getting raped in KT when GoD was new. <br />
<br />
Does it mean I can get better exp with real healers in a group: YES!<br />
<br />
And yes, it does speed up exp with multiples in the camp. Or is the reason why beyond your comprehension?<br />
<br />
I have to go by what other people say, but based on my experiences, I don't see a Shaman being main healer in KT. Hasted 1k hitters will waste the group while you futily spam Daluda's or Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
 I haven't bothered trying since getting raped in KT when GoD was new. <br />
<br />
Hrmm... Lets go ahead and examine that one once more...<br />
<br />
 I don't know what I am talking about. <br />
<br />
/groan.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if I decided to bring 3 mobs to the camp at once I couldn't solo heal either. But when I have a good puller, and I get mobs slowed as they are running in, I can main heal and ALWAYS HAVE A MOB IN THE CAMP.<br />
<br />
Now when you thought I was condescending before, you probably had no idea how right you were.<br />
<br />
Based on game mechanics group dps is based on how much time the people in your group that are DPS classes are actually attacking the mobs versus the over all time.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if a mob comes into camp the second another mob dies and the main tank and dps start attacking it, it is the exact same as if you had 3 in the camp (2 being mezzed) at all times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, maybe if you could explain how I am trolling I would be able to avoid doing it in future... Is it possibly because I am replying to all your posts in a manner that displeases you? I am not just posting to piss you off, I just disagree with what you are saying.</div></div><hr />

To re-iterate:-<br />
<br />
1. Shaman heals are reduced by the fact we have slow.<br />
<br />
2. Cleric and druid heals benefit from slow because the &quot;normal&quot; group will have a slower in it, whether that be bard, beastlord, shaman or enchanter.<br />
<br />
3. So why are shaman penalised by having crappy heals when the cleric and druid have *better* heals and also benefit from the mob being slowed &lt;boggle&gt;<br />

Having multiple mobs in camp at all times slows down xp.  It's a fact.<br />
<br />
For every mob being kept in camp but rooted/mezzed/kited, that's one group member who's wasting his mana and/or time on not doing damage to the active mob in camp being killed.<br />
<br />
What's more efficient?<br />
a)  an enchanter spending multiple hundred mana every minute keeping mob X mezzed while the group kills a 2nd mob<br />
b)  an enchanter spending multiple hundred mana every minute nuking the mob in camp.<br />
The answer's obviously b) for anyone who's not retarded.<br />
<br />
The *most* efficient method of getting xp is to have a 2nd mob in camp the moment the first mob in camp is dying, so that all the damage dealers in the group immediately switch from the dead mob to the new mob, thus keeping dps at a maximum, but the 2nd mob isn't ever dealing damage at the same time as the first mob, thus keeping incoming damage (requiring mana to heal) at a minimum.  It's the principle of &quot;just in time&quot; manufacturing of things on an assembly line.  You get what you need just in time for it to be processed.  It eliminates inefficiency.  It reduces waste.  It's the most efficient method of processing whatever you are processing as long as the resources are available &quot;just in time&quot; for the next step of the processing.<br />
<br />
If having two mobs in camp at all times was really better than having one mob in camp, then having three must be better than having two, and having four must be better than having three, and having 20 in camp at one time must be incredibly good xp compared to one mob!  *nods*</div></div><hr />

Just in time processing is well known and established as the most efficient method of processing things, assuming there is a steady supply of stuff to process.

You might want to pull your head out of the clouds (or your ass) and do some background info on this before you just dismiss this *fact*</div></div><hr />

It's not always the most efficient.  Many classes can do damage to more than one mob at a time.  While the general principle is a great one to follow, the efficiency *plummets* for every second that there isn't a mob to fight when they last 20-25 seconds.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not true at all, it's not a linear calculation - how could it be if you are speaking of efficiency, which implies that there is a peak spot where you get the most bang for the buck?  The best spot for most fast paced, competant groups is probably one mob being killed, one mob on deck, then one being pulled so that it arrives when the on deck mob becomes the current target.<br />

On an assembly line yes, but assembly line parts aren't being root-rotted while they sit and wait to be assembled next.  The conveyer belt, or puller so to speak, doesn't start helping to assemble the parts if there's more than one set available.<br />
<br />
See where your definition stops and EQ takes over?  EQ is not real life :)  The 300 mana every minute to CC one mob is irrelevant to the guaranteed next mob waiting, instead of hoping that the next mob will be inc by the time the current one dies.<br />

Ohhhh I can stack two Blood of Saryrn's on the same mob?? ;)  I think the necros of the world are chuckling.<br />

As I already said, the mana it takes to properly cc just ONE mob is inconsequential.  Running low on mana is not an issue anymore.<br />

I didn't say you should always multi-pull nor did I say that you should always single pull, I just wanted to clarify that because just in time processing is so efficient in the real world does not mean it directly translates to EQ, even given ideal circumstances.<br />

Yedra I don't think anyone is questioning that it can't be done with out a perfect group.  I think what is being said is that Juujuu claimed with 6K SK he could run a group with just a bit of down time as the only healer.  And if that is not enough he is doing the pulling.  I believe it is possible to do this with a shaman and druid as healer and a 10~11K tank.  I would also say it's possible for TWO shaman (with gear and AA) to keep a tank up with 10~11k hps.  But I just can't believe it's possible to do for a SINGLE shaman and a 6k sk to do reliable for more than a few pulls.   With this set up one resisted slow and your tank is down.  There are plenty of ways to make it work someway or another but to do it remotely reliable is another story.</div></div><hr />

No I didn't say I do not want a better heal, I did say that our heal is usable, I would never say we as shaman don't have issues, but I dont think the shaman class is done for either.<br />
<br />
We need help with things but the sky isn't falling. The only fight we currently do I cannot keep my group alive and do things like slow are major AE fights. A fast good size heal or a group heal would fix that.</div></div><hr />

I dont think anyone is saying that, I think mostly people are arguing that its not AS BAD as its being put out there. That Shaman can, in fact, function as primary healer in upper Gates under the right circumstances.<br />
<br />
Besides, there are SOME Shaman who would rather NOT go in the &quot;more healing&quot; direction with our class, and rather the &quot;more DPS/Utility&quot; direction. One of the biggest problems with Shaman, there are lots of different ideas regarding what we &quot;need&quot;. I thnk most would agree that a bump in healing SHOULD be part of any package, but I, for one, do NOT wish to become a &quot;pure healer&quot;.</div></div><hr />
