are these guys for real? they are buying plat for $10 per 100kpp and sell it for like $350 for 100kpp.<br />
<br />
are there people that actually pay that money for pp? is this site even real?<br />

<br />
I didn't see where they'd buy pp for $10/100kpp, though - just that they'd beat any verified offer by $10/100kpp, which seems a bit more reasonable.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE has so far decided to fight this by merely terminating accounts when caught but there are stronger measures they could take if they so desire.  The cost of legal proceedings being what it is I doubt we will see them take such measures though.<br />
<br />
That said, there is now a guy on Nameless offering to sell plat to anyone with a Paypal account.  Sick.</div></div><hr />

yes, there are ALOT of people who buy plat with real cash. playerauctions.com is a very popular site that sprang up after ebay was no longer allowed to sell any EQ related items, (how they are allowed to do it, while ebay is not, i have no idea). tho, i must say anyone who sells 100k plat for 10usd is a friggin retard, i'm assuming that particular figure is inaccurate. I mean, think about how long it takes to save 100k plat, would any of you throw that away for 10 measley dollars? i wouldnt, prolly not for 100 dollars.</div></div><hr />

Ebay decided to ban everquest auctions at Sony's request.  It is not a matter of permission.</div></div><hr />

ahh, i didnt know that, i thought there was some legal preface that sony was using to prohibit ebay from selling eq items. thx for da info</div></div><hr />

Besides, I heard the &quot;lost post count&quot; event was really an expimental system that filtered pointless, unneeded posts from your overall count.  What did your count drop to Mill? :eek:<br />
