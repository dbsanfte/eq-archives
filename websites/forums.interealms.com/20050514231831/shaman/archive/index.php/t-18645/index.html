<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">years ago i remember getting the caster beads and turning them into the Gavel of Justice.  it took lvls and lvls,  but i got my first magic weapon.<br />
<br />
i thought i was total uberness.<br />
<br />
yesterday i got it on Discord, and that feeling was returning.  then i realized the Gavel is <br />
Slot: PRIMARY RANGE SECONDARY  <br />
Damage: 5 Delay: 34 <br />
Ratio: 6.8 Bad <br />
and not only is it no longer RANGE, it is crap compared to a short run to Qeynos and back to get<br />
<br />
Cudgel of Justice <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 1.0 Size: LARGE <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Damage: 4 Delay: 26 <br />
Ratio: 6.5 Bad<br />
 <br />
that i already had.<br />
<br />
oh well.  at least blue server i have my Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic to cry with.</div></div><hr />

Btw, I'm pretty sure I saw you on Discord a night or two ago.  Re-rolled as a troll now instead, same name though :)</div></div><hr />
