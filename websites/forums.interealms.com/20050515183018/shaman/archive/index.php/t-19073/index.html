<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a shaman, and ONLY a shaman.  If it weren't for the fact that I had NOTHING to do except EQ on a friends computer for 2 months straight, I never would have played this game for more than 5 minutes.  The low level game at the time and the graphics were just that poor.  However, I was stuck with nothing else long enough to reach the point where the game got to be fun.<br />
<br />
  However, I still to this day cannot make it up to level 5 without realizing that I would FAR rather be watching TV, sleeping or seeing friends than making it to level 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As a result of this, I have no alts.  Every group I have ever been in has had a shaman in it (me).   I want to know just how many groups exist out there with NO SLOWERS.  Our heal is being scaled due to the fact that with a 1300 DD heal and our slow we are supposedly equal to a druid with their DD heal and no slow.<br />
<br />
  Is it really that common to run around without a slower?  I was honestly of the impression that this NEVER HAPPENED.  If I am right and people only fight unslowed mobs if their group's slower died before landing it, why are our heals balanced on the assumption that no other healer in the world is willing to have someone else slow for their group?<br />
<br />
  I guess if mobs existed in the game at the level our heals start to fall behind that you could actually fight unslowed with clerical healing it wouldn't matter, but I don't see any post 60 group ever going anywhere without a slower in my experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For most group its pretty rare that there is no slower.  At least from groups that my monk alt is in. Shamans are certaily not the only slower in the game, and of course slow is just a pasive form of crowd control, (i.e. limiting the amount of dps that mobs can create).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see groups without a slower all the time.  If they balanced our heal in regards to our slow then they made a mistake, as a common tactic with no slower is to place a damage shield on the tank so that the mob's hasted speed becomes an effective added dps for the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a lvl 55 Alt Troll Warrior.  With most groups I am in there is either a shaman OR a chanter.  On a side note however, I can't count how many times ENTIRE raids have wiped because a slow failed that was needed or one heal was mistimed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At the lower and mid levels, sure its common to have groups that don't have slowers.  And these groups do just fine.<br />
<br />
At the higher levels, especially at 65, exp-giving mobs tend to hit so disproportionately harder that it makes a slower required almost all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have entirely TOO many alts, tho the one I actually play somewhat often is my 35 ranger.  I also have a 18 monk and 16 pally (and some unused newly created ones).  I think that groups not having a slower is very common up until the mid to upper 40's.  Generally when I take my 35 ranger into LDoN groups, if there is a shaman in the group they basically heal and we just plow hard and fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my experience the only difference is that without a slower, the cleric doesn't get to melee.  With a slower they hardly have to heal at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first character was a wizard, which I leveled up to 62 befor starting my shaman(62 is where he still sits). I recall that it became very common to see a slower in almost every group around 50ish. This became even more the case when PoP came out, and no group I was in was ever without unless we absolutly had too. Even then there was always a search going on for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In PoP yes it is very typical to have some kind of slower, in normal LDoN its hardly needed if theres any sort of CC. Usually mobs are 1/2 dead before slow lands anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've done a fair few dungeons now with my shaman NOT SLOWING.  Honestly, when people just want to get through them and get their points ... if you bring enough damage, slowing is just slowing down the process.  It's kind of strange to become a nuker/healer in these situations ... and it makes me realize how hard it is for me to squeeze any kind of meaningful DPS out of Velium Strike and Tears of Saryrn.  I get excited about my 1900 point crit, and my mage just humors me and says &quot;sure, that's just great!&quot;  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you've got to remember that we dont get a really decent, noticable slow untill 39, with Torgor's insects.  It can be hard to appreciate the benefit of a 25 or 30 percent slow I think, but when we start slowing by 50 percent people start noticing the benefit.  That would explain why slowers are not common below 40ish (that and the ungodly mudflation that has happened, especially since PoP).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slowing mobs isn't really necessary until the 50s IMO.  With the amount of twinkage on people these days, you hardly even need a Cleric until the 50's.  Rangers and Monks are tanking into their 50s these days and the DPS just makes it impossible to justify the mana to slow a mob when it won't land until 40%.  But, when you do get closer to 60 or you goto PoP, it is very hazardous to your health not to have a Shammy or Chanter around....or a BL slow for that matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who was it that started the trend of calling our &quot;instant&quot; heal a &quot;DD&quot; heal anyway? DD = Direct Damage. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
