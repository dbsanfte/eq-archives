<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cross-post from Members Forum:<br />
<br />
Well last night I logged Blaydde on and started the journey to Luclin. Kindo was kind enough to port me to DL and, as I waited at the DL portal for the Nexus to open the portal, I was chatting in guildsay. In the midst of this chatter, Wulfran auctioned in guildsay &quot;WTT Kedge Robe to a dorf&quot; or something like that. As many of you know, Blaydde was a Kedge Robe short of his epic. So, assuming Wulf was teasing, I offered in guildsay to trade Kilrain to him, knowing of Wulf's attachment to dwarves. Wulfran responded that I wasn't offering enough (*ducks and waits for Kilrain to start throwing bottles of ale*). So I offered to throw in Drolgin. Wulf promptly accepted. Next thing I know Wulf tells me that he is serious - that he has a Kedge Robe to multi with me and that it is mine since it is the last piece that I need. I was STUNNED. <br />
<br />
So for the next couple of hours a group of me, Wulf, Lady V, Doku, Meiamour, and Serlina travlled the countryside finishing the rogue epic, and Blaydde now proudly wields Ragebringer. <br />
<br />
I want to thank all of you for all of your help and encouragement along the way. I owe particular thanks to Rizz (who insisted that Blaydde loot his General when Blaydde screwed up his turn-in), Wulfran (who supplied the elusive Kedge Robe), and Aseid/Dexail, who deferred on the Kedge Robe so that Blaydde could finish RB first, being higher-level. The generosity displayed by members of this guild is extraordinary. <br />
<br />
Speaking of generosity - umm, Killer, umm - yer now Wulf's slave.  You too Drollie.   8P <br />

<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you got there, Amarin!  I'm sure you are happy to have that out of the way and own such an awesome weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is also a very substantial damage upgrade for the guild as a whole in terms of damage in large encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
55 rogue + Ragebringer + double backstab = large owie<br />

Congrats, my freind.  Sorry I missed the turn ins.   :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And don't worry Kilrain and Drolgin, I don't intend on keeping either of you: I intend to sell you as soon as possible to help raise funds for a horse :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good plan Wulf.  I was grouped with both of them last night and found the smell almost intollerable.  If you want them to go for enough to buy even the oldest nag, you will need to bathe them thouroughly.  I also reccomend a nice dress for both of them, and maybe a ribbon for their braided beards.  They might sell well that way to some lonely seamen near the docks of EFP.  :D</div></div><hr />

One thing I must addmit about Wulf. He choose the right class(barb) to house the heart that this man has. His selfishness should be a lesson to us all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wulf you might need a corset laced up nice and tight to ahh shift some of that dwarf tummy around to even get a sailor to look at Killer in a dress..  there has to be one around somewhere.. a simple quest perhaps.. to Vhela locker perhaps?? <br />
<br />
oh be sure to pinch his cheeks to make them nice and rosey.. a drunk sailor might take that as blushing.. <br />
<br />
most important of all Congrats Blayyde!! it great to have your epic in hand.. wish i could have been there.</div></div><hr />

Wulfran that was an awesome thing for you to do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To clear any confusion here... I was on a phinny run with a dozen other KOE when the robe dropped: all I did was loot it and get with Blaydde... Sin, Moe, Baracus, Fana, Cshae, Thanduil, V and others were all there to help kill the Squid Man too.<br />

Now back to business... anyone want to buy a paladorf? selling him cheap... :p</div></div><hr />

You may not remember me, but I will never forget you, cause you were the first to make me run in a wolfpack when I was still a lowbie, biting the heels of a HG in Rathe Mountains  ;) ...  <br />
 <br />
You seem to have found a nice new home and I feel very tempted to join you there, but being in Dungeon Masters, who are like a family to me, I won't<br />
