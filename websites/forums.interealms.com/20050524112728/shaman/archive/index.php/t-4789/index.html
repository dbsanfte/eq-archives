<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am using canni dance since my 30s, but now have two minor problems with timing the ticks in new UI:<br />
<br />
1. When i have regrowth on, HP bar is not increasing step by step, but with rather irregular timing.<br />
I have natural regen, sitting regen, regen3 and regrowth active, actually 23 plus per tick.<br />
HP bar is showing, when i look at numbers: +5 +15 -15 +18, so it has no constant increase to use for timing.<br />
Is there any way to have all increases in one step? And what is used to time the tick for mana regeneration (i assume its the +5 natural regen)?<br />
<br />
2. Is there a quick way to change color of mana bar (to something better then dark blue on black - i like the black background usually)? <br />
I am nearly as blind in RL as my toon :D, but don't want to try a complete new UI at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest that you get a mod that shows your percentage mana. This will make it much easier to time your cannidance then.<br />
<br />
you can find the mods over at www.eqinterface.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hubby made some player windows, I asked him to lighten the colour of the mana bar as I thought it was too dark too. You can find them here:<br />

<br />
If you want to adjust the colour on your existing player window then it looks like you need to have a play with the filltint part under player_mana in the xml file for your player window. Theres R, G and B values, have a fiddle with the numbers.</div></div><hr />
