<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to get an idea of what AA routes different shamans take. Heres what my current line up is so far.<br />
<br />
Current AA Points<br />
<br />
General: 3 Innate Run , 3 Innate Regen<br />
<br />
Arch: 3 level Mental Clarity, 1 level Spell Casting Fury.<br />
<br />
Class: None (4 pts saved so far for a grand total of 24 pts)<br />
<br />
I'm planning on getting Mass Group Buff as soon as possible. I raid on a daily basis and I am often the only shaman present. Hitting 40 ppl with Khura's is a pretty hefty chore. After MGB I am gonna get Cani 5, then its kinda a toss up between Natural Durability, and Spell Reinforcement. I've been told reinforcment makes torpor last extra ticks, but haven't been able to confirm it personally. I also want to max out combat stability at some point, but its not very high on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm 1 point and about 2.5 blue AA short of finishing MC.  Wow, does MC suck :/  Anyway, I plan to get Cann V first.  Yes, MGB will be a huge help, but we have enough late arrivals and partial wipes that the mana regen ability will benefit us faster than 1 MGB will.  After Cann V and MGB I plan to start getting 1 level in things like HG, ND, SCF, etc...not sure about the order yet, I have plenty of time to think about it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd get Can 5 before MGB without thinking about it. Can V will help you get the extra AA for MGB, and MGB won't help you get Can V at all. <br />
<br />
Can V will also help a ton with buffing Khura's group by group. My shaman isn't 60 yet so I might be off on the numbers, but doesn't Can V give more mana than a Khura's focusing takes? I'd think it would make it pretty easy to buff 7 groups with Khura's Focusing, as you can recover the mana for repeat casts quicker. It's also true that you won't have MGB every time you need to buff all those people. People will be late. People will die and need rebuffing. The entire raid will wipe and need rebuffing. And MGB won't have recycled yet. <br />
<br />
The only question I have is how often a shaman can use Can V, but I'm under the impression that the recycle time on it isn't very long at all. <br />

<br />
can't decide if I want healing gift, quick buff 1, or SCF.</div></div><hr />

I find that SCM probably wouldn't help me much because manaflow isn't that much of an issue. Now you may wonder why QB and SCR are good. Well that's quite simple. They affect torpor. Not getting interrupted on torpor and having it last longer is a killer. Of course faster cast buffs in general help a lot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about Channeling Focus?<br />
<br />
When you're tanking, interrupts suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">are you telling me that SCR makes torpor do more of a heal? because my amulet of insight certainly doesn't seem to make it last any longer.<br />
<br />
as for channeling focus, I'm mostly a root dotter. not to mention I run around with focus on at all times, so it's not that often I get interrupted to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What about the new abilities we just got - the extra hitpoints and the reduced damage thingy - do they have any attraction?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I jst dinged my first ever AA point - Wootah - Go Me!<br />
<br />
And rather than the traditional wisdom of runspeed, I went for regen...I use regen ALL the time, but runspeed only occasionally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the extra hps are 'ok' but without cannib 5 I wouldn't even think about it. I got ND1 and was very dissapointed at the 31 or so hps I recieved for 2 AA points.  maybe one day I'll consider the extra 60 I'm expecting from ND2, but I'd rather just apply to a guild that can do ntov and gain all that hp in one item drop. the other damage things? no attraction atm. the mana efficiency and quick buff stuff is far more attractive. since I cast spells ALOT, and don't generally tank things that require me to waste alot of mana healing on. and if I do? more mana efficiency or faster casting torpor from quick buff are far more effective in my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">testing... last message didn't post my damn signature.. don't know why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You only get 1 sig per thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes that is what I am saying. AA skills affect any spell tagged as a buff, this includes celetial heals of torpor type. Focus items on the other hand require the base duration of the buff to be at least twelve ticks. Torpor is four ticks or with SCRM it should do six ticks half of the time seven ticks the other half. That it can do seven is in line with it's duration being a MINIMUM of four ticks base and reports of it once in a blue moon hitting the exact tick and making it five without AA.<br />
<br />
In any even, yes AA WILL affect torpor, mine with my newly aquire skill of QB2 has a cast time of 4,5 but it's cast time is NOT affected by the emperor key that takes of cast time of buffs longer than twelve ticks. It also regularly lasts for five ticks as I have SCR2. This can not be replaces by focus items. I dusturbingly I've heard that both speed and duration bonuses are capped at 50% which is the maximum effect of the AA rendering buff focuses virtually useless since you anyway need the AA for the less than twelve tick buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">your torpor is doing 5 ticks regularly with SCR2? looking at the numbers 15% seems to say it wouldn't do a 5th tick at all with 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I currently have:<br />
<br />
RS3<br />
Regen3<br />
MC2<br />
<br />
I am going for:<br />
<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
Combat Agility3<br />
Quickbuff 2<br />
Natural Durability3<br />
Combat Stability3<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
I doubt I will ever get that far tho as I hate xp grinding as is and it will take all my efforts to grind to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is just personal experience but maybe it could help.  Regen3/Run3 are usually the typical general selections so i'll start with Arch.<br />
<br />
Highly Useful<br />
Mental Clarity 3 - Prereq for Canni 5<br />
Cannibalization 5 - Uber uber uber.  Uber.  Should be the first thing you go for, especially with the new cheal i.e. you don't need torpor to use this skill.<br />
Quick Buff 3 - This skill will save your life more than any other.  The ability to torpor in 3 seconds instead of 6 (without focus items) is unbelievably useful.  Shamans catch aggro alot, and being able to tab to yourself and quickly torpor comes in handy constantly.  Plus without it you can write a book in the time it takes to cast group focus.<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3 - Doesn't matter what your playstyle is, less mana for spells = good.<br />
Improved Natural Durability 3 - Free hps are &gt; all.<br />
MGB - Pain in the ass to save for but worth it in raid situations.<br />
Combat Agility - Get hit 10 percent less, its nice.<br />
<br />
Medium Useful<br />
Channeling Focus 3 - One of those &quot;hard to say when it actually works skills&quot;, but I guess it all adds up.<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3 - Depends how often you nuke.<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement/Mastery - Good to have.  Buffs last longer and having SCRM will make Torpor last for 7 ticks.  Getting SCR1 will make Torpor last for 6 ticks (1800hps).<br />
Combat Stability - The worst of the 3 (agility/stability/dura).<br />
Healing Adept - Depends how often you heal out of group, doesn't effect the new heal tho.<br />
Healing Gift - Again depends how often you heal out of group.<br />
Rapid Bear - Um.<br />
Alchemy Mastery - Um.<br />
Pet Discipline - I guess...<br />
<br />
Anyways that's how I look at them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So far I went (in order)<br />
<br />

Regen 3<br />

MGB<br />

After now I am going after some AA's to get my Class title, then I will be working on ND3, CS3, CA3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Johnkelly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Run speed 3, Natural regen 3, Mental Clarity 3, Cana 5. First and formost imo. Cana 5 rocks on Raids and while soloing. But yes, torpor is a must and, not to mention, not highly recomended without ageo for the extra hp's. <br />
<br />
    Then Mass group buff,for the Large guild raiding Shaman, is a huge benifit. Yes, i did mass cana first just to help recover more quickly after casting this. <br />
<br />
    Then I went right to Spell casting reinforcement 3 and Spel casting reinforce mastery. Your mass group focus now last longer then the reset time on you mass cast. Your guild will love you for the longer lasting buffs. Very good to have for those long raid days.<br />
<br />
    Channleing focus was my next goal, but then VI felt generous enough to give us Natural Durability. Extra HP's are a MUST for mass cana. Everything was put on hold till this was maxed. <br />
<br />
    Now Combat Agility and stability were next on my list, but then VI gave us this new 1950 direct heal. Now healing adept and gift are top priority. 10% more effective heal and 10% chance to crit heal for double. This makes shamans VERY acceptable back up healers now on boss mob ventures and when duo'n with a war for exp.<br />
<br />
      Channleing focus will just have to wait. And yes. i did throw in rabid Bear and Spell casting fury for my own exp needs once I completed the ones i felt would help the guild out the most.<br />
