<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Godzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this sounds like a radical proposal but I have picked this up a couple times on the serverwide chat...  We should be the best slower by far at 75 percent.  Chanters should be dropped to the 60 range and bst to 50. <br />
<br />
Chanters and bst bring so much more to the group than slow i.e. CC, dps, mana regen.  There have been some radical changes by soe in the past like the monk nerf and the mages eating thier pets for mana.  I know the other classes would gripe and moan but so be it.  If shaman could CC at 90% the effectiveness of a chanter or do 90% of the dps of a bst then I would call us balanced out with them as far as them invading our slowage.  Don't know if that last sentence made any sense but you get my point.<br />
<br />
Anyway just a thought.  Maybe even giving shaman an aa that gives us the ability to &quot;strike through&quot; a targets slow mitigation by a certain percentage.  May not be a big deal till the end game but that seems to be where we have the biggest problems.<br />

/agree.<br />
I don't mind him that much anymore honestly.  He used to really bug me for his attacks and blatant derails of threads, but I got over it.<br />
<br />
I think he's the only one with 3 red dots that posts. :p I also wonder if half his more recent attacks weren't done on purpose after his comments were received poorly early on when he started posting here.<br />
<br />
If you can't be famous, I guess being infamous is a suitable substitute. I pity him more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
You must have me confused with someone else.  This is only my second post.  I have one other in the 50-60 solo spots zone.  I wasn't really wanting a nerf of other classes but was stating a fact that would seem fair if they could do 90% of what we do best we should be able to do 90% of what they do.  I'm only lvl 52 and don't have any problems yet.  I can solo well and won't see the end game maybe ever.  I was just thinking of what I have heard from the other shaman who were way beyond me.   You might know me from the serverwide chat as Ripdumb from Inny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that or nerf chanter/bst down to the lvls they should have been at, that or boots our heals to druid lvls, that or...you see where this goes.</div></div><hr />

As much as I might like this idea, I have to agree with Glorianna, we cannot do this to the detriment of others. Ryan has already said he would not go above 75% on slow, which rules out that bump as an option. I and several others have posted about an AA that mitigates the mobs slow mitigation. The other option is to expand upon our disease based slows, and leave those as shaman only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A long-standing idea to return Shamans to their role as primary slower is the concept of &quot;mitigating mitigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning, a shaman reduces 1 level of mob slow mitigation when slowing a target.  Mobs that mitigate to &quot;mostly successful&quot; to BLs and Chanters would be fully slowed by a shaman, and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
I like this idea, but doubt it will ever be implemented.<br />
<br />
If this is ever implemented, it will probably be in the form of an AA ability that reduces mitigation by a certain percentage, like 5%/15%/25% reduction in the mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
My apologies for the mispost.  I'll edit and copy to the correct thread.<br />
<br />
A very embarassed shaman,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As I mentioned in another thread, I think a BIG part of the problem is that when they gave other classes OUR defining ability, they gave it to them at a 100%, 93%, 86% ratio. Healing, however, was given at a 100, 60ish (I forget the druids exact ration to clerics) and 47%!!! Someone explain this to me? Did SOE feel that slowing was important enough that 3 classes should be virtually equally as good at it, but that healing was the specific province of Cleric only, with Druids and Shaman being tossed bones as an afterthough not even CLOSE to the same? <br />
<br />
And they wonder why we bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There's an easier way to fix it, which I've wished for before (but here I go again).<br />
<br />
Keep all the slow percentages the same, but change the formula used to calculate their effect.<br />
<br />
Right now we believe it is <br />
<br />
   E = B*s*m     (today's formula)<br />
<br />
Where<br />
   E = effective attack speed<br />
   B = base attack speed<br />
   s = slow amount, as a fraction<br />
   m = mitigation amount, as a fraction<br />
<br />
what it should be is<br />
<br />
   E = B*(s-n)    (proposed formula)<br />
<br />
Where E, B, and s are the same and<br />
   n = new mitigation amount, as a fraction<br />
<br />
I am assuming here that mitigation is implemented as a sliding number, with some mobs mitigating 100% (&quot;immune to slow&quot;), some at 0% (old world), and some in the middle (&quot;mostly&quot;, &quot;partially&quot;, etc).  From what I have observed, this seems pretty likely to be the case; if it's not the case, then it's done by &quot;binning&quot; the mobs into categories for mostly/partially/immune, which is a subset of this technique using specific preselected values for m.  I am also assuming that the calculation is multiplicative, like I show, which seems to be the consensus although I don't have any solid numbers to back that up.  <br />
<br />
OK, so there are some esoteric formulae up there... what impact would it have?<br />
<br />
Let's say you have a shaman throwing a 75% slow, an enchanter doing a 70% slow, and a Beastlord with a 65% slow.  Furthermore, let's assume that the mob mitigates slow such that when slowed by a shaman he does 50% of his normal attack rate.  That makes 'm', his mitigation amount using today's techniques, 50%.  'n', his mitigation amount using the technique I am proposing, is 37.5%.  The formulae become<br />
<br />
E = B*(.75)*(.50) = B*(0.375) using today's technique, or<br />
E = B*(.75 - .375) = B*(0.375) using my proposed technique.  So far so good - there's no change in the way the shaman slows.<br />
<br />
But the enchanter's scenario is<br />
<br />
E = B*(.70)*(.50) = B*(0.35)  (today)<br />
E = B*(.70-.375) = B*(0.325)     (proposed)<br />
<br />
and the BL is<br />
<br />
E = B*(.65)*(.5) = B*(0.325)  (today)<br />
E = B*(.65-.375) = B*(0.275)     (proposed)<br />
<br />
This puts the relative effectiveness of shaman/chanter/BL slows at 100/87/73, which is a lot closer to the ratios used in describing our healing abilities than the multiplicative version, although still a bit high.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, if we slow 5% better than a chanter, then we reduce 5% more of the mob's damage output, regardless of the mitigation factor of that mob.  Today, the difference between chanters and shaman SHRINKS as the mitigation goes up.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't know for SURE that slow mitigation is multiplicative like I suggest above, but if it is, that could be part of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've often had this thought myself, and I believe this is how it should have been implemented... The problem is, SoE will almost NEVER bring other classes' abilities down like that... imagine the firestorm it would create.<br />
<br />
The true problem is that they won't go over 75 percent due to the risk of making old world content trivial.<br />
<br />
What I am worried about is the other slowers' percentage of slow being raised slowly with level cap raises, while we remain at the cap of %75...<br />
<br />
I believe they headed in the right direction with Nihil.  Perhaps a slow that has a respectable resist modifier and good cast time like Nihil can be reworked so that it also comes with an innate debuff that is along the lines of Cripple, but perhaps more powerful, as in some type of actually EFFECTIVE modern era means of dps lowering.<br />
<br />
But they seem to think changing Nihil did the trick.  Oh well... we can still hope!<br />
<br />
But actually, this is all trivial, because we can change into bears.  Who cares about anything else?! Wheres mah HUNNY at?!? /raaaawr</div></div><hr />
