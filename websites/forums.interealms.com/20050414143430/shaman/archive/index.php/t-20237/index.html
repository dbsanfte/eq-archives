<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I log in and not more then half hour later crash with a message asking to send information to sony for evaluation. When I log on to the toon my menus/window/control screens are set in differant areas on my screen. I have to readjust all my boxes every time I log on. I had reformated my computer and reinstalled EQ prior to this starting. I went and checked for any bugs and none were found. I am getting no where fast with Sony tech support. Any one else experience these things? Please help.</div></div><hr />

Why did you reformat the HDD? Was it because of a virus? If so, you could have a MBR virus, which can only be cleaned by booting from a special cleaning floppy made on a non-infected machine. Check for viruses from a clean bootable floppy with a command-line scanner first to eliminate them (some are very sneaky and can hide themselves from virus scanners once in memory) If that comes back negative, check that the EQ directory and ini files are not checked read only, that would explain why window positions aren't being saved. Other than that, maybe one (or more) of your drivers are out of date, or an incompatible version. Check the versions first, as it is the simplest explanation and usual problem.</div></div><hr />
