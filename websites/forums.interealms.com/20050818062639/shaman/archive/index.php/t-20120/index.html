<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow Shamans, I've been a long time lurker and have gained much wisdom from this community, and I hope to contribute back as I progress and gain knowledge and wisdom of my own. <br />
<br />
I am looking for some quidance before I go spending my 8 banked AAs. Currently I have 89 AA's, 81 spent as follows:<br />
<br />
General: <br />
Innate Run 3<br />
Innate Regen 3<br />
<br />
Archetype: <br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 (extended buffs)<br />
Natural Durability 3 (hitpoints)<br />
Combat Stability 3 (mitigation)<br />
Combat Agility 1 (avoidance)<br />
<br />
Class:<br />
Cannibalization<br />
MGB<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (ext buffs)<br />
QuickBuff 1 (buffing haste)<br />
<br />
Most of my core play time will be spent raiding and off time will be spent pursuing GoD expeditions and maybe some LDoN.<br />
<br />
I went with SCR, MGB and SCRM (and I have the Ring of Firewarding) since so much of what I do is buff my teammates, I figured that the more value from my buffs, the better contribution I make. When I was wrapping up the 24 I needed in my Class to get my Elder title (ok, it was vanity...) I only needed 2 more points and the only thing that looked interesting at the time was Quick Buff, so I put 3 pts into that. But the more I think about it, the less attracted I am to QuickBuff, since it doesn't really save mana or extend buff times, it just saves me a few seconds during buff time. I already have a Ceramic Hammer of Innovation that I use during buffing and that cuts down buff times dramatically, but at first glance it just doesn't seem like there's enough value from QuickBuff to make it worth spending for 2 and 3. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, one of the things I get called on to do a *lot* in raids is rebuff Boar and Focus after rezzes, and the quicker that gets done, the sooner our companions are back in battle (and the better the shaman team looks, let's not forget that). So I have mixed feelings about Quickbuff. <br />
<br />
I currently have 8 pts banked and I'm not certain where I want to spend them. My primary role during raids is to buff, Malos, Slow, Cripple, and add some DPS when and if I can, but primarily the above. Occasional but spotty requests for Naddox and Tal of Trib.<br />
<br />
There are many times when I'm also called upon to patch heal in tense situations where every drop of healing is necessary. Although I rarely act as MH in any context, I often am required to patch heal so I keep Tnarg's up at all times and have a hotkey dedicated to its gem slot. I'm wondering if there's enough value from the various associated Healing AA's that I should consider spending them there.<br />
<br />
I don't really use my pup in raids and if I did I'm sure I'd want discipline first, but 6 pts? <br />
<br />
Another dimension to this is that I'm spending a *lot* of time in GoD trials lately with guildmates. I've beaten the first two sewer trials and working on the 3rd, and have been working Tipt with some friends who have already progressed to those. These groups are extremely fun and I will contine doing that as long as I can, so more of my DPS will probably be required as I need to round out my participation in the small group setting of GoD, where team role efficiency really matters.<br />
<br />
I've read a lot of threads here about various AAs and general pictures are forming in my mind, but I'm looking for thoughts from others who are doing the kinds of activities that I'm doing specifically on where the best values are for the investment.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ah, but Quickbuff works on Q/torpor. :)<br />
<br />
I would recommend QB 2 (no need to get QB 3), RC 1 or VP 3. Personally, I love the healing AAs and finished them all very early. Currently, with a nice heal focus item and maxxed AHA and AHG, I heal for 1700 most of time with crits up to 3400. Good stuff!<br />
<br />
You might want to work on your own survivability if you're in GoD. Finishing up CA/LR and working on SCS might be a big help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd get Radiant Cure 1 and Virulent Paralysis 1 with the AA you have saved up, both of those are serious bang for the buck. <br />
<br />
From there there's a lot of ways you can go:<br />
SCM3 is very good AA, 10% mana pres on every spell you cast. I'd put it high on your list.<br />
<br />
VP 2 and 3 are very nice. Play around with VP1 and see how you like it.<br />
<br />
Quick Buff 2 is nice, think of it as saving cast time on Quiescence after you use Canni5. Any AA that can make a difference every 3 mins is good :)<br />
<br />
CA3/LR5 is well regarded around here.<br />
<br />
The healing AAs are good as well.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't consider getting any GoD aa other than casting subtlety before getting all of the above ones I mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AgrajagGarrgravarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd get Radiant Cure 1 and Virulent Paralysis 1 with the AA you have saved up, both of those are serious bang for the buck. <br />
<br />
<br />
From my experience, don't even bother getting VP unless you go at least to VP2.  VP1 gets resisted so often it's useless by itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go for VP3 ASAP though, especially if you like LDoN. That AA seems designed for that expansion, seriously. The ability to bounce a mob out of the combat area and root it is pretty solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For mainly raiding, but some LDoN etc I'd get the following, in order:<br />
<br />
RC1 (lots of bang for the bucks)<br />
VP1 (ditto)<br />
CA3 (surviving aggro is great!)<br />
VP3 (its just so much better than VP1)<br />
LR5 (takes a while but really helps survivability)<br />
QB2 (Faster quiessence rocks)<br />
HG3 (if you're patching on raids, the difference between crit and not crit can save the MT. A few hundred hp difference from HA is less likely to)<br />
<br />
Beyond that, consider RC3, HA3, Crit affliction, Crit nukes, puppy power or anything else that takes your fancy.<br />
<br />
If you solo then I'd put VP3, SC3 and Crit affliction higher up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, everyone is right really:<br />
<br />
RC1 (best bang for the buck period)<br />
VP3<br />
QB2 (or 3 if you don't have a haste of mithaniel item)<br />
SCM<br />
SCRM<br />
HG<br />
AHG<br />
HA<br />
AHA<br />
LR5<br />
<br />
is the order I'd go probably.  Maybe move LR5 up, but I'm not nearly as impressed with it as some are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trevalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have VP1 and use it somewhat regularly. I generally use it to knock back an add and hold it while I get the other mobs under control, and overwrite it with Paralyzing Earth when I have time.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand why people recommend VP3 so highly (granted that I don't have it myself). The refresh time to me means you still need to have another root memmed or a clickable, in case you get a resist or an early break or have more than one mob to root at a time. Despite some comments in this thread, as far as I can tell higher levels of Virulent Paralysis do not have a lower resist rate.<br />
<br />
So what's the deal? The added duration is a little nice, but its easy to overwrite with PE when you get the chance, anyway. The larger knockback seems fun, but even VP1 knocks things out of melee range, so it doesn't seem like that big of a difference. I see that VP3 is an upgrade, but I am curious why people recommend it so highly over VP1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perception, I guess. I sure feel like VP1 was resisted a lot more than VP3. Maybe it was ust the mobs I was hitting. Dunno, I'm not a parser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The duration on most mobs is pretty much good until it recycles.  A manaless root is good.  A manaless root that can very quickly move a mob out of melee range is even better.  You just spin and face in the direction you want the mob to go and press the VP3 button.  Viola!<br />
<br />
In LDON VP is very nice I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">VP 3 is great.  As long as your teammates know to leave that punted mob alone, the root holds for 2 minutes almost every time.  No pets, no melee, no &quot;helping&quot; out:  leave my punted mob alone, go kill something else!  <br />
<br />
I just finished LR 5 yesterday.  So boring, getting 3 more aa and moving to LR 2, LR 3, if it made any difference at all I could not see it.  Second guessing myself all along the way, people say LR is so good, got to get LR, but I can't see the point, all these aa and it makes no visible difference.  Sigh.  Finally got the last ones, bought LR 5, and -- wow.  Why didn't anybody tell me how good this is?<br />
<br />
I know my evidence is anecdotal.  I haven't parsed anything, and so I can't compare any before and after numbers.  But last night we were farming for emperor key pieces in Ssra, and we were being pretty aggressive, two and three snakes at a time, fast as we could go.  I was pulling a lot of aggro casting slows on mobs that were not locked down.  I was amazed at how often they swung at me and missed.  I am pretty sure I never got hit four times in a row:  the mob would always whiff at least once in four swings.  I often got missed twice and three times in a row.  <br />
<br />
There was one particular moment when one of the snakes swung at me and missed seven times in a row.  Then I got this message:  A Shissar Templar mumbles &quot;Dammit, that's it, I'm petitioning.  Seven misses in a row!? Nerf shamans!&quot;<br />
<br />
OK the petition part was a joke.  But the seven misses was real, and the overall high miss frequency was real.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it was just a really lucky night for me and the RNG.  But for the moment, I pass along one shaman's observation:  CA 1 - 3 followed by LR 1 - 4 made no visible difference for me; and then LR 5 looks huge.  It may be that damage avoidance has been increasing by small incremental doses all along the way, but it appears to all happen at once at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCM makes a huge difference on the amount of mana you spend.  You can really see a difference when massing fot7.  I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
From a raid standpoint, RC is very useful.  I raid more than anything else myself, and I usually do not use VP as much on raids as RC (though VP3 is great and I love it).  I only have RC1, very few occasions that i need more, but it's nice to have at least 1.  I'll get RC3 eventually but isn't a priority now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks everyone for the sage advice, this is a great forum for getting a variety of perspectives from people who are actually *using* these things. Here's what I decided to do, based on all the feedback here and my own interpretation of what would be most valuable to me:<br />
<br />
QB2 (the Q issue decided it for me)<br />
CA2 (starting the long road toward completing defensives/LR5)<br />
RC1 (seems too good to pass up in utility)<br />
<br />
Next on the list will be the healing AAs (probably HG then HA) and VP. Although I don't do as much LDoN anymore, I figure the same reasoning applies to some extent to GoD expeditions.<br />
<br />
Isn't it interesting how little support there is for the new GoD AA's? ...<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PS You another MS person?<br />
<br />
Hi Gloriana! No, I don't work for MS but I've lived here since the 80's so I've watched them prosper along with the community. It's great to be from a little town called Redmond, Washington and have online friends from around the world know where it is!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice, btw, I went with QB2 after all and I'm not regretting it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In my opinion, none of the GoD AAs are as useful (or as cheap!!) as the pre-GoD AAs. I bought: <br />
<br />
1) 1 level of quickened curing - purely for the RC encounter, it was a fairly cheap purchase and I don't regret it<br />
2) 1 level of critical affliction - just for funsies. <br />
3) 2 levels of call of the ancient - I thought it would be an endurance regen and several warriors in the guild said it would be a useful thing to have. Since it was discovered to be a lousy hitpoint regen (although the description in game SAYS endurance regen) I've been petitioning/feedbacking daily for an AA refund.<br />
<br />
After buying the GoD AAs, I am now working on CS/ID and plan to get FOM 3 and pet hold before going back to GoD AAs.<br />
<br />
I would definitely work on pre-GoD AAs before worrying about GoD AAs (with the possible exception of SCS which is getting rave reviews from shaman who have it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm liking SCS quite a bit now.  I'm a huge fan of LR5, and noticed it make a really dramatic difference to me.  However, if SCS keeps you from getting aggro, depending on what you tend to do with your playtime, it might obviate the need, or at least push back the high priority, of LR5 and similarly the combat mitigation AA's.  If they don't want to hit you in the first place, you won't need to worry what happens when you get hit, as much.  <br />
<br />
Of course, if you're in groups where aggro control isn't good, or just find yourself getting hit all the time or are soloing, then SCS won't be enough to let you avoid getting LR5 as quick as you can.<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of radiant cure, for people who raid a lot or just group a lot where group members tend to get slowed or hit with DOTs, etc.  Some mobs group slow everyone, and that drops down your DPS a lot, sometimes enough to put your group's survival in danger.  Any DPS and crowd control you're doing gets interrupted by doing lots of individual cures, too.  So being able to radiant cure as much as you can is I think often very valuable.  <br />
<br />
VP -- I hated it at level 1.  Thought it was ok at level 2, definitely much better.  And at level 3, I like it well enough.<br />
<br />
I'd do all the things like quickbuff, scm, scr, scrm ages before I did anything else but canni 5.  All those work well with each other to really dramatically enhance you.  The other stuff is playing with toys by comparison.</div></div><hr />
