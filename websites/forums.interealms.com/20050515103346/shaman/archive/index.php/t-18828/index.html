I never seem to find the time to click epic as I'm either casting/refreshing dots or mashing the canni4 key while waiting for canni5 repop.<br />
<br />
Grouping stuff dies to quick to bother using epic -Bane/VS or Bane/Tears for 90% of grp dps these days.<br />
<br />
Raiding, well trash dies too quick, and bosses I'm either chain healing after debuff or putting bane and some nukes on. would rather use a  dot slot on the mob for 70dps bane over ~15dps epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Grogbat you might be able to answer this for me. I see alot of shamans talking about stacking all these dots on a mob, but where do you find the spell room? Are you constantly switching in and out spells to dot? When I solo in Tatics i have two spell sets. First spell list is for pulling (slow, malos, malosinia, malic decay) and then once the mob is debuffed and rooted i switch over to the dot spells. I have clicky pants and VP3. I never bought Anathema because I want some other things first, but I am pretty sure I will get it since I love Bane so much. 3 more wins to BA4 aug! Anyway:<br />
<br />
Pulling<br />
<br />
1.) Kragg<br />
2.) Malosinia<br />
3.) Malos<br />
4.) Slow<br />
5.) Cann 4<br />
6.) Q<br />
7.) MD<br />
8.) Bane<br />
<br />
Then for dotting<br />
<br />
1.) Kragg<br />
2.) BoS<br />
3.) Malos (just in case of dispells)<br />
4.) Slow (In case I have to refresh)<br />
5.) Cann 4<br />
6.) Q<br />
7.) BoU<br />
8.) Bane<br />
<br />
How do you guys find room for Bane, Anethama, BoU and BoS? Am I keeping too many spells up? Please help a lizard out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Meku, I use 2 spell sets for fire (tables) <br />
<br />
PoF pull:<br />
<br />
Q<br />
Tnarg<br />
Canni4<br />
turgur<br />
malos<br />
malosinia<br />
mal decay<br />
greater immob<br />
<br />
PoF kill:<br />
<br />
Q<br />
Tnarg<br />
Canni4<br />
turgur<br />
Bane<br />
Blood<br />
Breath<br />
Anathema<br />
<br />
All I do is pull with malos and immediately click root pants. greater immobilise is up for If I get a resist and have to kite around like a mad fool, dont have to run far to get the spell cast (1.8sec?) off, as opposed to 3 sec root on pants.<br />
<br />
Then mal. decay, VP3, summon drogmar, malosinia, turgurs. Once Vp3 and slow are on the mob is pretty much locked down, and I can use root pants at max range if VP goes for some reason (like your wizard friend arrives and nukes mob to help)<br />
<br />
Then it's a one click wonder to switch in 4 Dots and just keep them refreshed. pretty heavy on the mana but I kill before slow wears off usually (about 5.30 to 6mins a kill, 1-2 mins downtime). I use sinia as the bulk of my damage is Mr/Pr, plus the 20min duration helps if I have to slack off and talk to people mid fight.<br />
<br />
I used very similar tactics in tactics ;), start with full debuffs, then switch in dps once mob was controlled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It isn't worth the 9 second cast time to me.  The only time I would ever use a dot that lasts that long is while soloing, but when I solo I keep up ultor, blood of saryrn, bane, and anathema.  Between those four dots, I just do not have 9 seconds to spare.  If I stop to cast epic, one of the other, infinitely more powerful dots will fade and go a tick or two without being refreshed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use it to time my poison dot, and for right now, the stats on it make it worth it, mostly for the saves although the aug'd scion claw that clawws(?) had is tempting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our Epic is a waste of space, poor range - long cast time and a low damage dot<br />
<br />
It's nice in lvl 50ish range for when it was designed, but now it's <br />
mostly kept in my bag and rarely ever used.<br />
<br />
With canni 5 what do I need a mana free dot for?<br />
<br />
Lower cast time and I might use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I haven't yet found any upgrade to main hand, which would have such stats and resists like epic does, so it's a very decent one still. Not to mention it looks good. I use DoT when I can, but for extra kicks, I don't really count it as a damaging tool, 9 second cast time is just too damn long. And, it's a symbol, ya know :) If you're lvl 65 shaman and still haven't got your epic, then, dang, you're a lazy one or incompetent one. Got mine at 50 (was 50 when quests were introduced) and despite all the dang camping and killing of quest related mobs and still not getting the piece I need, or losing it to someone else's stupidity, I still think it was worth doing it. And I did it mostly on my own, only critical/toughest parts I did with friends/guild/alliance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">IMHO if you didnt do your epic, you are only half the shaman you could have been.<br />
You missed out on a great story line and alot of History story tell that would have been neat for you to experience.<br />
<br />
No Im not saying you wont play as well, (settle down lol ) Im saying that the spear is a Shamans pride as is any classes epic. Not as much as the stats but just the fact that it is unique to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Long story short you cheated yourself out of the &quot;Whole&quot; Shaman EQ experience. Some of my most fun memories was waiting on the bottom of that god forsaken lake wating for Abe to Spawn for 3 hours lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also it is attainable to us at a young age, I had mine finished at 46 and only becuase I had to wait til that lev for the fear tear.<br />
<br />
Please keep what I say in context, it has little to do with how you play.<br />
Im simply stating you missed a big part of the shaman walk if you didnt do it. (dont let the ego flare please) It seems like alot of folks 65 get attitudes real easy, which is also a shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Why the heck would you ever use the epic boots in the high levels?  Wanna take up an inventory spot?  Or you keep it in a bag?  Okay the only time I'd *ever* need those boots was if I was running from a mob that ran faster than run3 (read: rare) and I'm not going to use up an inventory spot for those boots just for the rare (read: never) times that happens, but when it did happen, I'd have it in one of my bags.  So I'd hafta fish it outta the bag, switch out a bag for the boots in inventory, all while out-running a mob and casting.  Real convenient.<br />
<br />
There is rarely a time when I've had to &quot;have&quot; a sow so quickly that it warranted those boots.  It takes all of 2 secs to use the right-click context spell menu to mem sow and cast it yourself.  After all I've heard about those boots, I've tried it here and there and each time I said to myself &quot;what do they see in these boots?&quot; as I put it back in the bank.  For all I care, those boots take up a spot in my bags that otherwise would hold a rusty dagger for dogdog (I carry tons of these around).<br />
<br />
The other time I could think of is during a raid where you'll be losing a lot of buffs to dispell.. so you can click sow on.  I'm not a huge raider, but at least once a week and it's not often that I come across those situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I just got my epic last Saturday. The short range of it is disapointing, but it looks great!  I use it for soloing, throwing on for manaless damage whilst kiting with a druid friend in HoH, and just to provide a little extra damage whilst raiding or in an experience group/LDoN.  I don't have Canni5 yet and will probably use the epic less once I get Canni5<br />
<br />
Ssnafu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Starting to really notice how many hps I could put in that slot, and shopping for a replacement.  I'll be sad to see it in the resist gear bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I would replace the epic if I could find something worthwhile (even without a right click / effect).<br />
<br />
I'm not in an uberguild and I haven't seen anything worth replaceing it with... the stats on the epic do not suck... if it's worth the effort is up to the person... but they do not suck... resists, wis, hp... all in one package... with a dot that's situationally useful (well, always useful I suppose... it's free).<br />
<br />
Maybe one day I'll see something close enough, or much better in stats, and replace it... but it's been glued to my hand since I got it.<br />
<br />
Anyone who doesn't use it, can you give just 1 or 2 examples of something very comparable or better, than the epic in stats that people may actually be able to obtain?  (ie: Not coming from ele+, VT, Emp, etc..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Haven't used my epic in ages. I still use the boots because if I have to run somewhere I want to get there as fast as I can. In groups I prefer Bi Lih over regular sow.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be too concerned if you don't get your epic before you have something better to replace it. I don't miss it at all. That 9 second casting time was a crock from the get go. Sure I used it soloing but only in my low 50's.</div></div><hr />

dont slow. if you are upstairs there isnt any point in slowing, the only mobs that are seriously dangerous are the sk's and slow wont save you from one of those bad boys. theres a post about tactics soloing, probably on page 2 by now but near the end of it I list a sweet guide for tactics soloing, I need to update it since I grabbed afew more aa's/spells and have been getting crazy in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah epic only when soloing for exp or farming greens. otherwise I use 2hblunt and melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It's always in primary for me and probably won't be upgraded unless i get the rare chance of looting clicky slow stick.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The fact that I equip and use affect on epic doesn't change the fact that its totally obsolete.

But I can never destroy it even though I will never equip it again.  As far as DoT solo set up mine looks like this:<br />
1.) Malos<br />
2.) Ultor<br />
3.) Blood<br />
4.) Bane<br />
5.) Velium Strike<br />
6.) Root<br />
7.) Q<br />
8.) Tnarg<br />

I have the fortune of being able to wield the TA and have Elem pants as well.  Makes it a little bit easier to root rot to say the least.  VS is memmed to finish off mobs or I sub out that for Anathemia sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I swap it with a thundering mace (65 HP) as the situation demands.  It is still useful for solo work, which is a lot more that can be said of many other epics.</div></div><hr />

Do you raid much?  Right clicky dummy buff items are super useful....<br />
Also, the sow from the boots is faster than run3, and it only takes one click to get it and you can do it on the fly..compared to say..sit down, mem sow/billy..wait for refresh...cast...unmem..remem new spell...run...</div></div><hr />

Hmm, orb of forgetten magic puts out more dps in grind group than epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I replaced my Epic a long time ago with Winterstorm, since its a better melee weapon and also allowed me to replace my JBB. At that time I still used Epic to DOT on occasion. <br />
<br />
Now that I am 65 nearing 200 aas, lots of VT and PoP gear, and a Sharkspine, the epic is in the bank. I dont even use it soloing in root-rot zones, I just stick with Bane, BoS and BoU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Boots are better than shaman epic...might even say better than all epics (minus cleric's...best item in the game).  I never used the dot even when I used it as main gear (2 or 3 years ago maybe now?).  Cast time was retardedly long for how little damage it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Bagged my Epic the day I got a Staff of Lost Rituals and I never took it out again :(<br />
<br />
Yeah, Bane isn't free. But it does in 3 ticks what it took my epic 14 ticks to do. And then does it again before dropping. Plus, using the staff instead, I get enough free focus-damage out of it using 2 or 3 DOTs to more than compensate for the 'loss' of the epic DOT. <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, 75% of the damage was in the last 3 ticks, which it pretty much never used to get to anymore, be it in group or in raid. Even in SolRo, I am lucky if the MOBs last long enough for the 2nd Bane to run out.</div></div><hr />
