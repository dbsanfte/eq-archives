<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This happened to me tonight. Was on a raid, got a rez and slapped Q on myself. Waited till my HP hit over 2k and hit Can 5. <br />
<br />
Bam! Dead!<br />
<br />
I'm 100% positive my HP was over 2000 at the time. Was actually about 2200-2300 at the time Can went off. This ever happen to anyone else? Was wondering how it would be possible that I died.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

It has happened to me several times, I &quot;think&quot; it's showing the HP but you don't really have it, I usually wait for my hp to top 2k.. then wait for the next tick of Q and start my Canni then. It's annoying, and i'm not sure why it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, it happens sometimes.  I think its the client side hitpoint tick getting ahead of the server side update, so you see 2100 hps and the server sees 1800.  Ever since that happened to me I wait an extra tick before pulling the trigger on cann5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have a similar, yet lower level, problem. Using Stoicism i proceed to cann and i notice that my hit points are dropping by a larger amount than the cann should be taking. I figure its the same type of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Havent killed myself yet, but I never Cann V when it's THAT close.  Always make sure im over 2k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It has a lot to do with server lag and updates on life; in the past it has caused people to die to heals that never landed because they started too late, made you look like you were at full life and were actually at 50ish etc....it happens a lot when I 2 Box my SK, blast him with Tnargs and he looks full life for a few seconds, even on his screen, but he actually only was healed enough to get to 80ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bah!!  Live a little!  I have a goal of Can5ing myself to single digits.  Best ever is 25hp so far... Hard to time it with innate regen though.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've FDed with it many times to show off :p</div></div><hr />

Me too until the I finally killed myself doing it.  Of course I did get quite a few more laughs out of that than FD'ing.  Like others have said the client side gets ahead of server side so I always wait until I'm a good 2 ticks over 1924 before I canni 5 after a rez.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol I canni'ed down to exactly 0 hps $$$ made my afk cleric have a **** fit too when she came back *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Happened to me once when the server was really laggy.  My client showed me at around 2400hp and I canned.  I was dumbstruck that the client could be off by almost 500hp, but it had to be.  It's the only time I died to a cann5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Cannied to 1 HP yesterday with C5, and nearly gave the cleric a heart attack because I forgot to hit my &quot;Canni 5 inc ... it's just a flesh wound! I've had worse!&quot; button before I did it. Never died from a C5 unless I hit it at the wrong time and got beat down by an indignant mob. Died from a C4 yesterday in HOH ... heh ... innocently munching away, lagged, and hit the button twice. It was embarras-- oh hell, it was just plain funny. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used to have canniFD down to an art form.  It just wasn't a good day if I couldn't get to -5hp.  Best canni story:<br />
<br />
In BOT, ME group.  We're recovering from a wipe, I'm on my lizard, and I'm canniIV like a champ.  Notice my HP are at 145, so I think &quot;woot, FD inc!&quot;  CanniIV, FD.<br />
<br />
you have taken 8 points of falling damage.<br />
you have been slain by unknown forces!<br />
LOADING, please wait.....<br />
<br />
I died falling off my lizard.<br />
<br />
I'm an ogre, and frequently take minor damage when dismounting, just never put it together with canniFD before.  I still don't count that to canniing to death.  Still perfect!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well thanks guys, glad to know I'm not going crazy, lol.<br />
<br />
As for canniFD. Done that twice already. Not sure if I'll do it again since I'm gonna be very very careful from now on. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I occasionally get a phantom tick with torpor, used to get it a lot with stoicism.  Its always taken away the next tick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I often Canni4 myself down to as close to 1924hps as possible and hit Canni5 after a rezz to see how close I can come to death. So far I haven't died to a Canni5 death yet but my best effort got me into purple for one round before I regened back over 1hp  :D . I was proud cuz everyone in my group was watching at the time.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I read once that using C5 while you have the rez affects will do double damage(or at least make the dmg worse).<br />
<br />
Guess that rumor is false.  :)  <br />
<br />
I've FD'd once with C5.  Scared the crap out of my group.... and myself when I realized I nearly killed myself!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Haven't died to it yet, but I've taken myself as low as 2hp.<br />
<br />
There's just something about getting rezzed, looting, then throwing Can V and going from 100%hp to 23%.  It amuses me.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I died falling off my lizard.<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG!! hahahhaa. This was the first post that made me laugh today! TY :D<br />
<br />
I've only died once from Canni5, and that due to low hps agro and the mob I thought was mezzed NOT being mezzed. I do however find it fun to get as close to 1% as I can. I LOVE scaring the clerics and druids!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There was a bug sometime back when this happened a lot. More recently, I have noticed the client hp updating with the server - if I hit Canni V and then quiessence back up, quiet often the hp will leap up 600 and then a moment later go down 300 (for a correct net gain of 300). Not quite sure what's going on but its definitely a client/server thing. I take care with canni these days because of it.<br />
<br />
Think I've died one from teh lag bug and once from being stupid - plus a couple more from low hp aggro when Ive misjudged things a tad.</div></div><hr />
