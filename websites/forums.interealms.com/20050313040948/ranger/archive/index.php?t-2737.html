<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsta</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well of course i do something stupid.  The servers have gone down today again, and i was in rathe Mountains partnered up with a 50 cleric,  we hunted for a while together but it seemed i did a lot more kiting then i think i should have and i never actually tanked, i would snare and kite while he medding ( i am thinking so he can fear and i can attack without losing to much in the hp area), but he seemed to be always out of, or low on mana not one time did i get a  traditional fight with a giant, well we had about 30 minutes before the servers went down and i am kiting when i read the server message, well a cyclops aggroes on to him while he is medding and he takes off, so i run to the cyclops slap it a few time and snare him, ok now kiting the giant and the cyclops,  mana is at 10 and the cleric is still oom i guess.  Finally i ask if we should zone to clear this up,  about a minute later hes says zone, i ask where he is to make sure he will be ok, he says he is quite aways away, so i head to the zone, mana is gone now, snare fades on the cyclops he is beeting me, i was at 30% health, i throw out tangling weads to get a little room and hope i get enough mana to cast snare again, ....whats this?.......oh SOW fades too...great..... well the last snare i have is interrupted so i fight to the death, like all proud rangers do,  i tell my partner i didnt make it so he says he will rez, i am already omw back there because i know the servers are about to go down i get back just in time to hear &quot;servers coming down&quot; everyone has camped and i am the only person there,  so after all that rambling ......am i gonna have a chance of finding my corpse and looting it when the servers come back up or am i gonna be a naked ranger for a long time?    (sorry this was so long)</div></div><hr />

EDIT:<br />
Also Rathe Mtns can be tricky CR even for a bard or necro, the song/spell points you in a straight line at the corpse but going in a straight line isn't always an option there. Print out a map from eqatlas, grab some chipped bone rods(any potion vendor should have) or a bard friend and kind of just zero in on it, and dont be afraid to write on that map heh. Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
