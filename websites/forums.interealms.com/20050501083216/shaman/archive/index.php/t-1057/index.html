<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Didnt have malo/mala last night...so I couldnt do it. Tash, puretone occlusion, malosini bounced 10+ times....after 5-6 mins I FINALLY got malosini to land...at that point clerics were close to oom and people were dropping like flies...after I got malosini to land I canni'd up just enuf mana for a turgurs...bounced. <br />
<br />
Done the statue before, had malo and it seemed easy as pie. <br />
<br />
Wonderful to know one of the spells I dont have makes or breaks some endgame encounters. <br />
<br />
Someone wanna loan me a couple hundred thousand plat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, you'll probably need malo/mala to have a good chance at landing malosini, though with malosini on you should have been able to slow soon enough.<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation, malo dropped from the protector in Sebilis last night for my 6 person group. Mala dropped from him same kill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can't land Malosini, don't try.<br />
<br />
Your lower level spells get a bonus to land and they are comparitively cheap to cast.<br />
<br />
Chain cast Malaise/malaisement, once these stick then toss on Malosini, you should be OK then.<br />
<br />
Remember at lvl 60 Malaisement is -40 to resists, Malo is only -45.<br />
<br />
I've used this many many times to stick slow on a mob there would be very little chance of otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get your bards a Tash stick and a Tash Orb.  Thats another -56 MR.<br />
<br />
/shrug I've never bothered with Malosini on Statue, slow usually stuck right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I keep hearing something about bards and tash sticks.. whats the deal? why a bard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sticks stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">stacks with what? regular enchanter tash? or the orb stacks with the stick? and again, why the bard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any effect or song cast by a bard is not effected by stacking rules.  Thus it's possible that a bard who procs a tash will stack that tash on top of a enchanter tash.  <br />
<br />
This is also how people get very large damage sheilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perhaps by the time you got Malosini to stick, OOS or tash had worn off? That might explain the slow bouncing. That or bad luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have the lower lvl statue that doesn't quad getting the slow to land usually isn't that big of a deal. tash, occlude, malo, slow combo lands 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
However, recently we had the higher level quadding version of the statue and he tore us a new one. between 2 60 shaman and a 60 chanter none could land slow (figure at least 12 slow attempts at a minimum there). we had a mage trying to get malosini in also and it bounced everytime.<br />
<br />
the only difference is using the lvl 60 chanter buff vs the lower lvl one. Only a 1MR difference in the debuff. /shrug  But I'm willing to give anything a shot givin how wierd some of the other stuff is in the game.<br />
<br />
Here is the debuff cycle we are trying next time after talking with some friends:<br />
First debuff round:<br />
chanter - winds of tishania<br />
shaman - malo<br />
bard - occlude<br />
mage/shaman - malosini<br />
<br />
second round debuffs:<br />
Slow<br />
Cripple<br />
<br />
The chanter debuff here is an aoe but has -40 on MR debuffing. <br />
Haven't caught the quadding status up yet to test this out but talking around this is the best chance to get the statue slowed quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">THe importance of landing Malosini BEFORE attempting slows can't be stressed enuf.  An early slow resist can spell death for a shaman or enchanter.  The smart slow caster will be sure to spam the mob with 'SINI until it's landed, whereupon he/she will announce to the guild/raid in SIMPLE terms that %T has been maloSINIED!  THen everyon attempts a slow. <br />
<br />
I did Zlandicar yesterday morning as he had popped and my guild was the first capable one to get to him that morning.   We did the Malo and tash and OOS and everyone who could started to cast 'sini.  I was the one who finally landed it, but landing slow also proved to be difficult.  I also stuck that one however, on my second cast.  <br />
It was nice to be the hero for once.  Zland was about a third of the way dead when I landed slow, and the majority of us were alive and ok.  Bout 5 people died out of 25, so not a horrible attempt.  I think we're capable of much better performances tho.  Last Zland only killed one necro who overnuked/doted.  Silly necros with Funeral Pyre and big taps hahah.  <br />
<br />
The rule is tho, use sini and live to try again.  Use Turgurs first and plan to spend a lot of time looting your own corpses.  <br />
Generally I consider myself a rather important member of most raids.  If i'm the only shaman on the raid, i'm quite important.  If I die the whole raid has to take a break.  If a warrior goes down cause my Turgurs didn't happen for a few extra seconds, well that's a pity, but he just has to worry bout rez effects, and the raid is safer as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So the level the statue spawns at determines if it is a quadder or not? Again, something I was not aware of. The bard thing is new to me also. Thanks for the info guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">dont bother with malosini, let a mage do it if one is there.  malo+tash+occlu are all you need, form a suicide debuff group and have a necro or mage pet tank the initial unslowed statue.  all you should need is one or two rounds to stick slow, have togors up just in case of a resist, then overwrite with turgur.  easy as pie :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Never heard this bit about level of statue et al.<br />
<br />
In my Statue experiences, he's been level 59, and he only 'quads' if he is duel-wielding Swiftblades of Zek. <br />
<br />
I've run into Statues who were harder to slow, but I've never seen this attributed to level or how often he attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">He can quad if holding hammers/combination as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He was duel weilding the blades on this attempt.  I have been in on the kill for him several times and that was the first time he quaded on us with me there, it made one hell of a difference. I rarely actually con big mobs as they are either slowable or not.  I'm pretty sure there was a ranger in the group/guild that made a comment regarding lvl, but I will make an effort to con the bugger next time we hit him are try to confirm the lvl issue.  For whatever reason the one that quadded absolutely refused to slow for us and I have always landed slows in that past on him at lvl 60.  If I've inserted confustion regarding him coming in at different lvls, I apologize and will try to con over the next few kills to determine if he truly does vary or if is a matter of the weaponery he is holding.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I checked with allakhazam and it says the rascal is lvl 59 only. So apparently I'm in error regarding the lvl issue. Strange how this one decided to not allow slows and he was  a quadder.<br />
<br />
/looks stupid and goes away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Malo + Tish + Occ is your basic debuffs, and honestly it's all you need for the Statue, although sometimes it may be difficult to slow him.<br />
<br />
Tish orb, tish stick, and malosini are sort of extras. If you got mages, have them chain cast malosini, or you can have a shaman alternate between malosini and slows while the rest chain slow.<br />
<br />
Statue's always been strange to us. Sometimes a level 57 shaman can get him slowed on the first try right after Malo, Occ, and Tish, while 60s bounce turgur left and right. Other times we can have 3 60 shamans and 4 60 enchanters all bounce slow 3+ times each (if you live that long) after malo, occ, tish, malosini, orb, and stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Statue seems really goofy with resists.  Last statue we killed, it was slowed on first or second cast with just tash/malo/occ. Last night we had tash, occ, malo, malosini, and tish stick on... 5 resists later I'm dead, lvl 60 shaman had about 4 resists and dead, level 60 enchanter finally slowed on 3rd or 4th cast but due to length of fight needed to reslow and got nothing but resists.<br />
<br />
Net result... About 20 resists between a lvl 60 ENC, lvl 60 SHM, and lvl 59 SHM with 1 slow landing.<br />
<br />
Oh... lvl 56 BST landed his 30% slow on statue once early in the fight!  GO Beastlords! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We had 5 shaman chain casting Turgur for the first two to three minutes.  This was with the disease counter agro bug that was recently fixed.<br />
<br />
We definitely landed Malo, and Tash was on, but we are pretty sure Occlusion never landed.  The bard tossing it was 57 or 58 (not 60).<br />
<br />
Out of roughly 30-40 casts, one landed - and it happened to be me.  Could have been any one of us in reality, it was just my turn to roll decent.</div></div><hr />
