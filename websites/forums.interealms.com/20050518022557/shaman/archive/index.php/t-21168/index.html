<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So im going to borrow this time flagged (although not geared) paladin with 150ish AA's and about 5200hps.<br />
<br />
Altough this question should probably be posed to a Paladin forum, but im posting it here because i what im asking for is from a Shamans point of view, and I know that this forum has a lot of serious and knowing people posting.<br />
<br />
I have spent much time grouping with Paladins, so i already have a good general idea about stuff like taking aggro with stuns and saving the earth with heals/LoH etc.<br />
<br />
From a shamans point of view, how do i effectively play a paladin? Any tips, ideas or general comments?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Learn for every zone which mobs can be mezzed and which can't.  Ask your chanters or bards, pay attention to their call-outs on what's mezzed or not, etc.  Whatever you have to do.<br />
<br />
Knights are often off-tanks, and they need to know to automatically grab the non-mezzables first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you are going to want to check his AAs and see what he has.  pallies get a few activatable AAs such as a new stun, 2 hand bash, RC, and a few others.<br />
<br />
when i box my pally and shaman i drop the FoA/FoA stuns with cease or a QWoS(if i know i well need to postion a mob) and while the mob is standing there stupid and getting beaten on i malos/slow. (my pally doesn't have AAs.)<br />
<br />
don't use push stuns in XP groups unless you need to get the mob out of the wall.  remember, the mob goes the way the pally is looking when the knockback hits.<br />
<br />
i have found the only way to run a pally out of mana is to group heal a lot...group heals tend to be nice agro increasers too.<br />
<br />
good pally holds agro and tanks while keeping the mob in position for the other melee classes (imo).  if you are playing a raiding pally you will have a few more things to think about =p<br />
<br />
fyi- virtue+AoTC+focus+stam+bss are prolly the raid buffs you want, pallies don't use druid buffs because they lose HP/AC and don't really need the extra mana regen from Nine.<br />
<br />
that was my quick crash course in pallies =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From this shaman's point of view, (and my first main was a Paladin now effectivly retired) you need to go ask the paladins. Paladins of Norrath (http://p202.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath) (PoN) should be your new home for quite awhile. Consider that any time you join a group as a level 65 Paladin there are skills and reactions that everyone will just plain expect. You need to cram 65 levels of skills into your brain and muscle memory. PoN is an awesome resource. Pay attention to the stickies, use your ignore rant skill (which if you read this board should be maxed anyways), look for posts by Romidar they are usually very well thought out even if I don't always agree.<br />
<br />
My tips? DA always memed. Heal your group not yourself. Master stun agro, learn when to use DD component stuns and knockback stuns and when not to. Become friends with your chanter. Practice holding agro on multiple mobs at the same time. Don't expect to do damage and don't get excited if you do, it won't last long.<br />
<br />
There is tons of other stuff to know... think about how long it took you to learn to play your shaman effectively.<br />
<br />
But hey, It should be fun! Enjoy.</div></div><hr />
