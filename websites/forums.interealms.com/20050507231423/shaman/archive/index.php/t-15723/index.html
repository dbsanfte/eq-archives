<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am about to buy the 100kpp Drogmar.<br />
However, before I do it I want to know a few things first.<br />
Would be good to hear advice from ppl that have owned it.<br />
<br />
1. How fast is it?<br />
<br />
2. Is it the same start/stop delay as on the 9kpp Dromar?<br />
<br />
3. The ones that have owned one, have it been worth it?<br />
<br />
I spend ALOT of time on my 9kpp drogmar, if I can move around faster and easier it would be worth 100kpp to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's as fast as the 100k horse, Comparable to selo's although with the right mods a bards selos is still faster.<br />
<br />
No idea on start/stop delay.  Doesn't seem that bad to me, but it's been so long since I had a 9k mount I really can't compare.<br />
<br />
It was worth it to me, but I really don't have anything else to spend my cash on.  I have no twinks and any upgrades to my gear are nodrop raid items.  It's nice for travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had one since they came out, and it's significantly faster than sow..if I dismount while running, it's like I came to a crawl....imagine sow wearing off and suddenly you are just running...that sorta difference in speed. <br />
<br />
Start/stop times are about the same, as far as I've been able to tell, however, if you summon/unsummon a couple of times, you can normally get one that starts/stops a lil faster (known bug). <br />
<br />
As far as being worth it...I'm in the same boat as Sciek, I pretty much had nothing else to blow my money on. Well, and I take a perverse pleasure in being the first across the zone if my friends and I are going somewhere =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 100k Drogmor is very fast.  It's even faster if you strafe run with it.  I think it's worth the money just to cut down on travel time in the old world(though it sucks if you die and have to run back with sow :).  You can move sideways extremely quickly with it by strafing and then tapping the up arrow.  This makes maneuvering in a group to get out of a mobs way extremely simple.  Typically I'll turn sideways and just strafe back from the mob.  Lizards are affected by graphics lag IMMENSELY.  Start up and slow down time is entirely dependent on your framerate.  When I'm just running around, I typically turn the clip plane all the way down so that I can start quickly and stop quickly as opposed to running for quite some time with it all the way up in PoK, for instance.  Be very sure that you want the expensive lizard because if you decide to resell it back later, you're going to lose around 40k on your purchase and get back only 66k or so.  That's a lot worse than buying a 9k lizard and selling it back for 6.6k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 100k drogmor was my first ever mount. And I would never live without it again. Its fast enough that in most cases, if I need to zone, none of the mobs can even begin to keep up with it.<br />
<br />
The start/stop delay on it is one you learn to live with. If Im pulling, I go back on foot or stay as far from the mob as I possibly can. But its rarely caused any problems for me, and when it did, it was because I had not anticipated something or didnt think about what I was doing in advance.<br />
<br />
Oh, dont forget to buy Innate Metabolism 3. hehe.. you will need that. Or you will go bankrupt buying food and drink. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One other thing is that if you Torpor yourself on the fast mount, you can move backwards no problem. Torpor'd on a cheap mount you have to turn to run.<br />
<br />
I bought a 103k mount, had it for a month or so, then sold it to buy my 65 spells. Got the 9k mount back, and I am sad. It might take the same time to get to top speed as the cheap one, but since top speed is faster, you are out of danger faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the 9k one .. i don't ever use it to travel, just to regen mana in outdoor zones .. it's especially helpful in poearth .. but it seems to be at it's buggiest there also.</div></div><hr />
