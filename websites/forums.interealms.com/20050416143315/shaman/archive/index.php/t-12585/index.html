<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Soloing in PoN is possible at level 54. Although I don't think that you could call it soloing as such, as you will almost definitely need a C3/4/5 and an Aego/virtue.<br />
<br />
I have only tried the spiders so far, I'm not sure if the trees/ravens have more HP or are more magic resistant as yet.<br />
<br />
I pulled with Malise, let puppy get aggro and then slow, let puppy do as much as he can and then pull him off after rooting the mob.<br />
<br />
Letting puppy tank is not an option, as even when they're slowed puppys health will go down fast, and it just turns out to be a major mana suck trying to keep him healed. <br />
<br />
I then cast E-Bolt and leave it to stew for a bit. When root breaks, it's best to let puppy get aggro again, root and then back off. <br />
<br />
I've got a JBB, but I've found that it's a bit risky using it, as 50 percent of the time it'll break root. I usually just cast E-Bolt and let it rot while canni'ing my mana back up and letting puppy regen some of his health.<br />
<br />
It will take a while, and you'll have to weigh up the whether it's worth the amount of of time/risk involved compared to how much XP you're getting. I was getting at least 3 percent AA xp per kill. I never tried normal Xp to see how that was affected. But I'm betting it's something like 1 percent per kill or even better.<br />
<br />
It's hard, and you will die a couple of times. But if you can get the hang of it, then I think that it is worth it. As with C3 and Stoi the down time in between fights is minimal. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, by the way, reslow half way through...or keep a timer.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether what I'm saying here is a bit stupid as loads of people have soloed them at 54 before, but I do know that I've had major problems in the past soloing at all in the places (other than PoJ). And now I've found a way I'm quite pleased:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried soloing spiders and treants at 55 and it didn't work out so well.  I never died, but I could never finish a fight without zoning.  The amount of mana required makes it almost impossible, even with KEI.  I'm 56 now, but haven't tried with BoN and new root.  I've found grouping is much safer and I still get good xp.  I'll probably wait until 58 or so to solo again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done PON at 56. I dont use pet. Pull with malos, root, plague, BON, ebolt. Reroot if one of them breaks. When i've cast ebolt i canni a bit, before its time for reBON. When the first BON wears off the mob is at 75ish health. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
If you have extended range keep in mind that if the monster WOULD have fled at low hp, and you are out of its agro range but within extended range-range it will reset back up to 30ish health and come back at you again.<br />
<br />
XP is slow, 1 % pr kill, but you can't kill very fast. 2-3 % aa xp pr kill. <br />
<br />
Very few resists as i pull with malos.Haven't had one on root yet.<br />
I dont use JBB on it, as it tends to break root, as im sure you're well aware of =)I would rate the monsters spiders&lt;ravens&lt;trees in difficulty, trees being the hardest but by no means too hard.<br />
Have to redo BON 3-4 times, dependant on how eager i've been with eBolt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ya, time consuming :/<br />
can be done at 54.. I pull with slow ( few resists )<br />
plauge,e-bolt,venom and poke it a min.. root and sit back once it's down to 2 bubs or so I step in mele and refresh dots, toss a couple ice strikes (no dog he just dies too fast anyhow ) yes kei and aego definitally speed up the process, but, I don't see how it's &quot;less&quot; of a solo when you have outside buffs.. you still killed it on yer own :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo'd a Raven in PoN at lvl 53.  Finished fight with 50% mana and 100% hp.  Wasnt a hard fight, just long.  Don't have epic, didnt use JBB, only used slow - root - plague - Eblot and my drogmor.  Fight alone took about 10mins.  Made 2% reg. exp off the kill too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I Tried PoN.. didn't like it.  I'd rather just head to PoD and kill Goo's.<br />
<br />
the fights seem alot faster and much easier, some are still long fights. TheXP always seemed better then pon.<br />
<br />
I basicly try to avoid PoN unless i'm doing Banshee's, Hobgoblins or WW's.<br />
the tree's spiders and ravens by ZI/O suck for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does anyone know of any decent guides for PoD?  I should be dinging 56 this weekend and I was looking to maybe move up to PoP (Haven't really fought in PoP yet).  About 95% of the time I am soloing, so if I wouldn't be able to solo in PoD...then never mind.  But if one of you think it is possible, do you know of any guides to the zone?  Like areas to pull to, areas to avoid, etc.  Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

where i try to hunt - follow the wall ( on your LEFT ) till you get to aprox<br />
-600 by -900 : there should be a small ledge near there, i make a pet, hand him 2 weapons for duel,  buff him up, get to full health then pull a bile/goo with slow run back to pet and root, cripple, epic, dot/pet<br />
and keep the damn thing rooted. they hit for 200plus.<br />
<br />
Avoid anything red.. and remember disease = don't work, from the resists i got from plague, makes sense, Plane of Disease.<br />
<br />
this seems like a good place, just be careful of adds... makes life problematic.  doable   but harder of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say that its impractical for a lvl 55-58 lvl shaman to solo in PoD, as they resist more than PoN does. And the xp is slow enough already soloing in PoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's impractical at lvl 52 to solo pod, I know because i was solo'ing at 52 and left because it took too much mana.  but i had too many resists in PoN at the same level.  at 56 i have VERY LITTLE resists in PoD, and find it much easier to solo than PoN.  besides the xp is MUCH better in PoD than PoN.<br />
<br />
doing the Biles/Goo's in PoD i'm getting 1% a kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find aggro kiting pretty effective in pod or pon.  Give dog a few weapons, pull with malo run out of range then slow.<br />
<br />
I usually tank em while i get plague and e-bolt on, then run around till they wear off while dogdog chew's em a new one :)  <br />
<br />
For this i turn pet's taunt off, and need a kei so that you can regen enough mana for the next set of dots while running in circles around the mob hehe.  im 53 and i started doing this at 51.  It's pretty good xp if you cant get a group or whatever.</div></div><hr />
