A minor upgrade to your equipment would be a spider fur cloak, which go for about 500 plat on Fennin.  And then a spider fur belt to replace straw spun, which usually goes for the same amount as the cloak on most servers.<br />
<br />
Another good, cheap upgrade is crested spaulders (11AC, 6 Sta opposed to 6AC, 3 Str and ?4? SvM).  You could camp the Avenging Caitiff in Mistmoore yourself, tho' he's kind of infrequent and doesn't always drop the spaulders, or you could buy them for about 300 to 500 plat.<br />
<br />
A good alternative to the ivy helm is the ry'gorr chain coif at 13AC 3 Str 3SvM 15 Mana.  I guess this goes for about 300 to 500 too.<br />
<br />
If you've got quite a few thousand plat to spend, you could replace most of your ivy with sebilite scale, which has better AC and mostly better stat adds.  Certainly better resists, as well, which will come in handy when swapping that diamond ring back in during raids.</div></div><hr />

I think Elured is very correct, with the exception of the above. AC/HP rings are so much better than STR/DEX, that there is really no comparison. Get the AC/HP rings.</div></div><hr />
