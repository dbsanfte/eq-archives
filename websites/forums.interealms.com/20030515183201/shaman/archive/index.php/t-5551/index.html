<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mind sharing some more info about this.  How tough are the mobs that come during the cycle?  Are they tougher than shrooms?  How many per round?  How do you start the cycle?  <br />
Or maybe point me to a site with more info about it?<br />
<br />
I've heard it called the booze game I think so I imagine it involves giving booze to one of the npcs in FG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mobs aren't all that hard.  The problem is that unless you have a chanter or are killing very fast  you're gonna get overrun sooner or later. <br />
<br />
I tried doing a small bottle with a 60pal, 60 monk and myself a 60 shaman after our chanter left and had to quit after about 15 minutes because we were getting overrun.  <br />
<br />
To do it you have to buy Gragrot or whatever its called from the Tarmok merchant near the human camp in FG.  The larger bottle you buy the faster mobs will be summoned.  Then you take it to one of the 3 callers in the 2nd tarmok camp.<br />
<br />
Pretty fun little event.  I wouldn't try it with out a chanter though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just hand in the bottle, follow the Caller.<br />
<br />
The caller's script is slow so your not about to miss anything he says etc.<br />
<br />
Just one tip - if you accidently hit the caller with an AE then he can be memory blurred to clear agro - or just get the offending player to camp out.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to add much more because I want you to have fun rather than have the encounter spoilt.<br />
<br />
Yes, you will need crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Crowd control... and go heavy on the melee... Mobs need to die quickly, and after a few waves, the nukers tend not to be able to regen manna fast enough to keep up with the spawns (at least on the higher level cycles).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A chanter is pretty much essential to this encounter, not just for mana regen, but the fact that you can get unlucky and have 3 healers spawn.<br />
<br />
Heavy melee isn't really needed. Just good crowd control and a seperate slowing class. Last time we did it, fastest cycle, we managed with an enchanter(only 57), wizard(54), rogue(55), bard(60), cleric(60) and shaman(58, me). Far from ideal, but it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We did this with a 55-60 group, Monk, Bard, Enchanter, Mage, Necro and Shaman. I can't remember but I think the mage may have been the only level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IF you get nice damage output, you can hand the quest giver more then 1 bottle of booze at a time and get double calling going. Much funner if you can keep up. <br />
BTW ditch the enchanter and bring a bard, more dps and no mana restraints.</div></div><hr />
