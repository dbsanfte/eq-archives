<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm in Dulak's harbor, sitting on the deck of the Stormwave clearing it out.  Things are going ok, no problems.<br />
<br />
So I run over to grab the next mob, and poof my pet is gone.<br />
 :confused: <br />
Not a huge deal, its happened before.  So I root my mob and summon another pet.  We kill that one fine.  I have pet guard and I go pull the next pirate.  He hits me a few times, and dogdog should some a running.  Poof pet is gone.<br />
 :( <br />
So I root this mob again, and summon yet another pet.  He pops up, and right away I tell him to attack.  POOF he's gone again.<br />
 :mad: <br />
Now I'm just raging pissed.  I gate and fire off an irate bug report.  What the hell is the deal here??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are certain spots where it does this.  When you notice this happen, just move to a new spot, and normally doesn't have to be that far away.  This should take care of your problem.  I have had this happen with pirates as well, so not always bad :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's awful in Kaesora near the library.  Some kind of glitch in the zone that eats the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have had problems like this in many different zones, its very annoying and I think they need to redo pet pathing in general, this is insane. One of the problems I have seen countless times is when I pull I leave my pet sitting at the pull spot, and come back and /pet attack to the target then when finished park the pet again. Then sometimes my pet with either ignore my /pet sit commmand and run off in a random direction and I have to chase him hitting the /pet follow button or once I sit him down he will get back up and run off like above. Once even I saw my pet run to a zone line and poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've read on other boards that pathing problems will cause pets to poof.   I've experienced it mostly in Kaesora.  Everyone I know who has a pet just doesn't bother casting it in Kaesora (except maybe in xalgoz's area).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Something I've noticed is pets will often have a hard time with pathing that requires a Z axis. Pathing is bad in Shadeweavers inside the tunnels and Paladul Caverns.<br />
<br />
Is the pet still listed on your pet window, or does it totally poof? Do pets show up on tracking? (Never played a ranger, so I don't know). If they do, it may be interesting to try tracking it to see where it went...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It may be the Z-axis problem. I've had pets that remained in the window, but the poor things were lost under world. This most commonly happens to me atleast, in hilly areas. I've lost 3 pets this way in Desert area of PoS. 2 went below world, and the third one I guess fell to his death underworld.<br />
<br />
I'm slow at times, but finally realized, if I got off that hillside, Puppup stuck around longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Z-axis is definitely one of the causes of pet poofing. <br />
<br />
Cursed building in Ssra basement is a prime example. Pet rarely lasts 5mins on the upper floor. On the bottom floor there is never a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is the pet still listed on your pet window, or does it totally poof?<br />
<br />
It poofs completely with the painful yelp sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've had my pet disappear quite a bit in Kurn's Tower, without the pet splat sound.  He just poofs.  :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SeitoBevari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This happens when a pet paths outside the &quot;normal&quot; world due to bad pathing and is unable to return to the master. This will cause the pet to suicide on you. Can happen with charmed mobs also, they just disappear.<br />
<br />
As Hamman said, try a diffrent spot and hope for the best.<br />

When your pet zones to get away from you, you know you have problems :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bad pathing or entering an area that has no pathing will do it every time. And I do have to say that LoY is the King of bad pathing. I use suspend minion a lot in LoY becuse of this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have never come across the poofing pet thingee. But, a couple days ago in Dalnirs I was um, helping a monk lvl a bit and mobs that I was slow pulling to the zone were poofing like this alot....they'd get to about a bub of health left and then disappear with an explosion noise (gave no xp and no faction hit). Didn't have a puppy up so dunno if he'd react the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember this being really bad in UP at the zonein/tunnel thing from ME.  Seems to really be a problem near cliffs or walls.  Last nite had an ungodly time keeping a pet around in lower mephit caves in PoN... just seemed to fall through the earth -- sometimes poofed, sometimes would just run around somewhere in the netherworld until someone noticed he was slacking.   /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As mentioned Poofs are the result of a combination of things, Z-axis, bad pathing and NPC leaving &quot;normal game space&quot;.  A few other places I've noticed it are Upper Guk jail hall, All of Kaesora, few places in Ssra.  I've never had it happen in an outdoor zone though, hmm.<br />
<br />
I've used this sort of bug to my advantage before though also.  If in Mini-bear and pathing forces mobs to Port on top of you.  You can wedge yourself in a corner, and often when the mob ports on top of you, they'll port outside &quot;game space&quot; and poof.  No xp or faction but it is a good way to split or break camps solo.  Hard part is finding the pathing that forces the mob to port.  I use it in KC for verix room and warlord/jail breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I&#8217;ve had this happen in only one place so far and that&#8217;s KC.  I went there to get the last item I need for my Canni II spell and we sat up camp in the jail area.  My puppy was standing at my side perfectly happy until I told it to attack a mob. At which point it would poof without seeming to take a step.  All I had was an empty pet window.  After three pet poofs in a row I gave up.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve found that pathing in general really sucks in this game.  And inside area are always the worst.  I&#8217;ll tell my puppy to attack a mob directly in front of me and he runs all the way back down the tunnel we just came down and back again before doing so.  It&#8217;s a major pain, but I&#8217;ve learned to live with it as long as he doesn&#8217;t bring any angry friends back with him.  However, self-destructing with every order is not acceptable.  Thankfully I haven&#8217;t had this problem anywhere that I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time at.</div></div><hr />

Turn off you Badword filter ( /Filter Badword should get confermation when done correctly )to keep bad links form killing you.  With the last patch it was turned on in it automaticly.  Found that fix at EQtraders and have now been able to leave my merchant up all night with no Server select screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nope still happens, i undid that filter the day they turned it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am a bit late it seeing this thread, but the Dulak / Stormwave happens almost anywhere on that boat. The way we got around it (duoing with two pet classes) was to set up camp on the prow of the ship (the pointy end). Guard the pets, and root the mobs. If the pets get past the entrace to the hold (looks like rocks sticking up in the middle of the deck) they are pretty likely to poof.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've done a bit more messing around with it, and came to the conclusion that it is not a pathing problem at all.<br />
<br />
Seems like anytime myself or my pet is on the main part of the ship and he attacks, he poofs.  As listed above, if you're in the pointy front of the ship, it doesn't happen, and also it doesn't happen if you're up on the elevated back part of the ship.<br />
<br />
I've just taken to parking dogdog on the dock and pulling to there.  Its a bit slower, and mobs on the dock tend to pop at bad times every now and again, but its better than constantly losing a pet.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI for Brothers that are hunting in Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There is a Shaman pet poofing spot in Acrylia Caverns too. Doesnt effect friend's Necro pet everytime my pet gets near the tunnel, he disappears. Its a pain in the neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kierok2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It is odd that it is just the Shaman pet in kasorea that goes poof though. I was playing my Mage there with my earth pet and running around the library and had no problems at all but everytime my Shaman got a pet it would poof in a few minutes of moving around. It has to have something to do with his size because the pets must have been taking the exact same paths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i thought it was a old world problem , but it happened in PoTactics to me last night. I buffed up puppy and self and go to pull a diaku whatever that conned blue to see if i could solo it and poof , pet is gone. Very irratating :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So I'm in Dulak's harbor, sitting on the deck of the Stormwave clearing it out.  ....<br />
<br />
<br />
This happened to me on the Stormwave as well. I tried it four different times in four different locations. I finally fired off the /bug. <br />
<br />
However, when I was on any other ship in Dulak, I had absolutely no problems bringing up a pet and actually KEEPING it.<br />
<br />
I think they screwed up the pathing on Stormwave for certain pets that require that Z-axis. I've seen mages on Stormwave with their pets without any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've had it happen in US in velks, HK, seb, pretty much everywhere... Its really annoying to lose about 1500 mana and 2 weapons.  SOE doesn't give a crap though, fixing this isn't profitable :(<br />
<br />
And I do have to say that LoY is the King of bad pathing<br />
2nd floor PoH, Katta, etc.. *EQ itself* is the king of bad pathing, not any one zonel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">you guys ever been to PoMischief? god, the second my pet touches a wall. poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">*nod*<br />
<br />
What Amberfox said.  The boats are a pain in this.  If your pet moves accross the left or right, it'll poof EVERY time, unless you're on an incline.  if the pet moves from front to back of the boat, or vise versa, it's got a shot at surviving it, but still dicey.  I too have had the best luck pulling to the prow of the ship, the inclines on the ship are far more stable, just don't let things get to the level part of the boat when they start to run, it'll kill Fido.  And yeah, it's super annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Happened to me here too.  Was in runnyeye due to sheer boredom and looking for some quick cash.  Summoned pet, went around corner and poof pet was gon :(</div></div><hr />
