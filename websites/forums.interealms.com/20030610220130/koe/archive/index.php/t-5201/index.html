<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry about last night getting you killed Hoarmurath :(.  I made an all too easily first time error in Chardok.....The IN is not the Exit.  I also caused another person by the zone in to die after we had too much for us to handle.  I will definately be back there soon.  The xp was very nice and it seems to be a continuous pull place.  I did get that mallet which has the same damage as a six note blade but is only faster.  So now on raids I can really pack in the dmg with melee as well as singing.  I wish I would have met up with you guys sooner.  Anyways I'll be in Kunark this week for sure trying to make 50.  I'll be in either Burning Woods, Dreadlands, or Emerald Jungle.</div></div><hr />
