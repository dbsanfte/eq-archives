<br />
Only one I was able to get a screenshot was the new Ranger Epic:<br />

Man, I can't believe they made the ranger epic available to all classes.  That blows.  I hope they make it up to them by giving them Call of the Wild, at least that way they can rez themselves.  ;)  Oh, and since it's not lore, they can duel wield them.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bleh! That's just the Ranger 1.5. The Ranger 2.0 has far, far better stats and use: Body Bag (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=17021).<br />
<br />
PS. Yes, that's a real in-game item.<br />
PPS. I used to have a Ranger, I'm entitled to make Ranger jokes! :p<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oogga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ranger jokes aside...I can't say I like the way that the dev team is handling spell recast timers these days.  Seems like they took a perfectly simple mechanic and have started to un-necessarily complicate it.<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind the linked spell recast timers recently introduced is pathetic - no player would request it (apart from maybe jealous people begging for other classes to be nerfed), and spells have inherent delay in their individual recast times and cast times (that was the reasoning behind this, to introduce the concept of &quot;spell delay&quot;).  IF IT ISN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT.<br />
<br />
The recast time on that epic is a joke, in my opinion.  The effect is currently bugged at 0 range, uncastable on other mobs, so no way of knowing how good it is yet.  The stats are perfect for the time invested in the quest though.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp<br />
<br />

<br />
p.s: back to the Ranger jokes (I have a Ranger main ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;What did one Ranger say to the other Ranger?&quot;<br />
&quot;You're bound here, too?!?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think item recast timers are a good idea, it allows the developers to add more powerful effects to items.  <br />
<br />
If memory servers me correctly, the sham epic 1.5 is a group click HoT.  There's no way this could exist and be 400ish hps / tick w/o a recast timer.  If it had no timer, then it would always be on the group, and this would trivialize quite a bit, or really screw the game up, where with the timer, it's fine to add more powerful effects.  That is unless you really want to have our epic 1.5 to be the equlivent of the post nerf fungi staff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i also like the recast timer idea.. i just wish they hadnt put it on every single item, or had implemented it better.. like you have the choice between having an epic 2.0 with a HoT and recast timer, or an epic 2.0 with nihil and no recast</div></div><hr />
