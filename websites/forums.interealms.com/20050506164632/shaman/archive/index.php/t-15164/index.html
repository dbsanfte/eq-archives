<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was recently awarded the Black Collar of Boundless Might after a RZ kill and it has the focus Conservation of Mithaniel.<br />
<br />
I know this is a 15% mana saving on all beneficial spells except of % and complete heals. Does this also stack with MP focuses? I assume SCM and this stacks but please correct me if I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Much thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stacks with SCM, doesn't stack with other Foci(Mana Preservation IV for instance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Giac is correct. AA's and a focus effect with stack. For focus effects you just get the best of any type of focus effect. For example for dots I get my bracer for mana pres and not my earring. But for everything else I get my earring for mana pres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Focus item with same type never stack,<br />
<br />
AA stack with everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok thanks guys.<br />
<br />
So Conservation of Mithaniel is the same as MP focus then except it's for beneficial spells only I guess. Just wasn't sure. Is there an MP item that saves 20%?</div></div><hr />

If you look threw the list you can see that there are a variety of Mana pres type items ranging up to 40% but with a variety of differing limitations.<br />
<br />
Sanguine Preservation- is 40% mana pres but it's for self buffs only which makes it fairly useless for most.<br />
<br />
Pernicious Focus is 30% mana pres on dots which is probably the best actually useful focus.<br />
<br />
At 25% you see a variety of standard affliction  and pet summoning mana pres items, the single nuke focus effects for elemental gloves.<br />
<br />
At 20% you finnally start seeing some more general mana pres items.<br />
<br />
Conservation of Xegony is the general 20% mana pres focus effect but it hasn't been found on any item in game that I know of.<br />
Preservation of Solusek is detrimental and <br />
Preservation of Mithaniel is benificial 20% mana pres<br />
Both focus effects have been found on items in PoTime.<br />
There are also a couple VT focus effects and all the ornate single spell versions also at 20%.<br />
<br />
Past that I'll leave it up to you to look at the other ones.<br />
<br />
PS your necklace is 15% mana pres. Standard MP4 items are just 10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok much thanks Taradar.<br />
<br />
I hardly go to Lucy's cause my office comp doesn't like that site lol Same with magelo /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Conservation of Xegony focus can only be found on the necklace off Quarm in the Plane of Time. I am sure there's at least anothr item he will drop with the same focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get some ornate boots.  Easy enuf to get if you're flagged for sol ro, and they have ManaPresIV and so-so stats.</div></div><hr />
