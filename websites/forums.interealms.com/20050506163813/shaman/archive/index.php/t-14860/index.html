<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a SK on the same account as my shaman ( 65 with all the toys), one day im thinking i will move him to another account and 2 box them when im bored, but right now thats not the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question is if anyone has ideas on what i can camp to upgrade my SK, i know alot of people here 2 box SK's so im hoping to kill a lil time in my search with a lil help from people that have been there.<br />
<br />
This is his current gear.<br />

As you can see almost anything is a upgrade, he is in piss poor shape, but 46 levels of lfg and no takers forces you to KEI it. Anyway, any help would be great cause he is finaly getting close to do things with my guild and i would like to play him much more often, plus i would hate to get a PoD  group or whatever and have a SK like this be my tank lol. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogre or Human Rallos Cultural.. on my server ogre is a bit cheaper<br />
<br />
reaver is not too bad (40 / 40) and cheap<br />
<br />
solstice earring<br />
<br />
6/65's for rings <br />
<br />
spider fur belt<br />
<br />
black bear hide cloak ?(something like that)<br />
<br />
goranga idol, or pottyer made rallos idol (9ac 20hp some stats)<br />
<br />
ry'gorr collar is ok (9ac some sta) <br />
<br />
all that should be findable in bazaar with ease<br />
<br />
if you really want to camp items instead of spend plat on them..<br />
<br />
I guess you could get some crusty armor.. don't think there is that much good armor out there that's dropable in sets..<br />
or some rubicite stuff from cazic with friends I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea i still got a few thing for shaman to go, like my 65 DoT so i cant drop plat yet. It doesnt matter if anythign is no drop, i can run SK there and log out and kill with shaman then log and loot with SK, well thats the idea i had in mind.<br />
<br />
Good ideas up there though, frankly there was so much to upgrade was a lil lost on where to start i guess. Thnx bud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umbral Planes plate drops would be good - Moktor stuff, and Raldukan if you can do it. Most is nodrop, though the Raldukan helm isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well if you are stuck soloing.. try to get a ikky bp.. dunno where it drops, but with a 65 shaman it would definitely cut down on your downtime.  black bear cloak drops in kael i believe..same as the pally one. 75hp is great for back piece. belt of great turtle of lodi maybe? cougar claw earrings for ears if you can't get earring of the solstice etc, magma scarred boots in nadox off fire elementals.. rare drop though.  Sorry play on good team on SZ..so haven't played a SK =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">naa ninth, excellant ideas. Im thinking maybe i can even do a few thrug peices, i wanna get my dragon faction back up now that my guild is past ToV, no real reason, i just think its fun to be ally to dragons ;)<br />
<br />
Checked out some of the UP gear, looks nice indeed, the BP is not to shabby, i just hope the gear isnt ultra rare, i think im going to try it today, i been wanting a dathor hammer too anyway so i can camp there for both, just camp my ranger there adn check once in a while.<br />
<br />
cool, got some direction to go now, thnx for the ideas</div></div><hr />

<br />
aren't to bad, 7str/dex and 40 hps<br />
maybe also get a spider fur/lodi belt and get schw for haste, <br />
dusty sortiz boots, <br />
<br />
remember shared banks are your friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">go to velks with a friend or 2 and get some schw, and blood runed greaves,and maybe a sword of pain. maidens eye for some of the great nodrop war useable items there.I know you dont wanna spend plat, but you can find the black bear pelt cloak in bazaar for 1kish on my server, or possibly  underbulks for the 35 ac pally/sk only back/sec item. solstice quest for ear or if you know a chanter friend, maybe they can make you some 35hp ears for cheap. At lvl 65 you may be able to solo lodi for his belt and boots (boots always have been underrated) with your shammy. hope this helps !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At his level, go to icewell and kill dorfs right at the zoneline.  It's decent exp and you can pick up royal frosted velium.  It's definitely an upgrade for your sk over what he's wearing atm.  Then when he's a little higher you can start killing in Umbral plains like someone suggested or else start killing in Kael at the bank area for possible quest armor drops.  Another option is killing the Sentient Suits in wakening lands for the Sentient armor since he's a troll and could use the extra int.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can always park the SK in UP and kill w/ your shaman there then log in the SK to loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well if you ranger has max tracking he should be able to see most of the zone.  The Shak Warlord is on the east side with the druid campers for Elysian, whereas the moktors with Raldukan are on the west side near the zone in tunnel.  The Raldukan BP is indeed very nice, but have never seen it... helm every time I've killed him.  Camped the moktors for the armor for my SK, but no drops and eventually got bored... stuff isn't that good to be so rare.  For a BP gonna shoot for the Acrylic Plate one that drops in Acrylia Caverns.  It's not bad - AC 38 and decent +HP... better than the Large Acrylia Plate my ogre SK is wearing.<br />
<br />
Aislyth<br />
Prophet of Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ogre cultural RZ stuff is perfect for you -- excellent AC, lots of +HP and some +mana and +sv all on all the pieces.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Ogre SKs are about the only folks Ogre cultural is best for, but hey, find an Ogre smith, he'd probably jump at the chance to outfit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you got a couple friends who are willing...one of the fastest ways to get plate armor is the Ice House Cycle in Kael.  Usually will get 1+ drops a cycle and with a good group of high level people you can fly thru cycles quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BTW my guild used to do icehouse alot, I think our record is 9 cycles without a drop... so that kinda sucks..and we got mostly bracers.. anyway<br />
<br />
crystal chitin might not be too bad either.. doesn't that drop in velks as wella s SCHW?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
how many is a couple  3 or 4, me and some DPS ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used to 2box a lot in UP and sometimes in guild groups.  I saw Umbral stuff drop all the time.  I got so tired of seeing Umbral stuff rot while nothing decent dropped for my ranger or shaman, that I parked first a cleric then a warrior in the zone to pick up the drops.  Both were soon outfitted in full umbral with a couple of raldukan pieces thrown in for the bargain as well.<br />
<br />
No, it's not great stuff, but easy to get.</div></div><hr />
