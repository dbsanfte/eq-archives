<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if any of you are experiencing lag when you attempt to cast a spell?<br />
<br />
Basically what happens is when you press a key or click on the spell icon they grey out but do not actually cast for about 15 to 20 seconds. The numbers on the right of the lag meter jumps up to 5k+ and stays that way for 15 to 20 seconds or so and eventually drops back down, then the spell begins to cast.<br />
<br />
I started having problems with this around the time the new UI released and it hasn't gotten any better. It really hurts when you go to slow a mob or attempt to heal someone and this happens... by the time the spell actually start casting the mob is almost dead or the person I attempted to heal is dead.<br />
<br />
If any of you are having this problem, please post on this thread at the EQ's Technical Help board (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/033446.html) . Lots of people seem to be having problems with this but all the posts are scattered around. This post is attempting to compile as much data as possible about people who are having issuies. Hopefully, if enough people post VI/Sony will look into the problem a little further.<br />
