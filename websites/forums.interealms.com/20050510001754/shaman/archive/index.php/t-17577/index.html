<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sure everyone knows we are the weakest of all the true (mag,beast,necro,shaman) pet classes, but the differece is rediculous.  I finally got bored one day and loaded up a parcing program.  <br />
<br />
Pet buffs = focus, diaku, quickening, slw, ferine avatar, 2 fs weapons<br />
 damage  = 32-36 dps<br />
<br />
 Every other true pet class parces for at least twice that, not to mention additional procs. <br />
  Now i know we have spells (tugurs, 1300+ heal, etc.) that some of the other pet classes would kill over.  But i have gotten to the point of not even careing anymore if i cast a pet for exp grouping or ldon.  I can easilly out damage my pet just from meleeing.  <br />
  Our pet seems to miss about 75% of the time.  Even with avatar it misses the same, it just hits for full more often when it does hit.  And with the hastle of trying to keep the pet doing what you want it to do all the time,  Its almost not even worth makeing a pet anymore, especially when mobs get killed in less then 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Im just wondering how many of you still take your pet seriously?  In other words, how many of you still think your pet plays a big role when it comes to killing mobs in an exp group or ldon?  And if you have multiple roles in a group (healer, puller, and slower) do you still play around with a pet ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pet is a one time cast.  You make the pet and all you have to do is tell it to attack.  It is dps added to your melee and spellcasting.  Free damage (or nearly so) if you will.   <br />
<br />
Does it play a huge role in a group situation? No.  But every bit helps.  All you have to do is hit pet attack for each mob.  Not really all that hard for relatively free damage. <br />
<br />
It would not be a priority over ensuring someone gets healed or the mob gets slowed. But in the time after malo/malos is refreshing and before you can cast slow it is not that hard to hit pet attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once it's cast, it serves as a constant DoT. It was never meant to tank for us, and honestly I don't think they ever figured we'd be able to use him nearly as well as we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not using pet in ldon missions is just stupid. Avg mission length is about 1h or so for hard missions and if the pet does 36dps over that hour you get 129600 damage for the cost of 650 mana, which is pretty damn mana efficent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pretty much always have a pet up these days while I am grouped.<br />
<br />
The pet is ~30 dps in alpha mode as you noted, and after you summon it, it's free. It takes a bit of effort to manage it, I suppose. It's certainly not the most important contribution I make to a group in terms of pure DPS, but it helps a little. I mean, how much damage do you normally do a mob in a fast-killing group? If you have the pet on a mob for 30 sec, that's ~900 damage. Odds are you might get one or two rains off on the mob before it dies in that circumstance, so that's 1950 or 3900 damage if all waves land (barring crits). In the first case, the pet increases your total damage to the mob by ~46%, in the second case by ~23%.<br />
<br />
There are other uses for pets - your pet can buy a few seconds by suicide tanking a mob on a bad pull. I know he won't last long against elemental mobs or high-risk LDoN mobs, but seconds count sometimes. If you have Pet Discipline, there are some pretty neat pulling tricks you can try as well.<br />
<br />
I do wish that our pets would dual wield without weapons, though. It's a nuisance having to lug around a bunch of FS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman pet can be an excellent defensive tool. Whether its suicide pulling, having him shield you or having him buy some time for you with enrage, our pet is consistantly able to pull off some tricks that have saved my bacon more than any mage or beastlord that I've ever seen</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always summon a pet when doing adventures. The extra DPS is good to have. I usually just ask the main looter to throw any dropped weapons they pick up on my pet so he'll dual wield. If something happens and he dies, though, I usually don't bother summoning another one. In normal XP groups, I'll summon my pet if I have extra mana - which is almost always if I'm outdoors and on my horse. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was never meant to tank for us<br />
<br />
That may be true, but my pet tanks all the time for me in Inner Acrylia and Drooga.  His DPS may suck, but its great for the mana cost, and I'd much rather have the mobs beating on him than me, since its a lot easier to cast when you aren't constantly being interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love true spirit, can't see where having a more powerful pet would be balanced.  I've read that he'll parse up to 45ish dps with a muzzle, belt, and two weapons from a magician (that's a pair of 150 dd proccers, an additional 30% item haste, and an additional 350 or so hp, for the uninitiated).  If I'm going to be using my pet for any length of time, I make a pitstop in the bazaar first for this stuff, where I can generally pick up two sets for 50-100pp, about as much as a KEI or two.  I think some people just won't be happy until they can play in god-mode.<br />
<br />
It's a nuisance having to lug around a bunch of FS<br />
Buy Chill Daggers (or camp some).  They drop off dervishes in EW and IC, and are a secondary-only dagger, only one of which is needed to activate alpha mode.  I always use magician-summoned gear if possible, but these are great to have in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why on earth would you NOT use your pet? If he did 10 DPS I would still use him. 650 mana and can last for hours. Hell 5 dps would be efficient. <br />
<br />
He does not break mes, he does not agro mobs unless he is already engaged....<br />
<br />
What is the down side to using the pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How many of you think it is worth buffing the pet up (fos, diaku, avatar)?  I can see slw,  but the extra 3 or 4 dps that you might get out of the buffs doesnt seem worth it to me.  It is nice to make a pet, give it weapons and send it on its way without worrying about always keeping it full buffed all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">650 mana (pet cost) + 600 mana (fos) + 0 mana (right click ornate BP haste) = 1250 mana<br />
Your pet does 30+ dps for as long as he's alive, and as long as you constantly have a mob in camp (which is quite possible with good pullers in ldon, or in regular xp sessions)<br />
Adventures go from 30-90 minutes in length.<br />
<br />
30 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 1800 seconds<br />
90 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 5400 seconds<br />
<br />
1800 seconds * 30 dps = 54000 damage<br />
5400 seconds * 30 dps = 162000 damage<br />
<br />
54000 damage / 1250 mana = 43.2 damage per mana efficiency<br />
162000 damage / 1250 mana = 129.6 damage per mana efficiency<br />
<br />
Our level 65 dot in comparison does 320 damage per tick * 7 ticks = 2240 damage.<br />
Burning affliction IV will increase damage output on dots by approximate 10% according to parses done.<br />
2240 * 110% = 2464 damage<br />
Affliction efficiency IV will decrease mana by 25%.<br />
535 mana cost * 75% = 401.25 mana<br />
<br />
2464 damage / 401.25 mana = 6.14 damage per mana efficiency<br />
<br />
If you can keep your pet in combat for a solid 30 minutes, and estimate a conservative 30 dps for him, your pet will be more than 7 times more mana efficient to cast than dotting things with our level 65 dot.<br />
If you can keep him in combat for the most part of a 90 minute adventure (very doable if you are doing a hard adventure or something) then the pet is approximately 21 times more mana efficient than dotting things.<br />
<br />
Explain to me again why you aren't using your best dot you have?<br />
Laziness is no excuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Who said you had to put every buff you have on it? You do what ya can when you have mana to spare. I use my doggie as haste timer. Other than that, I don't even bother with a HP buff since he's not doing the tanking. If I have mage weapons for him, I'll IoS and dex him, if regular weapons, then only haste. As others have done the math....he's most mana efficient spell we have, and takes just a little work to control well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LOL, I didnt know people still use dots.  Our fastest dot is 5 ticks (Bane).  And, at least on my server, mobs die before the last tick hits, even when i dot right when its enguaged(in LDON adventures).  But then the mob is after me the WHOLE time until its dead.    <br />
Its always Tears of saryrn with velium strike for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As others have said its almost no mana, and it can save your life.  I know my pet has saved my life a bunch of times when i leave him to die as i make my retreat :)<br />
<br />
I dont think my pet serves a very big role, but when you get 3 mobs coming at you and you need them to pause and beat on your pet for a second..thats when its useful.  For the rest of the time he's slowly killing the current mob.<br />
<br />
Dont even bother trying to compare our pet to any other class..at least we have better pets than enchanters...much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just my opinion here but I think the root of the complaint is a near complete misunderstanding of our class. We are SHAMAN, field priests, battle clerics, witch doctors, whatever. <br />
<br />
I am sure everyone knows we are the weakest of all the true (mag,beast,necro,shaman) pet classes, but the differece is rediculous <br />
<br />
We are not the weakest of the true pet classes because we are not a pet class, period. If we are a pet class, add in druids, chanters, rangers, SK, bards, might as well call clerics with that damn hammer too. Yeah, we get a pet, but we aren't dependant on dogdog to get the job done. We can function with or without him because he is just another tool in our arsenal. That being said, the craftsman chooses the right tool for the job. Sometimes dogdog will save your life, sometimes you just gotta leave him in the backyard. The REAL pet classes are dependant on their pets as a major part of their damage dealing capabilty and tactics, hence, their pets are better than ours. <br />
<br />
 If you think dogdog isn't worth the mana, don't cast him. Don't expect the game to try and bring our pets up to par with other pets either, at least I hope not. I saw a 61 shaman eat a 60 BL in a duel and the shaman ended 80m and full health with dogdog still there. Yes, dogdog ate the cat before the BL went down.</div></div><hr />

There's a lot more to EQ than LDoN, or whatever else is new &amp; shiny at the time.  Honestly I can't stand most of the new content I've seen in the past year or so, but maybe that's just me.  Any solo situation, and most group situations, a mana-free dot is a pretty cool thing to have, especially for a class not known for dps.  I've heard up to 45 dps (been meaning to parse but never seem to get around to it), which is half again more than the 30 you state and none too shabby.  And spend a few AA points and it doesn't require much attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Give your pet 2 weapons, and his DPS will increase significantly. Even those cheap junk weapons that drop in many LDoN dungeons is good enough. <br />
<br />
Toss some buffs on him. Be sure to include haste. I used the SLtW off my Scaled Avatar BP so its mana free. That will almost double his DPS as well. Are you keeping FA on your melee? Good. Use your pet as the FA timer, and his DPS will increase some more.<br />
<br />
Its not hard to get your pets to do lots more than 30 DPS. And it really doesnt take much mana either. And in a crunch, he can and will tank a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Not having a pet up means you are not doing all the damage you could be doing. I target my pet on every mob I slow. That way as one mob dies, he instantly jumps on the next one. Yes, you can queue up the mobs for your pet. Its rare I am in a group with an enchanter. So mezzes are not normally something I have to worry about. But when I am, I just have to wait until the MA breaks the mez, assist him, and then send in the pet.</div></div><hr />

Don't take that as personal, but that attitude is plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Just assume for a moment (besides the extreme efficiency, others pointed out), all of your 6 group members had a 30 dps tool, but all were just too lazy to cast it, because '30 dps doesn't matter'. That's right here 180 dps down the crapper.<br />

Yes kick hits for 30 damage. Yes thats not a lot of DPS. but why not do it anyways?<br />
<br />
You can sit back, cast a malo and then slow, and then sit down and meditate, or you can whip up a pet, stack Bane and Blood of Saryrn, canni back up to full mana, and contribute over 160dps sustained. It all depends on how lazy you are, and every bit counts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On hard, if I'm pulling, then I usually don't have a pet up unless the group can benefit from the dps significantly, since I don't have /pet hold at this moment. When I'm not pulling, I always have the pet up--the extra dps doesn't hurt, and it ain't that hard to click on /pet back off when mobs go enrage.<br />

The bottom line is that I summon a pet whenever I'm not feeling lazy. That's all there is to it.</div></div><hr />

Annnnnd casting SLTW on 1npc is really going to soooo drain our mana.  Just with Canni 4 (let alone 5) that comes back in like... just a few canni's.<br />

<br />
I agree with everything else you said but you need to clarify this. If you have the requisite equipment/aa to get &gt;9 min FA then you can think about keeping FA on more than 3 people but if you are managing to keep a 6min FA up on 5 melees you are probably neglecting other duties, or providing no dps/heals at all, or are a god. With all that goes on in a raid if I am ready to cast FA the moment it becomes available I am probably being lazy to begin with.<br />

FA is great, but I find it hard to keep up on more than 3 at one time without missing someone in the heat of battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pet is just too useful.  It's free extra damage, and it can save your butt if things go bad by tanking adds or holding off mobs to give you enough time to escape.<br />
<br />
And you're very wrong about a pet's ability to dish out damage and take punishment.  Give your pet mage-summoned proc weapons like Fist of Ixiblat or Blade of Kedge, a Muzzle of Mardu, and a Belt of Magi'Kot, then buff up his dex to max and give him some tanking buffs (Mortal Deftness, Diaku, IoS, Talisman of Kragg for some HP, and of course FA and haste) and send him in.  He procs like crazy, and you can take down DB mobs in a shocking amount of time if you tank them so the dog can attack from behind.  When equipped with a +500hp belt and buffed with Kragg/Focus, the pet suddenly has some HP and can last if it has to pet tank an add.  It also has enough of an HP buffer to enrage when it gets low.  I sometimes intentionally let him get down and enrage, then Q/Tnarg's him to keep him alive.  An enraged dog can splat mobs in a heartbeat, because they hit HIM much more than he hits THEM.<br />
<br />
Every day when I log in, if the guild mages aren't on, I hop over to the bazaar and load up on mage summoned goodies.  I spend maybe 75-100 plat on 4 or 5 sets of mage items (sets of kedge blades, belt, muzzle), but the return I get when my dog can smack down farm trash or tank XP mobs is more than worth the expense.<br />
<br />
Our pets are just like any tank class or pet.  It's not going to do much if you don't take the time and effort to buff and equip him.  Do that, and he's your very best friend.</div></div><hr />

Both of those situations are root and rots, and if dogdog gets within melee range of the mob, he dies about 4 seconds. Keeping him healed uses a LOT more mana than just leaving the dog out of the equation and using the mana for dots instead. I stick 5 dots on the mob (6 if I bother getting epic out lol) and wait for root to break. Reroot, redot, keep watching the mob sit there seething that he can't reach you.<br />
<br />
Sure, dogdog would add a bit of &quot;dot&quot; damage, but the cost of keeping him alive is prohibitive in that situation. In situations where he doesn't draw aggro, he's always up.<br />

Pets are fabulous right up till you start thinking about PoP solo.  I can get more buffs and extra trinkets on my dog than all my twinks combined and he still gets bowled over like a lingerie model at a sumo-wrestling contest.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The pet is a usefull companion in many different situations.  I carry usually at least 4 sets of cheap pet weaps and one set of magic weaps (usually gnoll hide lariats).<br />
<br />
1) Hard hitting group adventures: He's a speed bump.  For example the other night in Tactics we got 6 mobs in camp near the pit because one mob got rooted too close to the hall and the mobs pathed there.  Anyway, at one point I managed to get them all slowed (no bard, no chanter, no AE Taunt) and ended up with 3 on me, the pet died keeping a 4th off of me while I was slowing.  I was down to 5% health and the other mobs were peeling off their targets to come plaster me when I channelled my Tnargs to get out of low health aggro.  The extra mob my pet took would have flattened me.<br />
<br />
In speed bump mode, I don't expect my pet to do any DPS.  I haste him, add 2 rusty weaps, done.<br />
<br />
2) cash farming: DogDog has 2 stun proccing weaps on him, is hasted (SLtW), Focus, FA.  In the ikky jails in OS some fights a necro doesn't even get a single spell off (pet has bash, dual stun proc weaps and me using slam while casting in teh face).  The benefit here is although I resist almost everything, that dispelling mobs don't make me stop to rebuff.  The pet allows me to take it easy too, it isn't high stress.<br />
<br />
3) LDoN.  The pet is DPS.  The pet gets Focus, FA (FA timer), haste and 2 mage fists, muzzle.  With this loadout he procs 4-6 times a mob, helps tank large pulls.  Mostly though, we stick 3 pets on an add and then we can pretty much forget about it, it simplifies things.  Pets work well on casters to interupt heals.  The DPS isn't outstanding, but it is noticeable.<br />
<br />
I use ToA to haste.  750 mana every 54 min beats the hell out of 1000 mana (usually 4 melees) every 24 min.  That's 1500 mana and 19 Cann4 casts I don't need to worry about (I have cann5, but I use it every 3 minutes, so I'm getting any more mana back with that ... ie: I'm already maxxing the return on cann5).  Thats 3 more Tears of Saryn casts I can make which should help level off the DPS loss of not using SLtW over ToA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">One other thing I have noticed about pets. When soloing or kiting with a necro, I load him up with some bone bladed stilettos.  Now you have ghetto snare.

<br />
I always carry around a few rusty weapons to alpha pet dogdog. To put it in perspective, Dogdog fully shaman buffed and dual wielding is able to solo a slowed mob in Dulak on 1st and 2nd boats. Not to shabby and it allows me to med and keep the spawns under control. <br />

Depends on your group.<br />

3 Tears of Saryn even with no resists and 4 lands.  would be a whopping<br />
7800 Damage over the what 54 minutes?  14.4 damage per minute<br />
about .25 DPS.  <br />
<br />
10% Additional Haste on a Melee will Add more than .25 DPS by a long long margin.<br />
<br />
Looking at some of the end game unbuffed melees are talking 100 to 150 DPS with only haste item.  40%ish.  70 to 100 DPS unhasted.<br />
Your talking EACH 10% haste adding to a time level group<br />
somewhere between 7 to 10 DPS per melee.  Times four in your example.<br />

LOL! Thats about the same DPS as my pet puts out and some shaman are not even casting it. ;)<br />
<br />
I won't dispute your numbers, frankly the 28-40 DPS isn't a huge deal.  Depending on the zone, our necro charms a pet that's done over 500 DPS (tormented soul in tactics, buffed and hasted, I forget the numbers, but since we got a 65 AAed rogue and a 65 EQ/AM3 ranger and the necro, any damage I do is largely unnoticeable).  Canning 19 times broken up in 2 bouts over a course of 24 minutes when I'm already cann5 casting every 3 minutes throw off my timing and sometimes puts me at under half health when my party members regularly overpull.  While you are absolutely correct that I should be casting SLtW over ToA for max DPS, and that I should refresh in front of the buff fade, in practice it's difficult to time this with pulls.  Generally, haste never wears off with ToA, sometimes my guys have to wait on a SLtW because I'm slowing incoming mobs, dealing with adds, and mostly, I'm there to keep the necro alive (with root, slow and malosinia, not to mention heals).  In theory you're absolutely right, in practice DPS is lost if you don't own an egg timer or your SK runs OOR pulling the next victim.  Since the vast majority of time is spent in combat, ToA can be refreshed before it expires during battle. and it's done in one shot, not 4 long slow casts.  I do doubt the 3 ToS casts will equate lost DPS, but my melees are not complaining and prefer the one shot ToA because I get so damned grumpy from chasing after them trying to SLtW and they know haste will not fade unless dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">You know what's funny ? That all you efficient Shaman using pets in each and every situation are going to cast grouphaste over SLTW in most group situations, so please spare me that attitude.<br />
<br />
You see, here's the problem with that logic.<br />
<br />
You can summon dogdog BEFORE you even start fighting (twice with suspended minion). o you spend the 1300 mana (or less, depending on mana preservation and spell casting mastery) and med it back and you have 30 extra dps for the rest of the night without doing anything but hitting /pet attack.<br />
<br />
You are of course right that casting talisman over SLTW is a loss in efficiency, but you can (for example) throw out a talisman when mana is tight (lol) and redo SLTW when you have it to spare. And you can interchange between the 2 over the course of an evening.<br />
<br />
The point is, there are valid reasons to use both hastes under different circumstances, but I see no good reason to ignore pet dps under most conditions. Even if your LDoN parses are accurate, it's still 20 dps (I'm assuming unbuffed). Over an average 30 minute adventure, that's 36,000 damage for NO COST.</div></div><hr />

The fact that we have to argue between ToA and SLtW just shows how retarded the dev team was when giving us that spell.

He can offtank in some situations (tier1 zones and places like Droga), or at worst can buy me some time to land to slow.  He is an extremely mana-efficient DoT too.  He can sometimes interrupt casters.  In short, there's rarely a reason NOT to use him.<br />

Oh yeah, and I use SLTW. :p I don't even own ToA.</div></div><hr />

Pet or no pet, the choice is yours, and it all depends on the circumstance.<br />
