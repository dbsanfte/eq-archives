<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings:<br />
<br />
If you attended some of the SoE discussion sessions, can you please post a quick description of what was discussed, and the SoE position/response to various shaman and game related issues?<br />
<br />
I'm looking more for straight information rather than a reaction to that information - Just thought it would be useful to have one thread that serves as a summary of what was said at each of the sessions.<br />
<br />
I suspect that most people did not attend all sessions, so we can put together a complete picture only by stitching together multiple reports. <br />
<br />
If you attended any sessions, please report here.  To keep this thread from getting cluttered, please limit it to reporting Fanfaire discussions, formal and informal.  <br />
<br />
Just the facts Ma'am!<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
Me: All fights recently have been geting shorter and shorter, yet certain classes are extremely poor at short fights, and better at long ones..<br />
<br />
Devs: Yep<br />
<br />
Me: So will we see a mix of fight styles in future expansions ot cater to both types of classes strengths?<br />
<br />
Devs: Well, no one likes long fights, so no.<br />
<br />
Me: So will we see those classes short term power increase?<br />
<br />
Devs: But those classes are so good in long fights! It wouldnt be balanced to increase their short battle strength.<br />
<br />
Me: Ahh, thanks. I can now return to humping an ant hill for less pain.<br />
<br />
<br />
They were scoffed at when they mentioned our superiority in 15 minute fights. We challenged them to name a 15 minute fight since luclin and they just stood there, looking stupid. The devs have no clue about balanced content and havent in years. We have been at this game longer, and know more. Youd think once in a while someone would listen.</div></div><hr />

There's an easy solution to this, which I know I've enacted, as more and more people are enacting themselves. You can do this yourself too, without much work at all, and it's real simple!<br />
<br />
It's labeled &quot;End Billing&quot;. Stop paying them... easy solution.<br />
<br />
Don't want to leave friends? They're called e-mail and instant messengers... and to think, up until recently, I was on the &quot;Don't want to leave friends&quot; boat... until all of them were too busy raiding to give me the time of day anymore, so I just said &quot;Well, since the raiding crowd will always be exponentially better than the non-raiding crowd, and I can't get the time of day anymore, nor do I have a will to login, nor do the devs appear to have a clue anymore, I'm not paying them anymore and going to save my money&quot;<br />
<br />
That simple.</div></div><hr />

Or I could work/jockey to improve something I enjoy and care about. Shaman imbalance doesnt totally ruin the game for me or my friends. I dont like some scenes in some movies, but I dont just leave in the middle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Others:  I understand that there is another thread discussing some of what was said at the Fanfaire.  I began this thread because:<br />
<br />
1.  Bloogbloog opens the other thread by explaining that he did not get to attend all sessions, so we need reports on other sessions;<br />
2.  While others are dropping quickee reports into response in the thread, they are easy to miss as they occur in the midst of a full discussion of what was said; and<br />
3.  Multiple views of the discussion are good, as it will increase the number of comments that are remembered and reported.<br />
<br />
Was hoping to make this thread a quickee reference guide - please do not respond to the content of fanfaire reports here, as it has the potential to make the thread unduly long.<br />
<br />
If you attended any of the Fanfaire Sessions, or had an informal discussion with a developer, please do report here.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a quickee reference on what has been reported so far in the other thread:<br />
 _____________________________________________________<br />
Bloogbloog starts by describing:<br />
Just to give a little update on fanfaire during the the discussion for spells and aa's.<br />
<br />
Was quite intresting.. group avatar is a definte no go. Stat buffs are being looked into, mainly raising cap. Shaman healing is pretty much where they want it to be.<br />
<br />
Some things I thought were funny, that other classes brought up. Clerics and paladins wanting invis. SK's wanting rez...Chanters complaining on a lot of stuff from focus overwriting shield of maelin to amount of spell gems they have. and rogues wanting more dps and utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways round 2 for the spells and aa's is tommorow...so we'll see what else comes up and what they have answers too. It was kinda interesting to hear their responce to a lot of the questions being asked.<br />
<br />
I was gonna ask a few questions but they ended the session before i had a chance...hopefully I'll get a go tommorow..<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UPDATE from APR 3rd discussions...<br />
<br />
Well I missed round 2 of the spells and aa's session cause I was too freakin drunk last night to remember how I got home, so I didnt know where my car was. I did manage to corner a few shamans and asked what was mentioned for us....<br />
<br />
Seems a group version of Q or torpor was asked about and that was said that was gonna be a no go.<br />
<br />
Slow was asked about too and Ryan Barker (Ryltan) said that shamans still have the best slow and that 5% makes a huge difference in amount of DPS. Dont think he was aware that almost everything mitigates slow...<br />
<br />
Talisman of alacrity may be increased to 60% to match SLTW. As all other grp buffs of a single target arent usually less than the original spell. I honestly dont give a crap about this one..<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Flabbo reports a bit later in the thread:<br />
<br />
I was at the FF and got to ask a few questions. They sauid they would look into a gruop FA, or a FA aa skill, but I wont hold my breath.<br />
<br />
As for healing, I brought up the absurdity of the 47/100 shaman/cleric healing ratio. I asked if we could get this ratio looked into, as fixed % increases arent healthy to the game. I then asked about upping our dots to be the same as our original ratios. Ice comet 1120/400 (2.8 dpm), E Bolt 1132/320 (3.54 dpm). Curent Strike of Solusek 2740/640 (4.28dp), Blood of Saryrn 2240/535 (4.18 dpm). SOOOOO based off of % increases, our mana efficiency on Blood of Saryrn should be about 5.41, and the damage should be 2770 with a mana cost of about 512. I wont even go into mana regen % increases.  <br />
<br />
Following this up, I addressed the shaman nerf through content, and how we suck at short fights. He pointed out no one likes long fights anymore, so I countered by asking when all our dots were going to be changed to be like bane or shorter. I also brought up how much weaker a 20% increase on a dot or heal over time was vs a direct blast nuke or heal, considering the latter can be chain cast for a much greater impact (especially in a raid environment). The devs then went on to say how great slow was, and how it scaled vs mob dps, and other bull****. He looked pretty stupid when it was noted that direct heals prevent more damage than slow does on short fights. Overall, the design team came off as having their heads up their asses on how the game breaks apart for the slow moving classes at high levels, and admitted we lost a popularity contest (speed kills vs efficient ones), but has no plans to rectify it. So theres something to put a little piss in your Monday morning Cheerios.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I came up ahead on gambling and got sufficiently tore up, so the weekend wasnt a total waste. Just reinforces what we all knew. Level your berserker, and wait for their class defining aa's to make them better at everything than everyone. Unless WoW comes out first.<br />
<br />

Valsuvius Reports:<br />
<br />
I missed the first 20 min of the second day and all of the first day AA/spell discussion, so the only shaman question that I heard was the part asking if we were being looked at for mgb heals and it was said &quot;No&quot;. I was the one that spoke to the dev about this during beta and posted that results on it beforehand. It was never said that we weren't getting a group heal, just that we weren't getting a mgb-able one. <br />
<br />
Really wish that I would have caught the first day's questions. I wanted to ask a few questions about dot agro and especially crit dot agro, as well as possible shaman buffs like the avoidance and dmg mitigation possibilies, but we ran out of time.<br />
<br />

Darkpaw Reported:<br />
<br />
I found the live team panel to be a bunch of clueless, arogant bastards (we're all right and theres no problems so shut up seemed to be their answer to everything).<br />
<br />
Heres some other information:<br />
<br />
From the new graphics engine forum:<br />
There are no current plans to redo any graphics in the old world, player models, or animations. Currently any new graphics will only be found in new expansions.<br />
<br />
Supposedly high end GoD content can be done without elemental + gear (LMAO)<br />
<br />
Everything else I think was covered, basically nothing new, nothing at all remotely positive. I turned off one of my 5 accounts last month, the other 4 follow soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I forgot to add I asked about an 1800+ heal as an ancient version in later zones. They seemed at least not 100% opposed to that idea.<br />
<br />
Also, they know HoT's are worthless, Ryltan admitted they were incredibly inadequate, even in their upgraded form, which was why he gave them to us. So hows that bone taste gang?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok since it appears that Sony doesnt give a F**k about us Shammys the i say lets do a game wide sit down in pok around both banks and refuse groups and refuse to do buffs till sony sits down and fixes what the f**ked up. This might take a couple of days but the lag we would creat and the complaints should get their attention. I am tyeried of us falling father behind other classes.  Ok Rant Off.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not to be mean, Banelor, but I don't see what good a shaman sit-in would do.  Warriors, though severely handicapped in agro control, had that little discipline called defensive that made them indispensible to raids and very tough group encounters.<br />
<br />
Honestly, what damage would shaman sitting in do?  Malos?  Mages have mala for a sizeable unresistable component and malosinia.  Slow?  Enchanters can take care of it.  Focus?  BL's can get most of it with Kragg since almost all the end-game type-folks have maxxed stats.  Cha buff for Divine Intervention spell?  Chanter can handle it.  Heals?  If they're depending on shaman heals they're SoL anyway--they're better off getting a druid or a cleric.<br />
<br />
About the only thing a sit-in would do is make us miss a group.  I don't even think people would particularly be inconvenienced if every single shaman in the game sat out.<br />

I believe the longest single mob fight in PoP is Ginto in PoEb (I figure he has a few million HP).  Now try and land anything on him.  Last night I gave up casting velium strike on him when I got 3 hits for under 100...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No deaths<br />
<br />
Sit in was about yet another change to Feign Death<br />
<br />
Gnome was Aradune as was stated, for those who don't know Aradune aka Brad, was the man who had the Vision of this game and brought it to being.<br />
<br />
I do not remember if monks got their way, but server was brought down I believe shortly after gnome boy showed up.<br />
<br />
Also believe people made monks on that server to participate in the sit in.  And yes, this was before Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually the gnome was not aradune, the gnome was John Smedly, and his giant gnome avatar was named Smed.  And no, there was no slaughter of players in freeport of any sort.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, he mitigated slow and quadded me for 1500. Tnarrgs wasnt enough to save me.<br />
As I lay there bleeding at his feet, I looked up at him and said,' You see what we are talking about now??'<br />
<br />
He did, however, acknowledge that faster dots may be inline but nothing faster than Bane, which would be fine with me. I just asked that the recast was adjusted so we can use it as a primary offense, the inproportionate aggro be looked at and that other similarly timed dots be added so we could stack them and contribute something for a change.<br />
I also asked about the fixed healing %'s...the reply was discouraging.</div></div><hr />

Gloriana's response was PRICELESS!<br />
Well, if it were a LONG fight, I guess.<br />
This reminds me so much of the whole &quot;alchemy is broken&quot; fiasco with SoE saying it wasn't.  If the devs knew more about the game than the players than they wouldn't have to &quot;BETA&quot; patches on live servers.  I'm starting to think they are as clueless as many have speculated.  Clearly, they don't play every class and do not have an accurate perspective on the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I guess it was a bunch of monks FD when I took pics.  I wasn't sticking around long to find out the outcome.</div></div><hr />

The scary thing is Litchbane, it always sound to me like the devs refuse to admit that slow mitigation is in place at all.</div></div><hr />

That one statement showed me exactly what the devs thought about us. <br />
<br />
I also asked a question about overcrowding in the EP's (my guild was 3rd to make EP's last month alone) and first was told Torvo isn't any smaller then any other server (LOL, I guess thats why we are just a bit above the zek's on pop sort list and have people from a lot of the really old servers transfering in and saying how peaceful it is.) Then was told to we could do high end GoD content without any EP gear (that was even funnier).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, Xegony now has 5 or so time enabled guilds with at least one or two others that will probably make it within a few months....

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'll alter what I posted on another thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;What if Shaman staged a sit-down and nobody cared / noticed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, and I don't mean to be mean, imagine if Clerics staged a sit-down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">New description of Shaman Class from the test server!!!<br />
<br />
Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for powerleveling alts. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears. <br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - Healing pets and buffing low level alts of real classes, and royally pissing off enemies with spells that have no other noticable effect. A shaman's enhancement spells don't do jack to squat, but light up numbers on your inventory in a pretty green color, and put our paintakingly hand-painted buff icons on your buff window. Shamans also are able to heal their allies for miniscule abounts, and have excellent health regeneration spells that couldn't save a gnat from a feather.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle, provided the battle lasts half an hour and is in the snowy lands of Velious. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive aggro for very little damage, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly to their metacarpals. A brutal line of crippling spells can appear to slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess, but only on paper.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations, but nothing truely useful for either. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, by gaining sufficient aggro and cannibalizing far down enough so that their deaths disrupt mob positioning and wipe the raid. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups, but not working well. They are also the only class able to solo dragons in Velious!</div></div><hr />
