<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halgoran Edgecrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
My main is a 63 shaman who I absolutely love playing.  Lately, I've found my play times restricted to odd times where finding a group is less than easy.  I like being able to log on and start hunting right away, so I've been 3-boxing my shaman, 56 magician and 51 warrior.<br />
<br />
My question is this: Is the warrior going to suffice as a tank or am I going to level him up only to find that I should have just rolled a shadow knight?  I enjoy playing a warrior, but I think having feign death, snare, and aggro-generating spells could be a boon to the group.  I like the magician in the group, it's a fairly easy, high damage class that adds some interesting things, but the warrior concerns me.<br />
<br />
I have read the threads concerning the great Shadow Knight vs. Warrior debate, I would just like some opinions on whether it would be worth it to re-start with a new tank class.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, I think the warrior will help you with a few certain cases where defensive is really important...<br />
<br />
The problem is that there's redundancy imo in that 3-box combo.  The warrior can only step in and fight/take hits-- if he wants to back off and let the magician pet absorb hits, he will just be standing there contributing nothing.<br />
<br />
Whereas if anything a shadowknight can snare, group life/mana tap, nuke, and even contribute with a stinky pet.  And like you said, feign death is invaluable.<br />
<br />
If you had fifteen hands, bard would complement everybody the best, hehe.<br />
<br />
I wonder if a necro might be the best third character in your 3-box?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A hybrid is always gonna be the better choice in a smaller group due to thier ability to adapt to a situation and bring needed spells and abilities to the table. Anyone of ranger (harmo pull, snare, am3/eq, hp and attack buffs that stack with shaman), Paladin (stuns, rezz, heals, hp buffs, group heals, LoH, pacify, root), Shadowknight (fd, group taps, offensive spells, life taps) or beastlord (bad ass pet, buffs, secondary slower, decent melee dps) would add more to your group than defensive does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Halgoran Edgecrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey,<br />
Thanks a bunch for your input.  I had considered necromancer, but in grouping with them, it always seemed to me they were an active class... much like a well-played shaman.  I like the magician because for the most part it can be completely hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
I like the point about hybrids being far better than pure melee in a small group setting.  I hadn't realized how much more they truly bring to the table, at the cost of a small amount of hit points/armor class/attack.  Paladin could be neat as a tank, as could that beastlord pet with magician summons.  I am a little skeptical of a ranger's ability to tank, but perhaps that's just misinformation on my part.  In my mind, the best third man still seems to be shadow knight, followed by necromancer if it wouldn't drive me insane.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the input, more is always welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you were two boxing I'd say necro over the SK.  Since its three accounts you're running, I'd go with the SK.  May make your playing a little easier.  I definately like the SK over the warrior for the snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are just going to break out for easy xp.<br />
<br />
Go Shadowknight, Snare, Feign are invaluable. <br />
<br />
Or Paladin. Stackable Buffs. Res. Stuns. Quite good as well.<br />
<br />
Warrior is also quite nice Simply cause of less maintanace. If you get a bad pull defensive can be a wonderful thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I often 3 box a 65 druid with DC, 65 shaman and my 62 warrior.<br />
<br />
I can do north east basement in HoH without too  much dificulty thanks to defensive and furious (12 secone auto reposte) disc's for resists on slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">going with 3 box, I would say warrior is your best choice - not because they are better, but for ease of play. You will find that 3 boxing 3 different classes that have 3 entirely different tasks requires a whole lot of work, almost more than is humanly possible. With a warrior, you can just stand in front of the mob, taunt a few times, autoattack on, and then bot him while you go to the shaman. With a SK you will be continually casting agro spells to be efficient.<br />
<br />
You can always just try it out, it can't really hurt. If you can handle it, I'd say SK is your best choice, followed by Pally, then beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not really the best 3 box combo.<br />
<br />
I would say Paladin but you won't have a snarer.<br />
SK but no rez.<br />
<br />
Since most of your love is for the Shaman... it shouldn't bother you to dump the mage for a necro instead then I would easily suggest Paladin for tank.<br />
<br />
A warrior with high agro weapons and decent AC/HP gear will not be cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used to 4 box on 2 machines using eqw before my older box died. I ran a necro as my second toon on my rangers box, and ran a druid along with my shammy. since i only had 1 melee and 2 pets the ranger needed more attention than the necro, but I could easily pop back and forth to group lifetap, sick pet, use epic etc on the necro. On my other box I would slow and canni the shaman, requiring alot of attention meanwhile Healing, nuking and casting dots with the druid. <br />
The key to maximizing effeciency i found was hot keys, and knowing which toons needed to be babysat the most, as well as what spells should be cast in what order, such as casting pox then bane of nife instaed of the other way around and wasting mana when pox barely went half way and having to cast 2 banes etc. Controlling agro is key also when having a small group/boxed group that doesn't necessarily have all the tools of an ideal group. <br />
Easiest classes to box in order of easiness<br />
Wizard (nuke and evac, no buffs worth casting really except for self buffs)<br />
Mage (sic pet and nuke)<br />
beastlord non melee (same as mage with a few more spells)<br />
Cleric (heal)<br />
Druid (evac, heal, nuke, dot and buff, maybe snare) <br />
Necro (taps, nuke, dots, fd, pet)<br />
Archery ranger (stand back and shoot, works great witha  gamepad)<br />
Berserker (autoattack and stand there figuring out what the hell else you can do)<br />
warrior (autoattack, just gotta make sure push doesn't move mobs away)<br />
Rogue (same as warrior but throw in backstab and evade)<br />
Monk (same as warrior rogue, add in kicks, gamepad would help with those as well)<br />
Melee ranger (autoattack, nuke, snare, etc)<br />
Paladin (heals, stuns, autoattack)<br />
Shadowknight (auto attack, pet, tap's fd, etc)<br />
Melee beastlord (pet, slows, autoattack, buffs, pet heals)<br />
Shaman ( slows, pet, heals, dots, nukes, canni is a big attention grabber)<br />
Enchanter ( cc is a tireless job, especially when they are only slower in group)<br />
Bard (everything except heals and evacs)<br />
What you really need to decide is how comfortable you are with the classes you play, how effecient you want them to be and how much work ya willing to put into your mini group. I found 4 boxing to be alot of fun, but a ton of work also. I find douing to be almost boring, and playing 1 toon unless I'm kiting is downright sleep inducing. Almost any class can be boxed well, but almost all are better off being played as the only toon. <br />
When deciding what classes to box you need to ask yourself a few questions:<br />
What do I want to accomplish?<br />
how many toons am I willing to play?<br />
What roles do I need to cover?<br />
What classes do I already have available?<br />
What gear will I need to help me accomplish my goals?<br />
Is anyone going to be joining me to form a more well rounded group?<br />
What are my play times and how many friends can I count on to help fill roles?<br />
Once all these questions are answered then you can figure out for yourself what classes you need for the ideal box. Don't overlap abilities to much, especially if it means ignoring ignoring other areas. Groups need a few things to be successful: healing, dps, debuffs, buffs crowd control. IF any of these is really dominate it can counteract a lack in the other areas, especially healing and dps. If the mob dies fast or you can keep everyone healed all day debuffs, buffs and crowd control are meaningless. The old manaburn teams are perfect examples of this, mobs would die so fast that the fact they couldn't heal or cc for crap didn't matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agreed<br />
Three boxing can be extremely difficult, and 3 different classes with 3 different tasks can be a lot of work.<br />
<br />
My BF and I both 3-box easy LDoNs, and let me tell you, trying to keep everything in order, and getting everyone to do their jobs takes a while.<br />
<br />
Him: Ranger (main), warrior, cleric -- all 65<br />
<br />
Me: Shaman (main), bard, and enchanter (puller) -- all 65<br />
<br />
Most of my concentration is on the enchanter who is pulling. The bard just twists 3 songs: mana, DS, and haste. Thank gawds for keypads!<br />
<br />
The shaman sits back, slows, roots, and back-up heals. <br />
<br />
My boyfriend has it easy. The warrior hits, gets hit. The ranger does most of the damage by sitting back and plunking arrows. The cleric just heals.<br />
<br />
If you're going to play the warrior/shaman combo, I suggest rooting the mob, and let the warrior taunt and kill where the mob is rooted, instead of pulling aggro off you when you slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you want to worry about having to do things to acquire aggro, then the SK isn't an inferior choice to a warrior -- just the opposite.<br />
<br />
Once a SK puts clinging darkness and/or fear and/or some of his other buffs(I really like the SK's AC buffs and ATK buffs) on a few times, it's not that easy to get aggro off him.  Things like clinging darkness take very little mana, also.  A warrior with a great weapon like a Blade of War is one thing, but most warriors have to work quite a bit harder at their aggro control.<br />
<br />
Plus the nice thing about losing aggro with a SK is, the mob will likely be snared.  A mob that a warrior loses will come running at you full speed.  And getting him back again can be tough for a warrior, too. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think something shaman/druid/SK is about perfect, and am a big fan of shaman/SK.  <br />
<br />
Only thing is, with an SK and shaman, you will be doing more minor mobs than someone will who adds in a slower to his cleric/warrior.  Both of those teams could really use what the other has -- that's why it's good to get together with other boxers sometimes and do with just a couple of people what whole groups sometimes flop at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personaly, im going with Shaman, Wizard and Paladin. It's easily the best 3 box combo imo, wizard is 100% hotkeyed, the shaman is my main toon which I can easily do CC with or tank the odd add, and the paladin is main tank. Paladin stuns is god for agro, and his group heals is a life saver if you get in any kind of trouble. LoH is allso a BIG plus in my book for 3 boxing, incase you **** up hes there to save the day. <br />
<br />
What none has mentioned is gaters, both wizard and paladin is quite nice for stopping these, where as a warrior/druid combo would lack the abilities to stop these effectively.<br />
<br />
Pulling is either done by shaman or paladin, it depends on the zone layout, in dungeons(LDoN) it's paladin and if it is a outdoor zone it's my shaman.<br />
<br />
I have tried out shaman/magi/warrior, and I found the combo really lacking. If you get in trouble the only toon that is able to &quot;help&quot; is the shaman, there is no real escape except for gate and that leaves the warrior in the dust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Halgoran Edgecrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, thanks for the overwhelming responses!  It's nice to see a lot of different combos working well for people.  I think I am going with the shadow knight, since it seems to provide the most utility and synergy with the shaman as the core of the group.<br />
<br />
The shaman/paladin tandem just doesn't seem like it would work as well unless the third character is really on the ball.  Though I am rather fond of necromancers....<br />
<br />
I am trying one out, it's a lot of fun even at level 14.  The spells just seem to go hand in hand with what a shaman has to work with.  I will try the magician at the third spot and see how well it works.  Perhaps cleric, enchanter or even wizard could take that place, which would cover stun.<br />

It's too bad that pure melee classes don't have much of a place in this setting.  I do enjoy them, but they just don't bring much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I only 3-box - haven't grouped once in months.  While I have a few combos I like, the magician makes an excellent off-character (bot).  You can macro the pet-attack and a few nukes and really don't have to babysit them at all.  Ideal attention-free damage potential.  And you can summon focus items to fill in any missing effects, and toys for any pets in the group.  Mages are underrrated in my opinion as 2 and 3-box options.  Their pets can do a very decent job of tanking if you get the mobs slowed quickly, and the earth pet especially does an excellent job of holding agro, so your shaman can DOT away without having to worry as much.<br />
<br />
One tip - if you do go with a mage, make sure your /pet attack macro includes a /sit off.  Mobs really get angry at sitting magicians when they send in their pets, even if they're a long ways away from the action.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mintyfresh, I have to disagree on your ideal combo.  Not to put it down or be mean, just that I don't think it's ideal at all.<br />
<br />
The stuns from the paladin are very nice, and can lead to taking less damage on the part of both the shaman(when slow gets aggro, which can happen even with a pally/SK tanking) and the tank himself.  But when you talk about the puller being the pally or the shaman, you have to let both step aside.  (Frankly, the wizard's snare makes him not a bad puller sometimes in comparison -- but more on snare pulls in a sec...)<br />
<br />
I pull all the time as a shaman, because malos lets me get a mob to camp malosed and often slowed too before it even gets there.  It's a lot of fun and often very effective.  Sometimes I can even get root to land before I get hit, too, presenting a group a mob for whenever they're in the mood to get around to it.  But for the tricky pulls, the FD spell really, really shines.<br />
<br />
Both a warrior and a pally basically have to run if you get an overpull and hope not to die.  If you two box like I do on the same computer, as soon as one toon zones, you have to worry about doing it with the other one -- which is tricky on a slowish system because of the instant lag that zoning creates.  But even on a lightning fast computer (or multiple networked computers) and a great connection, it's just not that safe to run to a zone compared to just feigning death on a bad pull.  Feign death is easily one of the best spells in the game.<br />
<br />
If I have to run a toon out past my shaman to the zoneline(I've two-boxed druid/monk, druid/SK, druid/warrior, and shaman/with all of those), I have aggro on not one toon but two of them.  If there are multiples, sometimes one gets far enough behind to start pounding on my shaman while the other is pounding on my tank who's running ahead to the zoneline - ouch!  Now I've got two unslowed mobs on two different toons I'm trying to run out at the same time -- not really possible.<br />
<br />
With my SK, I do what I loved doing so much with my monk before the monk nerf -- FD and try again.  FD just lets you try so many scary things and get away with it scot free.  With a tank who can't do it, you run, or die, and hope you don't endanger your other toon in the process.  No matter how competent you are, it can easily be a problem.<br />
<br />
I was duoing the metal suited guys by the zone in in POV the other day, working on my Aid Grimel tradeskill earring.  I needed to kill the suited guys for their uncommon no-drop, sacred waters.  It was great doing it with my SK.  I pulled with snare in some places(bioluminescent orb in the tented village, and then snare after) and kept casting snare till it stuck.  If I got multiples, no problem -- nobody died and nobody had to zone(and waste a ton of time and have to recast pets); I would just FD.  <br />
<br />
Well anyway, through FD, my pull got down to a single.  Pallies can pacify, but they can't do what  my SK can do for me in a duo.  Snaring the mob allowed the SK to run it past my shaman, who could then malos it.  Another run-by allowed for slow.  By that time the aggro was so high on the SK that there was almost never a problem.  The SK cast his AC buffs and ATK buffs as the mob was incoming and got ready to cast his lovely zeevfer's (sp?) bite spell, which adds both HP and, especially lovely, mana to the group, starting to regen my shaman's mana right away.  <br />
<br />
You have an enormous amount of control with an SK doing this kind of thing.  I loved my monk, and his FD was king of the world -- better than an SK's, in fact.  But... he didn't have snare.  Mobs came in full bore when he pulled them, and malos/slow was much more of a dangerous situation, with my monk's hitpoints plummeting all the time...and them slow yanking the mob right off the monk.  SK's combo of both snare and FD makes them an extremely potent puller in many cases.<br />
<br />
Your third being a wizard -- excellent choice, can't argue with the DPS.  But...I'd still rather have the charming ability of a druid as an option for vastly more DPS, and for the other things he can do.  Against really tough mobs, or when slow just doesn't seem to stick, shaman heals can either be too late or too inadequate.  Druid heals are far more potent, and having HOT's and slows from the shaman plus REAL heals from the druid makes for a very potent healing combo in a trio.  A druid also adds in significant DPS that, like a wizard's, can be readily hotkeyed.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, a druid, unlike a wizard, can give your team 9's, a very potent buff that helps add not just hitpoints but mana regen too.  Like the wizard, he can evac, which is more handy than a lot of people like to give wizard/druids credit for, but he can also land a superior snare, add a damage shield, cast a manaless regen spell with the right equipment, provide superior fire/cold buffs, damage shield, a nice ATK boost with his wolf form...that's an awful lot of utility.  <br />
<br />
Whereas the wizard in comparison provides superior DPS but ONLY DPS, the druid provides quite good DPS and excellent healing, as well as very useful buffs.  And if he gets a pet, he's very superior DPS indeed.  I've seen a druid/chanter combo mow through mobs incredibly quickly, far faster than a very good regular group could hope to do.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, while paladins provide stuns and a buff or two(their rez is nice, but usually I can find a cleric rez anyway), and wizards provide great DPS, the FD and snare and mana/hp &quot;sort of&quot; regen abilities of a SK, and the enormous overall utility on both the DPS and healer/buffer side of a druid make them, at the very least, easily the equal of a paladin/wizzy addition to a shaman.</div></div><hr />
