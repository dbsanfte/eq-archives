<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From the day I first got lost in Butcherblock (something I still do) to exploring ToV, it's been fun. But at some point, it's got to end. Like many others have said before me, EQ is more of a chore than a rollercoaster ride these days, with the main content being in farming ubers or camping ultrararespawn Y for quest Z.<br />
<br />
I don't regret the good hours I have had in EQ, and I will miss the friends I've made. However, I have too many important commitments and  way too many things in the RealWorld(tm) that I want to explore for me to waste  my time doing something that doesn't really give me joy anymore.<br />
<br />
So Drolgin steps out of Norrath and into Copenhagen. Who knows, if things change for me, and for EQ, I may be back - I will probably stop by and check out Luclin. But the 3AM raids I can't handle anymore - and those were the last bastion of fun in the game part of EQ.<br />
<br />
I will take a lot of good memories with me, mostly of my friends and the things we did.<br />
<br />
Rizz, for caring about Keepers of the Elements and the members of that guild to the extent that it sometimes ruined your own fun.<br />
<br />
The KoE officers for putting up with me and for letting me know I had their trust - Zelfani, Hammerstalker, Canoe, Aaeamdar, Aranuil, Ryutono, Chmee, Cyrssi, Klydon and Vhela. You guys have done a great job, and I hope you will continue to work hard to make KOE the friendliest guild on the server. <br />
<br />
KoE members old and new - We did good, all things considered. My one regret is that I couldn't help enough when it was needed. Thanks for every laugh you brought to me and for every thought shared.<br />
<br />
The LateNightCrew - Larain, Droogimp (F DROO!), Burien, Cshae (*HUGS*), Grugr (where the hell did you go you big lug?), Sparck, Slashir. You made me have fun in the game again, brought me back to EQ hardcore, and for that I thank you and curse you ;)<br />
<br />
Anyone who ever made me laugh, picked me up or put me down when I needed it - I thank you.<br />
<br />
There are just too many memories for me to put them all in writing - but trust me when I say that I haven't forgotten you.<br />
<br />
I'll probably keep trolling the boards and the IRC channels, and if I start going totally nuts over the absence of friends, I may log on to say a few hellos - but for now, I'm out. If you want to get in touch with me, drolgin@hotmail.com works wonders ;)<br />
<br />
Take care all, have fun - danish dorf out.<br />

<br />
From the first time we met (way back when I was still a young dorf paly of level 35 or so) I have had the utmost respect for you as a player and more importantly as a friend. You were always someone I could go to to with so many questions and you always took the time to answer everyone of them no matter how stupid they were. In many ways Drolgin the dwarf was, and always will be, Kilrain's mentor. I will miss you greatly my friend. Be safe and be well and I hope that one day you will come back to adventure with us again.<br />

It seems that even in Norrath, life is a long series of hellos and goodbyes.<br />

I wish you nothing but the very best in life.  I thank you for sharing your seemingly infinite wisdom with me whenever I had a question.  It was always a pleasure to group with you.  You are truly one of the best players Norrath has ever seen and you will be missed my friend.  Take care.<br />

On a serious note, I haven't known you long, or well for that matter, but you always brought a smile to my face and laughter to my heart. I will miss you as well, even though I didn't know you well or long, the sadness of your leaving still brings sadness to my heart. I hope you have many real life adventures that leave you happy and fulfilled.<br />
