Like, Casting Fury 3 = 10% will crit, 2x damage when they do.  Crit damage doesn't go up again till you get Destructive Fury (to 2.25x), but the other &quot;Fury&quot; AAs increase your chance to crit.</div></div><hr />

Weapon Affinity does not affect the proc rate of &quot;proc buffs&quot;. Combat Effects do IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This sounds like a great spell, but I was wondering whether we have to be careful with who we cast it on in a group situation.<br />
Lets say that a group has a warrior as tank, and a rogue for DPS. If I cast Panther on the rogue, will his dps (and thus aggro) go up so much that the warrior can't keep aggro any longer?<br />
If yes, we probably have to cast it on both of them, and hope that the warrior is not using a slow 2-handed weapon that will proc less often.<br />

Proc rate is a function of time, and not related to weapon speed, haste, etc, in any way.</div></div><hr />

The rogue AA that increases chance to proc is called Virulent Venom.  Not sure if it works on all buff procs or just rogue poisons.</div></div><hr />

What do I hear.....NERF BAT!<br />
<br />
I certainly hope this stays like it is, but I can hear several classes complaining already..well, I can't actually hear them, but I can imagine them complaining...  I think the biggest complainer will be BST.  With this, we can now out-dps them in a group situation.  With more DPS, more utility, more healing, better slowing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, I'm not so sure about the nerf bat on this one. not to say that it can't, or won't happen, but this isn't an everyday exploit.<br />
<br />
the DPS output of this spell appears to be hard coded. with specific duration, mana cost and upkeep, and available improvements to such a spell, you'd think they'd have been aware of the damage potential.<br />
<br />
this spell appears to be just something for the redefining of the classes, I believe, as stat increases were no longer producing lasting/wanted results, they give us a new way to increase melee DPS without relying on stat-increasing buffs. As I had originally believed when I first started playing, Shaman are to Melee as Enchanters are to Casters. we augment their primary abilities.<br />
<br />
this of course, is a multiple boon to us, as we not only augment the abilities of others, but our own abilities with these spells...<br />
<br />
no one has to agree with me, this is just the view I'm seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cast the lvl 61 spell on 3 mage pets. Procced 221 times over a 4 minute fight. This gives the region of 85k damage and 350ish DPS.<br />

Nice. I can't wait to get my lvl 69 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">lololol 350dps from a 61 shaman.  Rogues eat your heart out~<br />
<br />
Kunark rogues (level 60, Ragebringer w/ 14/24 offhand, no AA or +wierd****) do about 110dps, iirc.  I remember this number from when, during PoP, level 62 magician water pets (who are also rogues) were discovered to be doing about the same :p  <br />
<br />
Modern rogues, even lower level ones, do a lot more damage, of course.  The improved itemization on midrange droppable pokers for them has really turned the stabbing business around.  But still, that's some damned good damage for a 61 shaman !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lord, please let me hit level 61 before this spell gets nerfed. Pretty please?...with sugar on top?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If they nerf either of these two spells they are out of their minds.  Not that they arent anyway, but thats a different thread subject.<br />
<br />
While in 'theory' this provides great dps.  the reality is that it provides average dps.  why do i say that?  because this spell has such a short duration that you wont be doing anything else while this is being kept up on 2 or 3 people/pets.<br />
<br />
I was able to keep leopard up on 2 melee and my pet, while also slowing mobs with nihils.  If i had to heal, slow multiple mobs, root park cc, or anything else leopard dropped and did not get renewed, which meant no dps from it.  that was also not casting malos or using TA.<br />
<br />
what it comes down to is a choice.  something shaman have always had to deal with.  you want to fill that dps roll?  well now you can.  but you wont be healing or doing anything else to offset that dps.  you want to be the secondary healer?  well your dps is going to be better of using dots, because you wont be able to recover the mana back from healing and keeping panther (leopard) running full time.<br />
<br />
We now have the burst dps we have been asking for, but it comes with a price.  It requires a spell slot, which even with 9 is not enough for a shaman, and a horrendous refresh time, which requires constant monitoring and refreshing.<br />
<br />
i personally love this spell and tend to keep it mem'd now, but i dont cast it all the time or even try to maintain it on any melee.  I use it to help alt tanks get argo on adds or to help finish off mobs we are trying to burn down.  the vast majority of time (during raids) im healing, curing, buffing, or waiting to do one of those 3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;horrendous recast time&quot;? according to lucy, recast time is 0, Avatar line however, still remains at 60.<br />
<br />
does it have any longer than the standard built-in refresh of 2.5 secs?<br />
<br />
I could probably keep it up on a few people, but I wouldn't want to, duration and mana cost are a bit high, even if recast isn't. and this would be even MORE of a pain to keep up than avatar....I say pick a favorite monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i used the wrong phrase.  i didnt mean a recast time.  i meant how often you have recast the spell to keep it up... every minute and 30 seconds for me for example.<br />
<br />
Xero, thats exactly what i was talking about.  you CAN keep it up on several people, but you WONT be doing anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Proc rate is a function of time, and not related to weapon speed, haste, etc, in any way.<br />
<br />
Well, this is what has me curious then... if the proc rate is strictly a function of time, what if someone is using one of those weapons with the ridiculous delay numbers.<br />
<br />
You are saying that over the same amount of time, someone with extremely fast weapons will proc the same number of times as someone using an extremely slow weapon?<br />
<br />
Something doesn't seem right about that to me, but I am not into all that parsing/number crunching stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, when used on Farrel's Companion, the proc rate is MUCH higher than shown in that log I posted earlier, which leads me to believe that the proc rate isn't strictly a function of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pick a magician('s pet)/necromancer('s skele)/beastlord('s warder).  Much higher proc rate, much higher damage.  No pets available? Pick a ranger/pal/sk, they have higher chance to crit than monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Proc rate is indeed a &quot;function of time&quot;, however, if you used a weapon with a delay of 600 and no haste, you'd only swing once per minute. This would obviously prevent you from taking advantage of the high proc rate of Panther.<br />
<br />
Instead of just saying that the proc rate is a function of time, it's probably better to say that while a proc buff/weapon has an &quot;innate&quot; disposition to proc X times per minute on average, which is independant from the delay you are swinging at, you still need to swing at least X times(X being the coded average of procs per minute) to allow yourself to take full benefit of the high proc rate.<br />
<br />
In short, if you only swing 5 times, you can't proc 10 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That would be true for a shaman but most melee classes would at least double attack if noth tripple or flurry some with a high delay weapon. Giving more chances to proc. High delay 2hders are also pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I said that in another thread already and honestly don't know how to phrase it any better, but with swing I mean every hit/miss, so that one melee round can be made up of more than just 1 swing. A succesful double attack would be 2 swings and a tripple attack would be 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda correct. It is ratio between a set number of procs per minute and the speed of the weapon.<br />
<br />
If it is set for 10 procs a minute then a weapon that swings 10 times in a minute will proc on every hit but a weapon that swings 100 times in a minute will proc every 10 swings.<br />
<br />
This is how warriors were AE killing a crap load of mobs in PoN. They would use Earthshakers (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5667) that have an AE spell and would get the best slow on them they could. It would up the rate of procs per swings and would go off every 1 or 2 swings so a few warriors using a repost disc could eat up a ton of mobs.<br />

updated the warrior bit to show it was an earthshaker</div></div><hr />

You dont proc on ripostes, only regular swings. Folk with earthshaker were using their AA rampage ability, which will give one round where AE hit everything in melee range.<br />
<br />
However, I did hit furious on the final moments of a failed Coirn attempt once, when a giant pack of trash descended on me after finishing off the last caster. For 12 seconds the battlespam was something awesome to behold :).</div></div><hr />
