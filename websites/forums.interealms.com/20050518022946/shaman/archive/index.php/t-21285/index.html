&quot;death is constant&quot; Another way of saying more mobs with sickening DPS and slow immunities ? Have yet to find anyone who thinks the GoD style of mob design was a good idea, let alone good enough to build another expansion off of it. SoE can kiss my ass. Don't expect me to start billing on my account again when they cant even get the current content right. These guys are as bright as a 3 watt bulb.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If its true, I think that EQ is fixing a mistake they made by finally raising the level cap.  As it is now, there is a huge difference possible between two level 65 characters, that it would be very difficult to create content for one that is bazzar equipped with 14 aa's and one that is time equipped with 200 aa's.  I think parts of SoE’s desgin issues are a result of the level cap.  Itemization has become a kind of “pseudo level”, and this is what has a lot of “casual” players frustrated to the point of threads drifting off topic to pages of silly arguments.<br />
<br />
For example hard Ldons are very hard for a group of 65 bazaar geared players, maybe near impossible without the correct mix of classes, where for a group of time geared 65's hard Ldon's are hardly exciting at all it seems.  And yet both the bazaar geared level 65 player and the time geared lvl 65 player get the same amount of exp per kill, the same number of adventure points, the same items drop.  This creates a misbalance where content has to be boringly easy for one set of 65's to be doable for the other set.  But the rewards for both ends of the level are the same.  <br />
<br />
And if SoE wants both sets to purchase the expansion, they have to have something for everyone.  It may bring balance issues again, if PoP flagging mobs loose their raid status, for example, but these balance issues seem entrenched in the current design for expansions already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New things are never bad. It sounds more like this new expansion (I was wondering what happened to Morden btw) will be geared at providing more content/development avenues with broad appeal, while GoD is directed mostly at (and will be for some time) at high end play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've been wondering for a while when they were going to introduce some additional worlds besides Norrath.<br />
<br />
They've done about all they can do with Norrath except open up an entire underwater &quot;Oceans of Norrath&quot; expansion zone, and/or a &quot;Depths of Norrath&quot;, underdark-esque caverns and complex dungeon-maze underworld zone.<br />
<br />
Opening up the possibility and hint to other planets and worlds was a neat idea for this expansion.  Brad said a long time ago that they had plans and could work the current level system to 100.  If they bump it up every 2 or 3 years by 5 more levels, that will take the level 100 mark out to about 2015 or so with some creativity... and by then the universe could be just truly astoundingly huge ... and folks would be solo'ing the Bertox ring encounter for fun.</div></div><hr />

OMG how I love this comment.... nope you certainly dont have to go through the anguish of &quot;grinding your ass&quot; up to 70 or even spending 1cp on a new spell.  If you hate the game, go play CoH I hear it's really a lot of fun!<br />
<br />
Why do folks feel when a new expansion comes out they HAVE TO HAVE IT! and then bitch about it?  Dont like it? Havent gotten through all the other content? CHEER!  Wanna know why?  Because now the folks that are done with PoP but are only kicking around there because there is no where else to go, will leave.  So be happy that you havent had to fight over PoP flag mobs and be happy that PoP will be a lot less crowded when you are there since you are a bit behind the curve. <br />

I just meant, that people (there are a lot of em) in the same boat as me will be even more left behind. I dont 'have to have this expansion' but if i wanna keep up with my guild im sure i'll need it for the lvls/aa/spells that will come with it.  <br />
<br />
It wont exactly mean less compatition for EP's because at least on my server there are a bunch of newly EP guilds.  It does mean however, that i (and many people in the same situation) will be further behind in the curve.  <br />

Class issues will always be present, however after 4+ years, the game should be relatively stable. Dedicating the entire team to fixing existing problems should be their focus, rather than pumping out expansion after expansion. Honestly, if the game were stable I wouldn't have a problem with another expansion. The ideas presented on the web page sound interesting and I'm sure at some point I'll purchase it, but not until they address a majority of the graphics/gameplay issues.</div></div><hr />

Tugela, did you ever get a Christmas present that someone had dropped and broke?  Remember how you felt when you openned up the box and saw your new toy was broken?<br />
<br />
Broken new things are very bad.  I've been buying them for 5 years.  I finally figured it out.  Maybe you will some day, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Just going to directly quote what I wrote on my guilds MB, then read this thread later, dont have time now.<br />
<br />
I see this as backpedaling by SOE, and rushing to get another expansion out before WoW goes live. I think they see the wrinting on the wall. Time+ players all over the game despise Gates. They are leaving the game, in rather large numbers too, if the shaman board is any indication of the exodus. I am sure cancellations are up and server populations are down. They needed some &quot;juice&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet this Omen thing isnt even CLOSE to being done. It was probably planned for a Christmas season release, moved up due to pressure from other new games like WoW and CoH. Heck, they just announced they were going to go through Gates and re-tune the whole thing to accomodate more &quot;gear levels&quot; of people and less &quot;holy trinity required&quot;. Here is that announcement:<br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=62046<br />
<br />
I am skeptical. Is there more room for movement upward? I honestly do not think so, there is so little imagination going into the new stuff as it is (but hey, for 30 aa, I can cast group spells on my PET!). I guess we will have to see what the future brings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The graphics look great, better than EQ 2. Overall it looks much better than GoD.<br />
<br />
But what I hope for most (in vain probably) is that there are more LDON style adventure themes in it. LDON saved the game for most of the casual players I know, including me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">This just seems like GoD 2.0. GoD is too frustrating, not fun, and &quot;too hard&quot; so they need to give us 5 more levels and some AA to help us be able to beat GoD. Will there be any high level guilds left to even finish GoD before OoW comes out? I wonder how much of GoD they had to change to fit OoW into the story. From the early lore, didn't it seem like defeating Mata Muram would be the end encounter in GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Tugela, did you ever get a Christmas present that someone had dropped and broke?  Remember how you felt when you openned up the box and saw your new toy was broken?<br />
<br />
Broken new things are very bad.  I've been buying them for 5 years.  I finally figured it out.  Maybe you will some day, too.<br />
<br />
Well, if you get a toy car and try to use it as a toy transformer, sure it will seem broken but that is just because you aren't using it as a toy car *shrugs*. Things aren't *broken* just because they are not the way you want them to be.<br />
<br />
The grease that keeps games like EQ going is things to do and see. When you have done it all, or all you can do, then people get bored and leave. GoD has a lot to do, but in many cases that stuff is only accessible if you have well organized resources at both raid and group levels at your disposal. Most people dont, consequently they become frustrated and leave. Btw, all other classes are hemoraging players just as much as shaman, so this is a general issue with GoD and is not shaman specific, contary to what some would have you believe. LDoN is old and GoD is just too much of a wall for most people, including many in uber guilds who are nothing without their guild (and consequently hit a stone wall when they have to do hard stuff in groups).<br />
<br />
My guess is that Sony can see this happening and obviously it is a concern, hence an acceleration of &quot;news&quot;. I'm sure there are going to be things which are unfinished or dont work well, but from a business point of view it is better to entertain people in a full stadium with 80% of your act than to play to an empty stadium with 100% of the act.<br />
<br />
Or do you disagree? Perhaps you think they should hold back 6 months and wait until everyone has left the game before giving them something new to do?</div></div><hr />

Collecting cash time is comming.<br />
They need regular income apart from our monthly payment.<br />
And they don't care even that expansion is not well ballanced nor bugged.<br />
Of course they don't want to fix any expansion, because it never produce money.<br />
Good model of Commercialism.<br />
I am sure that next expansion has many bugs when they release it like GoD content. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Woo hoo!  Another raid expansion! I can't wait!  Man, I sure hope it's more flagged one group content like Gates!  Flags uber alles.  Why finish a zone when you can just flag it! It would suck to be able to go to the entire expansion on my own right out of the gate!  With any luck, they will advertise it as &quot;levels 50 and up&quot; and &quot;20 new zones&quot; and not tell you it's geared for L70 Gates+ chars w/ 10+ of the zones locked at release- players love surprises from marketing!<br />
<br />
And think of the new aa's! I can't wait to spend 40 aa's to get run 6 to outrun all the mobs w/ run 5! Woot! Critical Dots Mastery on my shaman to really pump out the phat dps, not to mention Pet Affinity II for my sk to crank his pet dps from 30.3 to 31.6, rock on!  Just as long as they again don't give knights any tanking AA's in this expansion and let me concentrate on my pet!<br />
<br />
And I sure hope they put the zones at the ass end of nowhere, ideally the zone in is somewhere at the bottom of Hate's Fury and everything sees invis.  I'm tired of this easy content in LDoN hards and Gates- bring on the unslowable 3k quad hitters! I'll be L70 after all, give me a real challenge!!@#$11111!!<br />

Sorry, Blazz, I had to. My jaw dropped at SOE's sheer stupidity announcing another expansion w/ so many gaping problems left unaddressed.  But why am I not surprised.</div></div><hr />

Bro, no offense, but this attitude is a problem. Everyone thinks they should have EVERYTHING. Behind? Behind what? Behind the guy who can play 20 more hours a week than you? <br />
<br />
My first character was 50 for a while when Kunark went live. After that, I never even got CLOSE to maxxing a character before the next expansion hit. Even Gates, I only had 160 aa and plenty of pre-Gates AAs I still wanted. I never killed Trak or the other Kunark dragons until Velious. I never really did HoT til Lucilin. I never saw Ssra or VT until well into PoP.<br />
<br />
Behind what?<br />
<br />
And Iz, I think you make a great point with your sarcasm post, but once again, and I say this with all sincerity, why don't you want to PROGRESS instead of just GETTING the most uber things and zones? I just do not get it. 5 more levels and a bunch of spells and gear would probably make Gates a ton more doable for a &quot;casual player&quot;. Even PoP bosses would be trivialized to the degree that you wont need 72 zergers, anymore. Of course, if your not handed the keys to the best zones and the best gear and the best spells OUT OF THE GATE, it sucks, right?</div></div><hr />

They got a lot to fix.  <br />

They've really frigged up progression and advancement and those who apparently are getting spoonfed content are the most unhappy.  <br />

GoD didn't force people to buy it, therefore most people chose not to waste their money.  Even a stern retuning of GoD gives me no reason to buy it really.  Every expasion has given the casual gamer and Ubah guilds a reason to buy it with the exception of LoY.  LoY was geared towards the 50 crowd, but it still had some content for AAs in HF....maybe Nadox, but it would be very slow IMO.<br />

Epic 2.0?  That was supposed to be in the game during PoP, which is over a year ago.  They would actually introduce new content when the content they pushed out 3? months ago is still full of lousy bugs, and this doesn't even consider how some haven't been able to play since the DX9 patch.<br />
<br />
Are some people so blinded by their addiction to EQ that they would actually buy yet another partially finished festering pile of **** expansion?  In any case, I am looking forward to seeing what they give everyone for spells and AAs.  Anyone want to place bets on beastlords getting turgurs and malo at level 70?<br />

The problem w/ progressing per se is that we're not even close to being able to handle (and access) Luclin locked content, much less anything past it w/o a raid behind us.  I know nothing about the new expansion other than it will raise level caps and that it was released SOE style while the last several expansions have glaring flaws left unaddressed.  <br />
<br />
If it's more single group content where 90% of the zones are accessible at launch we will def. check it out.  The whole concept of an expansion that is mostly locked started in PoP and was horrid design- you didn't hear me complain prior to PoP because I'm not losing sleep over no access to VT/ST/VP, 1-2 zones out of 20 in an expansion is livable.<br />
<br />
Yes, L65 has made content we couldn't do before much more accessible w/o a raid.  L70 will make it that much better except for the ole bonus exp problem.  At L70, only mobs that are 65+ will give you the bonus &quot;close to level&quot; exp.  So where will you fight lots of L65+ mobs? Not anywhere PoP- that's for sure.  Basically you'll be consigned to whatever zones are available in Ouch (OoW?) and the lovely quad 3k hitters on the zone trash.  I honestly don't know how they expect anyone not a raider to handle quad 2k-hitters in Gates w/o a warrior + 2 healers, which is just ridiculous, much less what we'll find in Ouch.<br />
<br />
There are more than just clerics and warriors that play this game.  Then again, maybe not.</div></div><hr />

I dont want my pc to lock up in PoK guess as i dont want it that means its not broken.<br />
Ditto reference getting stuck in scenerey.<br />
Ditto many other things but hey &quot;its working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The grease that keeps games like EQ going is things to do and see. When you have done it all, or all you can do, then people get bored and leave. GoD has a lot to do, but in many cases that stuff is only accessible if you have well organized resources at both raid and group levels at your disposal. Most people dont, consequently they become frustrated and leave. Btw, all other classes are hemoraging players just as much as shaman, so this is a general issue with GoD and is not shaman specific, contary to what some would have you believe. LDoN is old and GoD is just too much of a wall for most people, including many in uber guilds who are nothing without their guild (and consequently hit a stone wall when they have to do hard stuff in groups).<br />
<br />
Dont think ive ever read a post on here saying its JUST Shaman who are useless in GoD but to me that actually means that GoD is a damn sight worse than what you're suggesting.If just 1 class was useless then hell yes people would be on this board complaining but not on other class boards too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess is that Sony can see this happening and obviously it is a concern, hence an acceleration of &quot;news&quot;. I'm sure there are going to be things which are unfinished or dont work well, but from a business point of view it is better to entertain people in a full stadium with 80% of your act than to play to an empty stadium with 100% of the act.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or do you disagree? Perhaps you think they should hold back 6 months and wait until everyone has left the game before giving them something new to do?<br />
<br />
Actually these 2 quotes fit together nicely.<br />
Now if SoE had managed with GoD to play to a full stadium with 100% of their act THEN THEY WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO PLAY WITH ONLY 80%OF THEIR ACT THIS TIME AROUND<br />

Tugela if you were to go buy a new Mercedes tomorrow then when you got it home you found out they had forgotten to put brakes on because it was a rush job etc would you then go out next month and buy their latest model and say &quot;well you expect things to be broken etc&quot; ?<br />

what i dont understand is that you spend countless hours talking bad about the EQ most of you have left or are aboout to leave.<br />
Yes there is alot wrong with the new expansions and OoW will prolly be super bugged also, with zones half done, mobs quading for 4K, because they havnt completed every thing yet.<br />
BUT when EQ dies or the guild im in dies then im done playing EQ, I will NEVER start another game that stops me from working on my tan :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Actually before GoD came out all this was on the table, they really just decided to split the expansion into two for more marketing value.<br />

<br />
Well, thats the implication of all the posts harping on all the shaman leaving in droves when that doesn't appear to be the case, at least when compared to other classes. In my guild the heaviest losses have been in rogues, pallies, clerics and chanters it seems. But mostly the older more experienced people. I think in many cases they have been playing the game a long time and are just tired. There is nothing wrong with GoD as such, for the most part, but it is challenging and many people just dont want to make that sort of commitment anymore. The more serious issues come when people face uqua, because of the extreme difficulty. Earlier stuff is hard, but you dont get the sense that it is stupidly so, its just challenging.<br />
<br />
One of the legacies of PoP is that it taught a lot of people to be dependent on being surrounded by others, and now in GoD you are faced with situations where you are surrounded by few. The problem is that if such content is hard, it requires leadership and initiative, things which in PoP raids can be brought to the raid by a small handefull of people while the rest follow them. <br />

<br />
This is not a mercedes, its an entertainment product, and it needs to be delivered when the audience is there, flawed or not, not when they are gone. I would have thought thats obvious. Tell me, would you log in every day to sit in PoK and chat with your buddies for 6 months while they fine tuned the chamber encounter before releasing GoD? I think not. If you are being honest I'm sure that you would preferr new content as opposed to sitting on your butt.</div></div><hr />

But from one consumer to another. They have lost thier money from me. And anyone I talk too.<br />

I could try and use another clever scenerio but to be honest I don't have the energy anymore. CoH is fun. And they are not inclined towards ****ing over thier playerbase. WoW looks to be wonderful. Several friends are really enjoying FF11.<br />
<br />
SoE here is a little bit of advice. Don't piss off an established customer base with poor products and expect them to come back for more. Word is around, and the word is you are a used car salesman. Profiting on the work of other better people. And shouting SALE SALE SALE then changing the price while we are distracted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Another thing to consider here, maybe GoD was just a &quot;thrown together&quot; pile of poo to placate the &quot;Upper End&quot; and clear out Time for the guilds just getting there (usually 4-6 on most servers). Now, this new expansion is the REAL expansion. Looking at the relative lack of imagination in Gates, this is entirely possible. Whole spells being changed. Content totally un-accessable to 90% of the players (or more), but for MY guild, its been a godsend. We got 5 times as many EP mobs as we were getting before Gates, simply because the Top 4 guilds had better things to do than get twink_BL_016 a full set of leather EP molds. <br />

My attitude with expansions any more is wait and see what people are saying about them after they have been released. If reviews are great then I'll get it.
