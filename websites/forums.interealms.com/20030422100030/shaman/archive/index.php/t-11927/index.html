<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Up til recently I have been wearing a Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate for the regeneration effect.  However, last week I picked up a copy of Stoicism and I don't seem to be needing the regen as much any more.  I was hoping for some advice, should I hold onto the regen bp for the time being or should I ditch it and buy upgrades?  Btw I am lvl 53 (long way to torpor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am thinking the same thing with my Fungi, now i have regen 3 and regrowth/stoicism i cant see a need for it as much as my lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zukiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know this is somewhat off topic, but don't wanna start a new thread, I keep hearing conflicting reports of regen 3 (the aa points) do they stack with iksar regen? Lately I've been hearing alot of &quot;no it doesn't stack&quot;, though if it doesn't, why would it allow someone (as iksar) to train points into regen, it it'll do nothing?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you don't need the regen from your ikky/fungi, perhaps you should be canni'ing more.  The way I look at it, as long as you canni enough, every 2 points of regen is comparable to a point of flowing thought.  Or put another way, every point of regen is an extra slow/heal/dot every hour.  15 points of regen from a fungi is 15 extra spells.<br />
<br />
I have a fungi and I very much doubt I'll swap it out until I mem torpor.  Even then I may not, since I still view it in terms of how many extra spells per hour can I get over and above what I can regen via torpor/canni.  <br />
<br />
Probably the combo of canni5 and torpor will be what finally makes me put aside my fungi.  But stoicism+canni3/4 isn't gonna do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well the reason I asked is that a lot of times I have no trouble staying high on mana without using canni that much.  Granted I don't have canni3 but I don't see why this would change circumstances that much.  The regen is nice when I badly need mana though...I guess I will hold off on ditching the tunic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, please don't take offense at this, but if you're having no trouble staying high on mana, perhaps you should be doing a little bit more.  Toss in a nuke or a DoT.  If you simply have no opportunity to contribute more, then perhaps you should try to find more aggressive groups (or pull more aggressively solo).<br />
<br />
I have a fungi + horse + jbb + stoicism and I am routinely below full mana.   If I'm ever above 80m, the mob gets a bane right after I slow it (use ebolt if below 56 of course) or I toss on one of the less important buffs or proactively refresh a buff before it starts blinking and the melees have to ask for it.<br />
<br />
There are just so many things we can be using our mana on.  If you aren't having to canni that much and you are usually at full mana, get your puller to pull faster, canni as fast as you can, and start dishing out the damage.<br />
<br />
Now, admittedly, I never bother with getting KEI, so perhaps I'd have a different opinion on this topic if I had the extra 14 mana per tick.  But I doubt it.  I think I'd just use the extra mana to do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm 63, so that could affect things a little I guess (with canni 4).  In PoV with Stoicism, my lizard, FT1, bardsong, and KEI, I pretty much couldn't burn my mana fast enough.  I was constantly casting, either canni, stoicism, buffs, slows, malosini, dots, or rains.  I really have no use for a fungi right now.  Take away the bard, and I still have amazing mana regen.  Once I get canni5/torpor, or both, it will be sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess if you mostly group in outdoor zones where you can ride a mount, always have a bard, and always get KEI, then it's believable that you could simply be overflowing with mana despite casting something or other 100% of the time.  If that's the case, then sure, ditch the fungi for something with some HP/AC/resists or a nice clicky on it.<br />
<br />
I (58 shaman) was main healer for a small group (ranger+wizard+magician+me) in crypt of nadox the other day.  No bard, no KEI, no mount.  And I was VERY happy I had the fungi.  Main healing a ranger tank when you don't have a FD puller is extremely mana intensive.  Getting every mob slowed and keeping up with the healing was taking a ton of mana.  Every little bit helped.   If I'd had more, I might have been able to add some damage too.  <br />
<br />
The times I've had KEI and hunted outdoors though, I'm a lot closer to your position.  When I hit 60 and mem torpor, it may be time to PL up a kitty cat beast lord on the second box and hand off the fungus vest.</div></div><hr />

OT, but time to update your sig Vulash.<br />
<br />
Now, as the the discussion at hand...<br />
<br />
I bagged my Ikky BP when I got my horse.  Regrowth and horse&gt; 5pt regen, so I could get a BP that had some AC.  I still keep it in the bag and use it for downtime.  If I get a little low in the mana pool Ill toss it on for 22hp/tic with regrowth and horse.<br />
<br />
Ive never had as much fun with my shaman since horse/KEI were put into the game.  Instead of spending every second of my time canning life away I can actually speak with my group, and enjoy the social aspect of the game.  thats me though...some shaman Ive met are really anti-social, surly folks that are best left alone and dont care that they never speak because of thier canni habit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No offense taken.  When I say high on mana, I mean i rarely have to ask for a med break.  With my current set up I usually do just fine without KEI.  I find that if I throw dots I end up tanking unless I am grouped with a good tank.<br />
<br />
I am usually casting slow, malosi if resisted, cripple if melee heavy group, nuke or dot if not.  I don't ever go lom, I guess basically I was wondering if the tunic is really doing me a lot of good when I am fighting with between 1.5k to 3k hp depending on buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why dont you just get a nice Cheep AC breast Plat and bag the fungi for a day or so and see how you do with out it there.  That should be the easiest way to figure out how much it really is helping you out mana and stat wise.  Should only cost you 100pp at most to get AC breast plate of about the same as the fungi.  I personelly would give my left arm for a fungi as thats the only one I've not eaten yet :D hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With torpor or stoic you shouldn't need the regen. if your oom you just canni/heal simple as that. Much better off going with a tae ew tunic or something similiar the ac helps and trufhully the regen means very little with torpor and stoic to I'm assuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">im 54 and just traded out fungi for thurg quest BP<br />
<br />
basically i would say dont trade out fungi/regen BP unless you can get another BP with some very nice stats (ie. alot of wis/ mana/ hp) like tae ew BP or any of the velious BP's.<br />
<br />
i have no problems with mana having stoic + regrowth + cann 3 and i dont have JBB or horse/lizzy yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to agree with Kazim. I NEVER have mana. I would honestly say a horse is one of the best investments I have ever made. Not only regen, but also not getting aggro everytime you sit to open up the ol' spell book. With Canni5 and Torpor, I still have a hard time keeping mana in a good group. I would say on average I have about 40m.<br />
<br />
I don't know what prices are like on your server, but here you could sell that Ikky BP and get a horse, and then maybe save up a bit more cash and get something like a froglok bp. I was always told that the Ikky bp was more of a toy, and I promise you won't regret buying a horse (unless you spend lots of time in dungeons, then ignore hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Depends where I'm hunting but in general I always have mana even if I'm chain casting nukes. <br />
<br />
But it's just a simple fact that with torpor, and I guess stoic from what people are saying, you simply dont need hp regen. Why would you when you can canni and heal for more with mana gained also? <br />
<br />
Numbers just don't add up your better off with a tae ew bp or something nice like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have a fungi, i have stoicism. I plan on ditching the fungi at 51 for the Tae Ew bp sitting in my bank now. Reason is, even if im dropping myself to OOM ina  fight, or a triple pull, w/e...the regen from teh fungi isnt giving me mana back, Canni is and if i want my mana back fast, im using stoicism. the mana cost to heal ration is awesome, and i can go from OOM to FoM in no time, i have almost NO down time chain pulling multiples solo. It's just not as important now. Before stoicism...when i was using 150m for a 300pt heal, the fungi was awesome but as i move into PoP zones, its not gonna save my life and i have faster ways of regenning health. However, im not sure im selling it yet, might just bag it for when i need the xtra regen..depends if i find something i want bad enough to sell it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't sell your fungi. It's the best twink item in game. Also useful for pvp if you ever do that heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Regen 3 does stack with Iksar race.  For a short time I was enjoying AA regen 3 when Iksar and Troll races had 2 regen points for each AA regen point.  So regen 3 was actually 6.  It was very nice and very short lived.<br />
Unfortunately people complained and it was taken away.  Its funy these same people that complained dont suffer the same exp penalty I do for being an Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I sold my Iksar when I was 58 and got a Thurg quests.  I would have continued to equip the Iksar untill 60 but I felt that would be kind of rude to the guild.  Post LoY and Stoicism, I would just sell off the iksar as soon as you can get a nice AC / HP / Stats to replace.  A fungy has 3x the regen of an Iksar and so it might have more legs but the 5 hp regen on the iksar should be easily compenstated by Stoic.</div></div><hr />
