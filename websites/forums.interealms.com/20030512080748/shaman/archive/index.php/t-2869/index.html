<br />
Looking for advice on a guild event in the arena next week, it will be everyone against everyone and I like to become the winner. ;)<br />
<br />
Sooooo... I am not to familiar with PvP and would like some Combat tactics, what spells to mem, who to kill first, etc... advice if possible, so I can win one for the Shamans! :D<br />
<br />
I have all spells except Avatar and Pox and have JBB, Epic and horse and also have the snare necklace if that will help any.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In this type of setting (blue server duels) start with buffing yourself and your pet.  For yourself, start with about 5 useless buffs, then work your way into your see invis, ac, regrowth, sta, hp, resist (svd/p/f/c/m), and sow (in that order).  It is crucial to ensure that you always always have sow up, as it is an incredible advantage.  Your pet will need the typical solo buffs you give him, plus svm.  Now, in pvp, expect to never ever land magic based spells on your opponents; and likewise ensure that your svm is at least 160 w/buffs.  What this means is that nobody will have a good shot at landing snare, root, slows, blinds, or save debuffs (except for your malo which is unresistable).  The good thing about being a shaman in pvp is that nobody has good saves against poison or disease, our main spell lines for dots dd.  I would consider shrinking yourself as an option (as an ogre or troll, you're just screaming 'attack me' with your bulk, as you can be easily found and identified).<br />
<br />
Your jbb will be virtually useless in this setting simply because of the time factor needed to cast the spell and the low dmg output.  8 seconds can mean death at this level.  What will be useful are your epic, golem wands, pumice and such.  Epic for manaless damage, and the others to dispell the nasty dots and spells other casters use on you.  This is why you first cast 5 useless buffs.  Dispell those buffs by clicking on them, and now, when another person lands a spell on you, right click your pumice and dispell it.  I'd also make sure that you have a few healing potions and cure poison/disease potions handy as well.<br />
<br />
As far as spells to mem, keep up your two dots (keep disease up just in case even though it's slow), a dd, heal, cani, and malo for sure.   Possibly torpor, annul magic, maybe an ae dot or dd, spirit of cheetah, or insidious decay for your other slots.  Remember, dots and dd do 2/3 damage against other players, whether they're running at you, standing still, or running away from you.  Your debuffs drop their saves even more in pvp.<br />
<br />
Before you go to the arena, i'd suggest make a character on Rallos Zek (specifically a dark elf, high elf, or iksar as their starting zones are hell on earth) and experience the ruthlessness that is pvp.  You'll hopefully get rid of the shakes your hands go through when you first engage in combat.  <br />
<br />
Since you'll be in an arena situation, I'd focus on just surviving, rather than trying to kill people initially.  I'd lay off blasting and dotting until mid way through, focusing on healing yourself and maintaining full life and mana.  Use your epic whenever you have the chance, as it'll be your best dmg dealer when nobody is focusing their attention on you.  Never stand around, always stay on the move.<br />
<br />
When a melee class does engage you, they'll more than likely be a bluebie, so they'll still be duel wielding as opposed to jousting.  Your advantage is your speed - they have to keep you in melee range to do their damage.  Don't give them that.  Circle strafe and bard kite, or Pet kite them.  When they switch focus on the pet, malo/insidious decay and dot them to all hell.  That should get their attention back on you, and you continue running around, staying out of melee range while dog dog slowly ends their life.  Again, focus on survival, not killing everybody, so conserve your mana and life.  If they decide to leave you alone after that, I'd suggest you leave them alone as well, unless you're positive you can end them quickly and without much mana loss to yourself.  Paladins will probably give you the most trouble of all.  Attacking them is like trying to kill a warrior nearly 4 times over.  Rangers are probably the most dangerous, as their trueshot disc makes them nearly equal to any wizard.  They'll shred you up close with melee and from afar with the disc.<br />
<br />
Casters are just no fun at all, especially wizards with mana burn or epic mages.  Non epic mage and casters, key is interrupting them and killing them as quickly as possible.  If you have the initiative, lead with malo and dog dog.  Then Scourge of nife.  If they don't dispell, then just run away and stay out of casting distance.  That should end them, even with pvp nerf to damage.  If you can't evade, lay into them with melee and try to bash every chance you get.  Or just run away and heal up.  Against pet classes, never fool around with the pet first, unless it's an epic mage.  Take out the mage/necro with your dots or dd and root the pet quickly afterwards (again, not an option with epic mage pet).  Against epic mages, pray you can kill the mage quickly enough, because dog dog will last about 5 seconds against their pet.<br />
<br />
As far as who to take out first, take out anybody who is weak and not paying attention to you.  If you see two others engaged and low on life, dot the one with the most life.  Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll kill each other.  Otherwise, just try to kill obscurely and out of focus of others, preferably with your epic, and against people who are already low on life/mana to begin with.<br />
<br />
pvp itself takes forever to become very good at.  The truely skillful duelist or pvp lover has a host of little tricks that just enhance his play.  Clearing your target box, using hills and server lag to evade your foes, using special gear to take advantage of others (invis, cure disease/poison, ds, shrink, and regen potions, not to mention pet summoning items, etc), buff order, and a supreme knowledge of what others are capable of and second guessing thier moves.  This isn't very well organized, and their are a ton of better sites, but if you truly want to experience it, go to Rallos Zek.  Dueling is a poor substitute for pvp.  You'll find yourself using spells and equipment you never would have thought to be useful, not to mention develop an awareness around you that you never would have thought necessary or possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for taking the time to post that info Howler, very helpful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow very nice!<br />
<br />
ugh...mage epic pet bad news.<br />
<br />
i tried to malosini and slow a number of times and i couldn't land.:(<br />
<br />
can mage epic pet be slowed after malo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chinghis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yow, that's pretty informative, Howler.  I've just started a Shaman on a PvP server (SZ), and some of this will help. One thing - doesn't Smasherr also want to DoT himself with a weak one at the beginning?  I've heard that prevents getting Tash'd by Enchanters.  <br />
<br />
Going to go print this out now . . . I registered here just to post my thanks for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the weak DoT would have to overcome your regen to work.  So if you have a regen gear and you regrowth yourself you have to dot yourself fairly strongly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chinghis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah, thanks.  I'm way too low-level to think about that . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been in like 8 or so guild and non guild arena duels, one of my favorite things to do in EQ actually.<br />

It can basically go one of two ways...<br />
either slow and calculated, or f'n insane.<br />
If it's calculated, be patient<br />
if it's crazy, just stay out of the way<br />
<br />
Generally, you want to be undersestimated.<br />
Your power as a shaman, is going to be longevity.<br />
Work on staving alive, rather than dealing damage and you should be ok.  <br />
These things are generally judged by last man standing, which means you don't get points for killing people, just not getting killed.  I generally max my regen gear and only cast healing and life saving-utility spells (like invis and flash of light).  It's nice to be able to use the epic, but a lot of guildies get touchy about losing xp from dots when they die, so if I'm being nice, I try to minimize my dot usage.<br />
<br />
Hard nukers, like wizzies and druids will probably be taken out first because they pose the most immediate threat.  The question is, do you want to have fun, or do you want to stay alive?<br />
<br />
Generally, I like to wait til a few people are near death, then I rain evil on em, nothing like killing 3 or so at once.<br />
Or I like to open with a AOE slow and hit as many melee as I can.<br />
This tends to get way too much attention too soon, so some folks opt to wait this one out, let the melee's kill your compitition for you.  Usually, by late in the fight, when they should be going for you, most folks will be debuffed and easier to drops spells on.<br />
So slow and steady wins the race, but if you meet some jerk who thinks he's Charles Bronson, just break his nose with the butt of your spear.</div></div><hr />
