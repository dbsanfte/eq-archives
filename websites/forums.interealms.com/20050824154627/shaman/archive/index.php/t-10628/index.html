<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just read torpor will snare a mob without healing it. I have never tried this is it true? No I'm not an ebayer! I assumed it wouldn't affect an NPC in any way so never tried it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, well, try to land a heal on a mob .. call me when it worked (not charmed of course).<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">torpor is marked beneficial, cannot be cast on an NPC...charmed, pets whatever excluded of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL - don't believe what you read over in the guide and tactics section :p<br />
<br />
I'm off to kill some grass snakes now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torpor is benieficial.  You cant cast benieficial spells on NPC's.  Its the same as healing the mobs or buffing em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a shame, though.. It would be such a nice escape mechanism, if you could cast it on a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THINK about what you're saying!   Some griefer would start casting CHA spells on Orc Pawns and they'd be unkillable!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back when people could cast see invis on freeport guards....those were the days....<br />
All the ogres, trolls and dark elf SK/necro would get killed...gone are the days of simple griefing fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm i remember back in the day when the shaman epic spear dot was fooked up it ended up healing the mob for the equivalent of what the damage should been .......<br />
<br />
the mobs appeared to have SUPER regen. was especially cool regen when you cast it on yerself also.<br />
<br />
... that was beneficial and it certainly stuck to Mob_01<br />
<br />
Banth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think my post count has been nerfed .... was sure it was over 100 .... pretty good for a July '99 er Not ..... grrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Banthar<br />
<br />
The epic dot was still classed as 'Detrimental', but wasnt having a detrimental effect, thats all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On the other hand, being a beneficial spell, you can cast torpor on other players to 'aid' them at any time.  For instance, the next time a quadder runs his train through your group, torpor him.<br />
<br />
With luck he'll not know he can just click it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gonna hafta invite dat quadder inta yer groop first Crusty... den yu kill him. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Its group only? doh, I've been eyeing quadders for a month waiting for an excuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When our epic used to heal that was the most badass thing ever !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did alot of pwer leveling of alts when epic healed...would just duel my alt and keep him healed real easily</div></div><hr />
