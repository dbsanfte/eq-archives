<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started having this problem about 6 or 7 patches ago, I don't remember. But I've always been able to hit ENTER - hopefully it was on the right character. Playing on FV now, that's not a worry.<br />
<br />
But 2 patches ago (including today's patch) about 19 out of 20 tries I get there and nothing happens, thank goodness in the last week CNTRL ALT DEL works and I can close EQ. I'm sick of rebooting.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, I lock up on the Accept screen ALL the time, but if I click on the mouse, the cursor releases and I can click on ACCEPT.<br />
<br />
PC info:<br />
Win XP  -  AMD Duron  -  1.3 GHz  -  1.0 GB of ddr RAM<br />
Graphics Card - Gainward GeForce 4 PowerPack - Ultra/650 TV  -  64mb DDR  -  TV-OUT<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lecseasion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have the same problem.  I've tried clicking the mouse at the character selction screen an being finicky it works from time to time.  I still have the same issues though with my mouse locking up on the accept screen and character selection screen. :confused: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also noticed that I rarely have this problem if I remember to camp out in windows mode, therefore I come back in windows mode. <br />
<br />
But if I forget, I could be at it for 30 minutes or more, trying to get past the char select screen.<br />
<br />
So, why would anyone be insane enough to forget? Because when I log off, I'm usually really really really tired and my eyes won't stay open anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't really know if this will help, but sometimes my mouse would seem to lock up too.  I just hit SHIFT+ALT+R (or is it CTRL+ALT+R?) and it moved again.  Worth a try I suppose, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The workaround posted by Sony for the mouse locking up on the EULA accept screen is:<br />
 &quot;d&quot; , then left mouse click<br />
I have to do it about 75% of the time but it always frees up the mouse.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Disable your virus scan software? That's the tip I found on the official forums and I haven't had the problem of the &quot;stuck mouse&quot; since.<br />
<br />
NOTE: You should always restart your anti-virus software when you're done playing EQ. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This happens to me too. If you hit SHIFT + ALT + R .. you should get cursor control back. Sometimes I have to right click to get it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been fixing this by hitting ctrl+alt+de<br />
<br />
this minimizes EQ, then I click off the Windows Task Manager and click on EQ and all is well.<br />
<br />
Sounds like EQ is hanging up by losing control of the cursor to windows, and anything that returns control ( my trick, the ctrl+alt+R, etc.) does the trick</div></div><hr />
