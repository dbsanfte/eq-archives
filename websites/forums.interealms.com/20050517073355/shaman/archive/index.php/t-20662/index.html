I did not know brenlo was a dev, I always believed him to be the poor guy who only was allowed to tell us what was decided.<br />
Seems I was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SO nice that you can look at all of a persons posts.<br />

  Exluding a single post in the BEastlord forum about pet shrinking, the only class board Brenlo has posted on so far is rogue, and pretty heavily at that.   Why they gettin all the lubbins? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actualy he says he is on the dev team, that doesnt actualy make him a dev. Sounds more like he is there communication rep, not a coder or something. Not that it matters, but just pointing it out.</div></div><hr />
