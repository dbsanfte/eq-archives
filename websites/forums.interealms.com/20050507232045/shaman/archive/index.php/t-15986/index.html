<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tnit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend is quitting EQ and is giving me his account. I currently play a necro and haven't grouped much in a long long time. My friends account has a 62 shaman on it and I was wondering if someone could give me the rundown of exactly what shaman do in grouping/raiding situations. Any info would be appriciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look out!  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd do alot of reading before I play the toon, and if your in a guild consult their shammys on what they do. I would maybe try to solo some light blue mobs or even greens to just kinda get a feel for how the class is played and what skills they have. Read some hunting guides in the hunting section and ya should at least have a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lemme try this...<br />
<br />
Malo(s), Backup Heal, Rains for DPS, Dots if you're bored, CC since you should be able to take hits, Buff, Buff, Buff some more, control your pet, manage your AA's, oh and if you get bored, maybe slow a little bit ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Umm what server do you play on? And what is the Shaman's (grammar police /e banish) name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A quickie guide on how to not suck as a shaman: If you just did these minimum things you can be good enough to not suck up the place.<br />
<br />
1. Keep to the essential buffs. <br />
<br />
HP buffs: STA everyone, the extra hp adds up. FoS everyone except the cleric(use IoS on them otherwise focus overrides their self hp/mana buff combo) and beastlord(they like to do their own self hp buffing). In tier2+ zones you need the HP to survive so every little bit counts. Remember to buff yourself first so you know when the buffs are going to run out. FoS also overrides INT caster's self-hp buff but I've yet to meet one that doesn't prefer FoS so I don't bother asking them anymore if they want it.<br />
<br />
Regen: Keep replenish on yourself, the tank, any necros and whoever else might need it(like a modrodding caster). The 63 Blessing of Replenishment(group replenishment) makes life much easier. <br />
<br />
Haste: Haste the melee if no enchanter. Haste your dog first so you have it timed. There's no excuse for forgetting haste. <br />
<br />
Whatever you do keep those buffs refreshed. Don't be slacking on them. The rest of the buffs are up to you. I also keep group AGI up, group sow when available, talisman of diaku and resist buffs depending on the place you are fighting and whether there's a druid to take care of fire/cold resists. Talisman of Epuration is important against shaman/necro mobs that like to dot you. Buff CHA on bards an enchanters.<br />
<br />
2. Slowing.<br />
<br />
Your #1 job is slowing. When a pull is incoming, assist on the puller and immediately spam your malo spell. You want to malo then slow. Malo will debuff to make your slows land easier. If you don't have malo then you'll have to resort to your malosiniX line which unlike malo can be resisted. <br />
<br />
3. CC<br />
<br />
A shaman makes an excellent CCer with the combo of root + slow. Ok it's a lot more challening in tier2+ zones compared to the good ol' days of keeping 4 frogs root parked in Seb but it's still an important skill. The key is to slow first then move where you want the mob parked and then sit. Slow + sit generates huge aggro and 99% of the time the mob will come to you. Once it comes to you then you root it. Of course if those are caster mobs they'll be nuking you but it's better than nothing. Use pet to distract the rooted casters if available.<br />
<br />
4. Spot Healing.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on your cleric, make sure to keep her alive if she's being beat on. Heal a bit after battle on the casters and non-MT but let the cleric keep the MT healed. <br />
<br />
Now, if all you did was follow those easy 4 points you'd be a decent shaman just about anywhere. The rest you'll have to figure out on your own :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Step 1:  Cast focus and sta on everyone.  Regen is good too, and sometimes haste if no chanter is around.<br />
Step 2:  Cast malo on mob.<br />
Step 3:  Cast slow on mob.<br />
Step 4:  See if anyone needs a heal.  If they need one, do it.  If not:<br />
Step 5:  Do damage to the mob.  I usually just use nukes because dots can be a pain to use in groups.  Nukes, dots, and rains will all work fine.<br />
<br />
That's it.  Shaman is not a difficult class to play decently, but it takes considerable time and skill to play it very well.  Just practice and you'll get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read in a thread a couple weeks ago, but couldn't find it today.  They had the most perfect description of a shaman's job in a group.  Went something along the lines of....<br />
<br />
&quot; A shaman always watchs, 24/7 in his group, something always requires his tweaking, be it topping health bars, doing damage, replenishing his mana, rebuffing, off tanking, or crowd control.  We have been gifted with the ablity to make impossable things possable.  We do this by watching&quot;<br />
<br />
(if anyoen know where that post is, i thougth it was in the bards guide for shaman's but apparentally i was mistaken)  <br />
<br />
the problem with boxing a necro and a shaman is the micro managment, either one or the other will go slack as it doesn't have your full attention.  I've noticed it now with my low 20's necro/bst combo i've been playing on tunare, you will have to decide if the shaman will become a buff box, or your necro will turn to assist/nuke hotkeys.</div></div><hr />

My regular group recently had the opportunity to swap roles for a week.  I played a BL and some of the other guys played shaman on a rotation.  For the most part, they were frustrated by the reduction in DPS, the insistant buff requests (I screamed for FA every 10 minutes and I was PERSISTANT ... payback is a b****), one guy even loaded the wrong slow and wondered why it wasn't overwritting the BL's.  One guy was bored, so I asked what dots he was casting, he says &quot;I'm suppossed to do that too? I need more spell slots.&quot;.  I nearly died laughing.  Anyway, 3 things they learned, 1) they'll leave the shamanising to me, 2) they'll be a little easier on me about buffs (by the time they realise the buffs are gone I'm usually casting the referesh anyway), 3) they'll likely want to fill the floater spot in the group with another DPS class (they'll likely try to get a friend to bring his BL).  <br />
<br />
Shaman isn't THAT hard to play once you know your spells, stacking, timing, mana regen, balancing aggro and basically do the research.  Sometimes I still learn stuff in game about how best to play my class.</div></div><hr />
