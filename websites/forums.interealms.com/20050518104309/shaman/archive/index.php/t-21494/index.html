<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Be careful of the new interface when logging in.  In yet another dastardly marketing ploy SOE has swapped the locations of Order and Later, now positioning them as Skip and Order Omens.  If you are used to clicking the bottom right button, watch out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you accidently hit it you can always cancel it.  If I recall they don't bill it until the day the expansion launches, though the last time they did this very same thing they had thousands of pissed off customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They do it EVERYTIME ! These b&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; always try to force you to purchase their crap add on accidentally.<br />
<br />
        Each time you log , you see their pub ,so after a moment it's a reflexe to put on Later at the right side on the screen , except they will swap later and order some time ,easy way to sell isn't it ?.<br />
<br />
        to avoid that , go in EQCLIENT.INI . Search OmensOrderLastView . and change the number by 999999xxx , like per exampleOmensOrderLastView=9984302953. After this change you'll never see again the preorder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On one of my accounts hitting the order button takes you to their web page, whereas on the other account it took the order without going there. I'm not sure why, the only thing I can think of is that it is in some way related to the billing cycle (the accounts are on 1 and 3 month cycles respectively).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finally something positive from my Ubi version ... no order button  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know I didn't even notice there was a thread for this until right now, but yesterday I had posted my observation on this on the new login thread.<br />
<br />
You CAN always cancel it, yes, but dang, are they that desperate?  Is there a chance they did it just because skip would go better on the left in their opinion?  It would seem that, logically, ordering WOULD be on the left, with skip to the right...<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna bust a frontal lobe figuring it out, but it does make me sigh :( I almost hit the button by accident the other day.  I became used to clicking later every time I logged in, almost like a popup ad.<br />
<br />
That's a scary concept... in the future they'll have in-game pop up ads (complete with randomly placed order and skip buttons) for one of the 3 or 4 upcoming expansions, planned for release a month apart, popping up all over the place on your screen while you are in the middle of a raid...<br />
<br />
Maybe I shouldn't give them any ideas :) forget I said anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hahah! the wave of the future has arrived! way to go, slim!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm waiting for them to just put a port stone in PoK labled &quot;Fnersky&quot; or something cryptic like that.<br />
<br />
You click on it, and it just bills your account for the new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*guffaw*<br />
When they pulled this crap for the last expansion or two or three, I remember saying to myself &quot;why do I put UP with this crap, why don't I just cancel!?&quot;  I feel vindicated.<br />
