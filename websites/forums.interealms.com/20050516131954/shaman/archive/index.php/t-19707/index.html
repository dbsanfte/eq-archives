<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a side note, you can bring up the tribute window when you're out and about, too.  It only lets you downgrade (like ft5-&gt;ft4) or turn off tribute effects while in the field though.  Have to enable them at the tribute master.<br />
<br />
The 10 minute timer starts when you close the tribute screen at the tribute master, and pauses if you re-open it.  When the counter reaches 0, it deducts the cost for your currently active effects and starts over.  If you turn off all effects, the timer stops, but stays at it's current value, so it continues down from there when you re-enable any effects.  you can use this to work the system a little (if your timer is down low, buy something cheap and wait for it to roll over, then enable the expensive stuff), but in the long run, that's probably not really worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

I am told that Tribute mana regen counts as FT, ATK effects count towards worn ATK cap and the focus effects do not stack.<br />

The casino is sucking up plat and the tribute system is likely taking low/medium end items out of circulation. All the indicators are pointing to a massive inflation of prices. <br />
<br />
Exactly.  Low-mid range items have just become valuable to High end players with plat.  <br />
<br />
If wealth is measured by purchasing power, then for anyone who measures their EQ wealth by the amount of plat in the bank, they just became less wealthy.<br />
<br />
Yantis/IGE should do well.<br />
<br />
BTW.  My ranger forages bookworms and gives them to guildies for fishing.  They are worth 1150 tribute points  each :eek:</div></div><hr />

Its not a rumor.  You can turn in Animated Bait for 1150 points each.  Its a tradeskill item that requires a tinkering skill of 28 and about 3 cp of materials, both of which are sold on the same vendor in PoK.<br />
<br />
A guildy turned in 40 stacks of baits and now has over 1m points banked, but GMs permakilled the tribute guys this evening on Xegony.<br />
<br />
There were lots of items like this tho; I turned in 40 shivs (worthless crap drop from mobs in Dulak) for 1123 points each.  I also turned in a JB helm for about 750.  So basically, the value-to-point ratio is way wacked at this point.<br />
<br />
Edit: apparently, in the beta, you could only turn in platinums for tribute points, not items.  With the live rollout, they added the ability to also turn in items, which is what got them into trouble.<br />

Tribute Masters taking a break<br />
Your local tribute masters are taking a short vacation.  It seems that after only two days of collecting tribute and granting favor, they are already worn out.  They will also be in closed door discussions, at their secret retreat, to re-evaluate the amount of favor granted for items.  Look for them to return prior to this weekend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">While shivs and other items like that might be a bit off I'm pretty sure what got the gnomes killed is the animated bait. Being able to buy items up cheaply in the bazaar and get lots more tribute points isn't actually a probably. It's more of an indication that lower end items have become extremely under valued. <br />
<br />
I don't expect the tribute system to do much directly to effect inflation, the casino will do much better at that. I don't expect many people to ever give much in the way of cash to tribute masters. I expect that it will always be items but I expect that alot of low to mid end items will rise in price to be closer to thier tribute value and you won't get things where you get 20 or 30 time or more in tribute value compaired to plat cost. The one way I do expect it to effect inflation is less items will be sold to a vendor by higher end players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lively debate going on over on my guild messageboard on just this issue.  Currently, we have mostly concluded that, at most, they will probably cap the maximum favor at 100k or so.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I'm sure that lots of Plat and low end items got removed from the game last night never to be seen again. The points that were received from them will also be removed. This should revalue the low end items a bit and strip some plat out of the game which should drive down inflation a bit.<br />
<br />
Expect them open the flood gates with exploits and shut down the tribute masters again a few more time to get some more 'balancing' of the ecomony achieved. Then they'll finally get it right.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to get a bunch of stuff out of the ecomony, then taking a bunch of stuff and wiping out the points several times would work. Sounds like this may be 'working as intended' if you know what i mean ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>dashuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Several Comments have been made saying the Tribute system will not reduce the amount of Plat in the economy.  I disagree, even though the items are not actually Plat they represent Plat.  It took Plat to make them or buy them.  Once they are gone, in essense, so is the Plat.<br />
<br />
Both the Casino and the Tribute system provides the means of reducing the Money supply.  In RL this is the Govts Job.  If you notice, both the Casino and the Tribute return to you consumable items.(Casino foods mostly and potions,  the Tribute gives buffs which expire)<br />
<br />
IMO this should begin to balance the Economy and restore the value of the Plat.  As less Plat. is available bazaar prices should drop as no one will have the excess we currently have.<br />
<br />
PS.  For those who buy Plat in RL, I believe it will be for the casino use.  Again it will disappear.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes and No. Items are only plat to the extent that vendor will buy them for. Any value beyond that isn't. Realitsically alot of these items are still in the economy simply because thier value is next to nothing to vendors and people still want to try and get 75pp instead of 5 pp for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't mind them adjusting the rewards, but it sure would suck for them to just zero my tribute out and have lost all my platinum and time for their goof up they didn't even beta test.  I think the 100k cap might be a good comprimise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">About inflation...<br />
<br />
Casino will remove vast amounts of platinum out of the market.  In isolation this would cause deflation (negative inflation).  People have less money in their pockets to buy that Obulus Death Shroud therefore will not buy.  Mr Vendor who's trying to sell the ODS will think &quot;***, why isn't this selling?&quot;  And reduce his price.  Prices will go down until people start buying again.  It's called the &quot;invisible hand&quot; in economics (iirc!).<br />
<br />
Tribute system will remove vast amounts of low to mid-end items.  In isolation this will reduce the number of low to mid-end items making them rarer on the open market.  Vendors will be able to sell their Black Alloy Medallions at higher prices since they have fewer competitors when attempting to sell it.  Buyers will have to pay more for them since there are so few available.  This is also called the &quot;invisible hand&quot;.<br />
<br />
In combination these two changes will...   uhm...  I figure reduce the prices of high-end items and increase prices of mid to low end items.  Don't quote me on that tho.  This is on the assumption that higher end items will NOT be turned into tribute NPCs.<br />
<br />
My economics classes are far in the past, perhaps people still working or studying it can enlighten us further or correct me if I'm wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">just guessing, I think if they adjust prices, low end items won't flood the bazaar as much and will have alot more reasonable prices, yet making it more expensive for a noob/twink to equip.  If your green silken drape no longer sells at 45p but sells at 300p, its more expensive for the caster, but 300p isn't outlandish, someone could earn or trade up to that quite easily, especially with all the high levels that poop that much plat every couple hours.<br />
<br />
Also, I think that there will end up being some sort of unspoken transfer rate, maybe 3 tribute for 1plat.  Perhaps alot of low end gear will go up in the bazaar as 'tribute' items, meant only for tribute or maybe someone's poor alt or noob toon.  Having 80% or more of your population with full time tributes isn't exactly game imbalancing, since the tributes give you effects you can loot anyway, like focus and ft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
Moreover, the focus effects are not the best; in fact, they are mostly not an upgrade for anyone in or past VT.<br />
<br />
I suspect that most ubers will use them mainly for that one focus they are missing or maybe for buffing resists just a bit more.  Most of us will also get another 75 HPs or so too, by replacing those 1-2 crappy items everyone seems to carry around just for the focus effect (e.g. Ceramic Shield of Valor, etc.)<br />
<br />
Interestingly, I found that the focus benefits overwrite the focus on any items you are wearing.  I have a haste of mithanial item, which usually takes gate down to 3.8 seconds; with Spell Haste 4 tribute buff up, it went up to 4 seconds.  So, another bug in the tribute system.  Big surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">This will hurt low level players, who rely on the bazaar to outfit themselves.  Many items selling for 300pp but with unusually large tribute values are gone.  Witness the Greatstaff of Thunder, for example.  There used to be dozens of these available in the bazaar at any time, for a couple hundred plat.  Last night there was one, for 8k.  The Ayonae Ro bazaar last night and this morning was startlingly empty of these types of items.  I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing.  But twinks or true newbies won't have access to as much nice gear for as little money as before.  <br />
<br />
A ton of those items were already destroyed by the tribute system.  And many come from areas that aren't hunted much any more.  So those items have almost been effectively removed from the game.  Some will show up again over time, if the tribute value is reduced considerably on them.  The greatstaff of thunder, for example, will probably show up again because it drops from the planes.  <br />
<br />
This feels like a typical SOE ploy.  Just like prior expansions, there's always a &quot;too good to be true&quot; bug.  People rush out and buy the expansion just to take advantage.  The bug is fixed shortly thereafter.  <br />

This feels like a typical SOE ploy.  Just like prior expansions, there's always a &quot;too good to be true&quot; bug.  People rush out and buy the expansion just to take advantage.  The bug is fixed shortly thereafter.  <br />

Hmm... so what you're telling me is, if a player wants something worth using, they've got to go hunt for one themselves... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">lol yeah I agree with Yhakfiend. I didn't start playing till just after velious but even then you couldn't get the quality of gear you can now as cheaply. Hopefully the system will get tweaked a little and put back in use. And then we can see people actually working to get better gear instead of just farming plat to buy stuff.</div></div><hr />

On AB you can triple the selling price on anything with &quot; Bez &quot; on it so let that settle down before your assesments begin. With the servers going down, exploit plat, new class, tribute and high end gear hoarders the bazar has been fubar on AB for months now.</div></div><hr />

Funny how exciting it was starting my first character after a 2 year break and finding a +2 wis item or getting the drop for some newbie armor quest...ahh, the good ole days before I found the internet sites and the bazaar.   :p <br />
<br />
PS:  yes, I still have a lot of fun playing this game...just sometimes I miss the newness aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I just checked a few things with new Tribute Masters.  I find it odd how most of what I checked junk to nicer items seemed to match the bazaar prices with in a few 100plat.  I think the exception was MithMar Belt at 17K which is overpriced on Xegony at 30K+.<br />
<br />
Do you think that the game could be using a system to check the prices for droppable items in the bazaar to set the tribute range?  Nawh it couldn't be could it?</div></div><hr />

Heh if so, it could be pretty easily duped...  Get 400 foraged crappy items.  Put one up for sale in the bazaar for a crazy price, and then turn in the rest :)<br />
<br />
Maybe they use the average price over time or something.  But still could be duped by selling something that people don't bother selling, thus you are the only one selling, thus you are setting the average.  Leave it up for sale for a couple weeks then do turn ins.<br />
<br />
I hope they're not doing this :)<br />
<br />
Would be a smart thing to do, yet not so smart.<br />
<br />
Unless they're checking for the average price things are SOLD in the bazaar...  Mind you my alts on my second accounts could be buying my crap items over and over...<br />
<br />
Hmm...<br />
<br />
Interesting theory :)  I'm gonna have to go sell a foraged rare item for 10k and see what happens :)</div></div><hr />

If that's how they are doing it, I'd hope the calculation excluded outliers, but you never know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">From what I could tell Sal, most foraged or TS components were not accepted.  I think that the value maybe an average not just over time but over servers.  Isn't there a site &quot;EQecon?&quot; or such that uses such a program?<br />
<br />
I checked some Acrylia leather<br />
Tunic was a bit over 1k (maybe 1200) and pants were a bit under.  The Bazaar pretty closely reflected the same.<br />
What got me wondering was that the mask and belt and such sell for much less than the tunic, pants or cape.  My view is that if they are logging all these values in by hand there has to be some sheet that gives relative value like +10 tribute point for every point of Wis and 10 points for each item necessary for combine or some such. You understand what I mean kind of like the score system we have on a thread that was in the equipment section.  If they were using some sort of guideline like this I would expect the Acrylia masks to be a couple of hundred points not 30 or so.  <br />
<br />
I just can't help shake the notion that the tribute values I have seen seem to mirror the player set values.  Or I would expect the tribute value of player made items to be the same or a multiple of what NPC vendors buy the items for but that does not seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
Tae Ew tunic was 6K tribute the only one for sell at the time in Bazaar was listed at 6K.  Ring of Exaulted Freedom was 3K, none were on Xegony at the time but they usually go for 2.5-3K.  Same with the Light Chain arms that old Piklo(sp?) also drops.  They go for 12K when you can find them and 12K was offered for them.  I bought my Ceramic Shield for 8K quite a few months ago, they go for over 15K now and what was the tribute on the shield? 17K!<br />
<br />
I grabbed some other player made junk like Northman ring.  Bazaar listed for 100pp, tribute was higher at 150pp but still fairly close.<br />
<br />
I could be adding 2+2 and getting 5 but the devs have to have a method of assessing tribute values and there are only so many interns who are willing to type away for day without food and water to do it by hand.  Kind of fun to speculate all the same.</div></div><hr />

I knew someone would come up with a sarcastic comment about my post.  My intent was not to complain about this - my own personal gear can't be upgraded much by the bazaar, at this point.  I was simply making an observation.  <br />
<br />
Many of you seem to think there are no true newbies.  I'll grant you, there aren't many.  But try getting a pickup group to go to Upper Guk for monk mesh armor.  If you're a true newbie, that's the best you can get for a while.  Try being a true newbie magician and getting a pickup group to go to Najena to camp for the focus item drops from the Temple of Sol Ro quests.  When we did those quests, there were thousands of newbies just like us.  I remember camping Najena when j-boots still dropped there.  The zone would have 20-40 people all the time.  Now it's completely empty 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
These lower-level zones are empty; you simply can't find pickup groups there.  And how many guilds actually recruit low-level newbies?  Not many.  If you're actually new to this game, it's not easy to outfit yourself, especially if you have enough self respect to not run around begging for &quot;stuff&quot;.  Some changes to the game mechanics have made it easier on newbies, but the dearth of other players at that level, untwinked, make it extremely tough to progress.  The bazaar helped compensate for that, by making good low-level gear affordable.  Much of that disappeared down the tribute toilet.<br />

Funny, I thought this was a MMORPG. I seem to recall people buying things the summer of release. I guess unless you personally solo the mob and loot it, you didnt earn it?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I pity any untwinked person trying to level these days. How many 200hp level 8 warriors do you think get groups?  Mudflation allowed for new players to at least have a SHOT of joining an exp group. When I leveled my sk using a minotaur axe back in the day, she could get groups. There were no fungi clad monks with a sofw soloing the entire zone.<br />
Remove cheap gear availability, and you royally hose the newby in comparison, which stifles new blood into the game, and can ultimately hurt EQ in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">This is the first step by SOE in making shaman buffs useless at ALL levels of play by capping everyones stats.<br />
<br />
Next up is the availability of tribute hirelings that follow you around casting Turgurs whilst gleefully cackling 'I love SOE! Who wants buffs?'. Lets every shaman concentrate on cybering in follow mode. Even better for everyone else who can take the shaman off ignore.<br />
<br />
In the final step every angry and disillusioned shaman can trade in spent AA points from the following skills: rabid bear, call of the ancients and spirit call 4+ for special rewards. Rewards include prefabricated feedback and/or messageboard posts flaming SOE about the state of the shaman class (so you can keep up the cyber), economy size packs of Prozak, and preorders for the next expansion: Halls of Mitigation.<br />
<br />
Quite brilliant if you ask me.</div></div><hr />
