<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone got a chance to check out the new hate yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not yet Lum some people talked about it last night but we where hitting other targets instead. I did my &quot;virgin&quot; hate run for my first and last time on old hate on Monday night. It was nice to see it at least once before I would never have a chance to see it again. New hate will be fun to explore, it'd be interresting to see if they actually made it that much harder and upped the xp bonus on it to meet with PoP T1 at least, and/or changed the spawn rate, how it works in general as a zone.... or whether they just changed the geometry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Julliette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We took 3 groups up there.  Zone is much nicer setup, mobs lvls increased for more exp, and Maestro is much tougher.  You can also zone in safely now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Knibble Megentlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes Lum we did. Was rather nice zoning in and people not screaming NO SITTING&lt;STAY OFF THE WALLS.etc.<br />
Maestro had his way with us.*revenge I say*;)</div></div><hr />
