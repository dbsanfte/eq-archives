<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aziz Al'Qadir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.....<br />
<br />
Have been thinking of this and did not want to post, but - what the heck.<br />
<br />
I am looking ofr a new robe...  Have had my SMR for eons and have been after a Bonecaster robe forever.<br />
<br />
If you have one, want to go get one with me, please let me know. Would be happy to buy at a fair price ifn ya want to sell.<br />
<br />
Currently I am trying to scrap up some money to buy one in NFP, but the cost is high and will take me quite a while. Besides - I hate camping items just so I can sell...  is really no fun.<br />
<br />
Anywho - let me know....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You may want to consider a Tola robe (10int 50 mana 50 hp 30%haste).  If you could find a rogue in one of the big guilds who needs an smr for there epic.  You'd be set.  Tola robes are pretty coming and seem to be the &quot;booby&quot; prize for Trak raids.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Nindalf....   I was approached yesterday and am now a proud owner of a new Tola robe!<br />
<br />
Wooooo!  I loved the SMR, but have had that ever since I was level 40 in LGuk (which seems like eons ago).<br />
<br />
My robe is going to aid a Rogue in his persuit of his Epic along with a bonus - I had a spare Oracle robe in the bank that I gave in the trade....  8)<br />
<br />
Thanks again guys...  I am still stunned....</div></div><hr />
