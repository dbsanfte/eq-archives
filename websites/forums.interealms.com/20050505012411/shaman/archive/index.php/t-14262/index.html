<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With new dot reporting here is the exact dmg done by epic... i couldnt help but log in to check :P<br />
<br />
11 + 23 + 35 + 47 + 59 + 71 + 83 + 95 + 107 + 119 + 131 + 143 + 155 +167 + 179 = 1425 dmg in 1.4min for a dps of 16.9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL - that was the 1st thing I did, too.  Actually 1 tick longer than I'd believed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone else notice the formula?<br />
<br />
(N*12)-1<br />
<br />
Where N = number of ticks since landed.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the exact damage was already known from back when they messed up the effect and it actually healed instead of damaging  (so you could cast it on yourself as an increasing heal, and determine the amount healed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok..calculating epic + BoN = around 56dps according to your numbers..now what does alpha-enhanced pet contribute? Without procs of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I noticed something as well.. With bane of nife and coldain military bracer I was getting 8 and 9 ticks of bane damage.. Always thought before you were lucky to get one extra tick with extended affliction 3......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If we assume that spell durations are handled by the server in seconds rather than ticks - 20% extra on the base 42 seconds for Bane of Nife gives 50.4 seconds. Round this down to 50 seconds.<br />
<br />
Now also assume that the &quot;ticks&quot; all happen at the same time. By this I mean, the first tick of damage of a DoT will not happen 6 seconds after you cast it, it will happen when the server schedules the next tick, which could be anything from 0 to 5.9 seconds after you cast the spell.<br />
<br />
So if you cast the spell 1 seconds before the next tick is due, the ticks of damage will happen at these intervals into the duration of the spell: 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49 and then the spell will wear off at 50 seconds. That's 9 ticks of damage.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm only guessing it may work this way. If the server keeps track of spell durarions in ticks rather than seconds, you should always get (7 * 1.2) = 8.4 ticks from an extended affliction bane of nife, presumably rounded down to 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think your assumptions are correct i have noticed the same, and spell data isn't written in ticks its actually in seconds. well according to lucy and they pull straight from the spelldata its always in seconds/mins/hrs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just because Lucy displays a number in seconds doesn't mean that they don't merely convert ticks to seconds before displaying it on the page for us to read :)<br />
<br />
In fact if you look at the Lucy data for Bane of Nife, it IS in ticks. http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1590&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
But really the issue is not how the spell duration is stored in the data file, it's how the server handles it internally. I did a bit of testing last night and I was always getting 9 ticks fom Bane (with EAIII item). Which brings it in at over 2000 damage, not bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Although, having just read a similar discussion in another thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14251) it seems the Extended Affliction item is not as good as we thought.<br />
<br />
Turns out that Bane of Nife actually lasts 8 ticks with no focus items, rather than 7. So EAIII really does get us only 1 extra tick :(<br />
<br />
Although the overall effect is the same, Bane still does over 2k damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And the exact damage was already known from back when they messed up the effect and it actually healed instead of damaging  (so you could cast it on yourself as an increasing heal, and determine the amount healed).<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember when they did that ... everyone was complaining about it the first couple days ...<br />
<br />
Me, I was quietly in duel mode with a monk down in sebilis shrooms / ilis duo'ing everything we could find with no downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I so didn't believe this when someone told me it (epic healing).  I totally thought he was pulling my leg.  I took a couple/few months off from EQ when this happened.  When I came back, he fed me this line.  Turns out it was true.  I soo missed out!<br />
Anyways, it would seem that with the plague dot with a longer duration would be more likely to get two extra ticks.  Of course that's only 55hp/tick, so big deal.  It'd be easier to figure out if they just upped the damage it did by 15% rather than duration by 15%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I believe that the dot damage kicks in 6 seconds after cast, i.e. not on the server's tick boundary.  I say this based on when I see the first damage report message - if it were on the server boundary, then occasionally you'd see the first tick of damage 1 second after the DOT landed.<br />
<br />
If this is true, that means that by timing the tick you could conceivably get one extra tick of damage, but it'd be damned hard to time it right because you'd have to take the cast time into account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think you're wrong weissblau - for the simple reason that if you cast several DoTs on a target, all the damage messages occur together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aye Grippa is right, if you have the DoT messages on this becomes very apparent since if you finish casting a new dot just before the old ones hit the target, new one hits almost immediately upon landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So now someone needs to figure out the dps off all our dots stacked at the same time =)</div></div><hr />
