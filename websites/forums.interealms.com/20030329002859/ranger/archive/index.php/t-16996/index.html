<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mezrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know the new percentages for a chance to crit with CF2 and CF3. I know in Celt's original post they were 2.5 and 3 percent where CF1 gave 2 percent. A few months ago they had a patch that was suppose to fix that. Now I heard they are 2,4,7 percent respectivly but that was just from asking a friend online. <br />
<br />
I have CF1 and like it but if my melee crits barely go up I would postpone CF2/3 till after EQ/AM3. As of now I have CF1 and MC2 for my archtype AAs and one point banked so I'm either gonna get CF2 or ND1/CA1 for my last 4 points before class.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows for sure from parsing or a respectable source could you please post.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if its any help to you but CF3 is suppose to give you the same crit-rate as a non-CFed Warrior /Shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mdbrown1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went straight through CF1,CF2,CF3.  I use eqcompanion for dmg parsing.  From my observations the crit rate with melee weapons was 1%/2%/3% respectively.  I had a fighting dex of 219 through the majority of my observations.  I haven't shot enough archery to test the crit rate with bows but it seems to be significantly higher.  I'd guess more on par with the 2%/4%/7% Maybe even higher.  I got Endless Quiver now so over time I'll be able to get a better crit rate with bows for CF3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mezrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So CF1 is 1% and CF2 is 2% thats not bad 4aa to double my crits and will help with archery later. CF3 will have to wait though with only 1% more incresed chance for 6aa. <br />
I don't have EQ yet so i'm only interested in melee damage right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got CF2,3 and Fury of the Ages1 now in raw ... critical rate went up significantly. Cant tell you %age, because dont use parser, but 5 900ish criticals in raw is something i didnt see with CF1 before and mainly ist what I really enjoy. Its of course rare. On the other side 3 criticals in 5 hits is not rare, more like common</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mezrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was still thinking of the best way to spend my last 4 AAs to unlock class. (Ihave MC2 and CF1).<br />
I have come up with 2 options.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that the way I exp mostly is on lvl 49 and below NPCs that I fear kite, so FB1 should reduce my kill time by cutting out the last 10 percent of their health (well not really but it can) and I would get ND1 which would give me 50hp. Or I could get CF2 with my last 4 points and crit almost twice as often (melee). CF2 would help DPS a little in every situation but I think FB1 would help DPS more only in my current exp situation.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finishing Blow becomes utterly worthless once you start XPing in PoP - I'd skip it and focus on Natural Durability.  I wish I could get the 2 points I put into FB back.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elnil Everstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I disagree on FB as it's only 2 points and it works so often and would work more if I had a lower delay weapon in main hand. (using both epics most of hte time atm)<br />
<br />
Instead of MC2, i put my points into CF1, FB1, MC1, CA1, CS1, and SCF1.  I now have to go back and put 2 points into ND1 and get PE for 5 after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lasalle Stormreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Mezrax, good to see you posting on the Glade.  Were you ever bonked?<br />
<br />
/BONK<br />
<br />
First time I ever bonked a guildmate!  <br />
<br />
Hehehe anyways, as I advised you on www.epic-heroes.com, go with CF, it won't let ya down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Finishing Blow *never* goes off once you progress to the planes, as every mob there is too high in level to be affected.  Healing Gift 1 is far more entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elnil Everstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In Teir 1 planes, and other soloing places, FB goes off alot.  I probably avg as much as 4 times an hour with only FB1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">However, once you hit level 63, anything that was FB-able becomes green or light blue. How often will you be fighting those things and will FB continue to be worth it after 63?<br />
<br />
I bought it back in the day, and I wish I had my points back now. It wasn't even all that great when it did work for me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elnil Everstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a reason I stopped leveling at 60 in order to farm AA until I need the levels more than the AA.  When I do, I will only go to 62 until such time as I need to level again.<br />
<br />
This leaves most areas open for EXP solo or in a group, such as sebilis, velks, FG, all of luclin, etc.<br />
I spend a majority of my time in POP, but I don't want to be limited to getting exp there, ... yet.<br />
<br />
I'm sure once I get used to an AA in 90 mins or less in tier 2 and higher, I'll probably then make the levelling jump :P<br />
<br />
It was only 2 points for FB1, and it will still work for me for a while more.</div></div><hr />
