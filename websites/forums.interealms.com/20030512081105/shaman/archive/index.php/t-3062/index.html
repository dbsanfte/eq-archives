<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haggus of Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if Emperor Chottal runs when low on health if his pet is still alive?  I know many kunark mobs do not, hoping the same is true for the emp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ooh, this is a good question, I have been in a crypt group like 5 times, but I think i DO remember him running when his pet was _mezzed_, not sure if the pet was just rooted or not whther he would run</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">whats the spawn rate on this guy? i know his PH is on ~30min timer but does he spawn every other PH or what? rough estimate is helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, he will always run when low health...<br />
<br />
As for how many PH between spawns is very random, seen as many as 5 PH before him...or 3 emp in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">25 minutes......25...long minutes on respawn.</div></div><hr />
