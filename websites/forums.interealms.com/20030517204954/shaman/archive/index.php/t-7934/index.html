<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jheal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Im new to the class but not EQ.  So far I have played a Cleric and a Rogue to the upper levels.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to mostly solo my way to the 40's to catch up to some guildmates for grouping.  I'm trying to keep all my skills up, as I know thats important.  I chose a lot of Hp gear because it helps in the lower levels and will serve me when I can Cann.  Right now im using an FBSS because at level 12 l do most of my damage meleeing. Question is; at what levels should I ditch this for something else when meleeing wont be so important?<br />
<br />
Also I saw that most folks are using the 6 ac 65 hp rings over a Shadel bandit ring ( 6 ac 55 hp 55 mana) just wondering if thats a choice or an issue of availibility.<br />
<br />
thanks for your time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">shadel bandit rings are preferable to 6/65's, they are just rarer and more expensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haste is a good thing.  Once you hit 30 look for a deal on a Barbarian Spiritists Hammer.  It is a 2hb 22/47 hammer that procs the same DD as the JBB bracer, you will mow thru levels 30-45 or so with it.  Prices in the bazaar vary from 500-3500 or so, just hang out until you see someone looking to unload one for less than 1k.<br />
<br />
For pure speed of leveling forsake wis and mana for HP/AC without question.  Once you hit 30 and especially 34 when you get your dog dog, you will feel like you are being powerleveled with that hammer.<br />
<br />
Just buff up HP/AC/Dex (&amp; use the self only fury line as well) and you Dex should be over 150.  With Dex over 150 I consistently proc'd a couple times a fight (usually more if the mob lasted long enough) and with Self Haste &amp; SCHW I was swinging a heck of alot.<br />
<br />
If you can swing it, use the SCHW over the FBSS, no AC on the FBSS and using SCHW opens up the Waist slot for a Spider Fur belt which gives good AC and 40hp.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and I melee'd with great success to where I am now, which is 47, so dont look to give up your haste anytime soon...<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On my server, 6Ac65hp rings are about 500plat. Shadel Bandit rings are about 5000plat - nobody &quot;chooses&quot; the former, they just cant afford the latter.<br />
<br />
Just a wee suggestion - using your higher laevel main, and your low level twink, why not do the Kromriff Military leggings quest and the Coldain military bracer quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jheal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for all of your advice, very helpful.  This &quot;bloody twink&quot; :)  is having a blast and also gaining new respect for the class, I never realised how busy you all are!  Buff this, slow that, heal them....  can't they make that darn regen spell last a little longer !<br />
<br />
I'm assuming the Barb Spirit hammer that was mentioned starts to proc at 30?  I borrowed a friends,  Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, and really enjoy the speed of it atm.  So now I have to make another choice;<br />
<br />
Keep the Fang that will proc 80dd with a delay of 19.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Look for and buy the hammer that procs 230dd delay 44.<br />
<br />
Im inclinded to keep the fang, as I have it, and its twice as fast, and allows me to use a shield.  However the hammer proc does 3 times the damage and procs at 30 while the fang wont until 35...<br />
<br />
So what do you all think?<br />
<br />
Also shadel rings sell for les than 1k on CT server... its always interesting how the server economys can differ.<br />
<br />
thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfgang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I took my Shaman out of retierment a few weeks ago at lvl 22....forgeting he had a REIF...lol.  I Usually play my main Rogue...and witha  few plat...I hooked up my shaman a bit.<br />
<br />
With the REIF, SCHW and his haste spell I'm a poking SoB...lol..<br />
<br />
I'm 41 now and use Shissar scale gloves, but carry my SCHWs with me for when it's melee time...when i'm soloing.<br />
<br />
I opted for the SCHW casue they are affordable...about 3500p  and I can get a way better AC/HP/Wis Belt than I can get a AC/Wis/HP Gloves...so I'd ratehr swap out my Gloves for a haste item than my belt slot...but, again, I only do it once and awhile now.<br />

<br />
Yes, hammer procs at 30.  I have a suggestion and a gurantee for you.  Find a good deal on the Barbarian Spiritists Hammer when you hit 30 and give it a test run for 5 levels until you hit 35.  I can altmost gurantee you will put the REIF back in the bag after one fight you will miss the BSH so much, hehe.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have never owned a REIF so I am very, very biased towards the BSH. With the haste you have and self haste spells you will be swinging the hammer at (47/1.21)/1.30 (you may have to correct my haste formula but that is approximately correct) which comes out to a 22/30 weapon or thereabouts.  The hammer will hit on normal hits for ~50 or so with a high in the 60s PLUS the huge proc....its magic I tell ya, absolute magic, hehe.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and keep us updated on your decision!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jheal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks again, I will give that hammer a try, now if I can only find a few water mellons to practice on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have the icewurm fang myself and have to admit I like to use 2hb weapons too but when it comes to damage that 12/19 with our haste and dex buffs ussually wins out. In a good fight I have had the proc go off 6 or 7 times and hit in the mid 40's but I do have 200 offense and 200 pierce skill where my 2hb is just around 130.  the extra 25 ac and 40 hps from the sheild I can use with the fang is nice too. =)<br />
<br />
Not to totally ignore thee origional topic but I have never acctually had a haste item just always self hasted.  I did melee from about level 1 through my 20's then switched to root dotting and when I got my 2nd pet I started to just slow/melee mobs.  Now at 49 I am looking to go back to root dotting(have maxed my defense and offense) with the two new dots I just gained.  So a decent haste item sure would have helped at the lower levels probably would still have been useful once ya get your first pet.  but at my level now I am looking more towards getting ac/hp gear and trying to get my hands on a iksar bp(trying to camp it with help) and the things on the top of my list to acctually pay pp for are a Amulet of insight and a earring of the solstice.  I have considered picking up a horse also and also am thinking in a few levels on going to Seb and try to get a roll on a Ob shroud.<br />
<br />
Well I tend to ramble so hope I gave some decent feedback on it.</div></div><hr />
