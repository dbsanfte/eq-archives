<br />
My guild wiped again last night.<br />
No big deal.  We dust ourselves off &amp; we try again, or regroup to ponder what went wrong if we aren't ready to sally forth right away.  Last night could have been different if we'd had a few key people alive for a little longer.  We decided to call it a night.  I went to bed a bit disappointed but w/ caffeine still racing in my veins, and thought this up in bed. <br />
<br />
 I wanted to toss this idea out to my fellow shaman for peer critique/review.<br />
<br />
My initial impression is this would be a situational tactic for small/medium size guilds used for key people only.  What about using a double &quot;Call of the Hero&quot; system for saving key people's lives when manpower is short?<br />
<br />
What I'm thinking is if there is a situation where there is only one shaman, and the key to downing the mob is slowing it and quarters are tight.  The shaman finally lands Turgur's (or PoI/Tigir's, whichever) and of course gets fatal aggro that isn't worth a CH rotation's mana to save the one life (especially since the shaman's main job is now likely done).<br />
<br />
What about parking a mage (hot-boxed even better for this one) IN the zone but far away w/ COTH loaded &amp; charged, &amp; shaman targetted.  This mage is in a safe area free from aggro, probably across the zone, but definitely well out of aggro range of the rest of the raid party and any mobs they might be fighting.  (Like ToV zone-in.)<br />
<br />
Before the shaman casts slow, the first mage begins casting CoTH.  Shaman casts slow.  IF it lands, the shaman immediately hotkeys for CoTH (remember the casting is already in progress) to be completed.  IF it fails, hotkeys for &quot;Interrupt&quot; (to the mage) and recasts slow.  Upon interrupting, the mage recasts CoTH as soon as gem refreshes again.   If too many slow attempt failures occur (drawing fatal aggro again from the attempts), the CoTH cast can go through to completion anyway.  Shaman aggro is pretty obvious. :D<br />
<br />
Immediately after the first CoTH, the second mage (not boxed &amp; involved in the battle as a caster) casts CoTH to bring the SAME shaman BACK into the battle, only now with aggro gone and all hate lists for the shaman completely wiped.  Shaman can re-commence trying to slow, or if it landed originally, can now aid with poking, dots,epic,JBB,back-up heals, etc.  Not to mention being available for adds.<br />
<br />
My example uses a shaman, but it could be used for clerics as well.  Obviously it requires some good communication skills, low lag for the mages, and excellent timing.<br />
<br />
So the COTH group could be:<br />
Mage1<br />
Cleric1<br />
Cleric2<br />
Cleric3<br />
Shaman<br />
Mage2<br />
<br />
This brings the key person(s) back into battle with little to no downtime.  The first CoTHing Mage could even have a mod rod in hand ready to hand-off to the CoTHee!  Druids can keep the key person alive with Chloroblast/Sup Heals until the COTH goes through if the few seconds of aggro is likely to crush the COTHee.<br />
<br />
That's my little brainstorm.<br />
All feedback appreciated.  Is there a giant hole in the plan that's obviously not visible to me?  Does this sound like a hare-brained scheme doomed to failure or a viable tactic for limited use?  <br />
<br />
All feedback appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, kinda nice group for the modrod/Torpor-twitch if necessary, you have all the heavy modrodders in one group to Torpor.  It's kinda similar to using a bard and a mage in a group for pulling POG.  It just requires both mages to be on the ball.  Of course, some unslowed mobs could kill you out so fast that COTH could possibly not go off in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting idea but I would say a little unnecessary.  If your dying that much from *slowed* mobs then all you need to do is shoot your local pally or sk a tell when slow lands.  Have them ready to grab aggro quick.<br />
<br />
In HoT for example, last time we were there I got aggro once I think, maybe twice, and usually have the mob slowed by the time its at 95, sometimes 90 or 85, sometimes just under 100.  What I do is:<br />
<br />
Malo as soon as the mt engages, even start casting it on the pull (if your sure theres only 1) and land it the split second after the mt engages.  Then start a malosini/slow chain.  Many times malosini wont land the first time (as chanters tend to wait for tash) but by the time the mob is down a couple percent (or 5 say), tash lands and by then your casting slow.  Bang slow lands, no aggro as the mobs down a good 5-7 (or 10) percent.  Once CH has gone by but no biggy.  Your alive and up to assist heal and guaranteed ready to slow the next mob thats pulled.<br />
<br />
ID and POI are a different story as they have insane aggro.  You can get aggro for a good while halfway through the fight sometimes :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
No enchanter, bard or bst?<br />
If you had to create a double coth just to save the shaman, i think you'd probably get more value out of working on aggro control.<br />
<br />
Timing is a key point for any scale raid and the best way to get that down is through practising in different situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Darjeeling,<br />
<br />
Actually, no bards and no bsts is pretty typical for my guild on many raids.<br />
<br />
We have 3 bards.  One is mostly retired (probably in wrist braces), one has connectivity issues (can't seem to stay on more than 10-15min), and the 3rd is only 51.<br />
<br />
We have no Beastlords of significance.<br />
<br />
We have 4 enchanters, but even the 60 is rather squishy.  The others are all low-mid 50's, and flatten rather fast, even w/ Rune5 &amp; best buffs available to them.  They do a great job at cc, but slowing tends to make them a stain on larger encounters.  Me too for that matter if I don't land Turgur's or time it just right. :p  (Remember, no Malo/Torpor available.  We just had a mage get Mala last week!)  My getting squished isn't a problem most of the time.  I usually survive the beatings or try to prevent them with good timing of debuff/slow attempts.<br />
<br />
I am the only actively raiding shaman &amp; only 57 at that.  We have 3 other Shaman, but they are all mid-upper 40's.  They get alot of my old gear. :p  (Rather pathetic that it may be.)  My unbuffed AC just recently cleared the 900 benchmark.  Personal funds virtually non-existant due to recent spell purchases.  (Still missing Malo/Torpor.)<br />
<br />
So I'm really all there is for slowing w/o calling for outside help.  Our guild uses tactics instead of #'s to overcome encounters where possible.  We've done things I was told wasn't possible considering our size/#'s.  But our size does bring us limitations.<br />
  <br />
<br />
I was thinking in certain situations it might be better off to get the slow in SOONER &amp; coth out/in (especially since we have a strong minority of players who hotbox) instead of holding up the raid while my rez effects and mana are back.  Or even in a situations where I'm going to survive by gettin propped up by runes and heals it isn't very efficient of the whole raid party's mana.  Having me hold back the slow when the mob is going to town on the MA is rather wasteful of cleric mana.  (Did I mention we only have 3-4 active clerics, so mana efficiency for them is crucial.  We're lucky to have 3 on a raid.  We usually call in allies' clerics to help out.)<br />
<br />
A well timed double coth means I'm out of the melee for maybe 20-30 seconds, then I'm back with little raid mana loss  (&amp; aggro solidly back to MA). The tank will mitigate damage better than I could ever dream of, resulting in less cleric mana spent &amp; greater control of aggro barring the few seconds the coth is incoming.<br />
<br />
Your reply about timing for aggro control is right on.  It is something we are continuing to work on.  It is a challenge when most times the MA is a 60 Paladin or a 59 Warrior who is in dire need of some better aggro drawing weapons.  :p  We've ran two raids recently JUST to get him an aggro weapon to no avail. :(<br />
SK's are out as we're a good aligned RP guild.<br />
<br />
You are also right about practising. :)  That's why I posted here.  To test this theory against all the combined knowledge &amp; exp. of those who have done more than I have.  I'm not asking anyone to risk their own hides on this, just for your opinions.  I don't want to have my guildleader try to execute this tactic if it isn't sound. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe a good idea to get stuff like RC debuffed without all shaman getting beaten to small pieces of goo.<br />
<br />
But we have 4 very active Lvl 60 shaman in guild, so it is no big problem anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Might also want to make friends with a cleric with Bestow Divine Aura, ask them to hotkey it for you like this:<br />
<br />
/tar dyingshammy<br />
/alt activate 39<br />
<br />
Another thought, if you have a corpse that is ressable nearby a cleric could res you up as a sort of poor man's coth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">especially since we have a strong minority of players who hotbox<br />
<br />
What's hotboxing? Er nm...<br />
<br />
Ok your debuffs are tash, mala, possible occlusion?, and malosini. Only thing you are missing is the -10mr from malo. Not much really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Probably quicker to make use of the  chanters in your guild and have them chain rune you if you get aggro.<br />
<br />
It also means that you have two mages paying attention to battle instead of two paying attention to you :-)<br />
<br />
We recently used chain rune for someone doing part o the ninth ring.  Some giants that got run away from the fort, came back at JUST the wrong time.  <br />
<br />
We thought the ring attempt was hosed.   A bard aggroed one giant and pulled it away.  Anther bard charmed another and had it tank yet another and the rest of us were busy trying to stay alive from the remaining giants that came to help the ones who came back.<br />
<br />
The 60 ranger decided to try to kill the dwarf needed while we were busy because some repops were going to happen if we took time to kill the giants.    The 60 chanter chain runed him to keep him alive while he tanked the dwarf.  We got the situation under control just before the repops and just as he killed the dwarf.    He looted and we beat a hasty retreat dragging a few corpses behind us. :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the added input.<br />
<br />
I've pretty much relegated this to bear-brained idea #235, to try only in extremely special circumstances.<br />
<br />
We have 3 mages that all play regularly.  Two of them can hotbox, but neither really likes to.  That fact plus some nasty aggro one night in ToV is what made me think of this.<br />
<br />
I've been back to ToV a few more times, and I've not had major problems.  Actually went a 6 hour raid without dying once &amp; I was the only shaman.  I attribute that more to the cleric's superior skills than any of my own.  I was definitely in the running for the &quot;most often summoned&quot; award. ;)  The tanks did a good job with aggro.  I usually just snuggled up next to them before casting, so the few whacks I took wouldn't mess up positioning.<br />
<br />
I actually found I had more problems w/ aggro when I landed slow first time than after a few resists.  I just couldn't resist tossing a bane after epic a few times when I had lots of mana. :p<br />
Luckily that only happened 2 or 3 times. :D  Getting summoned INTO the firepot is rather annoying.  Felt like I was being turned into bear stew.  Grow, Grow, OUT! :) /cheer<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
