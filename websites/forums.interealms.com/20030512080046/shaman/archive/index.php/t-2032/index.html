<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My young troll shaman recently helped a high level cleric collect some ground spawns. It was very boring work which took several hours, but the reward was worth it. So now he has 2,100 pp and no clue what to spend it on. I plan on stashing a couple hundred pp to cover the next few circles of spells, but I’m not sure what to spend the rest on. I’m thinking maybe some +wis jewellery and a suit of banded. Maybe a nice weapon.<br />
<br />
If you had 2k on a young shaman, what would you buy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You said you are going to keep some cash for spells (good move), so let's assume you have 1800 to spend.   I don't know what gear you have currently, but this would be my recomendation:<br />
<br />
Clay Guardian Shield   500p<br />
Spine Chill Spear         300p<br />
Ry'Gor BP                     400p<br />
Ry&quot;Gor Legs                 300p<br />
Straw Spun Belt           100p<br />
Tattered Mantle           200p<br />
<br />
<br />
This should give you a decent weapon, plenty of good armor.<br />
