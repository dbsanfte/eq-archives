<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.. everyone knows the drill by now. <br />
<br />
Meet outside of Thurg at 7 PM CST. We plan on doing Tizmaks this week. We were really short of healers (2 for 12), so anyone who has a healer that would like to come is more than welcome. <br />
<br />
Level ranges are 26-37. <br />
<br />
We will probably be looking for alternate places to go pretty quick as we have done Tizmaks for a bit and everyone has gotten a good xp boost off of them.<br />
<br />
It is about time to think about doing some dungeon work again.. <br />
<br />
Some possibilities of new places:<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadow (first couple of floors). We plan on coming back to this place often in the future. The loot is good and coin is excellent. Only thing is dealing with the keys. <br />
<br />
Drolga. Hard to get to and lots of gobs. First part will be green to some, but this is a wonderful place to work skills and excellent xp. <br />
<br />
Moon. Some outdoor zones are good xp and have pretty good loot. <br />
<br />
Rathe Mtns on Hill Giants. Be a bit rough, but they are good xp and the coin drops are awesome. <br />
<br />
Bit low yet for Sol B, Lower Guk and some other places, but we are getting there.. <br />
<br />
LMK what your thoughts are..<br />
<br />
See you Tuesday night!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kaesora. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nang is now 27th and ready to join this foray. Vidya still needs some leveling work.<br />
<br />
Mrs Baracus is 31, so she can join too, if grad school schedule permits.<br />
<br />
As for zones, I would vote Droga, moon, rathe, kaesora in that order.<br />

Baracus</div></div><hr />

Well the Tizmaks weren't giving me trouble.  Of course they were blue so that may be why.  Experience was slight, but I'm told I am in hell (level 30).  The groups seemed great, and I should be able to stay until the conclusion tonight.<br />
<br />
As for healers, I know that Morsissa (the lizzie shaman) won't be here tonight.  He is out of town on business.  Since that was my group's principle healer (at least while I was there), we could be in more dire straits then last time.<br />
<br />
I have a Fungi Tunic I can wear and thus reduce the amount of healing I would require (if any, on blue mobs).  I also have a RL mutual friend of Klydon and I, who is interested in attending.  She is a L30 dwarven paladin named Thorhild Silverforge.  Thorhild has a Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate (regen), and therefore requires little healing as long as she is an alt tank.  The ICB isn't real good at tanking aggro IMO; great for downtime though.  Bottom line is the two of us together could get by fine at the Tizmaks without the services of a cleric.  A druid or shaman maybe nice, but we won't need a full blown cleric.<br />
<br />
I will be looking for a port out of the Feerrot tonight, unless I hear differently.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
As far as locations go, I would love to slug it out with giants (I've never done it with a melee class before), but ToFS sounds good, and aren't we looking good for CC?  Whatever, I'm a tank...I go where the clerics go :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kaesora is a good option, I know that place very very well.  As far as levels, I would recommend 35+ for that unless we stuck to just the frenzied room..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Kly When you get on look for Thyndrael &amp; Loriien.  They are friends of mine IRL and are in the process of becoming petitioners he's a upper 20's - lower 30's Warrior &amp; She's a cleric in the same range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye.. one of the points I was raising about healing was it will be more difficult to go some of the tougher places we would like to without some healers. Someone has to keep the chanter on his feet.. :)<br />
<br />
Tizmaks were the victums of a good old fashion melee beat down last week and did not get much of a chance to cause trouble. We wiped the boss 3 times and he was pretty much a nice bright red to about all of us. When you have 3 monks and a couple of warriors kicking butt and taking names, the mob is not long for this world.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beetem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I talked to Morsissa this afternoon.  His work related business trip has ended early.  He expects to be at the gates of Thurg at the regular time.  Well, we can count on having at least the shammy for healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yakka=0wnd3d thrice<br />
Tizzies should have gotten some sense and stopped following me/griss/Kyrencuri to their 15 second demise.  Nothing better than pulling 3 at a time, root one, 3 melee on another, and monk on the last one. EXP was going quite well. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
...just wish this was perma wed since i work Tues :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If we're short on healers I'll bring Draganite. If not then I'll bring Zral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kly, Verhanna is 41 now so I haven't been showing to the Younger gen nights since I'm a little past the level range; but, I'm also not playing her much while you guys catch up some.<br />
<br />
As soon as you can sneak a 41 cleric in, shoot me a /tell or let me know.  I'd be glad to show up.<br />
