<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  (currently being evaluated) [possible upgrades to healing abilities in omens, current abilities will be evaluated after launch]<br />
<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  (currently being evaluated) [DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future]<br />
<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. (currently being evaluated) [possible upgrade to Malos with omens]<br />
<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. (currently being evaluated)  [possible upgrade with omens]<br />
 <br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. (currently being evaluated) [Omens spells still under development, current abilities to be evaluated after launch]<br />
 <br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
10. MGB Shrink.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
The above is our top 10 list current as of 8/27/04. As I mentioned months ago the list being so general has little to no chance to be implimented. And having group versions alongside single, eg: group FA or group Q doesn't work either. IMHO this is the real list, comment away if you so choose. Healing change requests are hopeless and will stop all other possible Shaman tuning items because of Cleric and Druid conflicts IMHO so get them out.<br />
<br />
1) Increase DD potency and reduce casting time.  Druid cold DD in Omens is 2420 with 6.35 cast, ours is 1202 with 7.8 cast.  It's time to narrow or eliminate that margin.  I have suggested eliminating any difference for 6 months now since our DOT's are worthless in group settings and we need better DD's for raid stacking.<br />
<br />
2) Reduce malos recast from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
3) Increase duration of FA from 6 minutes to 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
4) Double the potency of canny4 and double the recast time.<br />
<br />
5) Have puppy innate duel wield and allow for pet focus items.<br />
<br />
6) Increase potency of group haste up to single target %.<br />
<br />
7) Put in -50 resist modifier for VP (aa skill).  Add Omens VP aa to reduce its recast time.<br />
<br />
8) Allow out of group shrink with confirmation.<br />
<br />
9) Add small endurance regen in Acumen.<br />
<br />
10) Lower component cost for Alchemy (I don't trade skill myself but many do so leave it in).<br />
<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />
