<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jr4atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">its in Alpha stage right now and you can play for the next 3 days... was quite refreshing game... something different and its gonna be a free game to play. They are planning of making their money with expansions.  Thats the word I got so far but go check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have some link to it? I'm assuming it's a MMORPG maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jr4atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">www.Guildwars.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im Quintara the Cosmos a monk/messer   rofl.<br />
<br />
Have no clue if its good or not, but i look hot ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I played with it yesterday.  <br />
<br />
I didnt like it.  No, thats not right.  I didnt just not like it, I pretty much hate it.  And its all because of the forced 3rd person virw.  I HATE 3rd person view.  It puts severe limits on what I can see and how I can react.<br />
<br />
The gameplay was ok.  Spells were cast by clicking an icon or a corrosponding number on the keyboard; melee was point and mouse click.  I have a elementalist/monk that uses a bow (???).  All players start and are capped at level 15.<br />
<br />
Im gonna give it another try today so that I dont seem like a crazy eyed lunatic about it, but I dont see what the fuss is about beyond the graphics.  The graphics are nice, but eye candy does not a good game make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think a lot of people are going to get a bad impression of this game because it's so very unfinished right now.  Gotta remember, it's not even in BETA.  The interface is horrible (I don't think it's finished by any means), they said themselves that the movement was still a bit awkward (I agree).  What I was interested in was<br />
* downtime<br />
* rate of play<br />
* character development depth<br />
My warrior/ranger had a real blast.  Trying to ignore the carpal-tunnel effects of not having a friggin autorun key...  I found a knockdown attack and followed it up pretty often with a power attack while they're getting up - had some nice results.<br />
<br />
Then there's the adrenaline system... as you fight, your adrenaline INCREASES, allowing you to access particular attacks.  They only work in the heat of battle.  Nice concept.  Knockdown was one of those.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to trying out the instanced PVP zones - where suppoedly your group of friends (or up to 4 groups?) can enter an instanced (read: LDoN-style) zone paired up against an equal number of PC's to whack at each other until one team wins and gets exp or prizes, or whatnot.<br />
<br />
The game's got a lot of potential.  And without a monthly fee, you can about guarantee I'll TRY the final release.  I hope they're getting around to the interface issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's very nice.  Nice graphics and spell effects.  The pacing is great, like a playing a normal game instead of grind, sit__________________get up, grind...<br />
<br />
They just need to get the movement controls smoothed over to something reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jr4atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Auto run key = up arrow twice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After playing it a li, it felt entirly too limiting int he control scheme. It was like Diablo ( suprise ) and while thats not a bad game, i cant seem to get into a MMORPG unless the controls are natural like a FPS or EQ. Infact thats what killed FFXI for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
So over all, i wont be playing it for real, but itll be fun to play and pretend im at E3 playing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Who needs auto run when you can click a position hundreds of metres away and you'll path there nicely?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Because I don't like autopathing, and thanks atkins.  *grin*<br />
<br />
It's definitely a good start on a 3D diablo.  Anyone do much with the PvP content?  Having a really hard time getting off CoH to do anything with GW, even though I'm really interested in trying out PvP that might actually not suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I been messing around with Guild Wars for quite a few hrs now, and am having fun.  Its a very shallow game at this stage but non the less the 4 way PvPs of 8 person teams are alot of fun.  The download takes all of 30 secs, give it a shot can only play for another day.</div></div><hr />
