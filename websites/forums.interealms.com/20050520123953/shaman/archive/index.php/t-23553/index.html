<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just bought some scaled avatar boots with the MP4 effect. My understanding is this is a 10% mana cost reduction on beneficial spells expect complete heal.<br />
<br />
Why does my calculations seem to be off? (I have all the mana reduction AAs also)<br />
<br />
with boots off:<br />
Q: 224 mana<br />
FoS: 474 mana<br />
<br />
with boots on:<br />
Q: 212 mana<br />
FoS: 438 mana<br />
<br />
Now even with my simple maths skills, that is not a 10% reduction, anyone know why? I tested by casting at full mana each time and tried a few times incase i got a &quot;tick&quot; just as I cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mana Pres IV is actually a chance of 1%-10% not a solid 10% every time, or at least the way I understand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tenj is correct, it is a random chance of 1%-10% saving each cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the focus effects except for buff duration extension are like this, a range of what they will provide each time.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.  I would think so too, but with the issues that the DX9 patch and the changes to collision its hard to measure this now.  Its not a problem on Thor, but my alt wizard gets bitten by this all the time.  For instance, yesterday I was in PoS farming Diakus with the wizard for Alt access to Tactics.  We were fighting on a hill to try and reduce adds and zonewide agro (which STILL hasnt been fixed yet, and its been about 18 months now), and probably 4 out of 10 times Id get  an OOR notice when I was right on top of the mob, and close enough to get hit by him (cause I was, occasionlly). If I took 1 step to the side I could cast on him.  Ive got Extended Range III running in Tribute on him (hes 58). <br />
<br />
  I get much the same problem soloing in Natimbi.  Flat area just across from the Wayfarer camp is riddled with ridges that will fubar your distance from a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I beleive extend range, Spell haste and Duration extension are full effect every time. All the mana pres, increased dmg/heal spells are random up to the max percent resulting in an average of half their max value.</div></div><hr />
