<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after playing EQ exclusively for 5 years i'm finding using a new interface to be quite challenging, as far as the chat &amp; player interaction commands go. i'm going to list a few commands that i frequent in EQ and was wondering if there is an equivelent in CoH.<br />
<br />
/<br />
/who class<br />
/who lvl<br />
/who all (class/lvl)<br />
<br />
also, how do you add a freind if they are not targeted? (the only way i know is by right clicking on a target)<br />
<br />
if you can think of any other useful commands that i'm probably missing out on, please post them!<br />
<br />
thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only one I know off the top of my head is the /who all command which is actually /whoall.  That will give class and level as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you know your friends' names, you can simply add them with /friend &lt;playername&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is no /who command in the game right now except for /whoall, which has some drawbacks:<br />
<br />
1) It accepts no parameters.<br />
1a) So it shows everyone.<br />
2) It only shows people in the same zone as you.<br />
<br />
A functional /who command would be very nice, IMO. I can't for the life of me figure out why the Devs have not put it in...it can't be a code issue, it has to be a design one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the /whoall command!<br />
<br />
/em newspaper<br />
Your character opens up a newspaper (though it's the same one every day *grin*).  You can also /em any of the commands off that emote button on your chat bar.  /em yoga  /em cheer  etc.<br />
<br />
f = follow, or stick, as per DAoC.  Indispensible for a scrapper or tanker, as the nukers really really want to you pick the next target quickly.  So when the old one dies, tab to the new target, f to stick to him, and start smacking attack power keys.<br />
<br />
/bind_load is a command I use every time I make a new character.  /bind_save creates a file with your current keymap assignments in the root of your C: drive.  (full info here http://coh.warcry.com/scripts/faq/faq.phtml?category=744&amp;site=36&amp;id=153#5562 )  Once the file is created, you can change a lot of key bindings that don't come up in the interface.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much of the other information in that guide is current, or if it's leftover from beta, but the key binding and saving worked nicely.<br />
<br />
Great thread.  My bet is that a lot of command line stuff will be added and fleshed out in time.  It's hard to remember the crappy commands we had to work with back in EQ's early days.  *grin*  That being said, I can't wait till they have a column in the supergroup tool to list what zone your guildmates are in so I can take them off my freakin friends list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does anyone know if it's possible to bind so that pressing both left and right mousebuttons simultaneously makes you go forward with mouselook (like in EQ)?<br />
<br />
I tried this: <br />
<br />
bind rbutton+lbutton &quot;+forward$$+mouse_look&quot;<br />
<br />
and it kind of works, but it also makes my character move forward when I'm only pressing the right button now, instead of just being mouselook :(</div></div><hr />
