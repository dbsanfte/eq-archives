<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been catching up on posts since I last quit this game in August of last year  and couldn't  help notice all the people talking of quitting EQ forever. I created my shaman in march of 2000 and have hit the cancel button 3 times in the past, once was over a year. I've deleted and removed EQ and cancelled and still came back. The only way to truely cancel forever is to wipe your Sony station name and password permanently from your brain.<br />
<br />
The addiction is amazingly hard to overcome. You may go weeks, months or a year like I did and one day it just hits you hard. In fact all of my previous returns from retirement started right here reading the boards :). You start thinking about those early days of discovery, your first sow, the first journey from Halas to WK, your first boat ride in OOT, your first piece of totemic, your first hell level and the friends you made along the way.<br />
<br />
You'll be back... Unless that is you remove all knowledge of your station name and password when you hit that cancel button.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only way to quit is to WANT to quit.  If you don't want to quit, chances are slim that you will.  As I always say, browsing any EQ related message board is detrimental to quitting :)  I personally quit 2? months ago because the game isn't fun, and it won't be fun again so I am officially EQ-free for life~<br />
<br />
The only thing I even remotely miss is talking to the people, and this is what email is for :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blah...I won't argue that the game is addicting, but if you have been in pickup groups, it is a whole new breed of gamers these days.  The reason the old school feeling isn't there anymore is because most of the old school players have left.  Reading the boards seeing people like Ceno leave is frustrating.  These are the people who guided me, yet I have nobody to pass the torch to because it's all about 1-65/70 and Time now.  Nobody enjoys the journey anymore and the finer points about playing a Shaman or any other class.<br />
<br />
Eventually, everybody will leave the game.  The biggest regret I will have is that EQ could have been so much more than what it has turned into.  But the only way to have fun now is solitary hunting or Guilds, because pick-up groups and meeting new people usually turns out to be a horrid experience.  I swear I wish I wouldn't have left Lanys, at least Mathii could always cheer me up :(  I am still in awe that people like her and the other &quot;Ubahs&quot; were so nice back in the day.<br />

Old School = People who started pre-Kunark that played this game for the journey, not the destination.  People who would help a fellow player w/o expectations of repayment...etc  <br />
<br />
I'm sure you get the idea.  Old School can't be solely determined on actions or time played.  It is also the mindset of people who play this game for the exploration and adventure, not the phat lewtz.<br />

Stopped visiting this forum shortly after I quit last year. I feel nostalgic skimming over eq-related posts, and hearing words like totemic sends bells ringing; grizzleknot, goblin wizards, glacier bear and that bleeping liche who seemed to show up just as my uv wore off.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish I could play again, but over a year later, my character isn't redeemable. All the better I suppose. When I obtained my shennanigan boots in time for my b-day, told myself I achieved the best I could without the need for outside help, and the guild life was wearing me down.</div></div><hr />

I am almost 4 years into EQ and I know that I am not.  But, it's moot...the fact still remains that this game isn't anything near what it was and neither are the players.  But it still brings me enjoyment from time to time so I keep playing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't understand why nobody has brought up the real method to quitting.  I used it (and I stayed off for 2 years), back when I had a late kunark era druid with DE mask, Manastone, Fungi Tunic, etc.  It's actually very simple.<br />
<br />
Delete all of your items and delete all of your characters.  It helps to get really drunk first.<br />
<br />
OR you can start cussing out a GM, that works too.<br />
<br />
End billing does NOT work.  Your characters are still there, and they will still tempt you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playing EQ is like dating a control freak.  It doesn't want you to leave it alone EVER.  It wants every second of your free time.  It gets jealous if you spend time with anyone else.  It will eventually drive a wedge between you and all friends &amp; family.<br />
<br />
It's hard to get away from for the same reasons, too.  You quit EQ and you realize that your friends &amp; family are used to you being unwilling to do things with them.  It takes a while to get used to doing all the things you stopped doing so you could devote your entire brain to EQ.  I'm even having to rediscover new web pages to check at work in the morning.  *grin*<br />
<br />
It's hard to quit EQ, because it's hard to come to terms with how much it dominated your life.  The first step of the 12 step program is admitting that you have a problem, after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I quit EQ for the second and last time a couple weeks ago.  I've been having a BLAST in City of Heroes ... As things stand now, I just don't see myself returning to EQ - ever.<br />
<br />
The first time I quit, Sony send me a free account about a year later when I was jaded and frustrated with the state of berserkers in DAoC, and it was just too much of a temptation so I went back to start a shaman again.<br />
<br />
Games are about people - not the game though.  Nearly everyone I knew from the old days was gone and had restarted on CoH, so now I'm playing CoH with my friends and having a great time.<br />
<br />
Play whatever you like, but play it for your reasons, not this game vs. that game ... play it to be with the folks you enjoy being with online, and do things together -- and remember to make some time for yourself (your REAL self) and your real family too.  In the end, those are the things that matter.  Not a hobby.<br />
<br />
EQ had become more than a hobby to me. It had become an escape.</div></div><hr />

Gotta love it. 4 years. Wow. Lets see, any other games on my computer 4 years old? Any other game I put even 1/10th as much time into? Any other game been as much CHEAP entertainment? (You cant go to the movie every other week for what you pay for EQ in a year, INCLUDING expansions). <br />

Thats not the point at all, and you know it. Its like a marraige gone bad. First its luvvy duvvy, then it develops into pure hate, hate that seems to consume some people, hatred so deep its unbelievable to consider that those people stood at an altar and said &quot;I Do&quot;. Thats what EQ seems to be like. Everyone forgets the hours and hours of outstanding entertainment. <br />
<br />
You wanna leave the game, fine. Don't blame you. I have taken many extended vacations from the game myself. But don't sit here and badmouth it like it was the worst experience of your entire life.</div></div><hr />

EQ was good, but was all downhill after velious. It was good enough to make that downhill last awhile..right up to the point where I played city of heroes for the first time and thought to myself &quot;Wow..is this what it is like to have fun with a game instead of clocking in and out in a grinding rut?&quot;.<br />

Hmm, are telling me what I can and cannot say on this board because people have a right to say whatever they want too? Sounds like a bit of a hypocritical point of view, but HEY, you have a &quot;right&quot; to say it. <br />
<br />
My point is merely to try to remind these EQ Haters that there WAS a time when they loved the game, and they DID recieve a lot of enjoyment from the game, else I doubt they would have played it for 3, 4 or 5 years. (years man, YEARS).<br />

<br />
I will agree that EQ is on the decline. I dont play nearly as much as I once did (thank GOD). However, I also think that PoP and LDoN are 2 of the strongest expansions the game ever had. Lets face it, when you said &quot;downhill after Velious&quot; did you really mean &quot;downhill with Luclin, then up a bit with PoP, then down again after PoP got old with stupid flags, then up for a little while with LDoN, then down when that got boring&quot;. <br />
<br />
See my point? <br />
<br />
I am not trying to tell you what to think, or feel, or say. I just want you to take an HONEST look at the 4 years you played. If it sucked so bad . . . <br />
<br />
. . . you get the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What sucks is putting 4+ years into a game, getting completely lost in it and having a blast and then to see it slowly break down.

<br />
Everquest was a good game. The original was nice, kunark was much better, and velious was a slight improvement. That was the turning point imo, and if I'm not mistaken, Verant at one point said their last expansion would be Legacy of Ykesha. But given the player base who didn't wanna give up, Verant came out with more.<br />
<br />
They're not really attracting more players, but trying to milk the money from customers who feel they've invested so much over the years that they refuse to quit and start over with more dynamic mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
I've been through this process a few times, from Meridian 59 to UO to EQ to Runescape and now FFXI. I know when a game has reached its climax and when it's time to move on, but a lot of people just don't wanna give up because they feel they're losing their uborness - a sense of high derived from some sort of twisted online superiority complex - and absolutely refuse to slump back down to the rank of noob in a new game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, I meant velious was the last stop before complete dev team incompetance. It was the last GOOD expansion. <br />
<br />
Luclin was blah, not so good...not so bad. PoP was horrible, it was the first showing of the &quot;buy this expansion and play in 1/4 of its zones!&quot; mentality that completely bent over to the raiding guilds. LoY was a speedbump. LDoN was content that should have been added free of charge, it's obvious that there wasn't alot of thought put into it. GoD is absolutely horrible.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's certainly true for some. Possibly even the majority that are left now.<br />
<br />
I -can- tell you that a LOT of the people who played on my eq server have migrated to the same server in CoH..so I don't think &quot;for the people&quot; is as valid a reason in sticking with eq anymore.</div></div><hr />

I quit recently.  I may or may not be back, I'm not 100% sure yet.  I quit mainly due to time constraints in my life, but also the general disgust at them releasing another new expansion.  That being said, I still have a lot of good memories concerning EQ and I wouldn't mind poking around a bit again =)<br />
<br />
But like Buz said, HL2, Doom3, EQ2, WoW, all coming out this year.  I don't want to be &quot;hitched&quot; to EQ and feel obligated to play when these things come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This summer will mark the biggest releases of major titles like Half-Life, Doom, UT2004 and other FPS’s. There are various MMORPG’s, but the two biggest are going to be EQII and WoW. More selections is a plus for gamers and this summer is going to be big year.<br />
<br />
I'm still a wee-noob in FF XI, but from what I see, it's an awesome game. Besides, ya gotta love the chocobos!<br />
<br />
FF XI is also very EQ friendly. A lot of the terminology has been preserved, like mobs, cons, lfg, aggro, /say, /tell, /shout, /follow, the macro system, etc. Of course, there are some major differences, but if you've played EQ, you have the edge as a newbie playing the game. <br />
<br />
And there are definite improvements which the ex-EQ player can appreciate. Sitting to regen heals at a much faster pace, loading time is minimal, and the graphics are utterly spectacular. On top of that, you're not only restricted to one class (which they call jobs), you have total freedom to switch back and forth (of course starting from scratch for every new class you take up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I have no idea why FFXI didn't hold my interest at all.  I can't put my finger on it, no matter how hard I try.  It was a lot like EQ, but really, ALL MMOG's seem the same, in essence.<br />
<br />
All I know is that I picked up CoH and my last lingering twinges to play EQ fled like a kitten from a vacuum cleaner.  FFXI just made me wonder why I wasn't playing EQ, where there were friends around to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">FFXI was ok for a cheap EQ knockoff,  the graphics are better at least, and not a lot of bugs from what I saw.  There were a few things that killed it for me though,  like NEVER being able to solo past level 20 (well you can solo worms but thats it).  Also the player populace was incredibly rude in my opinion,  just a TON of kids with their PS2's that have no manners at all and even less patience.  The gameplay is horrible!  Think about clicking TAB 20 times to find the right mob and then clicking 3 more buttons to actually cast a spell...and the controls are all over the map. Oh and one more thing,  you have to farm for 3 days for every 1 day you level in order to get the cash to keep your gear and spells up to date.  <br />
<br />
So in summary of FFXI:  rude playerbase,  no soloing, the controls make it much harder to play smoothly unlike EQ, and massive amounts of farming.<br />
<br />
On the plus side though,  it was kind of cool how you can change your class any time you want and keep the same character,  and subjobs is a great idea</div></div><hr />
