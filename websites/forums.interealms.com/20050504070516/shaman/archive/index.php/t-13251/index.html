<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I reading this right? They're dropping it from 3h 15m to 9.5 minutes?<br />
<br />
If that's the case I'm glad I never wasted money or time on acquiring a JBBP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I swear they've been stealth nerfing spell durations like this for a while.<br />
<br />
The thing that always drove me nuts about my ranger was he couldnt blink too hard or a buff would drop. My shaman was always great because the buffs lasted so long...but over the last few months it's seeming like my shaman buffs are always dropping every time I turn around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems to me like it's being brought in line with the rest of the &quot;coat&quot; spells.  They all last a pretty short time, if I remember rightly from my ranger days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just paid 16k for a JBBP, about 15 minutes ago. Sigh =((</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the ones had long durations on the list and they all getting changed to 10 min.<br />
<br />
Selling my JBBP tonight.</div></div><hr />

Naw if you go look at it they list all the coat buffs as having thier duration shortened. The self buff ones have always lasted for ever and a day even the low level ones.<br />
<br />
If you look they also changed the duration on all the MP potions.<br />
<br />
What I think happened was they wanted to change the duration on all the focus effects, no clue why, but they all seemed to have the same duration and it happened to be the same duration as the bramblecoat spells and the shaman potions and a few mob ae's too. They just went in and changed all of the spells that had duration of x not realizing what other things it was going to effect.</div></div><hr />

I was pretty shocked to see my Bramblecoat getting ready to drop this morning, seemingly just after I casted it on myself haha. I have a feeling what taraddar said is most likely what the situation is though, if you look closely...we'll see :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
9 min coat spell would seriously suck up the ranger's mana pool.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Heh...  look what else got changed, too.  What's that howling I hear? (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=1563&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />

Before you and others start doing things you might want to actually look at all the other changes for that day and/or check with someone on Test.<br />
<br />
A TON of spells had their durations changed from long timers to 9.5 mins, mob spells, player spells, focus effects, etc.   I would highly suspect that the way the information is stored changed and Lucy is not reading it correctly anymore.  Look at all the slot swapping and changes that have been going on with the spell system,  it's highly more likely that SOE is changing around the spell structure and Lucy now doesn't understand it properly than them reducing the durations of 100+ spells that are listed at that date on Lucy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Damage III:<br />
<br />
Date Change <br />
05-03 01:36 Changed Durationtext from 3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65 to 3.0 mins @L1 to 9.5 mins @L4 <br />
<br />
I find it highly odd that all of these spells now share a 9.5 Minute duration out of pure coincidence.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that Bramblecoat is only lasting 9 minutes atm on test. So it would seem Lucy is still reading the structure correctly. However it still seem likely to me that these spells will change back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Test is test... it could be they are trying to test something having to do when spells are wearing off, I suppose, and wanted to shorten the durations so they don't have to wait all day for it to happen.  More likely it's a mistake.  I can't see this being done intentionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That'd be kind of annoying if it went live, but nothing to make a big deal over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It would make the JBBP worthless to me. I swap it in every 3 hours or whatever to put up bramblecoat. If I have to swap it in every 9 minutes it is going to my fiancees twink Shaman. Not a huge deal I guess but annoying and pointless nonetheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still swap in my JBBP for Bramblecoat . . . when I remember to.  Lately it seems rather pointless since PoP mobs largely ignore your AC anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've heard this is an error, and won't go live. Guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />

Well it looks like what ever they where doing they changed thier mind.</div></div><hr />
