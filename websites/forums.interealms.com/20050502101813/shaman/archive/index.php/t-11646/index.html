------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these spells can be found in the Plane of Knowledge.

<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Added a command to allow you to toggle your target between your two last targets (unlike Tab which toggles between your character and your last target). To set the key that activates this feature, just open your options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all categories, the entry will be the last one on the list, called Toggle last two targets. This was actually added with our last patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
** NPCs ** <br />
<br />
- Undead will begin to spawn again at night in Kithicor. <br />
- Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he allows to do tasks for him, and he'll be speaking directly to folks (using /tell). His chatty nature was raising the volume in Gukta to levels that were considered unacceptable. He will also be a bit clearer about what he wants. <br />

- A Grimy Owl Bear Cub in Paludal now &quot;screeches&quot;, not &quot;screetches&quot;. <br />

- Mangler will no longer spawn on top of a table. <br />
- Porra, one of the Enchanter spell vendors in Felwithe, will no longer spawn inside of a wall. This was hurting her business. <br />
- Hutyn L`Lozz will now appear in his place of business and be less likely to leave to go sightseeing in Neriak. <br />
- Cleet Miller Jr. will now emote &quot;Grumbles and looks up at you&quot; instead of saying it. <br />
- The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no longer wearing cloth armor. <br />
- Junth McMannus will now be properly affected by movement reducing spells. <br />
- You should only see one Rodrick Tardock, his clones have been dealt with. <br />
- Duplicate Brenzl McMannus's (McManni?) have also been removed. <br />
- Waltor Felligan of Halas will now cast the spells he says he will cast. <br />
- Xlixinar Arcut and Drixiv Arcut will now respond properly to their quest texts. <br />
- Corrected some text errors for Jortreva and Grendish the Crusaders as well as Sage Xelrin, Sulgar, Warlord Gligoth, Bryce McFadden, Serna Tasknon, Welno Tanlonikan, Lorekeeper_Einar and Master of Elements. <br />

- Kodiaks in the Rathe Mountains should be friendlier to Druids and Rangers. <br />
- Undead Frogloks and Skeletons in Sebilis no longer have an extreme dislike for each other. <br />
- Groflah Steadirt's corpse will no longer disappear when he is killed. However, he is also no longer a merchant. <br />

- Corrected the spawn times for the Minotaur Hero. <br />
- Half elven female bandits will now give experience, leave corpses and be aided by other bandits. <br />
- A Coerced Iiksar will now be known as A Coerced Iksar. <br />
- Merchant Nora in Felwithe will once again sell her jewelry supplies. <br />
- Equestrielle the Corrupted will no longer be able to sense and get angry with people all the way on the other side of the zone. <br />
- Niola Impholder now teaches Brewing, Begging and Alcohol Tolerance. <br />
- Jusean will now give the proper quest reward when given the proper item(s). <br />
- Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed some broken doors in West Freeport that were opening incorrectly. <br />
- Fixed a door that was opening into a wall in Highkeep. <br />
- Fixed some doors in Kaesora that were opening the wrong way. <br />
- Fixed a door that would not open in Solusek's Eye. <br />
- Removed the ability for characters to consume more than one key given for access to the lower parts of the Crypt of Decay. <br />
- Added new sounds to Shadowhaven. <br />
- Removed safe spots in Katta, Solusek's Eye, High Keep, Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns, Crystal Caverns, Siren's Grotto, Plane of Valor, Plane of Torment and Plane of Water. <br />

- Entrance to Bertoxxulous's lair is now restricted to those that have the proper flag. <br />

- Placed rocks over a spot in Western Wastes that characters could get stuck in. <br />
- Updated some of the pathing in Torgiran Mines to reduce the chances that NPCs will &quot;poof&quot; in that zone. <br />
- Removed a box out in the middle of Skyfire that turned when clicked but had no real purpose. <br />
- Fixed a place in Burning Woods and the Plane of Knowledge where NPCs would get stuck while wandering around. <br />
- Also fixed a place in Erud's Crossing where sharks were getting stuck. <br />
- The Veeshan's Peak zone in from Skyfire can no longer be triggered from above. <br />
- Moved the Koada'Dal Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway on the second floor of the building. <br />
- The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will now work during Coldain Ring War. <br />
- The exit from the Plane of Justice to the Plane of Tranquility has been moved to place characters next to the Plane of Justice entrance. <br />
- A black ravenger should no longer be spawning right next to the Cabilis entrance in the Swamp of No Hope. <br />
- Trying to enter the Qeynos sewers will no longer take you to Ak'Anon. We hope the citizens of Ak'Anon can forgive the mess... <br />
- Fixed a problem in the Warrens that was causing the Kobolds to gather under the water near the river source. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />

<br />
Wont stack with fos unless its done unintentionally. (Meaning tends to change per patch but not suppose to) <br />
To answer .... who needed single target str and single dex followed by group version str and group dex. Now can do all that in two spells and cuts down on some of the buff clutter o/in in my spell book , buff board and hand ins. Nice change. <br />
  <br />
  Really like the idea of group haste spell but will see how well it actually does. So tired of 16 base haste but just wonder what % its gonna be. Alacrity just a name or the haste % too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">According to Lucy Disinfecting Aura was indeed changed back on Live Servers.<br />

great patch  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Actualy , that spell is just what clerics are looking for , Str and Dex. Its not really a waste , cause now instead of casting single str and dex i can just cast this , that is unless it doesnt stack wit their buff , then it is indeed usless .<br />
<br />
the group version is kinda useless , but hey , we got group shrink and group haste.  i say **** it  , rejoice !<br />
<br />
The group haste alone is going to cause me to log my shaman tonite and XP grind for the first time in well over a month. That hasting crap actualy burned me out of XP groups. I think this is going to help me enjoy the game again SO MUCH more .</div></div><hr />

No, you will not be able to MGB this spell.</div></div><hr />

Blood of Nadox is a group version of Pure Blood. Shamans will play god on Trak raids!<br />
<br />
- Shaman of Mithaniel Marr will now be able to scribe the Imbue: Diamond spell <br />
<br />
What about Imbue: Sapphire for trolls.<br />
<br />
- Replaced the shaman spell Aim of the Ginda with Talisman of Alacrity, which is a group haste spell. <br />
<br />
Alacrity in name only. It has better haste (50 vs 40) and is much longer lasting (36 vs 11) than single target Alacrity.<br />
<br />
This **** is awesome.</div></div><hr />

As we well know, Planes of Power saw the level range of mobs that players can get decent exp from shrink from 15 to 10, thus making all but a handful of zones useless for exping at 65. The level range will be opened back up again, giving players much more room to spread out. This should breathe new life into unfortunately abandoned places like the Temple of Cazic Thule.&quot;<br />

Very nice fixes.  I am shocked that they fixed the dex/str spells.  I was assuming the best we could hope for was to make them stack with focus again.  <br />

I know that I could certainly use it at 55, cause its a pain spending 30 minutes jumping from group to group shrinking everyone when we raid.  <br />
<br />
Group haste would be nice at a lower level too, but Im just happy to see it in the game.  Guess I got a whole lotta grinding to do.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't make sense that the new spell would be so much better, and now we get a group version with a 7.5 sec cast.  <br />
<br />
Sorry, but the cast times and mana costs are still out of whack.<br />

Doesn't make sense that the new spell would be so much better, and now we get a group version with a 7.5 sec cast.<br />
<br />
You dont get the point... We get OUR spell back (for those that dont have LoY this is a big boost) and we also get a unique spell (instead of a copy of an older spell)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get your point of the spell being put back to what it was before LoY.  You dont get my point, that there is a spell now that will cast faster for less mana that does almost the same thing, that we can no longer get. <br />
<br />
I was going to finish the dang quest last night, but something came up and I couldn't.  I liked the idea of a faster cast time.  Why should longer cast time be associated with more mana cost, for clearing a fractionally larger number of counters?<br />
<br />
And dont make your point saying &quot;for those of us that dont have LoY&quot;, because you also have in your point about a unique spell.  Well, guess what?  Those without LoY dont get a new unique spell, they have only been restored to pre-LoY.</div></div><hr />

Shrink is not a buff (has no duration, leaves no icon); therefore, you will not be able to MGB it.  You'll still get to play 'pass the shaman' when doing shrinks... only difference is that you'll only have to cast the spell once instead of 5 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Logged in and tested this.. you can not MGB shrink and you can not use the target group buff to shrink other groups. Does not use a buff icon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">shaman can no longer get the spell: pureblood<br />
<br />
having talked with one of the developers this morning in game they're now aware that shaman who currently have pureblood can still use it, and the one i spoke with said he'd talk with another in charge of the spells to see that shaman are removed from pureblood to get rid of a &quot;have and have not&quot; situation between the shaman who already have pureblood and those who can no longer obtain it.  I told him and he realized that this would probably cause some bad feelings.  My recomendation was to see that shaman could obtain both scrolls, as some, such as myself, would like the one with less than half the casting time.<br />
<br />
I'm in the situation where i did the quest before the patch and should have pureblood myself, but the quest bugged and i recieved no scroll at all, and did not get a hold of a GM untill today the day of the patch, and they dont reimburse the final items (ie scroll Spell: pureblood) but the step before last, so i got my glowing black potion back, and when you hand it in you get the spell blood of nadox, the same as you get just hailing the npc if you had previously done the quest (whether or not you got the scroll, as in my case where it bugged)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Bummer about the shrink ... still group shrink is nice ... plus that way you can shrink those dwarves that constantly complain about being shrunk.<br />
<br />
All in all a very good patch.  Cant believe I am saying that I wish I had gotten aim of the gidian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">a good fix to the haves and have nots for pure blood, is to lower casting time on disinfecting aura and reduce mana costs.  The 50 mana isnt that big a deal.  6 sec compared to 2.5 sec is significant.  Huge deal?  Nope.  But I would always rather have 2.5 sec cast compared to 6.0 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This is a great patch for Shaman.  Can we please hold off on the bitching over minor points for a couple days now?  We had a lot of issues addressed here that Shaman have been asking for.  <br />
<br />
I, for one, am proud that my version of poison/disease cure takes longer to cast and costs more mana.  I was angry when it was taken from us and I'm happy they fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Can we please hold off on the bitching over minor points for a couple days now?<br />
<br />
Yes, maybe holding off on the minor points will let them get fixed a few months from now instead of maybe next week when they fix the major points with the latest patch.  Issues with a patch should be brought up immediately following, while it is still in the focus.  Not a month from now, when something else is the focus.<br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Now that our Pureblood spell is a Group Spell, does that mean they put Disenfecting Aura back to the way it was?  I know it was changed back on test but the patch message doesn't say a thing about DA...<br />
<br />
DA was returned to its previous functionality: http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live.  It removes more counters than Pure Blood (20 vs 18), but costs more mana (150 vs 100) and has a slower cast time (6.0 vs 2.5).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hail,<br />
<br />
This sounds like a fantastic patch for us!<br />
I now have some motivation to get out of 62, since the 63-64 spells were changed! :)<br />
<br />
As to the DA-Pureblood change, I like this.<br />
I don't mind us losing the 2.5 sec Pureblood.  Let the druids and clerics have it.  We keep OUR Disinfecting Aura, which cures more counters even if it takes longer to cast.  50 extra mana isn't a big deal.  AND I don't have to quest a spell that I essentially already had. This is what many of us were asking for.  We get a GROUP version of the spell, which makes me happy enough.  Also something many were asking for as a solution to the DA/Pureblood fiasco.<br />
<br />
Group shrink is also a good deal.  Would have been fun to MGB shrink, but I think we all understand why they wouldn't make that possible.<br />
<br />
I think someone new was put in charge of the team fixing bugs and addressing complaints, because the last few patches have shown some obvious consideration for long standing issues as well as working on some current hot topic bugs.<br />
<br />
Several of the biggest and longest burning Shaman class issues we've been complaining about have been worked on in the last month.<br />
<br />
Let's review:<br />
Alchemy received major attention.  While some may not be thrilled with exactly how this was done, it HAS breathed some new life into this dead tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Spell Availability.  One of our longest continuing complaints was the rarity of spell drops.  This has been given attention with the new caster spell  research.  I have no problems going to an int caster to get my research work accomplished to fill those holes in my book. Woohoo!  http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/LoYresearch_priest.htm  (spell listings w/ recipes)<br />
<br />
63-64 Single target stat buffs.  Changed!<br />
Pure Blood:  Changed!  <br />
<br />
SO, what are our biggest issues that we want addressed now?  If you ask me it is the Slow immune-flagged mobs &amp; slow mitigation.  After that, most of the stuff seems relatively minor in comparison.<br />
<br />
/happy<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are suggesting that our poison/disease cure's cast time is broken.  I disagree.  For better for for worse, our spell is different than Pure Blood.  Something that should be fixed is the fact that Talisman of Alacrity isn't hasting anyone but the caster.  Reducing the cast time on Disinfecturing Aura is a change, not a fix.</div></div><hr />

I wish they could make the group shrink a raid shrink. Would make it far more useful on raids and would still prevent any griefing. Then we can sell our growth potions to those who hate being shrunk  :D <br />
